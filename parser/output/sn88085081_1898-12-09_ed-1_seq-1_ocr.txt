MASON COUNTY, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9 1898. “Mrs. Sanders had ten hemorrhages and people here said she would never be well again.” W. A. Sanders, Esq., of Hern, Mason County, W. Va., writes : “My wife had hemorrhage of the lungs. She had ten hemorrhages and people here said she would never be well again. But she be gan to take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov ery, and she soon began to gain strength and flesh. After taking ten bottles she was entirely well. If you think this will do you anj*fpod to* publish, just use it, and, if anyone disputes the merits of this almost omnipotent medicine, they may enclose a self addressed envelope with stamp, and I will an swer," When anything is wrong with the lungs there is no time to lose. The steps are easy and quick from a “slight cold ” 

XIWIIA d SllgUl \_\JIXX to bronchitis ; from bronchitis to pneu monia ; from pneumonia to permanently weakened lungs, and from that to dread Consumption itself. The time to cure consumption is before it gets a start. Take Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery on the first appearance of cough or cold, and you will never have a hemorrhage or a tubercle. The “Discovery” is the greatest health builder in the world. It first straightens out all digestive disor ders, and aids the body in ridding itself of poisonous effete matter. It tones up the stomach, invigorates the liver and in con nection with Dr. Pierce’s Pellets keeps the bowels open and regular. Don’t let an un scrupulous medicine dealer foist some substitute when you want Dr. Pierce’s medicines. Assert your rights—get what you ask for, and be well. Facts About Mason Co. Washington. The editor receives many inquiries from people in all sections of the Un ion, as to industries, wages, lands, etc., and to obviate the necessity of writ ing letters, the following general re plies have been prepared. The Editor will add further information, but en quirers should always send stamps. WAGES, Logging camp wages range from $2 $3.50 per day, and the employes are charged board. Carpenters $2 to $3 per day. Ordinary labor $1.50 to $2; Woodworkers $1.50 to $3; Farm labor S2O. to $25. per month ; Tiie nature of work, the skill of workman, and condition of the mark et makes a difference in wages. RENTS. A house in Shelton rents from $5 to $10; some poorer buildings are cheaper, but a good comfortable d vei ling brings $8 to $lO. Houses are scarce here. There are some farms and ranches which can be rented cheap, and one or two places, which can be had for a year or two for keeping them up. FUEL. Wood is burned almost entirely. Fir wood sell at. 90 cents to sl. per rick (half cord) delivered. Hard wood alder and maple will cost a little more. On the ranches and away from town wood costs the cutting. LIVING. The cost of living in section is very moderate, very few things being much higher than in the East, and many much lower. Best flour is 90 cents tosl. per sack. Butter, 15 to 30 cents, according to season. Eggs, 15 to 30 cents according to season. Potatoes and other vegetables, 25 to 50 cents per bushel. Fruits and vegetables are becoming very plentiful, producing heavily, and are within the reach of all. LAND PRICES. Practically no good vacant land convenient to settlement, is available for homesteaders. The Northern Pa cific and the Mill companies own large bodies of logged-off lands, some of which are well situated for agricultur al purposes, which are offered for sale at prices ranging from $1 to $5 per acre on the 5 and 10 year contract plan, which is very reasonable. We advise homeseekers that the best and cheapest plan for them is to find a partly inproved ranch and buv it, where they will find everything ready to begin making a living. This is a good section for workers, and idlers and people who are not willing to work are not wanted. There are good openings for milling, or other business, or intelligent farming in Mason Co., but no one should come without suffi cient means to secure a start. The construction of the Nicaragua canal should, and no doubt will, re ceive immediate legislative action. It is known that President McKinley will make a strong appeal to Congress for the early construction of the canal.

W ashingtou Letter. [From our regular Correspondent.! Washington, D. C. Dec. 4,1898 President McKinley has about fin ished his annual message to Congress, except that portion dealing with the treaty of peace. Spain has accepted our terms, and it is expected that the treaty will he signed in time to enable the President to get as many of its de tails as it is deemed expedient to make public in his message. There is no uneasiness in adminis tration circles about the ratification of the treaty of peace by the Senate, al though several republican Senators and a number of democratic Senators are talking against ratification. The only thing that the opposition can do is to delay ratification by preventing a vote at the coming session. It would be better, of course, that the treaty should he promptly ratified, hut inasmuch as we shall have everything in our own hands, and as there is no intention to govern tlie newly acquir ed territory, in any other way than by military rule, for at least a year, the delay will make no material difference, even if it extends to the end of the coming session of Congress. The President cun easily call an extra ses sion of the Senate, which will he strongly republican after the fourth of next Match, to ratify the treaty, and he can he sure that it will he speedily done. The necessity for a cable to Hawaii is so apparent that it is regarded as probable that the bill providing a form of government for Hawaii will also provide for the laying of a cable, which shall he subject to the control of this government, if not actually owned by it. No trouble is anticipated in pass ing the Hawaiian hill, whether it in cludes the cable provision or nut. President McKinley tinds it difficult to repress a smile when some promin ent caller begins to tell him the reasons —the same old reasons that lie has heard a thousand times—why the U. S. should not take the Philippines. The 'President never contradicts them. On the contrary, he expresses the heartiest agreement with a number of these reasons. After his anti-expan sion callers have exhausted their rea sons and arguments, ihe President usually says something like this: ‘•Some of your reasons are excellent, but there is one glaring weakness in your position; you do not provide a satisfactory way in which the Philip pines may he disposed of. Everybody admits that we could not, with justice, not to-mention humanity, turn the islands over to Spain again; the na tives are in no condition to maintain an independent government. Now, if the U. S. doesn’t take control of them, please give me your opinion of what ought to he done with them, bearing in mind that to attempt to transfer them to any European nation, other than Spain, which is out of the ques tion, would almost certainly precipi tate a great war.” Up to this time none of the anti-expansionists have suggested a satisfactory way for us to escape the responsibility of Philippine control, and only a few ol them have made the attempt. The U. S. Consul at Edinburg, says in a report to the Department of State ; “American made agricultural machin ery is widely used on the farms of Scotland. Most kinds of machinery for farm purposes, manufactured in the U. S., have long been preferred by farmers here, on account of price, quality and design.” The man who would have predicted twenty years ago that we should be selling large quantities of farming implements in any portion of the British Empire, would have been considered a fit sub ject tor an insane asylum. There is no telling to what extent our trade will grow in the next twenty years, if the wise policy, which has always been a feature of Republican National ad ministration shall be continued with out interruption. Nothing is likely to stop the expansion of our foreign com merce in every direction, owing to the improbability that the democrats will be in a position to saddle any more disastrous tariff experiments on the country for a long time. Those democrats who jump to the conclusion that the announcement that this government would maintain the “open door” policy in the com merce of the Philippines meant that there was to be free trade with the is lands simply exposed their ignorance. The term “open door” has long been in use in Europe, and means, not free trade, but an equal footing f«»r all. In other words, all countries will be al lowed to trade with the Philippines noon the same conditions. UpUU vllv ouuiu vuuuivivmo. OASTOXtIAi Bean the BOBght Big Increase Is in Sight. The Pacific Lumber Trade Journal, just out, says: “The prospects for next year in the lumber trade of the Pacific coast never looked brighter than they do at this writing. Copious rains have fallen in California, assuring a bounteous crop of cereals; fir prices have advanced in San Francisco, the redwood men are obtaining better returns for their lum ber than formerly, and stocks of lum ber of nearly all kinds are from 25 to 3.1 percent lower than one year ago. “The foreign cargo trade promises good results next year. Reports from Australia indicate a heavier consump tion than in several years, due to a depletion of stocks and a marked re vival in business conditions. ‘‘China will also be a promising field next year, due entirely to the Russian railroad, which is building through Manchuria, The principal demand, of course, will he for railroad timbers, but under the influence of the railroad we may look for a market in the near future for building material. It is said that already, where the Rus sians have taken camp and put up substantial frame buildings, they have found imitators in the Chinese. The next few years will make history in the Orient. Tiie accession of the Philippines will not at first do much for the lumbermen of the coast, hut new blood is progressive and will de velop the resources, which will have its influence on the sales of lumber. Japan will not taka any more lumber than usual, and Hawaii but little more than its usual quota, hut new capital will come in after a while and the products of that territory will be fur ther developed. “The South American countries ought to he good buyers, but no one can say for certain that they will. The lumber shipments to Alaska ought to he larger than this year, on account of railroad communication, and the certainty of the permanence of the gold fields and new discoveries. Eu rope will take about its usual quota. The cargo shipments to California ought to increase greatly. •‘Next in importance is the Eastern trade. So far the shipments of lum ber ami shingles exceed those of last year by a large margin. Indications point to a still further increase in lum ber shipments next year, and there is no reason why shingle shipments should not increase in spite of the unstable market the present year. Fir lumber is gaining ground everywhere in the East, as a superior wood for car building, bridge, railroad, flooring, sid ing, etc.; cedar has stood the test and is gaining ground, while the spruce and larch lumber demand is rapidly increasing. Red cedar shingles are all right, and the only remedy needed is a close study of conditions by manufac turers, carefulness in manufacture, prompt shipments and in many cases business methods. Indications are that the rail trade next year will even exceed this year, which to date exceeds that of any year in the history of the business.” Increased use of Copper. The report that John 1). Rockefeller is investing heavily in copper proposi tions is no doubt true. Mr. Rockefel ler has an eye to business, and knows of nothin which promises better re sults than copper. While the use of this material has increased almost be yond belief in this country the increase of exports of copper, raw and manu factured has been greater than that in any other article. In the past 30 years our exports of iron and steel increased from $8,000,- 000 to over $70,000,000, or nearly 900 per cent. Exports of copper, raw and manufactured, in 1868 amounted to $•479,488, while in 1898 they were $32,- 180,872, spid the demand, especially for manufactures, is rapidly increas ing. I Washington, it is safe to say, will in the near future produce more copper than any state in the Union. The mountains of the Puget Sound country are filled with immense deposits which give a higher average percentage than jis known in any other section. All that is needed is money for develop ment and the Michigan peninsula and Montana will have to take back seats as copper producers. It is a -noteworthy fact that the stock of copper mining companies ad vanced in price since January 1, from five to seventy-five per cent. A com parative table of the value of promi nent copper mines which in 1891 was | rated at a little over $50,000,000, ; shows in 1898 the same mines to le worth over $172,000,000, the immense dividends most of them have paid since the earlier date. —Ledger. Buy Goods At Home. Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker, in his re cent a ddicss, in ilh stinting ll.e wis dom of Li Hung Chang related the in cident of his conversation with the present czar of Russia. The c/.ar had been buying guns ami armor plate of Hie Krupps of Germany, and urged as his excuse that lie could get from them belter guns for less money than anywhere else. “But that is not the first principle of trade,” replied Li Hung Chang. “Every dollar you send to Germany strengthens that government and puts it in a better condition to rob you of territory. Those dollars will some day -be hurled back in the form of bullets.” As it is with international trade, so it is with local*trade. So far as possible, every dollar earn ed in Tacoma should ho spent in Ta coma. Your own wages should help pay the wages of some other Tacoma man or woman. Indirectly it will ns surely return to you as that water will seek its level. The more you buy of your grocerymau the better stock he can afford to keep and the narrower will become bis margin of profit. Every suit of clothes or dress pattern bought outside of Tacoma lias a tend ency to increase the price of the goods your neighbor buys. In some of the smaller cities one is sometime compelled to go to other markets to secure what he needs, but it is not so in Tacoma, which is uni versally recognized as being the best retail city in the stale. It has belter stores, and goods are sold at as low prices as anywhere else, and in many cases much lower. Tiie merchants of Tacoma are gen - orally men of high character and of financial responsibility. They are home-owners and interested directly in the prosperity of the city. If for no other reason than the selfish one of promoting your own interests, they should l>e sustained.—Ledger. The llev. Irl L.
