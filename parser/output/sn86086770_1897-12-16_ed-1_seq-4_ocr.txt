President McKinley’s message to congress furnishes food for discus sion on four public questions, to-wlt: the annexation of Hawaii, our atti tude toward the Cuban issurection, reform of our currency system, and the government civil service. On all these there are differing opinions in the president’s party,and harmonious action is not probable on either. He positively favors the annexation of Hawaii, to which sev eral republican senators and news papers are opposed,among the la,ter being the Milwaukee Sentinel. From the arguments that have come under its notice, the I'mihiink can but doubt the wisdom of annex ation. There appears in it no ad vantage commensurate with the ob jections against taking into the body politic the iindeserviible elements that comprise the great majority of the population of the islands. While a formidable jingo element of our country vociferously clamor for immediate interference In the af fairs of Cuba, the President advises moderation, and avoidance of action tdiat may ended! us in a war with Spain, for which no justification is yet apparent. In this the President has the support of tho unprejudiced sentiment of the country, and con- 1 gr< -- is likely to coincide. One feature of the President's ree commendutioii on the currency quest ion is a surprise. It is I hat Nu tional banks be allowed to issue pa per mom V to the extent of one-lmlf of their capital stock, secured only by lie assets of the bank, ill addi tion to an issue equal to the par value of government bonds depos ited by -m b haul,-. The proposi tion is sure to nn i I strenuous oppo sition among republicans, and its eu ncliie nl into a law seems highly im probable. The President ie. minuends modi fication and elucidation of the civil service laws, which be, with most other people who b.i\ noticed their work, duds to In very unsatisfactory, li our chief execntivi bad gum fur rier i II t b is I j lie a ml asked I'm the re peal nf the -i' i alb and ••ivil-serv Ice-re form laws, mi the ground that in their operation I lux are unjust, mi- Aim riciiii and dishonest, lie would 11 it \ i met pepiila i approval. As to the Election ol U. S. Senators. A -ugge-ijon by the Stall Journal siiiie- time ago tbal candidates for I . S. s. Motor should be nominated by Male con viint nms has elicited con siderable comment. The Milwaukee Sentinel jumped into the proposition, vigorously opposing it, and the Jour nal refused to defend it, claiming only to have suggested it to bring out sentiment. Tin Sentinel's oppo sition to the proposjtinn is based on the theory that a convention is held less strictly to accountability than a legislature, which nl course Is true. But the un i it of nomination by a convention is (bat it mn-t stand tin lest of rile polls. It I- not It 11 111. II a convention is con'iipted or blunders into a bad nomination the people vl .

The Increase In the plug tobacco trade is cited by the Cour ier-Journal as one of the evidences of returning prosperity. The point is well taken. Plug tobacco is used by the laboring element principally, and there was a sharp drop in its consumption soon after the panic of 18113 began. A large growth in the out put of plug tobacco lias taken place recently, although leaf tobacco is nearly 2nn per cent, higher in price than it was u year ago, and the plug variety lias also,of course, advanced. Manifestly hundreds of thousands more wag'- earners are employed now than were at work in 18%.—St. Louis G lobe-1 lemocrat. The democratic liars continue their denunciations of the Dfngley law, based upon absolute falsehoods. A sample of Ibis is found in a re cent, publication of the New York Journal, which, on the morning fol lowing the presentation of President McKinley’s message, said that Pres ident McKinley “finds the Dingley bill producing smaller revenues and greater deficits than the measure bis platform denounced ever did.” The absolute falsehood of this statement is shown from the official figures of the treasury d< parment, which set forth that the receipts under the Dingley law- in its first four months are more than s7,nnn,(XH) in excess of those of the Wilson law in tilt; first four months of its history, being in the four months in which it Inis been in operation $!K),517,114 against $83,- 038 0(17 produced by tile Wilson law in the corresponding period of its history.
