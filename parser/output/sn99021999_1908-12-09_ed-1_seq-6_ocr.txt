PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's last annual message to the congress, considered purely at a state document, will rank all of its predecessors in point of pre paredness and real force. It shows evidence of deep thought and study of the problems touched upon, even to care In' wording them, which has not been pronounced in former mes sages by Mr. Roosevelt. In his earlier messages, the president was pursuing an aggressive policy, outlining work for congress and the administration, and he gave more attention to rugged sketches of the legislative program ho had in mind than to calm discus sion of details. With most of his great work finished, he has devoted much of his present message to retrospect, to a review of wont accomplished and to a markedly conservative and thoughtful consideration of work left to his successor in the furtherance of what hare come to be known as "the Roosevelt policies." Study of the work of the railway rate law, one of the greatest achieve ments of the Roosevelt administra tion, has only strengthened the pres ident's conviction that the railways should be removed from the domain of the anti-trust law and placed com pletely under the Interstate Commerce commission. He urges that the com mission should have absolute power In the matter of fixing rates, and should also be authorised to have su pervision over the issue of securities and other financial operations of the transportation companies. Authority, he urges, should be given to the rail ways to make traffic agreements and combinations, subject to the approval of the commission, the purpose being to see that the railroads do justice to the public and that no injustice be done the railroads. This attitude of the president meets the approval of the expert students of transportation problems and the leading railway managers, aa well as the best In formed shippers of the country. It is being generally conceded that the leg islation proposed by the president of fers the surest solution of the problem of transportation and the relations of the railways to the public. With the prominence given to the labor question in the recent cam paign fresh in mind, the president devotes a very liberal portion of his message to the labor question and its relations to capital and the courts, offering suggestions and criticisms that may not be pleasing- to either labor, capital or the Judiciary, but may result In wholesome benefit to all three. He urges a general extension of the laws providing compensation for persons injured in the government employ and In interstate commerce service. He reviews the attacks made by certain labor leaders in the last campaign against the republican party and the congress and shows, by offi cial records, that the claims made by these leaders - were untrue and - their purpose unjust, in that It sought to ceato class legislation and class con sciousness. Excuse is found, however, for this radical attack on the courts, In the attitude of some judges who "have lagged behind In their under standing of the great and vital changes in the body politic, whose minds have never been opened to the new application of the old principles made necessary by new conditions." This reference is directed at decisions by certain courts which have been ex ceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers and the president urges legislation designed to check the abuse of the issuance of tempo rary Injunctions. He suggests that notice should issue before injunctions. In all cases except where it is clearly shown that Irreparable injury would result otherwise and in such cases hearings on the merits of the case should bo promptly held. The presi dent criticises the, courts for their marked inefficiency in dealing "with corporations. Other recommendations of the mes sage afe In keeping with former doc uments from Mr. Roosevelt. He asks enlargement of the army, and navy; the establishment of the postal sav ings bank system; the admission of New Mexico and Arizona; the making of provision for the improvement of Inland waterways and a general for ward movement in the furtherance of the policies inaugurated in the . last eight years for the benefit and ad vancement of the welfare of the whole people.

LORDS. ' The committee of the BritlsS House of Lords on the reform of that body has made a report on the demand that has been growing In the British empire for a change in the Lords that would make that body more respon sive to the sentiment and will of the people. The House of Commons has openly advocated that the House of Lords be abolished or radically re vised. The Lords have barkened to the demand for revision, but, like some tariff agitation in another coun try, they propose to have the revision done by their friends. Tho report of the committee sug- gests that a House of about 350 mem bers be created, of which 100 shall be elected from the peerage by the body of peers; ISO to service by right of heredity, qualified by public service; 10 to bo elected by the bishops from their number and 6 to servo as Judges, II is rurtner recommended that twenty yeara' service in tho House of Commons bo rewarded by elevation to tho peerage and membership in tho House of Lords. There Is no prospect that this ree iruimcuujimu win meet with any marked approval among those who have been advocating a reform of the Lords. It makes no provision whatever for giving the people a voice la the selection, of members of tho body and comes no nearer being an elective proposition than would appointments by the king. The recommendation contains a shrewd bid Tor the support of some of the older members of the House of Commons by holding out to them the prospect of a peerage and a membership in the upper body of the British Parliament. How far this will tend to lessen the demand In the Commons for the abolition of the House of Lords remains to be seen, but the whole proposition viewed from the American Idea of political reform borders very closely upon the ludicrous. FADS JX TBS SCHOOLS. The Board of Education has acted wiaely In turning down the proposition to equip the Omaha public schools with a numerous corps of medical in structors, whose time should be de voted to the care of the children at tending school In the city. While tho reason assigned : is one of sufficient weight to justify the action at present, there is back of the objection a still more potent reason, and one of such gravity aa to challenge careful consid eration at present. The complaint has been, made dur ing a number of years that the public schools of the country were tending too much toward fads and fadistn and getting away from the practical pur poses for which the schools were in stituted and are maintained. The idea of education at public expense Is to train the children for the duties of citizenship, and In this the cost of maintaining the school Is merely an Investment in the interest of good government. This simple proposition has been twisted to sdpport the intro duction of a number of experiments along the line of public education. Some of these experiments . have proven merely expensive, while others have shown themselves to be of doubt ful, if any, value. The cotst, however, has been met from the public coffers In each instance. While the , health of tho children attending the public schools Is a matter of. concern to the people at large, It is a duty that de volves moro on the parents than on the public to see that their children are properly cared for. s The proposition Just rejected by tho School board' would reverse the nor mal relations between the schools and the patrons and would shift onto the public responsibility that properly be longs with the parents. The state has already accepted a great deal too much In the way of making provision for the individual. It is not merely conservative, but it is also wise and prudent, that a check be placed on the alleged progress that merely amounts to aubBtitution of state for individ ual responsibility. THE NATION'S EXPENSE ACCOUNT. The annual report of Charles H. Treat, treasurer of the United StateB, shows that the treasury deficit on June 30 last was $58,070,021, as against a surplus of $84,236,586 for the preceding year. Mr. Treat has nothing to do with the making of lawB or the spending of money, except to keep track of the receipts as they come in and pay the bills authorized and ordered by congress. He explains that the deficit for last year was not due so much to decreased receipts as to Increased expenditures. While busi ness Increased for the fiscal year end ing in June, 1908, the congressional appropriations were larger than ever before. Mr. Treat's report will servo to call renewed attention to the question of revenues, the most important problem that will have to be met by the con gress that comes into existence next March. The receipts of the govern ment even during the period of de pression show an actual increase over former records. This Increase may be expected to continue, as the nation's foreign and domestic trade is devel oped, but no increase from customs and internal revenue will be suffi cient to meet the Increased drains upon the treasury for governmental purposes. The problem to be settled by Mr. Taft's administration will be to either provide a new source of fed eral revenue or adopt some method of reducing federal expenses. Difficulty will attend efforts in either direction. The demand for extension of the govT ernment policies in many directions, in public buildings, In river and har bor Improvements, in forest preserva tion, in irrigation and a!l along, the line is persistent and almost impossi ble ' to resist. No congress has ever shown a niggardly disposition with the public funds and the people have never really protested against federal expenses, except in the course of polit ical campaigns. It will require states manship of the . strong-backbone variety to determine where tho reduc tions shall be made, If a policy of re trenchment is decided upon. It cannbt well be In the matter of conservation or development of the natural re sources and bitter opposition will fol low, from many sources, any attempt to reduce either the army or the navy. No cheese-paring policy can be pur sued In making provision for the en forcement of the corporation and anti trust laws and every policy inaugu rated in the last eight years all of which have met with popular ap provalcalls for money for continua tion. The reaK problem would appear to be the devlsion of means for increas ing tho national revenues, either by tho Income or Inheritance tax, the in crease of internal revenue taxes or somo other method which- congress and the courts may decide upon as wise and le-"' 'The democrats are now insisting that their support for the supreme court amendment was given as a re sult of a bargain made with Governor 8heldon. Is It possible that the dem ocrats of Nebraska must be bribed Into supporting what is generally con ceded to be a needed amendment to the constitution? Could not they have honestly supported the proposed change because it was right, and not because they expected to get the lion's share of appointments? The World-Herald Is Insisting with much vehemence on the election of the Board of Fir and Police Commis sioners for Omaha. And it has only been a very few years since the editor of the World-Herald was clamoring with equal insistence for the removal of tho police force and fire department from politics as far as possible! One democrat appointed to office by Br'er Shallenberger is inclined to balk because the holding of the office car ries with It residence In Lincoln. It is too bad that there should be even this small fly In the ointment that Is otherwise so sweet, but the law will not likely be changed even to suit a democrat. An eastern paper says that the last latest defeat of Mr. Bryan shows that the democratic party can not win under radical leadership, and a western paper retorts that the de. feat of Judge Parker shows that the democratic party cannot win under conservative leadership. Both papers are right Elbert Hubbard declares that Julius Caesar died from "compulsory vacci nation," thus spoiling the Impression and general report that he died while Drs. Brutus, Cass! us and Casca were performing a "successful" operation on him for the removal of an enlarged ambition. On Friday the regents of the Uni versity of Nebraska will meet in Omaha for the purpose of selecting a chancellor. The field Is still open, but the hope is that the new head for the great Institution will be a man big enough to fill the job. Thus far the Washington corre spondents have succeeded in selecting only George von L. Meyer, Theodore Burton, Senator Knox, Whltelaw Reid and Francis R. Bacon for the position of secretary of state in Mr. Taft's cabinet. James Hamilton Lewis declares there will be no tariff revision at the next session of Congress. Mr. Lewis, it may be remembered, is the man who carried every state in the union except Pennsylvania for Mr. Bryan last' October.
