Somebody nun figured it out that tbe wheat acreage of Kansas is 285,000 acres less this fall than last. The western part of the state has a largely increased acreage, but the eastern part ha3 only 64 per cent of its last year's acreage. In the defeat of Roger Q. Mills, the republicans have lost an able ally. His elevation to the speakership would have given him an opportunity to materially aid them in the campaign of 1892. Rut bis influence as chairman of the ways and means committee will contribute largely to republican suc cess. Dickinson county wants Something. That court , the Abilene Reflector says, has never had a state officer. Well, Dickinson is as good a county as many that have had numbers of state officers and she has men much more competent to fill .my position in the stam than some t.isit have been barn acles. La ivd:iA' irth Times. The republican league of Kansas deserves credit for one thing. It meets maniiesto wjth manifesto and address with address. More than that its documents are straightforwaid, businesslike and packed full of common sense-a decided contrast to the bald erdash put forth by the peoples parU suystern who are now running that institution. Tbe Dicnunon county alliance rren who pio;n.e joint; to Washington to see their reprrsentaiives "jjet" will find no agricultural simplicity. Ptffer, it is said, occupies tho most, gorgeou.-t apartments in tba capital and luxur iates in inasrmiicfut nigs, portieres and deeoralious while the other allwnce congressmen live at a similar pace. The alliance movement was a great success for them. Abileif i rf irs t compromise tho state capital question by accepting the nomina tion for go voruor.

In 1S90 the peoples party eieclt d 324 and Ihe republicans 71 out of i he 424 county officers voted for In other words the peoples party suffrred a net loss of 197 offices out of 424, while the lepublicar.s made a gain of 206.

There are postoffices kept open the year round in Dickibsou county for a less amount than an average man would want fjr a wv;',.' s jiry. To be sure there ate some advantages m the postmaster having unlimited opportun ities for talking over the condition of crops, weather and publics with tbe neighbors but there is not enough money in the position to keep the fire going io the postoffice room.

STATE DEPARTMENT. What Has Hecn Done in the Sealing, Chil ian and Italian lynching DIlllcu ties. Tho work of the state department during the last year has been characterize! by an Tmusual number of Iinpottant negotiations and by diplomatic results ot a notable and highly beneficial ch tract r. Among these are the r-cinrocal trade arrangements which have been concluded. In ihe exercise oi the power conferred by section & of the tariff law, with the republio of Hr iz 1. with Spain, for its West India possessions, and with San Domingo. Like negotiations with oth t countries have been much advanced a d t is hoped that before the clo e of the yoar further definitive trade arrangements of great value will be concluded. AFFAIRS WITH ORE IT IlKITAiy. In view of the report whlc i have been received as to the diminution of the seal herds in the Retiring sea, I deemed it wise to r roposo to her majesty's government In F. bru try last that an agree ment for a clo-ed season should be made, pending the negotiations for arbl ration which then secmo I to he approaching a favorable conclusion After much corre spomiem e, and delays for which this gov ernment was not responsible, an agreement wa-t rea lied and 9lgned on tho 1-th ot June, by which Great Britain undertook Iro.n that dHto.inl until Miv 1. 1S9J, to prohibit the killing My her subj -cts of seals la the Hearing wen and tht government of the United sta'es dur m the s ime period to enforce its xlsting prohibition against pel gcs'-alinga id to limit thci-atch by the fur seal comp mv upon the islands to 7 5uO skins If this agrecm nt could have been reached enrli- r In resp mse to the strenuous endeavors of this gov. rnment. It would have been more effective but coming as late as it did, it unquestionably resulted in greatly diminishing the destruction ot the seals by the Canidlan e ilers. In my last imssage Istat d that tho basis of arbitration proposed by her majesty's government for the a ljustment of tho long-p-ndlng controv y a to th seal fisheries w -s not aeioptable. I tin glad now to be able to announo - thit terms s itlsttctory to this povernment have b. en agreed upon and thai an agromnent as to the arbitrators is all that is HW'Ssay to.thocomp etion of tho convention. In viowof the a v meed posi tion which t is guvort ment has taken upon the uuj.jct of Inter lational arbitration this ren wed ex;ir 3-jlonof our a llien-nce to this method for the settlement of disputes such as have i.ris- n in tin Behring sea, will 1 doubt not, meet with the concurrence of congress. ME4T IXSrECTIOX.

It is gratifying to bo able to state that Germ my, Denmark Italy, Austria and France. In th order named, have op netthelr ports to Inspected Amcrcan pork prolucts. The removal of thee restrict on3 In every In-tance wis asked for and given olely upon th ground that we h td now provided a meat Inspection that should bo acrcntcd as adequate to the complete removal of the danger', roil or fane ed, which had been previously urged The state departm nt. our ministers abroad and the se retarv of agriculture havo co operated with unflairglng and Intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this great result. The outlines of an agreement have been reached with G rniany. looking o equitable trade concessions in consideration of tho continued free importation of her sugars, but the tl.no has not yet arrive 1 when this correspondence can be submitted to congress. cniLlns AFFAIRS The civil war In Onill which beaan In January last was continued, but. fortunate ly with Infrequ nt and not important a mod collisions un il August 23, when tho con gressional forces landed near Valparaiso and, after a bloody en -agement, captured ino city. I're-llcnt Balinaceda at onoe recognized that his rauso was lost, and a provisional government was speedily es tablished by the victorious party. Our minister was promptly directed to recog nize and put himself In communclation with this government so soon as it should have established Its do facto charter, which was done. During the pendenco of this civil contest frequent Indirect app-als wcro uiuuo io mis government to extend being t ent rlght3 to ihe in urgents and to give audience to their representatives. Thl was de lined, and that policy was pursued throughout, which this govern ment, when wrenched by civil war, so stren uously In-lsted upon on tho part of Europe an nat ons. The Itata an armed vessel commanded bv a naval officer of the Insur gent fleet mnned by Its sailors and with soldiers on board, was seized under process ot the United States court at San Diego C !., for a violation of our neutrality law While In the custody of an officer of the court the vessel was forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It woul 1 have boen Incon sistent with tho dljnitT and self-respect of this sovernment not to h ivo Insis ed that the Itata should be returned to San Diego to abide by tho Jud ment of the court.

Tuere is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, forej-rn or domestic, there is cer tainly nothing In the condltionof ourpeople of any class, to suggest that the existing tariff and revenue legislation bears oppress ively upon the people or retards the com mercial development ot the nation. It may be argued that our condition would be bet ter if our tiriff legislation were upon a free trade basis; but It cannot be denied that all the conditions of prosperity and ot general contentment are present in a larger degree than ever before in onr history, and that, too.

In Closing nts Message the President Has Something to hay on Gerrymandering and the Necessity or a Constitutional Amendment. The method ot appointment by the states of electors of pros dent unlv ce-president has recent y attracted renewed inter-st by rea-on of a departure by tne state of Midi gan from the methods which had become uniform In all the states. Prior to 1S32 van ous mctho is had been used by th.- different s ates and even by thj samo state In some the choice was made by the legislature-. In others electors wero chosen by distr.cts, but more gen-rally by the voters of the whole s.ate up n a general ticket. The movement towards the adoption ot the last named method had an earl, beginning and went steadily .or ward among tbo states, until In ls32 there remained but a single state. South Carolina, that bad not adopted It That state, until the clvl war, continued to chose its electors by vote of the legislature, but after the war changed its m thod and conformed to the pract ce of other -tates For nearly sixty years all the st .tes save one h ive appointed their electors by a popular vote upon a gen eral ticket, and for nearly thirty years this method was universal After a full tes of otner method , without important division or disent In any st ite and without ny pur pose of party advantage, as w mnt believe, but solely npon the considerations that un iformity was d sirab e an 1 t lat a general election In territu.rl .1 divisions not sub- ctt ichanue wasmO"t consistent with the po ultr chiracte ot onr insti utlons best preserved the equality of the v ers, and etfeotualty remov d tuechilce of pres idont from the baietul Influence of the "gerrymander," the practice of all tbestates was br ingbt Into harmony. That tbls con currence should now be broken, ts, I think, an unfortunate and even a threatening epi sode and one that m y well suggest whether th states that still give th ir approval to the.ildan prevailing method ought notto se ore. by constitutional amendment, a practicv which has had tha approval of Ce-ent Mic ilgan lets at on p ov. les f cboosi 1 what ne po u ir y known as t on ress onai elector- f r pro-iJet by co resslonil 'li-tr cts and tne two xenator lo tors by dis nets r ated f r that pu pose. T.iis legis at on wis of course, ompaiiied by a new ongressioua appo lonment, and th- two stt uto bring t el ctoral vote ot t ie st ite un cr the lull ence of tlie gerrymander " These ge ry manders for congressional purposes are in most cases bnttresse t by a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making It Im possible for a major ty of the legal voters of the state to correct the apportionment and equalize the con gres lonal districts. A minority rule Is established that onlv a political convulsion Can overlhrw. I have recently been advis d tha. .n one county of a certain state three, dl tri. ts for thee ection of mem bers of the legislature aro constituted as fol.ows: Oae has 5.0 0 poaulat o 1; one I .- 0 '. an one in,0n) wull in another count,, ditae ed, non-con. 1 uous sect. ons hav 1 eeu unit d to in ke a 1 gisla ive d stri.-t These methods bav already fonnd effective appli ation to the choice of sen itors and rep resentati ves in congress and now an evil start has be n mado in the direction ol'applylng them to the choice by the st itc3 of electors ot president and vice president. If this is accomplished we shill th-m hive three great dep rtraents of the government In the grasp of the gerrymanlor. the legislative and tho executive diroctty and the Judiciary Indirectly through the power of appoint ment. An election imp i s a body of olectors hav ing prescribed nu.ilitl ations, e 'Ch ono of whom hasaneiuil value and i fluence in deter.nin ng he result. So when the consti tution provides thut eich siate shall appoint (elect) in such manner as thu 1 g. stature thereof mav direct, a number of electors." etc , an un restrlc.eJ power was not given to the legis latures In the solo tion of 111 'thods to bo usid A republic in lorm ot government Is guannteed iy thocon-titutlo 1 to each state, and tho power given by the samo instru ment to the legi-laturcs of the stales to pre scribe methods for the choice by th state, of electors must be exercised under that lim tation lho essuntlal feat ires ot such a government aro tho right of the people to chuo o their own oillcers and the nearest practica lc equ ilit of value in the suffrages given In determining that choice. It will not bo cl lim d that tho power given to tho lcglsl iture would support a law pro Tiding that the persons re eiv ng the small est vote shou.d bo tho electors of a law unit a 1 olectors should be chosen by tho voters of a single co gressionul district, and under tho pretense of regulating methods tho legislature can neither vest the right of cho ce elspwhere nor adopt methods not conformable to republic n institutions. It Is not my purposo here to discuss the question whether a cholco by the. legisiatu-c or by tho voters of equal single districts Is a choice by tho stat , but only to recom mend such regulation of this matter by con stitutional amendment as will secure uni formity and prcv nt that disgraceful par tisan Jutrglery to which such a Ilbeny of choic , if It exists, off ts a temptation. Nothing just now Is more Important than to provide every guaranty for tho absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respective statos of all tho officers of the national trovernment whether that suff ace Is annlied directly as in tno cho'C. of menibTS of the house of ren rcsentatlvci". or Indir ctly as In tho cho co of sen itors an 1 electors of pr. sident Re spect for p'ibl c ofltc rs and obedlen'e to law will not cease to bo the characteristic of ourpeople until our elections cease 10 declare the wi 1 of majorities fairly ascer tained wi hout fraud, suppression or gerr -man ler. If I were ca led upon to declare wi.crcin our chief na lonal danger lies I shoul I say, without hesitnt on, in the over thriwof majority control by the suppres sion or perversion of tho popular suffrage Tuat there is a rcnl dan cr hero all must agree. But the energies of those who se it have been thiell expended in tryimr to fix rosp nsloility upo tue opposita partv. rattier than 111 fforts to make such pract.ces Impossible by iihcr p irty. Is It not possioic now to adjourn that in terminable and inconclusive, debate whi o wo take, br consent one step In tho direc tion of reform by eliminating the g -rrvman-der which has been denounced by all parties ns an influence In thu election of electors of prcsidont and mem'iors of ion,rres? All the states nave, acting re ly and sop ar itely, determined th it he choice of elect ors by a general ticket Is tho wisest and safest mi t nod, anl it would seem thcrocoullbd no objection to a constitu tional amendment making that method permanent. If a legislature chosen in ono year up n purelv local questions should, pending a presi lentil contest, meet, re scind the law for a choice upon a general ticket, and provldo for th choice ot elect ors by the legislature, and this trick should determine the result. It Is not too mnci to say that tbo public peace might bo seriously and widely endangered I have alluded to tho "gerrymander" as aff cttng the method of selecting electors of p osident by congress) -nil districts, but the p imary intent and effei t of this form of political robbery h ive relation to the selec tion of members of tho homo of represen tatives. The power of co igrjss Is ample to deal with th s threatening and Intolerable abuse. The unfailing test of sincerity In elect on reform wil. be found m a willing ness to conf t as to remedies and to put In o force such m asures as will most effectu illy preserve the right of the p ople to freu and cq nl representation. An attempt was mule In last congress to bring to bear the constitution il pnrc f the general government for tho correctio 1 of frauds ng 1 nst thnsuffnge. It is Impor tant to know whether 1 he opoositinn to such measures is really vested In particular featur s supposed to be obje ttonablo or n cludes any prop -sltion to a ve to tno ole -tion laws of the United states adequlcv to the correction ofgrivcand ac'-tnowlediod evils I must vet c iter.atn the hop that it Is oss hie to secure a calm, p itr.otle con sideration of such constitutional or statu tory chang s as ma bemcssiry tosecur-" the cho'-e of t ie officers ot t ie govornment to the people by fair apportioame it and free elections.

To the cons erat on of these very grave questions I Invite not only tbe attention of congress, but that of all patriotlfcitizens. We must not c itertam the delus on that our people h ive ceased to regard a free ballot and equal representation as tbe price ot their al.eg.ance to laws and to civil magis trates.
