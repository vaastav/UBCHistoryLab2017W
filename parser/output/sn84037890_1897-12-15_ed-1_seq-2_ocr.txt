In an address recently delivered boforo the National Prison Congress, by its President, General appeared some very significant utterances in regard to the necessity of moral and religious training in ourpublicschools. Ho regards this as tho most important cloment in the education of the risinggenerationtotho highest and most perfect citizenship, and the most essential of all measures for tho prevention of crime He says; Hirst snd foremost, what Is most essential to be done is to revolutionize otrr educational ss tern from top to bottom, so that pood morals, cood citizenship, and ability to cam an honest Ihlng shall 1 its primary purpose Instead of intellectual culture as heretofore. And again: In this last message t want to put it on rec ord, with all the emphasis I can command, that If we are to make any large progress in tne xc formation of prisons or the prevention of crime, or In the betterment of mankind, we must u).ll lie more fully than heretofore the religious ele ment which is inherent In the unhersal heart of man. These aro words of the most vital import, and their truthfulness can not bo caiiisaid. They will meet a responsivo chord in tho heart ot all persons. There is not too much teaching of Bcience nowadays, but too little training in the habits of morals. Much timo and attention is given to tho develop ment of the intellect but not enough to the instillation of tho eterpal principles of right and justice. In telligenco does not always breed hon esty nor education right living. Intellectual culture of itself dots not vouchsafe the perfection of "God's noblest work, an honest man." What tho conservators of our public school system should bear in mind is tho fact that moral and religious training is more important to the life and future of tho student than intellectual attainment, and that the two must be carried on together to insure a realization of tho highest and most perfect citizenship. At no time in our country's history was religious traiuing and practice more needed than at tho pres ent. There can bo no disputing thp fact that the further we got from the divine teachiiiKS of tho Bible and the eternal verities of God's com' mandments, tho more chaotic, im perfect and dishonest become our public institutions and our mode of living. Tho Christian religion as taught in tho Bible embraces the very essence of right living and good citizenship, and tho humble and faithful follower therein cannot be misled into anything except the grandest truths and tho most sublime inspirations. One great trouble with tho world to-day is a wandering away from tho exalted and imperishable precepts propagated by Christ, tho Leader of men. Men have grown selfish and indifferent to the obliga tiona of honest citizens, and practice too much tho trickery and chicanery of the world, rather than tho righteous principles of justice and moral ity. This is tho result of too lax training and too little following along religious linrs. One need never bo afraid nor mistrustful of the treatment ho will receivo from man who is constantly endeavoring to the best of his ability to lead a true christian life. If he is mistreat cd or ill used, it will bo by mistake and not by impulse. True religion is not a superstition, but a tangible something that goes into the very vital element of a man's life and makes him better and truer and more honest towards himself, his neighbor and his God. Wo are getting too worldly, too selfish and too aesthetic. We need to return to the practice of olden days, from which tho ages seem dividing u, when God's word was law and His precepts a codo of government. The lastest paper to come to our desk is tho Hart County Record. It turned up a few days ago dated Dc comber 21, 1897. The double-number iuo of tho Todd County Times, in point of typographical get-up, was tho best piece of work that has lately conio to our notice. Tho Madisonvillo Huitlcr camo out last week in a holiday doublo number ami in a new dress, and in this it exemplifies its name and improves its appcaranco. Tin: IIiniAi.n is in favor of a reduction of tho Governor's salary from 80,500 annually to 85,000, and this in face of tho fact that wo aro quite sure that our next Governor will bo a Democrat, to bo succeeded by Democrats. One redeeming featuro of tho Dingly bill is tho clauso proi hibiting tho importation of lottery tickets, which will have tho effect of eternally squelching tho Louisiana Lottery, which has been doing bus- in tea in Honduras. Tun Todd County Progress has tho following concerning an articlo which appeared in Thu Herald: The Hartford IlhRAtn's address to Its sub scribers, occuplnRn half column, Is one of the most unique addresses of the season, and If it don't prote n money fctcher It ought to Dit. C. II. HuoiiES. tho trrcat St. Louis scientist, says flirting is a so, like St. Vitus danco. Ho holds, that tho flirt is unbalanced, and that no person indulges in this occupation who is mentally and physically sound. The fact that a man may live to almost reach tho meridian of his ex istence beforo ho learns some of tho great truths of lifo, cannot bo too strongly impressed upon tho minds of tho "rising generation," many of whom think that they "know it all beforo they aro scarcely old enough to vote. The Kentucky Press Association will hold its annual meeting next year some time in June, iu sumo central point in Kentucky, perhaps in Louisville. After tho transaction of business, the editors will tako their regular outing, tho objective point being Mackanac, Michigan, including a steamer ride on tho great lake from Toledo. Tho trip will bo a most delightful one. Another crying need that will conio up beforo Congress is legislation on our pension laws. A contemporary aptly remarks that "Republican papers are awakening to tho fact that thousands of dead pen sioners are still being carried on tho rolls." The pension system is all right aud proper when carried on in a lecal and Honest way, nut tuo fraudulent practices that are now permitted are a disgrace to our country and an injustico to really deserving soldiers. A great saving could be accomplished along this line. Mn. Harry Sommers, editor of the Eluabethtown iVcii's, says that some time ago young Henry Sum mers, a neighbor, lost his leg in a railroad accident, and the public prints got him mixed up with the Xcics man. Since that time tho editor has been deluged with all kinds of letters and catalogues, wanting to supply him with artificial limbs. Mr. Sommers says this thing is get ting monotonous; that he don't need any wooden legs or crutches, but that the persons who aro annoying him will if they don't stop their peg' leg propositions betoro no is com pelled to grasp the office cleaver and start out on tho war-path. No iietteh evidence of tho wide popularity which the Herald en joys could bo asked than that which has been furnished us lately. With in the past week or two we have re ceived several orders for the paper from distant points in Kentucky, and some of these subscriptions come from other States. As to how these persons ever camo to hear of the Herald wo do not know, but that they havo heard of it and appreciate it, is a fiict which we are proud to note. Tho Herald is now going to over 300 different post-offices in the Unite tl States. It is our endeavor to furnish a paper of general interest to the people, and wo believe wo are succeeding. It seems that many farmers aro slow to heed tho lesson that appears unheaded in the crop reports of tho papers. It often appears from a heedful reading of the market that the best prices and the Burest salo come to those articles which havo received tho most careful attention in raising and preparing for market. This is notably true of tobacco. Tho crops of men who have earned a reputation for careful preparation and handling and which give evidence of superiority in all salient points, are eagerly sought for and command a better price and a surer sale than the mongrel offerings. Thero can be no doubt that in farming, as in most other matters, it pays to do a thing right. m -- A movt sickening and pitiful sight, not without its disgusting features, was witnessed at Madison Square Garden, New York, Saturday night, at tho finishing up of the great six-day's bicycle race. Men worn to tho limit of endurance were wabbling nround tho track, almost crazy from the fearful ttrain of the long ride, and exerting their utmost energies and risking their very existence for tho attainment of fame aud a small prize-purse. With a drawn and idiotic stare upon their faces, tho men continued to make tho dizzy circles around tho largo show- ring, alternately colliding with each other and dropping from their wheels from sheer exhaustion, only to stag ger on again, until finally tho pitiful honor was accorded to a man named Miller. It was freely admitted by doctors and trainers present that many years were taken from most of tho contestants by tho long weok's rido. r. :" IlAinroui) is proverbial for its hospitality. Kvery that arrives in town finds n generous welcome Our citizens vio with each other in extending a kindly greeting and making everyono feel nt homo who casts his lot with us and comes a citizen of our village. These facts will bo heartily attested by ovcryone who has come among us to live. Our citizens aro warm-hearted, "kindly afloctioncd ono to wards another," and barring tho friendly political rivalry that exists, as in nil communities, thoy will bo found each over ready to help tho other in all matters of common concern. No more warm-hearted or hospitablo pcoplo can bo found than resido in Hartford, and they invito tho citizonship of all good people, irrespective of creeds or principles, who will bo mado to partnko of tho magnanimous spirit which has won for Hartford the name of being ono of tho best towns in Kentucky. While considerable interest is being worked up in other Congression al districts, everything is quiet in tho Fourth. Mr. D. II. Smith, our present Democratic representative, will not likely havo any opposition from his own party for a re-election. Tho Louisville papers havo intimated that Mr. E. D. GufTy would announce from tho Republican side, but this supposition cannot bo relied on. Considerable talk has been indulged in of late about Mr. GufTy resigning his positi'n of Assistant SecretaryofState.andit is quite like ly that he will vacate this place to tako a deputyship under Col. C M. Barnett, as soon a3 the latter re ceives his appointment as Surveyor of the Port of Louisville, which for weeks has been considered an event only a few days off. The Republi cans havo not yet announced their sacrifice for Congress in this district, nor aro any probable names mentioned in this connection. Ii is to be regretted that Kentucky cannot hae a battleship named for her without a big row as to whom should Christen it. People who live in glass house should not throw stones, for this reason we seldom remark upon the grammar of our contemporaries. Tub Herald, howe er, in its lat week's issue made such a glaring error that we feel disposed to call it down. Brother, jou should not say, "their shots have mostly v lnt wide of the mark," etc The correct thing is this, "their shotshave.mosb ly cone wide of the mark," etc. Now do not ltt such things occur again. The above two paragraghs are tak en from the Hartford Republican, one appearing just below the other, as shown. Its editor seeks to criti ciso our grammar. We do not set ourselves up as high authority on this matter, nor do we claim to be incapable of mistakes. But we wish to call our 'steemed contemporary's attention to tho little word "whom" in tho first paragraph, which it uses in tho wrong sense. He should have said "As to uho should christen it," and tho capital "C" is unnecessary, a "christen" is a verb and not a proper noun. "Now, do not let such things occur again." The tendency of tho metropolitan churches to run into plutocratic channels and drag their religion along with them is becoming more and more apparent. It seems that tho big churches of the cities are for tho rich only, and a poor man who seeks comfort or rest beneath their roofs is met with a cold and indifferent reception. This has been con clusively proven of late by tho visits of newspaper reporters dressed in ragged but decent clothes to tho stylish churches. They were either utterly ignored by the ushers or commanded to take a very bock seat. Tho same gentlemen, wearing kid gloves and silk hats, were met with gushing politeness and shown to good scats well up towards tho preacher. All of which goes to provo that if Christ should appear on earth in tho garb and manner of His first coming and seek admission into ono of these churches, He would likely be relegate'd to tho rear and refused a too close advance towards the man who preaches His name!

WASHINGTON LETTER. l'rom our regular correspondent.) Washington, D. O., Dec. 10, 1897. Secretary Gngo is about tho only member of tho admiuittrntion who would really liko to soo his moudations for cinching tho hold of tho, Bingio goiii siummni on ims country laws. Mr. MoKinlcy did not dnro to ondorso tbo recommendations of his Sccrotary of tho Treasury, ond ho has no renl dosiro for tho flnanoinl legislation ho lull-horn toilly suggested. IIo knows that his gcitlon of gotting rid of tho green backs by turning them into gold certi ficates could cot get through Congress, oven if only tho Republicans voted npon it. IIo was afraid that tho recommendations for amending tho National batiking laws, so as to rcduco taxation on National bank currency, to nllow currency to bo issued to tho fnco vslno of tho bonds deposited with tho gov ernment, and. to allow the establishment of Nat'onol banks with $25,000 cupiUl in (mall p'neos, might gtt through, so ho added a proviso that ho know would kill tho whole1, to mako all National bank nctesredcemablo in gold. Tne administration is simply trying to Muff a poition of iti own ratty and tho country. It doesn't wnnt any flnanc'al lcgiilstion. This has already been mado plain in tho Houso by tho engineered by Sir. Dingly by which his committee Ways and Means will tako chargo of tll financial bills and smother them. Republicans havo also phinly indicated by their talk that thoy Lad recieved intimations from tho administration that no financial legislation was wanted.' Ono Nebraska Republican Mr. S. Strown, on Omtha lawyer has turned up in Washington who is hoaett enough to publicly say that tho Republicans havo no chance to carry tlat State, either nt tho Congressional elections next year or tbo National election of 1900. Mr. Strawn says tho Republicans 1 aro not been ablo to gut back the farmer votes tboy Io:t on the silver quettion, and (hot thoy aronot likoly to gtt them back so long as that question is unsettled. With tho exception of Senators Morgan, of Alabama., and Gorman, of Marland, every Democratio Senator is now lined up againtt the nanexa'ion of Hawaii, and the opiojition among tho Republicans already includes Senators Hoar, Morrill and Pattigrow. This makes it imrossil le to proenro the two-thirds vote needed to ratify tho treaty providing for annexation, and the Republicans aro already serioutly thinking of abandoning the treaty and trying to securo annexation by majority legislation. It looks all tloas though tho annexation question was going lo bo used by tbo Reed machine- to whnk McKinley over tbo head. Tho Czar is undent od t havo privately announced himself to bo oprosrd to annexation. In fact, preseut indications aro that before this session has grown very old, tho lino between MoKinlev Republicans and Reed Republicans will bo starply drawn. If Spain isn't entirely pleased with the situation at tho Washington end of the line, eho must be hard t3 please. It was a new thing for a President of the United SUtea to devote nearly half of his message to Congress to an argument in favor of allowing a foreign nation moro timo in which to try to equeeze tho life out of a pcoplo resid ing in sight of onr coast, and tbo innO' vktion was ennsoous to many.

Senator Allen offered a resolution in tho Senate for tho recognition of Cuban independeno9, bnt it is feared that tho Committee on Foreign Relations, to which it was referred, will pigeon-hole it.
