?1 ? - v. DAILY INDEPENDENT. ? . FRIDAY DECEMBER 9, 1887. COUNTY OFFICIAL PAPER. THE HEMAOE. Itopnbllcmn Prvtrctlaa Is Otsia crstlck'VM Trade. The Republican party claims to be the especial cliauipiou of Protection, nud prominent representatives of that party are now vigorously denoauoing she President's message ua a Free Trade document, notwitliMtandiug that it advo cates the HStue principles laid down by the Bcpablioun party a few years ago; that is to ssy the principles tnuueiuted by the party of Protection iu 1883 and 1884 beoouie essentially Free Trade doctrine when endorsed by a Democratic President iu 1887. The troth of the matter is that the President, in his dis cussion of this paramount question, has struck a popular chord whose vibrations will And an appreciative response in the hearts of the Amerioau people, and as a natural and inevitable seqnenoe the managers of the Bepablioau party are stricken with sadden fear and tremb ling at the probable resnlt. Iu oom meuting on the recommendations em bodied in the message the Examiner suys: There are already signs of a Repabli can combination to resist these moderate# reooramendatious, although the Presi dent's doctrine wuh good enough Repub lican doctrine three years ago, when the crisis wus immeasurably less aoate than it is now. The Bepnblican National Convention which nominated Mr. lil.iiue in 1884, adopted t? platform with this explicit declaration, falsified by every act of the party since: "The Re publican party pledges itself to correct the iuequ lilies of the tariff and to re duce the aarplus, by snoh methods as will relieve the taxpayer without injur ing the laborer or the great productive interests of the country." That is precisely what President , Clevi land proposes. The Rtpoblicnu Secretary of the Treasury of the last Republican Prt-si dent, in hiB report advising the appoint ment of a Tariff Commission, proposed "that the existing duties npon raw ma terials, which are to be used iu manu facture, should be removed," and "that the duties upou the articles used or con sumed by those who are the least able to bear the burden of taxation, should be reduced." Those pr< p isnls of Presi dent Cleveland, whioh will be the tar gets for the fieroest Republioau o iti cisniH in 1887, are identical iu substauoe, ilnost identioul iu langu ig?', with the advice of tbs highest Republican author ity in 1883. Mr. Cleveland has p'aced the issue iu a light that forbids the possibility of mistake. There will be no ohance of evas oo; the sarpl is will be rudaoed or it wi I not, and the party that shirks iis duty is lust. iONttH??aiOIllAL. Wa. HtNaroK, Deo. 7, IB87. The Seoretury of Ihe Treasury, in bin aunnil report submitted to Congress to , *ay. nay* that the torul ordinary re ceipts ot the government during the y.mr ending Jane 30, 1087, were 987l? 403,000, and that the total ordtua y ex peud lures were #315,835,000, leaving, with the amount drawn from tbo oash balance in tbe treasury of 934,455,000, u total surplus of 980,023^000, wbioh was offered for tl*e redeuipt'on ot bonds. T]te itoetida for the year show an in crease of 931,053,000 over the yeur be fore, and the expenditures show an in crrase of 935,410,000. For the present year Ihe revenues are estimated at 333,000,000, end the expen ditures at 9310,817,000, leaving an esti mated surplus of 968,182,000 on Jane 30, 1R88. The See etavy estimates the surplus for IU? year 188 f5V-?,000. Thu 8eoNtoij Mjn lb* argM?y of tka ques tion of the surploa revenues h ad great tbot it ehoiil.l demand the attentive of both executive branches of the govern meat. The Secretary mentions the following ways in which the receipts aad ex penditarea oi the government may be equalized: First. The purchase of the interest bearing debt of the gore ra me at. Second. Larger expenditures by the government for other purposes than the purchase of bonds, so (hat they shall each year equal the taxes of that year., Third. A reduction of the revenue irom taxation to the amount actually required to meet the neeeasary expens es. All of these expedients have in com mon the one merit of p; eventing a de rangement to business which must fol low the hoarding or locking up in the Ti-easury of the circulating medium of the people. A KhandleM Brute. ? . w 1, ; * The t>nmm heart revolts over the exhibitions of depruvily frequently en countered among society's outcasts, bat it is doubtful if anything in the lower strata sr"pusses in loathsomeness the dis.fusliug revelajioos that often oome from the higher social oircles. Here comes Dr. James 0. Shatter, who. in bis efforts to obtain a divorce from his wife, oharges her with criminal intei oonrse with himself before their mar riage. The depths of depravity fail to reveal aoything more cowardly, oon temptible aud revolting. The beast who would make a harlot of a git 1, marry her and then bold his own crime aud her weakness np to the g:'ze of the woild, is far too low for the subtleties of denunciation to reaoh. -[Saoramento Bee. ? ? ?
