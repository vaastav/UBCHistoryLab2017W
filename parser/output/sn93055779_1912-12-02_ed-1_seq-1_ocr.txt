MAN ARRESTED IN CAIRO Child Spirited Away Nino Days Later From. Chil dren's Home. Federal sleuths, keen of scent and very astute, are- searching for May Dunning, a girl aged 13, who was placed in the (Children's Home here jH Nov. 2 and was either spirueu away Nov. 11 from the institution by parties deeply Interested, or sho walked away on her own-accord, in preference to testifying in a case in which her Step father, John Bain bridgo alias Bill Holmes is defend ant. The particular charge upon which Bainbridge is awaiting trial in the Federal court is for "White Slavery." It is alleged that Bainbridge vio lated the Mann Act, in this particu lar instance, by taking his step daughter from Harrisburg, 111., to Bardwell, Ky., and thence to Cairo, for the purpose of having illicit rela tions with her. Bainbridge, it is charged, began hiB infamy at home at Harrisburg nearly a year ago, following the in carceration of his wil the child's mother, in an asylum for the Insane. Me Etole the girl from 'an aunt, with whom she was living, and fled to BardweJl, where he sought and ob tained work on the railroad as a sec tion hand. Me shortly camo to Cairo and wunt to work on the Big Four. He, and the child, boarded at 200 Washington avenue, he sleeping in a room alone and the child down stairs. It was upon his return from work each day that the child came to his room and submitted to his em braces. . Suspicion being aroused Nov. 2, jus? four days after the pair arrived in Cairo, the matter was reported to Piobation Officer Mrs. A. Comings, who called Chief Egan into requisi tion. The pair were arrested and taken tc headquarters, where the girl confessed tc all the details of '.ho horrible affair. Bainbridge gave an alias, but ad mitted that he came fiom Harris burg. The Ilavrisburg authorities were told of the arrest and they re quested that he be held for an officer as ho was then wanted to answer an indictment returned after Bainbridge had tied with the girl, charging rape under the age-of-eonsent act, the case referring to his actions with his step daughter, The deputy sheriff at Saline coun ty was granted custody of the man, and the child was immediately placed in ths Children's Homo. Nine days later, the child mysteriously disap peared during the noon hour and no trace of her has been found so far, although the Cairo police made active search for her immediately upon being informed of the disap pearance, but as the girl, and who ever aided her sequestration, had a full two hours start before she was missed no traces were found. From letters addressed to the girl while at the Home, it Is assumed that parties eeply interested in her dis appearance had a hand in her abduc tion following the arrest of her step father. Tim Federal authorities having been made acquainted with the facts in the premises and the grave nature of the charge against Bainbridge, made a demand on the Saline county authorities for the person of Bain bridge and he was surrendered to V. S. Deputy Marshal Odum. Ho was then placed in jail, either at Danville or Believille, to answer to the greater charge following a prelimi nary hearing before a U. S. commis sioner. May Dunning, the girl In the case, although exhibiting no semblance of incorrigibility, was very solicitlous regarding the possible punishment that would be meted out. to her un natural stepfather, pleading that the officers release himj She stated that Bainbridge had first outraged her when she was living with an aunt .(Concluded on Pago Eight.)
