The first few days of the KB- PUBLICAN'S great scholarship sub scription contest show results which indicate that there are u large number of young people in the county who want to go to school when they are given the opportunity and they are willing to work for their opportunity.

As Prrsi- dent Cornett expressed it , " 1 believe that this contest will bring in some of the best and most earnest and industrious young people in the county and they will be a credit to the school when they graduate. " No work is more commendable than that which leads to an education. The prizes offered to the win ners make an unusual inducement to the contestants and they arc taking the work up with energy and deteru.inatiou.

PHELPS A CROUP OF CUSTEk COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHO WILL BE NEXT SPEAKER OF HOUSE THE RGIIT FOR POSITION IN MAJORITY PARTY IS ON. PEOPLE GREATLY INTERESTED. A Number of Candidates Tor Spcakersliip Are Out And The Jobs To Ik Given Out In Ilic Democratic Caucus Are In Demand. ( Special to the RBI-UDUCAN. ) Lincoln , Nebr. , December 8 : The organisation of the house of representatives is always of arge interest to the people on he near approach of a session of hat body. This year the demo crats are in overwhelming con- rol and the fight for position in he organization is consequently confined to those representing Ihe majori'y party. The big iri.e of the speakershipis now as always the largest reward to be won , and Democratic patriots are not lacking who are fighting ootb and nail for this distinc tion. George W. Leidigh , of Otoe County , who has served in a pre vious session , has been spoken of in this connection , but it is given out in Lincolon that Mr. Leidigh refuses to consider the honor and will not be a candi date. Charles W Pool of Te- cuuiseh is making a valiant fight for the job , and as it is strongly intimated in informed circles that Charlie is the boy with some corporation backing , it is nol im possible that he may win out. Said a Johnson County Demo crat in Lincoln this week : "If Wagner GEORGE KELTNER The contestants have already begun work and two of them had close to 20,000 votes Wednesday morning. The detailed vote of each of the contestants will be announced next week when all have an opportunity to report. The early reports indicate that the four and five year subscrip tions will be numerous. The rate of fifty cenls a year mates the price of the REPUBLICAN for five years only one dollar to a dollar and one half more than the price of most of the other papers for one year. This cxtra-ordin ary low rate ought to enable the the contestants to get everyone they see to subscribe for one year and a-large per cent of the sub scriptions will be for four and five years. Charlie does'nt get it , it isn't be cause he does'nt want it or won't go alter it with both hands , Down in Johnson some of us re fer to Charlie by the pet name of 'Hungry Pool , ' inasmuch as Charlie's rule has always been to take and strive for any office in sight. Charlie is hungry and he will put up a fight that will make the rest sit up and take notice. " II. R. Ilenro , of Holt County , a former member , is also listed as an applicant for the speaker- ship honors and is said to be a strong nun personally and to have a strong hold with the Democratic , - ocratic party. Those Who know lim well expect him to win , and t will not be surprising if their > redictious turn out correctly. W. S. Shoemaker of Omaha is eported as a candidate for the peakership. It is understood hat he occupies a position of in- lepeudeucc and is lthis own cau- lidate. " Admiring friends do not deny that he will admit him self to be fully competent for the : > ! > . Looming up in the crowd ind with good chances of success s Member Henry Gerdes , of Falls City , an old member and said to be a strong man. Mr , Gerdes is strong with tuc farmer element and his friends are claiming the jacking of the fanners in the egislature for him. No census of occupations has as yet been taken , and it is not known yet the number of farmers represent ed in the present roll of the lionise , but , if it develops tnat they are in the majority , or near t , Mr. Gerties will be a formid able candidate for the speaker- ship honors. The official plums will , of course , be , as usual , divided through the medium of a demo cratic caucus , which will be held in advance of the meeting of the legislature. The minor positions within the gift of the house will no doubt be passed on in the caucus , but as yet there arc no public indications as to the lucky Democrats who will get the jobs. That there will not be enough jobs to go around is assured in advance , as the hundreds who have been asking for executive appointments from every section of this state and have necessarily been turned down , will no doubt move en masse on the legislature in the hope of receiving- few crumbs that fall from the Demo cratic table. The legislative pay roll bids fair , in consequence , to far exceed that of any previous session of the state law-makers. Jess Up Again. Petitions recommending Jesse Gandy for an appointment nre beings circulated. This time the petition recommends Jess for any position to which the gover nor may see fit { 3 appoint him. The petition is being signed by a good number of Republicans as well ni Democrats. Jess states that l.c is feeling happy and that he frclsoniihul of a good nppoinlmci The public schools of Broken Bow will close Friday December 18 for the for the Christmas vacation. The Christmas pro grams of all grades of the school will be given on the afternoon of the ISlh. The vacation will close January 4th. G.

BETTER THAT \YE SHOULD HAVE A THOUSAND TOWNS THAN ONE LARGE CITY , [ f a place is good enough for a man to make his money in , it certainly should he good enough for him to spend his money in. The merchants have a just right to all the business of the town in which they have ( heir stores , and every good citizen will help them to get it. " Did you ever see a FINE LARGE FACT so simply slated ? BRYAN'S PROGRAM is MUCH'IN DOUBT WILL HE WAN I ' 10 CARRY OUT DENVER - VER PLATFORM IN NEBRASKA. SHAlinNBERGfiR'S ASPIRATIONS Governor and Presidential Candidates A\ay \ Clash Over The Legislative Program as Ilotli arc Looking Toward the U. S. Senate "Lincoln , Dec. , 7.-r-\Vhat influ ence will Mr. Bryan exercise over the legislature of Nebraska this winter ? , is a burning- question of paramount interest to Democratic politicians of the state. Mr. Bryan is at present in the south recuperating- made a speech in Texas last week. Nobody knows for sure what his program lor Nebrabka is , but many demo crats think of the possibilities with fear and trembling. When Democrats get out from under the spell of Bryan's voice they begin to hesitate on many Bryan is sues and to "have their doubts. " That is about the condition of the ones today and the fear that Mr. Bryan will insist on making Nebraska an experiment station for the Denver platform is a re mark not unusual from Democrats who have visited Lincoln within the last two weeks. It is freely predicted that such an effort on Mr. Bryan's part will lead to an early clash with the new Demo cratic governor , who has some plans and ambitions of his own in which Mr. Bryan's future does not figure. As a plain fact oi current news it is not doubted at all that Mr. Bryan desires to be the candidate o * his parly for the bcnatorship at the close of Bur- kett term , and that very natural ly would "lay his pipes" during this Cession of Democratic legis lation. If he can control in spite of any opposition ollered by the new governor the people of the state may look to see a win tcr of legislation copied after the Denver platform so far as that document is in line with the pow ers of the state government. J. S. Cay wood missed a num ber of rings from his harness in the stable at his farm north of town on Monday morning. The harness was partly taken apart and the rings were gone.
