THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WINK, Editor 4 Proprietor. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1905. President RooseTell's Message. The Annual 'message of President Roose velt to the 59th Congress will be read bp millions today. Whatever the President writes is read, and generally approved.by the American people. This great docu ment will be no exception to the rule. Mr. Roosevelt speaks "straight from the ehoulder" en all questions that are alive in the United States today, and makes himself understood. There is no mluolng of matters in any manner, and Congress will have no trouble in discerning the needs of the country or "the state of the Union" after a perusal of this great state paper. The message entire will be iound on our first page today. The insurance investigations have shown that publicity is a good thing for the people. Some of the college boys would rather see the authorities let football alone and abolish some of the examinations. Am Indiana man has left his wife be cause she wouldn't talk. Some men never know when tbey have a treasure. Mk. Smoot has passed the million mark in the signatures of women asking for his exclusion from the Senate, but he is not bragging that he holds the record. The proposed Jap-English Nicaraguan ship canal has reached only the talking stage. Uncle Sam's -canal, on the con trary, is in a position where there is little more to say. The Japanese, the Chinese and even the Turks may be pardoned if, after rending our football returns for the sea son, they contemplate sending us a few missionaries. As we understand it, by asking the Presideut to take the tariff off of hides, Gov. Douglas, of Massachusetts, merely succeeded In getting the "hide" taken off bis friend Whitney. The 59th Congress which met Dec. 4th, in its first session, is destined to become a memorable one there is a man at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue who intends to see that it does something to the railroads, et al if it takes all summer. There were 1,017,670 votes cast at the recent State election, according to ofllcial returns. And :he result for State Treas urer was: Plummer, 458,6!)8; Berry, 646,892; Socialist, 10,390; Socialist Labor, 1.622; scattering, 86. Berry's plurality 88,194. The University of Pennsylvania has formulated a new set of rules to govern football, by which a penalty of twenty five yards is Inflicted for the deliberate injury of an opponent, and for willful murder a player is put out of the game for a whole day. Punxy Spirit. The death of Cl. Thomas O. Sample occurred at his home in Pittxburg on Sunday, 3d Inst., after an illness of eleven months from cancer of the stomach. In 1819 be was appointed superintendent of ini lil io printing of Pennsylvania by Gov ernor Stone. Col. Sample was one ot the best known Grand Army men in the State, and in 1894 was choson State de partment commander. Political managers of the various as pirations tor the nomination for govern or by next year's Republican state con vention are beginning to lay their plans for an active campaign. Among the most formidable aspirants for this office are Congressmen George F. Huff, of Greensburg Congressman E. F, Ache son, of Washington; ex-Judge Elliott Rodgors, of Pittsburg; Lieutenant Gov ernor Williom M. Brown, of New Castle; ex-Lieutenant Governor Louis A. Watres, of Scranton, and State Chairman Wesley R. Andrews. Although the American peoplo ex pend in re money upon the schools of the country than do the peoplo of any other nation, census figures show that the per centage of Illiteracy is greater in this country than that of Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark or Switzerland. One person out of ten in this country above the age of thirteen years is unable to read or write. The condition is due to the ad mission of ignorant immigrants and to the fact that almost one-half of the entire negro population is designated in census returns as lacking In common school ed ucation. The value of American farms has in creased at the rate of 1,400,000 each day for the past five years, aggregating a total Increase of 10,133,000,000 for that period. These are the figures given by Secretary Wilson, of the department of agriculture, in a report just issued. The corn crop exceeds all others in value, with hay, cotton and wheat following in the order named. An amazing item of the report is that which credits the crops with an aggregate value exceeding by $3,000,000 the capital invested in farm lands or a yield in excess of one hundred per cent. The American farmers conduct the most stupendous industry known in the his tory of the world. The state depaitinont of agriculture haajUBt sent out a special bulletin, call ing attention to the adulteration of feed ing stuffs with rice bulls and urging dealers to exercise caution. The bulletin says: Rico hulls are of very inferior valuo, containing nearly 40 per cent, of woody fibor and a largo amount of silica or sand. The ou'or surface of tho hull is harsh and rasping, whllo tho edges carry sharp projections which have a tendency to irritate the digestive tract of animals, and if fed in quantity, may cause tluir death. Rice hulls are, therefore, of little value as a food, detrimental to the health of farm afiimals mid sometimes even dangerous to their lives. So far, rice hulls have been found as adulterant of wheat bran only, but they may find their way into mixed feeds and standard goods. - Every dealer should be on his guard against this grossly fraudulent practice, and for the rake of his reputation, should refuse to handle rice hulls or any feed which ia adulterated with the same. Iu buying feeds from the manufacturer or jobber, the dealer should be sure that the amount of protein and fat is guaranteed, and also should demand a written guar antee I bat tbe material is not adulterated iu any manner. Every feed dealer in the state should value bis reputation. He ia responsible for selling adulterated good aud for any injurious effects caused by feeding materials which be bandies. Tub courts have recently passed upon the conflicting laws of this slate relative to compulsory school attendance. One act provides that children shall attend school within certain age limits; another prohibits attendance without a certificate of vaccination. Where a fine was im posed upon parents, by a justice of the peace, for a violation of the compulsory education act, notwithstanding evidence that the child had been refused admit tance because no certificate of vaccina tion was produced, the higher court de cided that the imposition of tbe fine was illegal. The parents hsd relieved them selves from liability to fine by Bending tbe child to school. Its exclusion by tbe teacher was a sufficient defense to the mandates of tbe compulsory law, and vaccination could not be enforced. Bull Pup for a Horse aud Buggy. Friday an individual who gave his name as William Connell appeared in Titusvllle and endeavored to get some residents of the city Interested in dog fight which he proposed to manage. In terest did not develope as expected and the man went to the livery stable of Pat rick Foy and said he bad arranged for a dog fight there. lie wished a rig to drive to the country to secure a dog. The man did not return Saturday or Sunday and tbe police were informed of the transaction. They succeeded in lo cating the rig at East Branch, Warren county, about ten miles north of tbe city. Monday Chief Buckley and Mr. Foy went out to East Branch and got tbe rig. Tbe driver bad left It under a cattle shed and the owner of the shed bad cared for the horse. Tbe man bad probably sold the robe and bought horse feed with tbe money received. He left with Mr. Foy a fiue specimen of a bull pup aged about 8 months, and the kioodle has been turned over to tbe city police force with tbe understanding that it will become a police dog. It has a pedigree a mile long and will be named "Foy" la honor of the donor. Herald. Noted Piano Recital. The following account of a piano re cital Is taken from tbe West Chester, Pa., Daily News, and bas referenoe to a young lady whose parents, Dr. and Mrs. T. D. Dunn, were former residents of Tionesta, whore they enjoyed the high esteem of a wide circle of acquaintances. Many of our people will recall tbe pleas ure of meetiog Misa Dunn on the occa sion of her visit to Tionesta last March when ebe accompanied her mother on tbe sad mission of the burial of Mrs. Ii M. Cobb, mother of Mrs. Dunn. Such portions of the account of the recital as will most interest our people, follow: "Miss Rachel M. Dunn, who last eve ning made bor first appearance on tbe concert stage, was welcomed by a large and enthusiastic audience in the Aasem bly Building. The many friends of her late lamented father, Dr. T. D. Dunn, and a number of tbe young people who had been schoolmates during ber child hood here, gave tbe yonng pianist a most cordial welcome on her retuin to ber na tive town and her programme was one which proved that the years of study have not been -spent in vain. Before leaving West Chester, Miss Dunn, as a pupil of Mr. William Hatton Green, evinced much talent and ber playing In pupil recitals bold at his home gave promise of better things to follow. That the promise is being fulfilled was proved by the close attention of the audience and by tbe spontaneous applause which fol lowed each selection. When Miss Dunn, wearing a simple costume of soft white material, and carrying a great bouquet of crimson roses, came npon the stage, the greeting from ber audience was a royal one. Her response was a graceful, though dignified acknowledgment of ber friends' good wishes, and with a slight bow she took ber place at the piano In a most un affected aud easy manner. Throughout tbe evening Miss Dunn used no notes, playing the most intricate passages with not the slightest hesitation and showing a wonderful power for memorizing. Her touch la delightfully clear-cut, elastic, sympathetic, with a singing quality that brings out the melody moat charmingly. In the tender passages it is as soft as velvet, but when force is required her chords are strong, clear and decisive. Most of her selections were of an ex tremely sad character; too sad to seem appropriate from a youug girl with a bright future before her, but in tbe tfo or three of an opposite character, she proved ber ability to throw off the sad mood and play irith brilliancy and ani mation. After each appearance Misa Dunn received soveral bouquets, and to two of her encores she responded with a second selection. "Tbe coming of Miss Dunn to West Chester to play last evening was In a sense significant, and most appropriate. It was on the twenty-second anniversary of her parents' wedding. It waa on Do nation day at the Chester County Hospi tal, an Institution founded largely through her father's efforts. It was for the bene fit of the AVentwortb, an Institution in the house where Miss Dunn spent the years of her childhood." ioo it i:va it i, 8ioo.

Among the notable whispering places of the world is the "Ear of Diony slus" of nncieut Syracuse. It is in the shape of a parabolic curve, ending in an elliptical ntvli, with sides par allel to Its axis, perfectly smooth nnd covered with n slight stalactlttc Incrus tation that renders its repercussions amazingly sonorous. It is 64 feet high, from 17 to 35 in breadth and 1S7 deep. It has an awful, and gloomy nppenr ance, which, with its singular shape, perhaps gave rise to the popular nnd amusing paradox that Dlonysius had it constructed for the confinement of those whom be deemed Inimical to his authority and that from the little apartment above be could bear all the conversation among the captives who were brought to the ancient town ot Syracuse In tho time of its splendor, when it was the largest In Sicily. Tho sound of words uttered with a low voice is augmented In vaults or gal leries so as to become audible at a con siderable distance from the spenker. A like effect takes place in a less de gree when sound ascends from the bot tom of a deep well or when words are uttered at one extremity of a long cor ridor or passage in a building. If a pin be dropped Into a well tho sound produced when it strikes the venter is distinctly heard nt the mouth or the sounds of words spoken near the sur face of any well is similarly augment ed.

Iu Egypt It represented Ilorus, the young or ris ing sun, iu a boat surmounted by stars, closely followed by Sirlus, which was shown as a eow. It has also been found sculptured on the walls of Thebes G,000 years ago. And on the men of that early time It shone down from the same position and with the same brightness as It does on us today,' a striking example of the unchauge ableuess of the heavens. From the days of the early Hindoos to the present the constellation has for some reason borne always a stormy character. Allusions to Its direful Influ ence are found everywhere among the classic writers. Thus Milton wrote: Whn with fierce winds Orion arrived Hath vexed the Red sea coast. The loss of the Roman squadron In the first Punic war was ascribed to the fleets having sailed just after the ris ing of Orion. The group has also been employed as a calendar slgu, Us morn ing rising ludlcnting the beginning of summer, Its midnight rising the season of grape gathering and Its early even ing rising the arrival of winter, with its attendant storms. In recent times the group has always represented a great hunter or warrior Its present title came into Greek astronomy from the Euphrates and originally signified the light of heaven.
