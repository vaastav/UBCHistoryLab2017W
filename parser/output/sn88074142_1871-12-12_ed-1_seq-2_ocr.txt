M ., hv tiniiiTo. J I Thk latest news from Uic prince of Wales, the heir to the British throne, is that he was lingering ou tho brink of death. Londou was excited, the Queen alarmed and terrified. Tho prince of Wales has five children, the oldest oi whom, Albert Victor Christian Edward, now nearly eight years of ago, will, in the event of his father's death, suc ceed to the throne under a regency. The Shawneetowu Mvreuri, tho or gan of radicalism in Gallatin county, disposes of the meeting of congress and the president's message, in the fol lowing brief terms : " Congress asscm ' bled on Monday. The president's ' luesingo is too lengthy for our col- minis." A lew words of flattery of the " able state paper" would have oc cupied but little space, and put tho Nrrcnrg in the fashion. Hr.S llVTI.i:il bn.M xipiilor Wii'iim and senator WiUon, but in order to gratify his dislike of tho latter, he sometime since announced his intention of piiHhiug tho claims of speaker Blaine for the vice-presidency. Sinco tho meeting of congress and the announce ment of tho committees, it is supposed that Jlutlcr doesn't dislike Wilson less but lilaiuu more, and therefore, that he will not now press tho speaker's claim to being second on the presidential ticket. This personal spite and ma neuvering is characteristic of the dough ty Ben. A Wahiunhto.v correspondent of a radical paper, ivhosc institicts appear to be on the side of honesty and decency, writes this . "The administration is ' now playing tho game of detaching ' some of the more unprincipled demo ' cram from auy schemes of compromise, ' and constituencies connected with the 4 late democratic party are warned that three or four of their members of con gress cat dinners at the white house, ' and share in the plunder here." This is a fair specimen of the inside work mgs of radicalism. A squabble for office and grabbing for spoils is the first principle, to which the leaders of the party prove themselves eminently faithful. We hope Grant's latest slice ulatiou, that of buying unprincipled democrats, will prove successful. The party can spare all such. Ohio radicals, who were pleased at the leliremcut of Murphy from the iflice of collector of New-York, ob ject to Grant's sugar-coated letter to the out-goiug favorite.
