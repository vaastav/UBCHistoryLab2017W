VICE PIIESIDKNT'S DEATH. To the Congress of the United Hmtf'/Vm,. issembling is oloudod by a sense oereavement, caused by tho rec 5 len death of Thomas A. president of the United StTTm*i.h°° yulshed public services tegrity and devotion t- 'J^L°J „t?pllo'to, \T personal virtues wi1' in his country's h' proofs of the OP lie was held /lTfU?.d manifesto" and hl® h°"ora™e rooor^ ory' Ample and repeated confldenco in which hls fellow countrymen wuro moat bv his oleotion to offices of the lira*' toportant trust and h'jrhcst u* 'Ti «nd at length, full of years -A honors, ho has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and veneration. The constitution which requires those chosen to legislate for the people to antmnlly meet •n the discharge of their solemn trust, also requires tho president to give to congress Information of tho state of the union, und recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall doom necessary and ex oedient at the threshold of a compliance with the constitutional directions. It is well for ns to bear in mtud that our usefulness to the peoples' interest will be promoted by a fiameBt appreciation of the scope and the character of our respective duties aa they relate to federal legislation while the ex scutivo may recommend such moasures as he ihall deem expedient, The responsibility for legislative actions must and should rc.it upon those selected by the peoplo to make them. 4 contemplation of tho grave and responsi ble functions assigned to the executive branches of tho government under the con ititution will disclose the partitions of power between our respective departments und their necessary independonce, nnd also the aeod for tho exercise of all tho power en trusted to each in that spirit of comity and :o-operation which is essential to the proper fulfillment of tiiti patriotic obligations which rest upon us as faithful servants of tho uoo plo. The Jealous watchfulness of .our con stituencies, groat and BThall, supplements their suffrages, and before tho tribunal thoy establish, every public servant should be judged. 

FOREIGN ItEr.ATlONS. -iSBsii THEY CONTINUE FKIEKBLY. It is gratifying to annoonco that tho relations the United States with all foreign powers con tinue to bo friendly. Our position, attor nearly »century of successful constitutional govern ment, the maintenance of good faith in all onr en gagements, the avoidance of complications with sther nations and consistent and amicable atti tude toward the strong and weak alike, furnish proof of a political disposition which rendcts profession of good will unneccesisnry. There are no questions of difficulty pending with any foroUm Bovornmont. the Argontine government has rovlved tho long Sormant question of the Falkland Islands by slaiming from the United States indemnity for their loss, attributed to tho action of tho com inander of the sloop-of-war Lexington in break ing np a practical colony of those islands in 1831, and their subsequent oocunation bv Great Britain. In view of the ample justification for the act «f the Lexington and the dlrolect condi tion of the islands before and alter their alleged Msoapation by Argentine colonUts, this govern nent considers the claim as wholly groundless. THE TH.T WITH AUSTCtlA. A question has arisen with the government of lustrio-Hnng&ry, touching tho representation of the United States at Vienna. Havinir, nnder my constitutional prerogative, appointed our tstlmable citizen of uidmpeaohed probity, and eompetence as minister at that oourt, tho gov ernment of Austrlo-llungary invited this gov ernmont to tulco cognizance of certain exceptions, based upon allegations against the per •onal acceptability of ,'Mr. Keiley, the ap pointed envoy, asking that, in view there of, the appointment should bo withdrawn. The reasons advanced were snch as could not bo •cqulexced in without violation of the oath of office and the precepts of the constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation in favor of foreign government npon the right of selection by the executive, and required such an applica tion of a relieious test as a qualification for nfflee under the United States as would havo resulted In the practical disfranchisement of a largo clans &f our oitlzens and the abandonment of a vital principle of onr government. The Austro-Htiu jarian government finally decided not to receive Mr. Kctlev as tho envoy of tho United States, and that gontloman has since re ilgned hiB commission, leaving tho post vacant. I have made no now nomination, and the intor sstB of this govornmont at Vienna are now in tho oare of tho secretary of legation, acting as charge ifaffaire.H ad Interim. Early in Maroh last war broke out In Central America, caused by tho attempt of Guatemala to consolidate tho •cveral statos into a Binglo government. In this eontost between our neighboring states tho United States forbore to interfere actively, but lent the aid of their friondly oflloes in depre cating cf war and to promote pcaoc and concord among the belligerents, and by such counsel contributed impartially to the restoration of tranquillity In that locality. THB PANAMA EPISODE. Emergencies growing out of civil war in the United Statos of Columbia demanded of tho Gov ernment at the beginninaof this administration the employment of an armed force to fulfill its guarantees under tho thirty-fifth article of the treaty of 1818. In order to keep the transit open across the Xsthmus of Panama. Desirous of ex ercising only the powers. expressly reserved to us by the treaty, and mindful of the riithts of Columbia, the forces tent to the Isth mus wore instructed to confine their aotion to "positively and efficaciously preventing tho transit and its accessories from being "interrupted or embarrassed." The exeoution of this delicate and respouslblc task necessarily involved police control where the local authority was temporarily pow rless, but always in aid of tho sovereignty of Colom bia. The prompt and successful fulfillment of its duty by this government was hiclily appre ciated by the government of Colombia, and has been followed by an expression of its satisfac tion. HlcU praise is due to the officers aud m»n engaged iu this service, the restoration of the peace on th» isthmus by tho re-establishment of the constituted government. These be ing thus accomplished, the forces of the United States were withdrawn. Pending these occurrences, a qnestlou of much importance was presented by decrees of tho Colombian government proclaiming the closure of certain ports, then in the hands of insurgents, and ft declaring vessels held by tho revolution ists to be piratical and liable to capturo by any power. To neither of these propositions could the United StateB assent. An effective closure of ports, not In tho possession of the government, hut held by hostile parti sans, could not be recognised neither could the vessels of lnsurgonts against tho legiti mate sovereignty be deemed hostes humane within the precepts of international law whatever might bo the definition and penalty of their acts under the municipal law of the state against whose authority they were in re volt. The denial by this government of the Co lombian propositions did not, however, imply the.admisslon of a belligerent status on the part of the insurgents. The Colombian government has expressed its willingness to negotiate con ventions for the adjustment bv arbitration of olalms by foreign citizens arising out of the destruction of tho city of Asplnwnll by the insurrectionary forces. THE KlC.UtAOUAK CA*AI» The interest of the United States in a practi cal transit for ships across the strip of land sep arating the Atlantic from the Paclflo has been repeatedly manifested during the last half-cen- My immediate predecessor-causod to be negotiated with Nicnraeua a treaty for tho con struction bX »nd at the solo cost of the United States of a canal throuKh Nlcuaiman territory and laid before the senate, pending the action of that body thereon- 1 withdrev the treaty for re-examlnatlon. Attentive consideration of its provislone leads me to withhold It from re-submission to the Benata Maintaining, as I do, the position of a line of p.' isidenta from Washington's day whioh pro scribes entangling alliances with forelm states, I do not favor a poller of acquisition of new and distant teitltory or the incorporation of remote interests with bur own. Laws of progress are vital and orginto, and wemust be consolous of that Irresistible tide of commercial expansion whloh, as the concomitant of our active civiliza tion, day by day is being urged onward to* those increasing fadl|tle» of production. I* f* WI ISfSPll HHIIl -«*!rt«tiOHiMid communication to \rbljJi aild electricity have given birth, llttt oilr duty in the prosent instructs us to ad it*ss ortrselves mainly to the development of the vast tesrmrccs cf this great area committed to crftr charge and the cultivation of the arts of pflS'cc within our borders through jealousy al^rt Ihiprovoutlnic the American hemisphere from tielnir involved in tho polltic.il problems and complications of distant governments thereon. I am unablo to recommuud propositions involv iiie paramount privileges of ownership or right outside of our own territory when coupled with absolute and unlimited engagements to defend tlio territorial integrity of tho state where such interests lie. While tho general prospect of connecting tlio *wo oceans by means of a canal is to he encour aged. I am of the opinion that any scheme to that end to be considered with favor Bhould be free from the features aJ'udcdto. TheTehuan tciMic route is declared liv encineers of highest repute and by competent scientific men to afford an entirely practicable transit for vessels and cargoes by meuus of a ship railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Tho obvious advau taces of such a route, if feasible, over others more remote from tho axial lines of traflic be tween Europe nnd tbe Pacific, and par ticularly between the valley of the Missis sippi and the -western coast of Noith and South America, are deserving of consideration. Whatever highway may be constructed across tho barrier dividing tho two greatest maritime areas of tho world must bo for the world's benefit, a trust for mankind to be removed from tho chanro of domination bv any single power nor become a point of invitation for hostilities or a prize for warlike ambition. An engagement combinlua tho construction, ownership and operation of such a work by this government with an offensive and dofenslve aillance for its protection with the foreign state whose respon sibilities and rights we would have, la, iu my Judgment, Inconsistent with such dedication lo universal and neutral nse, and would, moreover, entail measures for Its realization beyond the scope of our national policy or preBont means. Tho lapso of yoars has abundantly confirmed tho wisdom and foresight of these earlier admin istrations which long bofore the conditions of marltine intercourse were changed nnd enlirjred by tho progress of the aio, proclaimed the vital need of an inttroceanic route across tho Amer ican isthmus aud aonsccrated in advance to tho common use of mankind, by their positive dec larations and through tho formal obligation of treaties. Toward such realization tho efforts of my administration will be applied, ever bearing In mind the principles on which it must reel, and whioh were declared in uncertain tones by Mr. Cass who. while secretary of state in 1S5G, announced that "what the United States want In Central America, next to the happiness of the people is, tho security and neutrality of tho interooeanlo routes which lead through it." The construction of throe transcontinental lines of railway, nil in successful operation, wholly within our territory, and uuitinz the Atlantic aud tho Pacific oceans, has been accompanicd by resiittH of a most interesting and impressive nature and has created new conditions, not on tho routes of commerco only, but in political geography, which powerful!y affect our rela tions toward, and necessarily increase our Interests in any trans-isthmian route which may bo opened and employed for tho ends of peaeo and traflic, or, in other contingencies, for uso3 inimical lo both. Transportation is factor in the cost of coiuiuod' ities scarcely second to that of their produc tion. aud weighs as heavily upon tlio consumer. Our cxistcnco already has proven tho great Importance of having tho competition between land carriers and water carriers fully developed, cacu acting as protection to tho publio against tho tendencies or monopoly, whioh is inhorent in the consolidation of wealth and power in tho hands of vast corporations. Those suggestions may eorve to emphasize what I have already said" on the score of the necessity of a neutralization of any interoceanic transit, and this can only bo accomplished by making tho use of tho routo open to all nations and subject to tho ambitions and warliko necessities of none. Tho drawings and report of arcoent survey of tlio Nicaragua oanal routo made by Chief Engineer Menacal, will bo communicated for your infor mation.

CHINA. The harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained in the application of the acts lately passed to execute .the treaty of 1880—re strictive of the Immigration of Chinese laborers into tho United States. Individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond the power of the executive to remody, aud calling for Judicial determination Thocondltlon of the Chinese question in tho Western states and territories is, despite this restrictive legislation, far from being satis factory. Tho recent outbreak iu Wyoming Ter ritory, where numbers of unoffending Chinamen, indisputably within the protect ion of tho treaties and the law. were murdored by mob, and the still more rccent threatened outbreak of the same character. In Wasldngton Territory, are fresh in tho minds of all, and there is apprehen sion lest the bitterness of feeling against tho Mongolian race on tho Pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstrations. All tho power of this government should be ex erted to maintain tlio amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men, and the Inflexible sternness of the law In bringing tho wrongdoers to justice should be insisted upon. Every effort has been made by this government to prevent those violent outbreaks, aud to aid the representatives of China In their Investiga tion of those outrages, and it is but just to say that they are traceable to tho lawlessness of men, not citlzous of the United States, engaged In competition with Chlneso laborers. Kaoe prejudice Is the chief factor, exoeis in originating these disturbances, and Is in a large part of onr domain jeopardizing our domestic peace aud the good relationship wo strive to maintain with China Tho admitted right of a govornmont to prevent the influx of elements hostilo to its eternal poacc and security may uot be questioned oven whore there Is no treaty stipulation on the subject. That tho exclusion of Chinese labor Is domanded in other countries where like conditions prevail is strongly evinced in the dominion of Canada, where Chinese immigration is now regul lated by laws more exclusive than onr own. If existing laws arc Inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any* futher remedial measures within the treaty limits which tho wisdom of congress may devise. THE CONGO. The Independent State of Congo has been or ganized ass government, under the sovereignty of his majesty, the king of the Belgians, who assumes its chief magistracy hi his personal character only, without making the new state a dependency on Belgium. It is fortunate that a benighted region, owing all It has of quickening civilization to tho beneficienee and philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the advant age and security of his benevolent supervision. The actlan taken by this government last year in being tho first to recognize the flag of tlio In ternational Association of the Congo, has been followed by formal recognition of tho new na tionality which succeed* to its sovereign pow ors. A conference of delegates of the principal commercial nations was held nt Berlin last win ter td discuss methods whereby the Congo basin might lie kept open to the world's trado. Dele gates sttended on behalf of tho United Statos on the understanding that their part should be merely deliberative, without imparting to the results any binding character far as the United States were eoucsrned. This reserve was duo to tho indisposition of this government to share in any disposal by an inter national congress of jurisdictional questions In remote foreign territories. The results of tho conference were embodied In a formil act of the nature of an international convention, which laid claim to ocrtain obligations purporting to bo binding on tho signatories, subject to ratifica tion within one year. Notwithstanding tho reser vation under which the delegates of the United States attended, their signatures were attached to the general act in tho same manner as those of the plenipotentiaries of other governments, thus making the United States appear without reserve or qualification, assignatorles to joint International engagement imposing of the signers the conservation of tho territorial in tegrity of distant regions whero we have no established Interests or control. This govern ment does not, however, regard its reservation of liberty of action In tho premises as at all im paired and holding than an engagement to share iu tho obligation of enforcing neutrality in the remote valley of the Congo wonld be alliance whose responsibility we are not in a position to assume. I abstain from asking the sanc tion of tho senate to that general act. The correspondence will be laid before you, and the instructive and interesting report of tho agent sent by this government to the Congo oonntry, lishment. his recommendations forth on the ?e W 3 Odi&t, aro also SiUjmit'eii for vonr consideration. The commlrtion appointed by my predeeissor ast winter to visit the Central nud South Amer ean countries and report on the methods of en larging tho commercial relations of the United 8t«l»s therewith, has submitted reports which "will ho laid beforo rou. No opportunity has been Olilltted to testify tho friendlfnos* of this gov orunieat toward Corea, whoHi entrance Into the family of treaty powers tho Uni ted States -were tho fim to reco«niz?. I regard with favor the application made by the Corean Kovernmeut to ho allowed to employ American officers as military instructors, to which the assent of congress becomes neoonsary, and I nrn happy to suy this request haa the con current sanction of China and Japan. The ar reut and imprisonment of Julian S.mtous, a citizen of the United States, by tho authorities of Ecuador trove rise to a contention with that government, in which hts riffht to be released or to have a fair and impartial trial on announced chnrireK and with all uuaraatecs of defense stip ulated bv treaty was instated upon b- us. After elaborate correspondence and repeated and earnest representations on our part, Mr. Santous was, after au alleged trial and convu tiop, eventually included in a general decree of amnesty, aud pardoned by ths Kcua dorian executive aud released, leaving the ques tion, of his American citizenship denied by the Ecuadorian government, but instetcd upon by our own. Tho amount adjudged by tho late French aud American claim* commission to be due from tho United States to French claimants onaccouutof iujurie.s suffered by them during the war of aecc&dou having beeu ap propriated by the last congrcus, has been duly paid the French government. The act of Feb. 2.1, SS5. provided for a prelim inary search of the record.* of the French prize court for evidence boarlng on the claims of American citizens agaimt. Franco for spoliations committed prior to 1*01. The duty has boon performed, and thy report of the agent will bo laid beforo you. I regret to say that the restric tions upon the importation of our pork into trance, notwithstanding the abuudaut demon stration of the absence of sanitary danger in its nse, arc yet in force but I entertain strong hopes that, with the understanding of tho matter, this vexatious prohibition will be removed. It would be pleasing to be ably to j#ay as much with re spoct to Germany, Austria and othor countries, where such food products arc absolutely exclud ed, without present prospict of reasonable change. 

1UJLATT0N3 WITH OFiCfANY. The interpretation of onr existing treaties of naturalization by Germany during the past year has uttr,acted attention by reason of an apparent tendency on tho part of the imperial government to extend the scope of the residential restrictions to which returning naturalized clU?.:*ns of Ger man origin are asserted to be liable, under the law* of the empire. Tlio temperate aud just utti tuao taken by this government with regard to this class of questions will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding. The dispute of Ger many aud Spain relative to the denomination of ^arollne inlands has attracted th# attention of this government by reason of extensive inter ests of American citizens having grown up in theso parts during tho past thirty yearn, and be cause Luo question of ownership involves juris diction of matters effecting tho status of our citizens under civil and criminal law, whilst standing wholly aloof from tho proprietary issues raised between powers to both of whom States is friendly. Thi* government expt.cts that uothing in the present contention shall unfavorably affect our citizens currying on a peaceful commerce or there domiciled and has so informed the governments of S ain and Ger many.

CLAUSES of tho treaty of Washington in pursuance of tho joint resolution ot March 3. must have re su.ted in the abrupt cessation on the 1st of July of this year, in tho midst of th^i -ventures of the operat ons of citizons of tho United States on gaged in fishing in Uritlsh-Amcrican waters, but for a diplomatic understanding reached with her majesty government in June last, whereby as surance was obtained that no interruption of those operations should take place during the current fishing season. In tho interest of good neighborhood, of the commercial intercourse of adjacent communities, the question of the North American fisheries is one of much importance. rollowiug out the intimation given by m« when the extensorv arrangemoat above described was negotiated. I recommeud that tbe congress pro vido for the appointment of a commission in «!. I '9,LT'or,nr ',e.tlt ot tlle Unltcd THE ALABKA BOUNDARY. The frontier line botweeu Alaska and British Columbia, as defined by the treaty of cession with Russia, follows the debarkation assigned in a prior treaty between Great Britain and Russia. Modern exploration discloses that this aucient boundary is impracticable, is a geo graphical factor in tho unsettled condition of tho region. Tho question has lacked impor tance, but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the Hue is supposed to traverse, ad monishes that tho time has come when an ac curate knowledge of the boundary is needful to avert Jurisdictional complications. I retsom mend, therefore, that provision be made for a preliminary reconnoissanee bv ofilcers of the United States to the end of acquiring more pre cise information on the subject. I have invited her majesty's government to consider with us the adoption of a more convenient line to be established by modern observations or bv knowu geographic features without the neces sity of a:i expensive survey of the wholo. The late insurrectionary movements in Havti having been quelled, tho government of tha» republlo has made prompt provision for adjudi cating the losses suffered by foreigners because of hostilities there, and tho claims of certain citizens of the United States will bo in this manner determined. ho long ponding claims of two cH of the United States, Relletaer and Mhave been disposed of by arbitration, ai.u u.i award of two claimants has beeu made which by the term* of the engagement is final.

RKT.ATION-J WITH MEXICO continue most cordial, as befits those of neigh bors between whom the slrongest ties of friend ship and commercial intimacy exist, as the nat ural and growing consequence of our institu tions and geographical propinquity. The relo cation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, eastward of tin? Rio Graude under the convention of July 29, 18S2, has be#»u unavoidably delayed but I apprehend no diffi culty In socurlng a prolongation of the p»r'od for its accomplishment. Tho Jatelv concluded commercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the stipulated legislation to carry its provisions into efTect, for which ono years additional tune has been secured bv a supple mentary article, signed in February Bince I W rectified on both sides. As this convention, so important to the com mercial welfare of th« two adjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty making-branch, I wish to express the hope that tho legislation needed to make It effective may not long bo delayed. Tho largo influx of capital and enterprise from the United States continues to aid in the development of the resources aud in augmenting the mutual well-being of our sister republic. Lines of rail way, penetrating to tho heart aud capital of the country, bring tho two peoplo into mutual bene ficial intercourse, and the enlargod facilities of transit are an aid to profitable commcrce, create pew markets and furnish avenues to otherwise isolated communities.

PRINCIPLE or ARBITRATION. It Is gratifying to revert to the cordiality of our intercourse with Hpaln. The long-pending claim of the owners of the ship Unmasonio for loss suffered through the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities in the Philippine Mauds has been adjusted by arbitration ami au indem nity award The principle of arbitration in such cases, to which the United Statos have Jong and constantly adhered, thus receives a fresh and gratifying confirmation. Other question* with opain have been disposed of, or are under diplo matic consideration, with a view to just on honorable settlement. The ojwr.itIon of the commercial agreement with Sjmiu of Jan. 2 nnd reb. 1.1, 1SH-1. has been found inadequate to the commercial needs of tlie United States and the bpauish Antilles, aud t) t?rms of the agree inent are subjected to eonrtlc ing interpretations iu those islands.

While :h to is question as to the suilleienoy ot the noticc of termination given, yet as the commercial rights ot our citizens in Turkey come under the fav ored uational guarantees of the prior treaty of ISJO. and as equal treatment is admitted by the parties, no inc inveuience can result from the jissent of this government to tho revision of tho Ottoman tariff in which the treaty powers have been invited to join. QuesMons e'.mccrniug our citizvn* in lurkey may be affected by tho porte's non-acquiescence in the right of expatriation and by the imposition of relieious tests as a con dition of residence, in whi0j this government Cannot concur. The United Slates inuH hold iu thoir intercoms? with every power, I bat the sta tus.pi their citizens is to be respited and equal civil privileges accorded to them without regard to creed, and a.fceted by no considerations save thoso growing cut of domiciliary return to tho i? orhrmwl alleghueo or of unfulfilP-d personal obligation wisich may survive u-nder municipal laws aitor such return. The negotia ons with Venezuela relative to the rehearing of the awarus of the mixed commission cousticuted under tho treaty ot was resumed iu view oi tuerecent acquiescence of the Venezuelan oti voy in the principal point advanced bv this gov ernment, that the effects ot the old treaty would only be sot aside by the oj»eration of a new convention, a result in substantial aecord advisory suggestions contained in tho joint resolution of March II. iss: has been agreed upon and will shortly' ho submitted to 'the senate for ratification. Under section J(5,9 of tho revised statutes, all funds held in trust by tho United States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty of the bulled States, bear a rate of interest not less than 0 per cent per annum. There being now no procurable stocks paying so high a rate of inter ^tker of the statute is at present inap plicable, but its spirit is subserved by continu ing to make investments of the natt re iu cur rent stocks bearing the highest rato of interest now paid. The statute, however, makes no pro vision tor tho disposal of such accretions, it being contrary to the general rule of this gov ernment to allow interest on claims. I recom mend tlie repeal of the provision in question, and the disposition under uniform rule of tho prosent accumulations from investment of trust' funds, ihe inadequacy of existing legislation touching citizenship and naturalization demands your consideration. No statutory provision exists providing means for renouncing citizen ship by an American, native born or naturalized nor for terminating ana vacating au improper acquisition of citizenship—even a fraudulent decree of naturalization cannot now bs can- privilege and franchise ot American citizenship should bo granted with care, and extended to those only who intend in good fa.-h to assume its duties and responsibilities when attaining its privileges and benefits. It should bo withheld from those who merely go throu-h the forms of naturalization with the intent 'of escaping the duties of their original allegiance without takiug upon themselves those of their new status, or who may acquire the rights of American eUzenship for no other than a hostile purpose toward their original governments. hese evils have had many flagrant illustrations. I regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors that provision niav bo made for a central bureau of record of the de crees of naturalization granted bv the various courts throughout tho United States now invested with that power. The rights which spring from domicile in the United States especially when coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are worthy of definition by statute. The stranger coming hero with intent to remain, establishingliis lesideuce iu our midst, contributing to tiie general wel fare, aud by his voluntary act declaring his pur pose to assume the responsibilities of citizen ship, thereby gains inchoate status which legis lation may properly define. Tiie laws of certain states and territories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree whioh places him in the anomalous position o? being a citizen of a state and yet not of the United States. Within the purview of federal and international law. it is important within the scope of national le" isJation to define this right of alien domicile us distinguished from federal naturalization* 

JNTEKNATION'A INTEIICOURSn. Tho commercial relations ot the United Slatci with their immediate neighbors nml win. im portant areas of traffic near our shores su""tst opeMally liljoral intercourse between them aiifl us. Following the treaty of 1SS3, with Mexico, V.-Mch rested on the basis ot a reciprocal ex emption from customs duties other,similar trea ties were initiated by mv predecessor It"coir nizlni the need of less obstructed traffic with Cuba and Ports Kico. and met bv the desire of hpain io succor languishing interests in the Antilles, steps were taken to attain these ends by a treaty of commcrce. similnr treaty vras afterward signed by tho Dominican republic Subsequently overtures wero inado by Irr-r Uritanuic majesty's eoyernmont for a likt mutual extension of commercial in'.i rcoiirsewlth the British West Indian aud South American de pendencies, but without result. On tnktne olitcc I withdrew lor rc-examinatlon the treaties Slimed with Spain and Santo Domlnsn. then pendimr before the senate. The result has hern to satisfy ine of the inexpediency of en'erlni uto encasements of this character nut covcrine the entire traffic. These treaties contemplated tho surrender by the United States ol lart-e revenues for ir.adeiiuateconsiileration upon su-ar alone. Duties were surrendered loan amo'int far exceeding all the advantaaes offered in ex change. Even were it lutended to relievo our consumers. It wan evident that solonaas tho exemption but partially covered our Importation such relief would bo illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essential seemed highly improvident at a time when new and large drains upon the treasury were contemplated. Moreover c-nibarras ing questions would havo arisen under the favor ed nation clauses of treaties with other nations. As further objection, it is evident that tariff reg ulation by treaty diminished that independent control over its own revenues which is essential for the safety and welfare of any government. Emergency calling for an increase of taxation may at any time arise, and uo engagement with a foreign powor suouhl exist to hamper the ac tion of tho government. Bv the fourteenth sec tion of the shipping act, approved June 20, c-Ttain reductions and contingont exemp tions from tonuage dues were m--.de as to vessels entering ports of the United States from any foreign port in North and Central America, the west India islands, tiie Bahamas and Bermudas, Mexico and the isthmus as far as Aspinwall and Panama. Tho governments of Belgium, Denmark Germany. Portugal, and Sweden and Norway have asserted under the favored uxtlou clause in their treaties with the United States a claim to like treatment in respect to vessels coining to the Ignited States from their home ports. This government, however, holds that the privileges granted by the act aro purely geographical, enuring to any vessel of any foreign power that maychooso to eugage in traffic between this country and any port within the defined zono and no warrant exists under the most favored nation clause for the extension of the privi leges in question to vessels sailing to this coun try from ports outside the limitation of the act. undoubtedly tho relation* of commerce with our near neighbors whoso territories form so large a frontier lino difficult- to be guarded, and who find iu our country ami equally offer to use national markets, demand spocial and considerate treat ment. It rests with congress to considei what actiou may increase facilities of intercourse which contiguity makes natural and desira ble. I earnestly urge that congress recast the appropriations for the maintenance of tho DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAU SERVICE on a footing commensurate with the importance of our national interests. At every post where a representative is necessary the salary should be so graded as to permit the incumbent to live with comfort. With the assignment of adequate salaries, the so-called notarial extra official fees, which out officers abroad are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites, should bo dono away with. Every act requiring the certifica tion and seal of tho officers should he taxable at set schedule rates and tbe fee therefor returned to tho treasury. By restoring these revenues to the publio nse the cousular servico would be self-snstainlng, even with a liberal increase of the present low sa'.arles. In further prevention of abuses, a system of cousular inspection should be instituted. 'Jhe appointment of a limited number ot secretaries of location at Pll*

The fact that our revenues are iu excess of tho actual needs of the government, justifies a duction in the amount exacted from the people ,C°,nJc.rcVP° for its snpport. Our government is but the means, established by the will of a free people, by which I ?Jfi mS ncyi a dustries and interests which encouraged by suoh laws, and in Citizens havo large investments, our should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed, should also deal with the subject In such a I h' ',r'^eet tll( ,il1 !'»rc«ta manner 1, Its stability and proper remuneration fiTrulsh the most- justifiable pretext for a protective poilcj. Within these limitations a certain re duction should be made on our customs revenue. Iho amount of such reduction having beet* de termined. the inquiry follows whero can it best be remitted and what articles can best be re leased from duty in the luterest of our citizens'' I think the reduction should be made in tho rev euuo derived from a tax upon the imported nec essarles of 1 fc. Wo thus directly lessen tho cost of living in every family of the land s»»d re lease to tho peoplo in every humble me a larger meaiure of tho rewards of iruica.1 in dustry. THE IUyKS. During tho year ended Nov. 1, 1885, 145 na tional banks were orgnuizod, with an aggregate capital of $10,938,000, and circulating notes havo been issued to them amouutiug to 274, 010. The wholo number of these banks in es sence on the day above mentioned was 2,727 Ihe vary limited amount of circulating notes issued by our uational banks compared with the amount the law permits them to issue, upon a deposit of bonds for their redemption, indicates that the volume of our circulating medium may lie largely Increased through this instru mentality. Nothing more important than tho present condition of oc.r currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since February. 1878 the government has, under tha^mnulsoL'v.nm- tip to the present date, 215 759, 4 HI silver dollars have boen coined. A reasonable appreciation of a delegation oi powvr to the general government would limit iti exercise without express restrictive words to th people's needs aud the requirements of the pub lic welfare. Upon this theory the authority te "loan money," as given to congress by the con stitution, if it. permits the purchase by the gov ernment of bullion for coiuagc in any event, 1 I deem it expedient that a wen-devise.i measuro for the re-otg-mlzation of til*' ext nv t-rrliorial ciurts in Oriental countries shou:d ropl-»o) tue present system, wulch labors nnd the disis-t vautago of combining judicial .j-id executive lunctious in the same office. In several Oriental countries generous offers have been tnuJo of h'u.- ig tiie legations of tho United States. A grant of land for that purjose whs made kodio years since bv Japan, and has been retorted to iu tbo annual messages of my predecessors. Too Slum government has made a girt to docs not justify such purchase and coinagei tc the extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium. The desire tc utilize tho silver product of tho country should not lead to a misuse, or the perversion of this power. Tho necessity for such an addition tc the silver currency of tho nation as is com pelled by 

TIIE SILVER COrNAOK ACT, Is negatived by the tact, that up to the present time only about fifty millions of silver dollars so coined have actually found their way into cir culation, leaving more than $lG5,)00,(K)Uin pos session ot the government, the custody ol whioh has entailed a considerable expense for the eonstpte'.ien of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstand ing silver certificates amounting to about our roprvscutaMve ooo.ouo. Kveiy month $,J,00(»,000 ot gold iu the publie treasury prepaid out lor $2,000,000 or more of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued loug enough this operation will result, in the substi tution of silver for all the gold the government cwus applicable to its general purposes. It will uot do to rely upon the customs receipts of the government to nui! good this drain of gold, be cause the silver coined having been made legal tender for all debts ami dues, public and pri vate, at times during the last six mouths, 58 pel-cent of the receipts for duties have been in silver or silver eer.ilicates, while the average within that perir.d lias been 20 per cent. The proj-ort Ion of sliveraiid its certificates re ceived by the government will jcobablv increase S time gees on, for the asou that the nearer tie period approaches when it. will be obliged to UYer silver in payment of its obligations, the greater inducement these will be to hoard gold against depreciation in the value of silver ?md for the purpose ot speculating. This hoarding of gold ha already begun. Wh-.m the time comes that gold has been withdrawn from eireultlten. 41 .2 .i .... .... .. ........ biiuv .(11^ i/\. I.U ti iu uu it ti iiimi HI u, unsmorat.m .he advisability of alM^i.ddng tiie then will be apparent the difference between the discrimination made by the tariff laws in favor the works ot America's artists. Tin odium of the policy which subject to a high rate of duty the paintings o: foreign artists, and cx.-mpts the production of American artists residing abroad and who receive gratuitously advantage and instruction, recoils upon our citizens cn gagsd in art culture in Muvope, and has caused .vvit*1 W'uctieal unanimity to favor the about,ou of such an ungracious dis tinction and in thoir interest, and for other obvious real value of a rdiva- dollar ami a dollar iu gold, and tiie two coins will part company. Oold still the standard of value and uecessarv iu tmr deallugs with other countries will beats premium over silver. Jtanks which havo substi tuted gold Jor the deposits of their customers, may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome profit. Jiich speculators will s«:il their hoarded gold to their neighbors, who heed it to liquidate their foreign debts, at ruinous premiums over silver, »ud the reasons, 1 strongly recommend labming men and women of the land, most de I fenseless of all, will find that the d-dlar received for the wages of their toil has been aadly -hrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary and that ultimately tho orice oi labor will be adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place the wage worker cauuot possible gain, but must inevita bly loose since the price he is compelled to pay for his living will not only be measured ink com heavily depreciated and tinetuatmg and uncertain in Us value but this uncertainty iu the value of th purchasing medium will be UK,'le ll!C Pr'-toxt for an ad\ance in prices be- yond that justified by act tin! depreciation. Tiie words uttered l.s.'M oy Panic! Webster, in tho senate of the United States, are true to-day: "The very man of alt others who has tho deep est interest in a sound currency, and who suffers most from mischievous legislation in money matters, is the man who earns his dailv bread by his daily toil." Tiie most distinguished advocato of bimetal lism, discussing our silver coinage, has lately writ leu: "No American citizen had felt iheseu feation of cheapness, cither in receiving or ex pending the silver ac: dollars," and those who I lire by labor or legitimate trade, never will leel that sensation of cheapness. However plenty silver dollars may become, they will not be dis tributed as gifts anv ug the people, and if the I laboring man should receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but two, he will pay iu the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pays lor all the necessaries and comforts of life." Those who do not fear any disastrous consequences arising from the con tinned compulsory cduage of silver as now directed by law, ami who suppose that tho addition to the currency of the country, in- 1 tended as iu result, will be a public benefit, are reminded that lust-ivy demonstrates that the point j-scas.lv reached in i8 ta c,,,RPul»frily 21,404.322 2.95 *579,5--o 053 ^0 I/"W 'JC.CIU.'siKI DO 10.550,027 00 Total $022,S22,370 SO The following are given as prominent articles or import duiiugthe year, with their values and the percentage they bear to tho total imnorip tion: the uHcmot to float at tho same time two sorts or mouev of different excellence, when tho better wilt cease to be in circulation. Thehoaiding of gold which has already taken plice indicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases. So if this .silver coinage be continued we tnav reasonably expect that, gold aud its equivalent will abandon th** iield of circulation to silver alone. his, of course, must produce a severe contraction of cur circulating medium instead of adding to It. It wiit uot be disputed that any attempt on the part of the government 'o cause the circulation of silver dollars wor:h -O cents side by side with gold dollars worth loo cents. even with the limit that legislation d' not run counter to laws of trade, to be suor(ssful. must be seconded by the coutidence of the people that both coins will retain iheir siaie purchasing power and be interchangeable at will. Special eftort has been made by tlu secretary of the treasury lo increase the amount of our silver coin in circulation, but the fact that a largo share of the limited nm-mut thus put out has returned to the public treasury in pavment of duties leads to the odief that the people do not now desire to keep it in hand: and this with the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspicion that there already exists a lack of coniidouce among the people touching our liuancial processes Ihere is certainly uot enough silver now in cir euUtion to cause uneasiness, and the wholo amount coined and now on hand might, after a time, be absorbed by the people without appre hcuslon. But it 1s the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the laud which causes fear and uncertainty. What lias been thus far sub mitted upon this subject xelaren -ilmost entirely ^:»m?raU0lIS njiure, unconnected with the bearing which the policies of other na tion have upon the question. But it is per fectiy apparent that a line of action in regard to our currency cannot wisely be settled upon or persisted in without considering the attitude of the subject of other countries with hum we maintain Intercourse through commerce, trade and travel An acknowledxmi'nt ol' this fact Is found in the act br virtue of which our silver I coined.
