SAINT PAUL GLOBE. EVE OF GOfIGRESS WASHINGTON ALX, ASTIR FOR THE OrEMNG OF THE SESSION TODAY. HANNA IS THE BIG FIGURE ATTRACTING MORE ATTENTION THAN ANY QUESTIONS OF STATE POLICIES. EXTRA SESSION IS EXPECTED. Sentiment ApiiiuM the Dlngley Bill — Forecast of the Session's Work. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— That to night was the eve of a new session of congress was apparent in the Wash ington hotels which are always barom eters of political activity under the dome. Senators and members coming to the city by every train, who are re inforced by the ataches and lookers on of congress, were drifting into the lobbies, greeting one another like schoolboys after a vacation; with much handshaking, with reminiscences of the campaign and many explanations of how their re-elections or defeats had been brought about. There was com paratively small interest in the work of the coming session itself, apart from the president's message, but clouds of speculation were afloat deal ing with the policies of the new admin istration to be inaugurated on the 4th of March, and with the personnel of the cabinet. It was unanimously con ceded that the Republican programme was to ignore the Dingley tariff bill and to summon an extra session of the Fifty-fifth congress for the 15th of March for the purpose of passing a new tariff measure, so these features of the situation which have absorbed the attention Qt politicians recently had ceased to be of interest. Curiosity was expressed over what reference, If any, President Cleveland might make to the issues and results of the presidential campaign, and par ticularly as to his policy upon the Cuban question. 

HANNA IS WATCHED. The central figure of the night was Marcus Hanna, who is looked upon here as the advance agent of the Mc- Kinley administration, with a commis sion to feel the pulse of congress and to communicate the policy of the presi dent-elect to the leaders. When Mr. Hanna appeared in the Arlington lob by, after his dinner, accompanied by H. C. Payne, of Wisconsin, who is slated as a cabinet probability; J. C. Dawes. of Chicago, a member of the Republican committee, and Gen. Ho "race Porter, the marshal of the inau guration parade, the party was sur rounded by congressmen and other politicians, who escorted them to Mr. Hanna's room. The Republican chair man had been invisible during the day, trying to put aside politics for a Sun day, he explained, but throughout the evening he was beset by visitors. Some of the most conspicuous men about the hotel, most of whom talked with Mr. Hanna during the evening, were Sena tors Platt. of Connecticut, and Aldrich, of Rhode Island; Chairman Babcock and Vice. Chairman Mercer, of the con gressional campaign committee; Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio; Congressmen Lacey, of Ohio; Gillet, McCor mack and Wilson, of New York; Foss, Belknap and Larimer, of Illinois; Chairman Cannon, of the committee of appropriations of the house, and "Deacon" S. V. White, the New York financier, who served a term in con gress, and seldom fails to attend the opening of a session. With most of his callers Mr. Hanna did much listening and little talking. The chief purpose of his visit is to make preliminary ar rangements for the inauguration cere monies, and was dropped over Sunday, and the local politicians interested in the matter were not in evidence. Mr. Hanna had breakfasted late with ex- Congressman Benjamin Butterworth, of- Ohio, and W. W. Dudley, former commissioner of pensions, and had spent the afternoon driving with Senators Sherman and Proctor. Re garding the position of chairman of the INAUGURATION COMMITTEE, which has been tendered to S. W. Woodward, a prominent business man of the city, Mr. Payne said: "Mr. Woodward will give definite answer to morrow. He fears the duties of the position would take more time than he could spare from his business. He has talked with others who have been con nected with inauguration committees who tell him he would be obliged to devote two-thirds of his time this winter to the work. Mr. Payne said emphatically that Mr. Woodward's hesitation was not inspired by the ob jections made against him by local Re publicans on the ground that he is a gold Democrat. Mr. Woodward will give a definite reply tomorrow. The visit to Washington of Mr. Dawes, of Chicago, is said to be connected with the proposition to maintain perma nent Republican headquarters at the capital, which will be discussed while Mr. Hanna is here. Chairman Babcock, of the congres sional committee, was non-commital when asked- whether his organization would join with the national committee in the preject, saying that the matter would have to be discussed by the com mittee. Interest in the affairs of the Hawaiian republic has been rekindled by the din ner which was given Saturday night by ex-Secretary of State John W. Fos ter, to Mr. Hanna. The guests who numbered a dozen, included the Ha waiian minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Cooper, who is in the city; Minister Hatch and Secretary Hastings, of the Hawaiian legation, and a half dozen members of the senate committee on relations, among them Senators Mor gan, Hale and Lodge, who are advo cates of annexation. It is believed the movement for annexation is to be brought forward again with the ad vent of the next administration and it is likely to be one of the leading ques tions with which President McKinley and the Fifty-fifth congress will have to deal. 

MICH FOR SENATE TO DO. Cuba, Hawaii and Appropriations Will Receive Attention. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— Vice Presi dent Stevenson, who is now in the city, will call the senate to order at noon tomorrow. The first day of the session will be devoted almost entirely to receiving the president's message, provided it is sent in that day, as it is generally conceded it will be. Imme diately after the opening prayer, com mittees will be appointed to notify the president and the house of repre sentatives that the senate is organized and ready to receive communications and proceed with business. The senate will then, in all probability, take a re cess until it becomes known whether the president will send his message in that day. If precedents are followed, 

MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1896. there will be an adjournment soon after the receipt of the message. The first week of the session is not expected to be productive of important results in a legislative way. There are many senators who think that but lit tle or nothing should be done beyond the passage of the appropriation bills at this session, and as these measures necessarily originate in the house.there will be a disposition to postpone the season of activity until some of these bills can be received from the other end of the capitol. The probabilities are that the daily sessions at the beginning will be comparatively brief, and that the senate will content itself with four days'j.work each week. The calendar presents a wide range of material for consideration in case the senate shows a disposition to busy itself. In this is included the immigra tion bill, which is the "unfinished busi ness;" the Pacific railroad refunding bill, the statehood bills and the Ding ley tariff and bond bills, as well as the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Senators Lodge and Chandler have announced their determination to press the immigration bill to a vote as speed ily as they can. It will be the first regular business to be taken up, and cannot be displaced except by vote or unanimous consent. They hope to get the bill through before the holidays. It is also possible that the president's message may suggest subjects for speeches, and there are those who pre dict that the Cuban question will re ceive vigorous attention from the be ginning of the session. It is generally agreed that the Re publicans will hold a caucus to deter mine upon a line of policy, especially with reference to the tariff, and until after the exchange of views which this conference will permit no step is likely to be taken which will commit the party to any position on any question of political significance. The opening week promises to se_e the house put its shoulder to the wheel of the regular appropriation bills. Chair man Cannon and the committee on ap propriations were at work all last week and it is their earnest intention to pass two, and possibly three, of the bills before the Christmas holidays. The pension and legislative appropriation bills are about ready, and work on one or the other of these will be begun in the house before the week closes. The pension bill, although it carries a larger amount of money than any of the other supply bills, is very brief, and unless some political discussion is precipitated, is not likely to consume much time in its consideration. Be yond these two bills, nothing is in sight at present. It is, of course, not unlike ly that the committee on rules will pro vide something for the house to do in case the committee on appropriations is not prepared to go ahead with either of these appropriation bills. The course of the legislation, so far as the impor tant measures on the calendar are con cerned (like the Pacific railroad fund ing bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, etc.), will be determined entirely by the rules committee. But it is safe "to as sume that nothing will be allowed to block the appropriation bills, as they are reported for action. They always have the right of way at the short ses sion. Tomorrow, the opening day, will probably be devoted entirely to the reading of the president's message. 9,uiet Sunday for McKinley. 

CANTON, 0., Dec. 6.— Except for a short drive this morning about the city. Major and Mrs. McKinley did not leave the house today. The major had intended to go to church as usual, but was detained by a num ber of callers about the hour of service. Col. and Mrs. Myron T. Herrick, of Cleveland, came down on the morning train, spent the day at the house and will remain until to morrow. A number of people passing through Canton stopped over between trains to greet the president-elect and wife. SLOWLY PASSING AWAY. John R. Fellows Realizes That His End Is Xear. NEW YORK, Dec. 6.— Though the general condition of District Attorney Fellows is unchanged, he is gradu ally growing weaker and sinking slow ly. He still remains in the semi-coma tose condition that has marked his illness since last Friday. Late today, Harry Fellows, son of the district at torney, told the reporters who called at the house that his father's condition remained unchanged. However, he JOHN R. FELLOWS. passed a restless night and it is be lieved that he is gradually losing strength. His physicians. Doctors Fleming and Redenstein, remained with him throughout the night. Col. Fellows is still alive, but sinking. At 10 o'clock Dr. Rodenstein left his house and said: Mr. Fellows is sink ing very rapidly. He is very weak, but his wonderful vitality will prob ably keep him alive until morning. He is conscious and rational, but occas ionally lapses into coma, from which, however, he recovers quickly." Just before midnight, Col. Fellows, realiz ing that his end was near, summoned all the members of his family to his bedside. Mrs. Fellows, her two daughters, and Harry Fel lows, the youngest son, gathered' around Col. Fellows, who bade each in turn an affectionate farewell. John W. Fellows Jr. was the only member of the family absent. He is expected to arrive on Monday afternoon. CINCINNATI, 0., Dec. 6. — Gov. Bradley, of Kentucky, is still here in charge of Dr. Max Thorner. Two operations were performed yesterday, and the patient rested well today, but up to tonight the physician denied all callers access to the governor. On ac count of his throat troubles he cannot talk, but it is believed that he will soon recover. DUBUQUE, 10., Dec. 6.— Senator Al lison has been seriously ill at his home here for more than a week, but is re ported somewhat better today. He will not be able to leave for Washington for a week or ten days. PLAINFIELD, N. J.. Dec. 6.— The condition of ex-Congressman Rosewell G. Horr, formerly of Michigan, now of this city, who is ill, was much Im proved today. No complications of a serious order have as yet appeared and the family and physicians believe Mr. Horr will recover. NEW YORK, Dec. 6.-Gen. Franz Sigel who has been ill from pleurisy during the past two weeks, has been pronounced out of danger by attending physicians. Troops for Weyler. HAVANA, Dec. 6.— The steamers Cataluna and Isle de Panaya, having on board 2,550 soldiers, have arrived here. WITH PSASA ORE ROCKE-TEIXER WIM. GO INTO THE MAXIFACTI'BE OF STEEL. EX TENSIVELY. SCHEME IS A GIGANTIC ONE. ROLLING MILLS COSTING 910.000, -000 TO BE ESTABLISHED AT CHICAGO. AN EFFORT TO DOWN CARNEGIE. Project Is Sure to Bring; On a Pretty Fight With the Steel Com bine. CHICAGO, Dec. 6.— A morning paper makes the following announcement: "John D. Rockefeller is seeking to outdo Andrew Carnegie as an iron king and has plans already matured and about to be carried out, aiming at that MRS. MARK A. HANNA AND EER TWO CHARMING DAUGHTERS. ill <f\) \^^ -"— C CLEVELAND, Dec. 6.— Already gossip is busy talking about Washington society under the McKinley and Hobai t yegime. It is said that owing to Mrs. McK.ialey's ill health, the McKinleys wHI not sets'" to lead in soolety. The conclusion of pretty good judges about these matter, seems to b« that the Hannas will be the center of attraction in the social life of the capital. This, with the provision, of course, that the chairman of the national committee will go to Washington as secretary of the treasury. The Hannas are fitted in every way to assume sway. Mr. Hanna is end. The Standard Oil company, directed by Rockefeller, will be the foe of the Scotchman. This company has purchased in South Chicago, along the shores of Lake Michigan and at the mouth of the Calumet river, a plot of ground sevral acres' in- extent and with a water frontage of 3,200 feet. On this, it is said, rolling mills will be erected to cost $10,000,000, possibly twice that amount. "With this plant for manufacture, with the vast mines in the Mesaba region for the raw material and with eighteen huge lake vessels to carry the ore to the very doors of the works, all owned by the Rockefeller com pany, that corporation may be able to dictate terms to Mr. Carnegie and his associates instead of being dictated to. "Mr. Rockefeller's scheme is not new. He has had it in mind lor several years, but not until now has he been ready to put it into effect. His preliminary movements have, as usual, been kept quiet. Not until today did anything reach the public and then it was through an accident. Some weeks ago, a large plot of ground was pur chased in South Chicago. The sellers were the Calumet Canal and Dock company and several private inMl viduals; the real buyer was not pub licly known. The price was in the neighborhood of $500;000, divided into three payments. The first installment was paid when the deed was signed, and the next two will be paid Dec. 15. It was not necessary that Mr. Rocke feller should divide the sum. "The iron and steel business — at least that part of it dealing in steel rails — is controlled by Carnegie and his two allies entirely, the Illinois Steel company, of Chicago, and the Colorado Fuel Iron company, of Pueblo, Col. The price of rails at Pittsburg is $28, at Chicago $29, at Pueblo $33. Whichever of these three concerns is nearest the purchaser delivers the rails. Rails cannot be had of any one else. "This is the situation which Mr. Rochefeller has tackled. He expects to make steel rails from 25 to 50 per cent cheaper than the trust can. He can then sell them much cheaper. "The new mills at South Chicago will not be confined to the manufacture of steel rails, however, but will make structural iron of all sorts as well. It is stated further, and on good au thority, that Mr. Rockerfeller may even g-o into the armor plate business also. "The site of the new works is ideal for a mammoth rolling mill. The river at this point is twenty feet in depth, enough to float the largest of the lake vessels, and' provides a perfect en trance for the Standard Oil ships, which will carry ore from the mines along Lake Superior. ■ These same boats will serve as a pow erful whip in the harfds of the Stand ard Oil magnate in case the railroads attempt to fight him, for they can also be used for the grain trade, and literally demoralise freight rates in every direction." URUGUAY THAKQI'IL. Official Notice of the Bud of the Re volt. BALTIMORE, MCL bee. 6.— Mr. Pru ,dencio de Murguondo, consul general of the Republic of Uruguay, tonight gave out the following statement regarding the political aspect of affairs in that country: ; "In answer to a cablegram sent by me yesterday to the Uruguayan minis ter of foreign relations, requesting In formation as to the state of^reyolution In the country, 1 hjkve received" Hie following reply: "Rioters completely defeated.

THEIR RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE, EXCEPT IN THE DIRECTION OF ARTEMISA— VOLUNTEERS SENT TO WEYLER'S RELIEF. INSURGENTS THREATEN HAVANA. Forces Now Within Twenty Miles of the City— Raids on Gnana bacoa, KEY WEST, Dec. 6.— The steamer Whitney brought Havana news thig morning in relation to Maceo and Wey ler. Passengers state that Weyler him self is now encamped ten miles from Artemisa, and his army is scattered a broad entertainer. Mrs. Hanna and the Misses Hanna, Mabel and Ruth, shine in society with a distinct lustre. Mrs. Hanna is tall, stalely and regal in her deportment. Her ways are charming and graceful, and Ehe is quiet, kind and generous. Cleve land society has long regarded her aa its best dressed woman, and there is no denying at ail that she has a remarkable genuineness In taste. On the occasion of her last public appearance she wore a gown of yellow bro cade, with jeweled garniture, and superb dia mond necklace. The daughters are devoted to their mother. Mabel, the elder, Is a along the trocha and through the Pi nar del Rio district. When Maseo retreated from Weylor in his first campaign bis plan was to surprise Weyler at the first opportuni ty, and now Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler and they are hav ing daily skirmishes. Weyler is com pletely hemmed in, and if he shall at tempt to move he will be compelled to go to Artemisa. Small bands have crossed the trocha into the Havana district and are attacking the outposts and villages of that province. Insurgents numbering 7,000 are en camped in Havana province, twenty miles from Havana, and will go to Ma ceo's assistance when needed. Spies in Havana are keeping the insurgents posted as to the movements of the Spanish posts. A movement is on foot to capture Weyler if he shall attempt tc go to Havana by rail. Firemen and volunteers in Havana are being sent to Weylers relief. Heretofore these troops were used in the defense of the city. Since Tuesday's raid on Guanabacoa the city has been attacked almost ev ery night, and Thursday night 250 Cu ban cavalry rode for two hours through the city. The damage done amounts to thirty-six houses burned and a large quantity of supplies and ammunition seized; also a large number of mules leaded and ready to leave the city were taken. MACEO HASN'T TIME. Report That He Has Gone to \en York Denied. MADRID, Dec. 6. — A report reaches here from Havana that Antonio Maceo has gone to New York to consult with the Cuban revolutionary committee there. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 5.— A telegram from Havana was published here today that Maceo had fled from Cuba to the United States to avoid a conflict with Weyler. H. A. Hyau, the leading member of the Cuban circle here, said tonight: "I have heard from Maceo direct within the past day or two, and I know that he Is all right. A captain on his staff was here yes terday direct from Maceo's camp. He stated to me that Maceo could hold the hills for eight months or longer against Weyler and all his arm>." SHARP FIRING HEARD. Havana In a State of Uncertainty — Troops to the Front. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 6. — Today's Havana advices report an excited conflict of opinion there as to whether the forcing of the trocha by the Cubans yesterday was by guerilla bands or by the vanguards of Maceo's army in a movement to unite with Gomez. Spaniards have given no definite news from the front for a week, and at the same time have redoubled their censorship of the press. Sharp firing has been heard again .today in Havana from the neighborhood of Guanabacoa and other suburbs of that section, and all Havana is excited over the occurrence. Over 800 refugees have passed into the city during the past five days from that section, fearing for their lives during the fights between the soldiers and the insurgents. Nearly all the Havana volunteers have gone to the front, but as fast as they rout the guerrillas in one place, they encounter them in another, making a succession of running fights, all within five to ten miles of the city. About 100 soldiers have been killed or wounded so far in theso engagements. ENGLAND HAD A 810 CROP. Twenty Million Bushels Above That of 18»5.

HE DISCUSSES PENSIONS. Assistant Secretary Reynolds Makes Report. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The report of Assistant Secretary of the Interior Reynolds for the present year shows the policy pursued in the adminis tration of pension affairs. It states the important changes in the rulings and practice and the following: out of a general plan for securing equity, uniformity and justice in the determi nation of appeals. The assistant sec retary says: The liberal and generous spirit which prompted the enactment of the pension laws has been the guide of the department in their construction. Former adjudications have not been disturbed, save where fraud, error In law, or mistake was apparent. Figures are cited to show the sig nificant reduction of pending cases and to demonstrate that for the first time in eight years the work of the office during the past year was devoted to considering current appeals. The action of the commissioner of pensions was reversed in 2,066 of the cases ruled. The report says: General sat isfaction has followed the recommend ation of last year for such legislation as would secure better protection to the pension fund due incompetents and others, followed by the law direct- blonde, was educated in Cleveland, and is a charming young lady. Ruth is only 16, and is now at her studies, but promises well. She is fond of horses, and drives a spirited team, the gift of her father. The Hannas lire in a great bourne, rtvarlookine the lake. This mansion is not showy, but is elegantly fur nished. Within it many eminent men have been entertained, and its master is a gracious host. Should he go to Washington in a cabi net position there can be no doubt that he and his family can lead the social depart ment of the administration if they have the desire to do so. ing all quarterly payments to be made by check. Gratifying results have followed the passage, of the act of March' 2, 1895, which secured an extension of cash wherein payments of accrued pension could be made, as well as that of- the act of March 6, 1896, relating to the commencement of pension under the act of June 27, 1890. The suggestion is again made as to the advisability of such legislation as will lodge in the federal courts the right of any one on behalf of the gov ernment to ask for better protection to the pension fund of those laboring under legal disabilities. The following also are suggested: That Justice demands the universal appli cation of the common law rule in proof of marriage. State laws govern and lvd to de nial of title in cases which are equaSy meri torious. That the pensionable rights of minor chil dren, who claim under the act of June 27, 1890. should be defined with more certainty where the soldier dies leaving no widow sur viving. The act of Aug. 5, 1892. relates to pension able title of those women who served as nurses during the war of the rebellion. Title is confined to those who served in regimental, post, camp or general hospitals. The refusal of the war department to recognize those as properly employed who served in the first three classes mentioned tends to defeat their title and renders this portion of the act nugatory. Attention is invited to this in or der that proper legislation may be enacted to relieve any deserving claimants of an un just and unintentional discrimination. On the Ist of February, 1896, a new division was organized in the office of the secretary by his order, and the board of pension ap peals was thereby merged in this new di vision of pension affairs. By this means, all matters relating to pensions were brought into one division and under the assistant sec retary's supervision. The result has been to harmonize and systematize this work, and has also led to its greater expedition in the hands of a competent force. _______ _^ ______ Judge Dropped Dead.
