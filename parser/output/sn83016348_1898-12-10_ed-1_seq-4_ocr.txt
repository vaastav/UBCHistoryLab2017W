TUI' United Staten ami Spanish Ptore Commission''is con cluded their work on Thursday, and finally settled the terms of the treaty of peace. They will meet once more in formal session to day or Monday, when the Spanish Commissioners sorrowfully, and the Americana with feelings of relief, will write their signatures upon the document which embodies the i suits of the war, and the pre paration of which has consumed eleven weeks. In the meantime the treaty will he engrossed under the supervision of Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda, the seeietaiies of the respective com missions. The essential Ratines of lire treaty are embodied in eight articles, as follows : First—The oustomary preface of treaties in the mtnre of on expression of amity and of hope for perpetual peace.

Eighth—The provision for the “open door n commercial policy in the Philippines THE CURRENCY QUESTION. IN his mtasage, President M'Kinley very wisely did not go deeply into the currency question, because he knows that this Congress will not take up the subject, and that luttr judgment before action is taken would naturally be belter. The message treated finance and currency as follows : FINANCE AND 

CLUUENCY. The Secretary of the Treasury eports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the Usual year ended June 30 1808, including *114.751,‘223 received from sale of Pacific Dailroud’ amounted to *405,321,335, M"d its expenditures to *443.308,582 There was collected from fusion - 143,675,002, and from Internal revenue *170.000,041. Our utiabe imports amounted to $324,635,479, a dscreaso of *58,150,0: 0 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted lo *291.414,175. u decrease from the preceding year of *90,524,008. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the pre ceding year by *24,212.007. The total lax collected on distilled spirits was *92,540,099; on manufactured tobacco, *30,230,522, and on fermented liquors *39.615,421. We xported merchandise during the year amounting to *1,231 482.330. an increase of *180,488,774 from the preceding year. ll is Estimated upon the basis ol the present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for tin* year ending June 30, 1899, will be *577,874.017, and its expenditures *089,874,047, rr suiting’ In a deficiency of *112,000 000. On the first day of December, 1898, there whs held in the Trea sury gold coin amounting to *138,441,547. gold bullion amounting to *138,502,545. silver bullion amounting to *93.359,250, the other forms of money amounting to *451,903,981. Ou the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circula tion, or not included in Treasury holdings, was an for the year of *165,794,960. Estimating our population ut 75.194.000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was *25 09. On the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to *138,502,545. The provisions made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury in connection with the war has given increased confidence in the purpose and power of the government to maintain the present standard and lihs established wore firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. A marked evidence is found in the inflow of gold to the Treasury. Its net gold holdings ou November 1, 1898, were *239,885,102 as compared with *158,573 147 ou November 1, 1897, and an increase of net chsli of *207,750,100, November 1, 1897, to *300,288 275, November 1, 1898. The present ratio of not Treasury gold to outstanding government liabilities. Including United States notes, Treasury notes of 1890, silver certificates, currency certificates, standard silver dollars, and fractional silver coin. November 1, 1898, was 25.35 per cent, as compared with 10.90 per cent., November 1, 1897. I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows: That when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemable iu gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes— a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out iu any other way, they may return again, to he followed by another bond issue to redeem them—another interest-bearing debt to redeem a non Interest-bearing debt. 

GOLD STANDARD. This recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard, and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business conditions of the country. In my judgment, the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in h trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. it is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our cur rency Is not required; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand The Importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now is to that o' our h V mI {<. s? .

CECIL WHIG, ELKTON SATURDAY. DECEMBER O, 1898. CONGRESS IN SESSION. I I'HE short of closiii){ session or the Fifty-fifth met I promptly at noon ou Monday. In the House Mr. 1 Ointrlpy offered the oustomary resolution for the appoint ment of a committee of three to join a similar committee of the Senate to wait upon the President and inform him that the House was ready to receive any communication he had to make. It was unanimously adopted and Speiker lieed appointed Messrs. I)in)jley and Cannon (Kep., 111.), and Bailey (Dem., Tex.) A resolution was also adopted informing the Senate that the House was ready to primped to business. When tile House reconvened after recess the committee ap pointed to wait upon the President tepoited, and Major Prnden, the President’s executive clerk, announced the message of the President. The real of the envelope in which the message was contained was broken by the Speaker himself, and it was immediately laid before the House. Phe members on the lloor and spectators gave the reading their moat earnest attention. Mr. Cousins ( Hep,, Iowa) introduced the first hi 11 in the Honse at this session of Congress It provides that the standard of value in the United States “is hereby declared to ire and is the standard gold dollar at twenty-live and eight-tenths grail's of standard gold niue hundred line.’’ Lucky day it was for Cecil county when race track gambling ami its attendant evil influences were banished. .Inst how gam bling damns a man cannot he better shown than by the else of Boggs, the defaulting teller of the Farmers National P>ink of Dover, Del., who accounted for $48,000 of the shortage as follows: Lost on race tracks, $20,000; in marginal stock operations, $8,000; in poker, $13,000; in taro, $3,000; in pools and bucket shops, $3,500. Mu. Heuiikut N. Gkrky has purchased the “Port Depo-it Press” from Mr. George E M. Stengle. Mr. Gerry his ably edited and managed the paper for some months past arid his labors in the journalistic field of Cecil are sure to contribute not only toward the advancement of Port Deposit hut of the county at large. 

PRESIDENT M’KINLEY’S WISE MESSAGE. PRESIDENT M’KINLEY’S message was hut another evi dence of his greatness, and in no feature of it did he show better bis good judgment than in the treatment of the Philippine question. He said all that could well lie said in the light of present knowledge in the case, and Iris course once more demonstrates that he is at all times considerate of the opinions, and solicitous for the welfare, of the people at large. The time bail not come for him to indulge in any discourse upon this important question, and his notion is to be commended. President McKinley’s reference to our new possessions wa-: 1 do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will he appropriate after the treaty of peam shall he ratified. In the meantime anil uutil the Congress has legis lated otherwise it will lie my duty to continue the military govern ments which have existed since our occupation ami give to the people security in life aud property and enecuragoment uuder a just and beneficent rule. Until the treaty of peace with Spain is ratified, no discus-con of tile question is called for on the part of the President, his duly being—just as President McKinley has done —the continuance of military governments. And in this first decision he certainly lias the cordial approval of the American people, his determination being to keep the administration of tire conquered islands out of politics as much as possible by confiding the fiduciary positions in army officers. The high standard of integrity which prevails among officers as a part of their military education and of the military code of honor insures a thoroughly honest administration of tire affairs of tire islands. And in his tariff policy President McKinley was most wise. With regard to his message upon the Philippines and Porto Kico—merr of judgment certainly should appreciate the Prrsident’s wisdom of making neither a recommendation nor a suggestion at this time regarding this country’s future course. Little can ret lie known, aud under I lie present military gimrn ments every month will bring forth knowledge concerning tire relations between these properties and our country—and in want of this experience it would he the crowning act of foolishness to attempt to shape public opinion at this time. In the case of Cuba however, the relations voluntarily assumed by tire Unite.) States made it necessary that suggestions be offered by the President and which point lie disposed of most ably, as follows; Aa soon as we are iu possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will bo necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safely and assured snece.-s. It is important that our relations with this people shall he of the most friendly character and our commercial relations close arid reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the iudustry of the people, ami assist them to form a goverumeul that shall he free and independent, thus realizing the best aspirations of the Caban people. Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent ao,l humane government, crested by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither revenge nor passion should have a place in the new govern ment. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will he continued. And because of this foresight and wisdom our thanks are due our honored President. national Hffairs.
