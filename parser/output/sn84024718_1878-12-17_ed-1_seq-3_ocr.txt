' Ye Local's Soliloquy.—To write—and what to write, that is the question; Whether'tis nobler for the reporter to make up All sorts of dots and local paragraphs, Thrilling accounts of accidents and things in general Without the shadow of a fact whereon To base a single paragraph or dot; Or by the lack of a good local column Lose fifty thousand of our subscribers;— There's the part That makes calamity of being a newspaper paragraphist; For who could bear the sneers and jeers oj men And here them say, "This paper ain't worth a cent; It ain't got a bit of local news, And I'm goin'to stop it?" Oh! for a marriage or a runaway, A circus, or a dynamite explosition ; Oh! for a fight, a horrible, fearful fight Whose narrative might make our pencil go, And harrow up the soul of eve ry man Who pays two dollars a year for this paper, In order that he might get the worth of his money And cause each Individual's hair to stand on end; Like frills upon the fretful porcupine! Oh, Cordelia! how sharper than a serpent's thanks it is To run a local column ! Charlottesville Chronicle. Raisins, Currants, Citron, Prunes, Fish er's Mince Meat, &c., &c., for sale by C. A.

Fires Near Fishsrsville.—On last Friday night about 12 o'clock two stables belonging to Dr. Dold of Fishersville were destroyed by fire # The stables were used for storing hay and farm ing implements. The amount of loss is not known. The origin of the fire is unknown, but was doubtless the work of an incendiary, whose object was plunder; and whose hope and ex pectation was that by firing the small and some what remote building which was first set on fire, that the family would be drawn from the l)OUse, leaving it and the valuables it contain ed, unprotected. The alarm however was too soon spread and an immense crowd was too soon upon the ground, forthettyieves to accom plish their purpose. The buildings were insured in the East Au gtjsta Mutual Insurace Company. Central Point School-house, in South River District took fire on last Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock, but the fire was discovered in time to prevent any great damage.

Resolutions of the Staunton Bar Endorsing Judge Wm. McLaughlin. At a meeting of the Staunton Bar, which was attended by all the members who were present in the City, Capt. Geo. M. Cochran was called to the Chair, and Charles Grattan appointed Sec retary. The Chairman explained the object of the meeting to be, to take such action as seemed best, in view of the approaching election Of Judges, in order to secure to this Circuit a con tinuance of the services of its present efficient Judge, Wm. McLaughlin. The Chair under the resolution appointed Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Capt. T. D. Rauson and Maj. T. C. Elder, who retired and in a short time reported the following resolutions : Resolved, That we, the me mbers of the Bar of the City of Staunton and County of Augusta, in view of the approaching election of Judges by the General Assembly and of the proposed opposition to the re-clection of the present Judge of the Thirteenth Circuit, deem it not improper to give some public expression to our viewi and wishes in tnat regard. Resolved 2, That this Bar is unanimous in the opinion that the reelection of Hon. William McLaughlin, of Lexington, to the olllce which for eight years past he has filled with so much credit to himself and such general satisfaction to the people of his Circuit, will be a tribute justly due to him for laborious, faithful and ef hcent service. Resolved 3, That in our judgment his re-elec tion will promote the best interests of the cli ents whom we serve, and his defeat would be looked upon, in this part of the Circuit, as a public misfortune. Resolved, 4, That in his marked judicial abili ty, his extensive and varied inuormation, his deiigent attention to business, his promptitude in disposing of controversy, his well known in tegrity, impartiality and independence of char acter, his watchful supervision of trust fuuds, his remarkablelpowers of memory and tolirough familiarity with the business of the Circuit, we recognize qualifications for the office which we could ill afford to dispense with, and which it would not be easy to supply. Resolved, 5, That a committee of livemembers of this Bar be appointed by the chair, whose duty it shall be to communisate to our Sena tor and Delegates the resolutions of this meet ing, and to represent the body in all proper measures to promote the object desired. Upon offering which, Mr. Stuart the chairman said that he had been at this Bar and others in this State for a period of more than half a Cen tury, and all that time, he had never met a gentleman on the bench, who combined more diligence, more caution, more correctness and more firmness than Judge McLaughliri, and that he should regard it as a public calamity if his services were lost to the Circuit and the State. Mr. J. Addison Waddell said it gave him great pleasure to attend this meeting and that he concurred heartily in its object and cordially endorsed the resolutions reported. The motion for the adoption of the resolutions as a whole wss made by Mr. Wm. Patrick and seconded by Capt. D. S. Young, whereupon they were unanimously adopted. The chair under the sth resolution appointed Maj. T. C. Elder, Capt. Jas. Bumiardner, Jr., Meade F. White, Esq., W. A. Hudson, Esq., ! and G. M. Harrison, Esq. On motion of Mr. Stuart the meeting adjourn ed. GEO. M.

Jok Turner.—On Sunday afternoon of last week in St. James's Cathedral, Toronto, Canada, a sermon was preached specially for deaf-mutes, by our former citizen, Prof. Job Turner. The sermon, which had oeen written by Mr. Turner, was read by another, and trans lated into the sign language by Mr. Turner for the benefit of the deaf-mutes. The Toronto Globe says"The service was in no way different from that observed on ordinary occasions, only that as the reader proceeded with the various lessons there was a pause so as to allow the translator to keep pace with him. The deaf mutes, a large number of whom were present, occupied seats immediately in front of the pulpit. They observed with eager eyes the movements of the translator, and in the pray ers many of them made the signs after him.— The sermon preached was written by the trans lator, and was based on Psalm ciii. 8: —"The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in redemption." During the service a letter was read giving some interest ing information regarding the progress of reli gious teaching among the deafanddumbin the States. The communication stated inter alia that Rev. Mr. Turner is an earnest and faithful missionary among those of his fellow-country men who like himself are deaf-mutes. Jt also stated that thereare forty stations in the States where deaf-mutes, numbering altogether three thousand, receive religious teaching from deaf mute missionaries. At the close of the services, which were of a most interesting character, a collection was taken up on behalf of deaf-mute mission work." Fisher's unrivalled mince meat. 2ts J. E. Graham. Free Fight in Craig.—There was a tem porary revival of the "good old times" at New Castle, on the Btli instant-county court day.— Hon. James W. Marshall, who was theopposing counsel in a case pending in the court against Mr. C. T. Steele, was approached by the latter with a big stick, with which, after some warm words, he.struck Mr. Marshall. This occurred in the Court-house yard, and immediately af tervrards the.scene of conflict was chanaged to the street, Mr. Marshall insisting on Mr. Steele to "come on."' Steele failed to accept the invita tion, but kept rather quiet untii Mr. Marshall's attention wa3 attracted elsewhere, when he struck him with a stone, on the head. At this a friend of Mr. Marshall, with a blow with his list, laid Steele out on the ground, and for a time things were quite lively. Mr. Marshall's conduct was approved throughout by his friends, and the people were highly indignant at the manner of the assault upon him.—Fin castle Herald. Hon. James W. Marshall is State Senator from Craig, and is well-known to many of our citizens. He was born and raised in Augusta county. Death of Rev. Geo. G. Bkooxe.—The Rev. Geo. G.Brooke, one of the oldest and most es teemed ministers in the Baltimore Confeience, M. E. Church South, died suddenly at his resi dence in Berry ville, on Sunday last, of paralysis. He was apparently .in excellent health, and unusually cheerful, and was preparing to leave his home to "attend to his ministerial duties, when disease attacked him. He died before medical assistance could reach him. He had been in the ipinistry for oyer fifty years, and was widely known and highly es teemed throughout the bounas of Ihe Confer ence. within which he had labored so long as one of its most useful and devoted ministers. He was pastor of the Methodist Church here in Staunton in 1858 and 1859, when the present edifice was begun and held services in the Court-house, during which time he conducted a most successful revival, which resulted in over a hundred additions to the church. His kind benignant countehance and noble head silvered over by the frost of years, will long be remembered by many who attended the Sunday School Convention of the M. E. Church South here last Summer. C. A. RICHARDSON will be receiving fresh Christmas Goods this week. Call on him for your supplies. ♦ » ♦ Death of Dr. IJenry Leach.—Dr. Henry Leach, an Englishman who settled in Wythe ville several years since, died suddenly on last Friday'morning about 6 o'clock. The deceased complained of a cold the latter part of last.week, but did not take his bed until Monday evening, from which time his illness grew \porse and worse unt}l his death, which was caused, we learn, by inflammation of Itye braiq.— Tfythe ville Enterprise. It will be remembered by many of our citi zens that Dr. Leach was severq.l years ago, located in Staunton, and left here, rather sud denly, leaving his bills unpaid.

Bumgardner & Sons, were un loading at the warehouse in this city, one of ] the teams became frightened by a passing j freight train and ran off. The driver seized the j bridle of-tlie»leader, and Mr. Ben. Strickier, an 1 aged man, caught the off-wheel horse, but the bridle on the leader breaking gave the leaders a chance to run, and, as they did so, Mr. Strick ier was thrown down and the wagon wheels passed over him. The wagon was loaded with nine barrels of whiskey, weighing* over three thousand pounds. Mr. Strickier had the larger bone of his left leg broken a short distance above the ankle, and was painfully bruised about the hip- and head. He was taken to the American Hotel, where he was promptly attended by Drs. Waddell and ; Gibson. His injuries are serious, and it is fear- , ed may prove fatal. He is a worthy but poor j old man, and will receive the best of attention that Messrs. Bumgardner &, Sons can give him. Since writing the above, we learn that his in juries are not so serious as at first ap, pehended. j He was removed from the Amerlcun Hotel to his home in West End onSunday evening, and, ] though he is sixty-five years old, is doing very well, and stands every chance of recovering.

Social Cluh.—A number of the young ladies and gentlemen of our city have formed an or ganization for social entertainments and dances during the winter. It is a re-organization of the former (we were just going to say "T. B. Ts," but fortunately remembered, in tline, a dire threat from a fair member should we dare to do so.) Not knowing the nomenclature of the j present organization, we must content our selves with calling it a "Social Club," organiz ed for the purpose of holding social gatherings, once a week, at the residence of the respective members. Wo cannot refrain from expressing our hearty approval of this.movement, as nothing has sogreat a tendency to improve young men and ladies, both morally and socially, as fre quent social, joyous, happy meetings together. To the young men especially it is highly bene ficial in removing the rough and inelegant ten dencies of man'sanature, and developes that easy bearing and gracefulness so characteristic of those who seek the refined association of ladies' society. We wish the club much success and happi ness in their efforts to pass many pleasant evenings in each other's; society during the winter months. New Orleans molasses fifty cents per gallon, 3 2tS J.

Shortly aftert the Express came puffing along. The horse struck out in a long trot and followed the rail road, just in front of the engine, which had checked up, through the tunnel and down as far as Afton. where he left the track and saun tered out, apparently unconcerned, upon the commons, where he was found by the owner next morning. The tunnel is nearly a mile through, and it is one mile from the eastern end to Afton, yet this horse kept the track the whole way, and never stumbled.—Waynesboro Tribune.

Science has accomplished no more wonder ful or gratifying result than the perfection of an antidote to the chilling signs of approaching age, something to obliterate the tell-tale tracks of time, and preserve natural adorn ments of youth to ripe old age. Hall's Hair Ren ewer does all this, and its praise resounds in cottage and palace. The dwellers among the snows of Norway and the peasants of sunny France and Spain, find use for it, and find means to get it, and it does not disappoint them. The whitening locks again resume their youthful color, the thin, dry, and faded hair be comes bright and glossy. Tbe whole appear ance is changed as if by my magic, and the man or woman, who, before was called aged, now appears as one in the prime of life. Such wonderous changes cannot pass unnoticed, and they have produced the unprecedented de mand that now exists for the first and only ar ticle ever compounded that can produce them in a pleasing and satisfactory manner.—New Era, WooiMock, 111.
