BARBER COUNTY INDEX. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 9,1908. U. C. KERR Editor Painter & Herr. Publisher TELEPHONE KO. 60. One fear fi.no 81x Months . .... jio Three Months J5 Olcial Paper if County ail City .Congress convened on Monday John D. Rockefeller has alvays voted the Republican ticket. Teddy is back at his old habits, writing letters and shouting "liar!" "My Dear Mr. Harriman" is al ways a most welcome guest in Washington. Andrew Carnegie has never fail ed to contribute to the g. o. p. campaign fund. Frank H. Hitchcock will be Taft's postmaster general. Hitch cock is chairman of the republican national committee. Champ Clark of Missouri has been chosen minority leader of the House. Keep your eye on Champ. He'll wake up the animals. Archbold says the oil trust does the public good. He is right, pro vided he will allow us to put spe cial emphasis on the words, "does" and "good." John S. Dawson has been made private secretary by Gov. Stubbs. Dawson has been a hireling around the state house since 1899. He is now an assistant in the attorney general's office. The interest bearing debt of the United States is climbing up close to the billion dollarmark. On December 1st it was given out by the treasury officials at approxi mately $835,000,000.00. Another bond issue is coming. The fact that Senator Getty's opponent had a majority of 317 will have some bearing on the con test which the former has institut ed. But the fact that the Repub licans have a majority of 28 in the State Senate will have more. To peka Capital. The U. S. treasury deficit is growing'at the rate of $10,000,000 and over, per month. During the past five months the expenditures exceeded the receipts $54,000,000. 00. And the republican party has controlled every branch of the government since March 4, 1897! A truce was declared between President elect Taft and "Uncle" Joe Cannon last Wednesday, ac cording to the press dispatches. In reality, however, the "truce" was declared immediately after the adjournment of the Republican national conversion last June when Taft bargained for Cannon's sup port in the election. State Senator Quincy has given it out that he will introduce a genuine compulsory bank guaranty bill in the approaching session of the legislature. But Senator Quin cy, being a Republican, wilTiater change his views "in the interest of harmony" and if he introduces a bill at all it will be a makeshift and milk and water weaklinjr. "The cow eats hay with her main and might; she eats all day, and she eats all night; as fine as silk is her bill of fare; when it comes to milk, then she isn't there. The hens loaf round all the sunny morn, and pound by pound they eat the corn; with their yellow legs they scratch and tear; when it comes to eggs they ore not there. The damsel plays on the pi"-a-no, or she spends her days where her dress will show; though many a dub may think her fair, at preparing grub, well, she isn't there. The young man's done with his days at school, and he bets his mon' on his skill at pool; he can smoke and chew a grown man's share; when there's work to do, then he isn't there." Walt Mason. The minister preaches every Sab bath day, and he expounds the Gospel in a powerful way; he E leads for his Savior everywhere ut when it comes to voting for Christ why he's seldom there. FOR

Newspaper circles were greatly agitated recently by the announce ment that William R. Hearst had paid a visit to Theodore Roose velt at the White House and had received a most cordial welcome. Referring to that visit the New York World was unkind enough to say: "We wonder if Mr. Roose velt made this social function even more joyous by reciting any of the following extracts from the speech delivered by Secretary Root at Utica, November 1, 1906, when Mr. Hearst was a candidate for governor of New York: 'I say to you with his (Roosevelt's) authority that he regards Mr. Hearst as wholly unfit to be governor, as an insincere, self-seeking demagogue who is trying to deceive the work ingmen of New York by false statements and false promises; I say to you with his authority that he considers that Mr. Hearst's election would be an injury and a discredit alike to honest labor and to honest capital and a serious in jury to the work in which he is en gaged of enforcing just and equal laws against corporation wrong doing. President Roosevelt and Mr. Hearst stand as far as the poles asunder. Listen to what President Roosevelt himself has said of Mr. Hearst and his kind. In President Roosevelt's first message to con gress, in speaking of the assassin of McKinley, he spoke of him as in flamed 'by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sul len hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they can not escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish visionary who for whatever reason apologiz es for crime or excites aimless dis content' I say, by the president's authority, that in penning these words, with the horror of President McKinley 's murder fresh before him, he had Mr. Hearst specifically in his mind. And I say, by his authority, that what he thought of Mr. Hearst then he thinks of Mr. Hearst now.' " A Kadical Departure.
