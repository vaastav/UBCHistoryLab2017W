VOL. XIV. DURING ITS READING Republican Senators Give the Message Their Undivided Attention. On the Other Side, However, Little Attention Was Attracted. Only a Few Members of the House Followed the Clerk. One of the Populists Wants a Large Supply of Paper Money. [The president's message will be found on (he sixth page. 1 Washington, Dec. (..-Immediately after the reacting of the brief journal of yesterday's proceedinirs.ExecutiveOlerk l'ruden was announced "with a mes sage from the president of the United States." Senator McCormick entered upon the leading of it with considerable abatement ot his usual rapidity of ut terances. There were nearly sixty sen ators in attendance. Senator Hill, of New York, one ot the prominent ab sentees yesterday, was in his seat at the opening of the session today. Senator Ransom, of North Carolina, entered the chamber during the reading of the mes sage. Senator Vilas, of Wisconsin, and one or two senators held pamplet copies of the message in their hands and followed its reading with attention. This was particularly noticeable in the case of Mr. Cockrell, of Missouri, who studied the figures presented with close care Mr. McPherson, of New Jersey, moved down to the front rank so as to be with in hearing, and Mr. Palmer, of Illinois, took a position on the Republican side, occupying Mr. Frye'a scat in the front row to escape the buzz of a conversation which intervened between his custo mary seat and the clerk's desk. When Mr. Fry e came in he changed over to a place of Kqual Advantage on the oilier side of the aisle. Noticea ble changes in the customary arrange ment of the message naturally attracted attention. In all previous executive messaues the affairs of the state department, which lias no other way of comiminj eutiug with conuress except through the president, have generally been given precedence. Mr. Harrison's subordina tion of them iv his closing message 10 Jiis presentment ot the tariff issue was quickly noted. There was a percepti ble increase of interest when these passages which so pointedly discussed relations with Canada were reached. Mr. Cullom, of Illinois, exchanged whispered coinmmits with his neighbor, Mr. Dixon. of Kliode Island; Senators Sherman and Morgan, the two chiefs ot the foreign relations committee, listened attentively, and Mr. Hoar dropped the newspaper he had been looking at and followed the reading closely. Ex-Speaker Reed dropped in while the reading was going on and heard the message read In the senate instead of the house. The reading oi' the message occupied about an hour and a half. At its close, Mr. Manderson, chairman of the committee on printing, offered a resolution lor printing 1,000 copies for the use of the senate, which was adopted without objection. Enterested Republicans. The commercial and business statis tics given in the first part of the mes sage and the sarcastic paragraphs as to the supposed effects of a tariff for rev enue seemed to meet general approval on the Republican side of the chamber, while they attracted little attention on the other side. During the reading, Democratic senators were for the most part chatting listlessly with each other, or attending to their correspondence, while the Republican senators, on the, contrary, paid the president the com pliment of giving to his message their undivided attention. The various other subjects discussed in the message, however, seemed to have very little interest for senators on either side. The Democrats made no pretense of listening and the attention of Republicans showed a marked falling (ill. Seals in the diplomatic gallery were occupied throughout the readme of the message by the Spanish minister and by the first secretaries of the Ger man and Russian legations. The reading of the message was con cluded at 1 :35, having occupied an hour and a half. Five of the eighteen sena tors who were absent yesterday were present today. They "were Messrs. Graw, Ilawley, Hale, Hansom and San der?. Ten thousand copies ot the presi dent's .message were ordered to be printed in pamphlet form for the use of the senate. 11l the House. 11l marked contrast with the bustling scene of yesterday was the meeting of the house today. There were few per sons in the galleries, and upon the lloor the members seemed to have settled into the old routine. In a feeling man ner and amid the devout attention of all the members— who remained standing — the chaplain alluded to the recent afflic tions which the president had suffered, and invoked the divine protection on the bereaved ones. Mr. Ray nor, of Maryland, introduced a bill for the bet ter protection of commerce and to establish a national quarantine. -Re ferred. At 12:15 Mr. Pruden, one of the presi dent's secretaries, presented the annual message, which Cleric Kerr immediately began to read. The reading of the. mes sage met with little attention. Many or the members left the hall, preferring to study the recommendations of the president at home. Those who re mained entered into conversation or de voted themselves to a perusal of the newspapers. There was a few exceptions to the general rule. Mr. Hooker, of Missis sippi, was an interesting listener from beginning to end. He left his seat in the rear of the chamber and occupied a desk directly in front of the sneaker's chair, and paid the closest attention. For a short time he had as his com panions Messrs. Herbert, of Alabama; Dinirley, of Maine, and Butler and Dolliver, of lowa. When the question of the tariff was reached Mr. McMillin. 01! Tennessee, strolled down one of the aisles and listened intently, but Ills criticism of the excerpt was a mere smile. He then resumed his seat and paid no further attention to the message. The discussion of the Indian question arrested the attention of Mr. Simpson, of Kansas, for a few minutes, and he then turned to his colleague,* Mr. Otis, and thereafter heard no word of the message.

AFTER THK RKADING. A Petition Against the Wheat Combine Presented to the Sen ate. Washington, Dec. 6. — After the reading of the message, certified copies of the certificates received from Mary land, Michigan, Georgia, New Hamp shire and Arkansas, conveying the names of the electors for president and vice president chosen in those states, were transmitted from the state depart ment, laid before the senate and placed on file. Other communications and re ports were presented and referred. A petition presented by Mr. Peffer, from citizeiiH of Kansas, alleging the existence of a combination between elevators, millers and railroads of Min neapolis and St. Louis to depreciate the price ol grain, raised the question as to what disposition should be made of it. The vice president intimated that, as the anti-option bill had been reported, tho petition should go to the table, but Messrs. Paddock, Washburn and Har ris favored its reference to the commit tee on agriculture, and it was referred. Several bills were introduced and re ferred, among them the following: By Mr. Hate- To repeal all statutes relating to supervisors of election and special deputies. Jiy Mr. Chandler -For the suspension of immigration for one year. By Mr. Vest— To create a bureau in the department of agriculture for the giving of public information as to the product and shipping of livestock; a joint resolution, which he said lie would call up Tomorrow, for the appointment by the president of the United States of three commissioners to confer with the proper authorities of the five civilized tribes of the Indian territory with a view of making such agreement and ar rangement as will induce them to take homesteads In severalty and sell the re mainder of their lands to the United .States; a resolution reciting allegations in the public press charging gross mis conduct on the part of census em ployes, especially of enumerators in Missouri, who are said to have taken lists of voters for partisan use and also charging that certain clerks or the cen sus bureau had been sent to the state of New i'orlc during the election, to per form partisan service, and directing an investigation of such charges by the senate committee on the eleventh cen sus. Mr. Jlale.chalrrnan of the census com mittee, said that he presumed there would be no objection to the proposed investigation. He could not help think ing that the senator from Missouri had been led into offering the resolution by what would be found to be a matter of no substance. The great census bureau Jiad done an immense work with but very little political bias. Mr. Vest referred to the arrest of a census official in Albany, N. V., for an attempt to induce 3T)O Democrats to go down the Hudson river on an excursion, and thus keep them away from the polls. Mr. Mitchell— Does the senator think that the result of the voting in New York showed that Democrats had been kept from the polis? Mr. Vest— The result In New York has nothing to do with what 1 am say ing, because the attempt was unsuccess ful. This man was arrested and put in jail. He gave an assumed name. And 1 am credibly informed that he has been rewarded by being promoted and put In a higher and more lucrative position on account of his pernicious activity in the last canvass. The resolution went over without action till tomorrow. Mr. Hale introduced a bill to increase the naval establishment, and it was re ferred. After a ten-minute executive session the senate adjourned. 

AVIL.L SUIT THE ?OPS. Otis Wants Fifteen Hundred Bill- ions of Fiat Money Issued. Washington, Dec. C— The financial theories of the third party were empha sized today in a bill introduced by Mr. Otis, of Kansas, having the voluminous title, "To change our monetary system, reduce interest, fix the unit of value, supply the states with a circulating me dium and for other purposes."

Terrific Battle Between. Livery" Stable Employes and a Fa-. neral Party. Razors, Revolvers, Paving Stones and Wagon Stakes the Weap ons Employed. St. Louis, Dec. 6. —At 9 o'clock last night a riot occurred at Seventh and Gratiot streets between a funeral party and a lot of livery stable employes, in which all kinds of weapons from clubs and stones to razors and revolvers were used. The funeral of Mrs. Val Gardner, a courtesan of No. 922 Clark avenue, took place in the after noon. The mourners drank heavily on the way back and detained the carriages about four hours longer than agreed. On reaching the city the drivers drove direct to the stable, and Frank Witt, proprietor of the stable, refused to let the carriages take the occupants home. At this, Thomas Wiseman, a white man who had taken a colored woman named Mamie Reynolds to the funeral, sprang from his vehicle and tried to cut Witt's throat with a razor. I. N. Sweet, an employe of Witt's, stretched Wiseman insensible on the pavement by a blow from a cart stake. Mamie came to her lover's assistance with a revolver, but in turn had her skull fractured by Sweet's stake. The friends of Wiseman and Mamie, about fifty in number, came to their as sistance, and the drivers sided with Witt and Sweet. A fierce and very much mixed fight followed. Witt and his side were driven into the stable and compelled to barricade the doors to keep their assailants out. The angry negroes and whites then bombarded the stable with bricks and paving stones, doing considerable damage and smash ing in the door, but betore they could enter the stable a detachment of ten policemen arrived on the scene and drove them away. Wiseman and the Reynolds woman were taken to the city hospital, the latter in a dying condition. About a dozen other persons were more; or less wounded, and a number of the rioters were arrested. Later in the night the police raided a number of immoral resorts in the neighborhood: and arrested all the inmates. tq, — ■——.' The Prison Congress.

In the Composing: Room Was ')\ Where the Greatest Dam age Occurred. . Philadelphia, Dec. The Public Ledger building, at Sixth and Chestnut streets, was almost gutted this evening by fire. The damage by fire was con fined almost entirely to the composing room, situated on the* top floor, but a | torrent of water poured down through the building, flooding every .floor in the entire structure. The loss can only be approximated tonight, but it will probably be between $250,000 and $500,000. The Ledger building is a . five-story brown stone building with a Mansard roof. The fire originated at G o'clock in the basement, and through an air shaft spread rapidly to the top floor. City Editor McQuade was making out his evening assignments for his men when the tumult and shouts of fire greeted him. Grasping copy that had been turned in by reporters during the day, he stuffed it into his pockets, and, after depositing the obituaries of , men of local prominence in an other pocket, he took his assign ment book under his arm and* beat a re treat to the street. The files of tiie paper were all saved, and the many rare and costly articles in Mr. Childs' u#vate office were all carried, out. In tli'u meantime a dozen ( Stream** of Water had been turned on the fire in the cel lar and the flames there were soon extinguished. The flames in the com posing room, in the top floor, however, had been creating great havoc. The fire . burst througn the roof and shot up in a great column toward the sky. About this time Mr. Childs arrived. He posted / himself in I tile doorway or. the court house across the street from the burning > building, and silently watched his buildings go up in flames. When in vited to enter a neighboring office he declined, and said he liked to watch the fire. He assumed charge of his em ployes, and directed them what to do in i ; ie way of providing for issuing a paper tomorrow. . ■-. -?■--•«• t't-i" ■•■:•■-■■'»:.*».-[ •■;■<■?£ .'. --• While the firemen were at work they : were , spurred, to greater efforts by the announcement tint Mr.Chilas intended to distribute 55,000 among » them for their prevention of the total destruction of his building. Neither , was Mr. Childs unmindful of the firemen's bod ily comforts, for he provided them all with a bountiful • supper at a neighbor ing restaurant. ' ' ' . The greatest destruction by the fire was done to the composing room. This was completely burned out and the roof went, with it. While the lire was still burning fiercely the work of getting out tomorrow's paper was begun. The city department Was removed to the board of tradu room in the next building and the reporters turned in their copy of the day's doings of a great city as usual. With the exception of presses, the Ledger his A Complete Newspaper Plant at No. 415 Locust street, and there the compositors are setting type for tomor row's paper. As the presses were ren dered unfit for uso tonight, by water, Mrs Childs accepted the offer of Will-" iam M. Singerly to print his paper from the ; Record's presses. During the fire Mr, Chiids was tendered the use of presses by every daily and weekly newspaper in the city. The cause of the fire is unknown. The cellar in which it broke out is not used, and no theory as to how it broke out is advanced. Joel Cook, business .manager of the paper, said late tonight that the Ledger's total loss was es estunated at $150,000, including SIOO.OOO on the building and ?50. --000 on the contents. The loss or tenants is estimated at 150.000. The perfecting presses, engines and other machinery in the cellar are valued at (250,000, and the damage by water i5?25,000, being an outside estimate of the loss. :.' The Public Ledger was established in 1830 by Messrs. Swane, Abel &' Sim mons. In 1850 the paper was purchased by George W. Chikis,and has since been owned by him. The Ledger is noted In the journalistic world for its conservatism and accuracy in news Its proprietor is one of the best known men in this country on account of his public spirits and princely generosity.

Baltimore, Dec. 6.— lt may be stat ed, upon the authority of close friends of Cardinal Gibbons, that he and Mon signor Satolli have a perfect under standing about the duties to be per formed by the latter in this country. The impression prevails in clerical cir cles here that Cardinal Gibbons request ed the pope to send Morisignor Satolli to America to investigate the troubles re sulting from Cahenslyism and the dis pute between Archbishop Corrigan end Dr. McGlynu. The cardinal is a diplomat, not an autocrat. He had quietly investigated the matters of a contest, and arrived at the conclusion that the only way to prevent an open rupture, which might even lead to a division in the American church, was to have the disputes arbitrated or ad judicated by ; a special 'emissary from the Vaticun, whoso recommendations or decisions could . not .be construed as showing any partiality , to either side.- Mgr. Satolli will take no action without consulting the cardinal, and first re porting to the pope. Mgr. Satolli. as he himself says, has been empowered by the pope to investi gate and decide without appeal the ex isting controversy; but it was on Cardi nal Gibbous' advice that he was vested with his power, and whatever disposi tion is made of the cases 'of Dr. Mc- Glynn and Father Coirigan, the cardi nal's opinion will not be overlooked. At a recent conference between Cardi nal Gibbous and Mgr. Satolli. in this city, the former explained the whole situation to the latter, and the plan of trial and settlement of the troubles was agreed upon. The above is the view taken of the matter in the inner circles of the church. Cardinal Gibbons wants it to be understood that Mgr. Satolli's power in the matter is supreme. There is a perfectly satisfactory understanding between the pope and the primate of the American hierarchy. Rochester, N. i., Dec. 6.— Bishop McQuaid, of the diocese of Rochester, said to an Associated Press reporter to day in reference to the power s con ferred upon Mgr. Satolli by the pope: "The appointment simply confers upon Mgr. Satolli the powers of apos tolic delegate. . Authority of the same nature, though, perhaps, not so great in its extent, has been conferred upon American bishops many times before this. In many cases where particulars are to be obtained by the pope with ex treme difficulty, the cases have been re ferred to some delegate, whose decision in the matter was final. 1 don't look upon the recent appointment as any thing out of the ordinary rule that I have explained."

The party, he says, conld not have won had it ignored that principle. He adds: "We stand, then, as a party unalter ably committed to the overthrow of McKiuleyism in every shape and form. Nothing short of this will fulfill the in structions and requirements of the peo ple. Their support for our party was obtained by our Bold Denunciation of Republican protection as a fraud, a robbery of the great majority of the American people for tlie few, and uy our courage in tne enunciation and ad vocacy of the principle of tariff for reve nue, and we must see to it that the ex pressed will of the people shall not b« stifled or defeated by a failure ot our senators and representatives in congress to enact such laws as will forever ex punge the foul blot of protection from the fair escutcheon of our grand and mighty republic. This done, it will maintain Democratic ascendancy in the national government uninterruptedly lor a long and prsoperous period. The struggling toilers of this land who have so long been the victims misguided by this cruel and odious doctrine of protec tion will, when they ure released from the oppression and slav ery of such a system, and when they realize and eujoy the benefits of n fiscal policy based upon principles of taxation that are inspired by the love of liberty and right and Justlce,"giv<> to us as a party their continued support and confidence. And with such sup port tin; possibilities of our party lor the future will be unlimited." CJov. Bolex' Wl«e Word*. 11l the course of his letter (Joy. LSoles says: "But in the excite nient of its joy over the victory it lias won, the Democratic party must not forget that even and exact justice to all classes and to every individual is indispensable to lasting success in any political organiza tion. That party has no war to make upon manufacturing; in dustries in this country, it must be ready at all times to recognize the importance of these industries in the great struggle for supremacy among the civilized countries of the globe in which we are engaged. It success is to be per manent it will bo because of an eco nomic policy revised by it on Hues that fairly and honestly seek to promote ev ery material interest of all our peo ple, that recognize no distinc tion in classes, and, as far as possible, confer no favors on one class that impose corresponding burdens upon the shoulders of others. To frame and put into operation such a sy«teni will require all the wisdom and all the patience of the wisest and tbc best of the statesmen of this, the most progressive of the nations of tne world."
