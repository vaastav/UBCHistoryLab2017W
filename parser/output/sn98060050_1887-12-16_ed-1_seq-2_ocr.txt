Uulluud and Htnliiitou seem to have Iteeii tho only placet in Vermont to organ ize and send a list of regularly-elected dele gates to the convention of Republican cluhs now- in session in New York. In Rutland a permanent cluli wan organized, appropri ately called the Morrill club, with Albert ChukeaH president. In Bui lington the old I'laiue and Iogan club wan teiuuarily re v ived for tho occasion. A despatch from Rev. Clias. A. Uarry of Wiiherlmmpton, Kng., was read to the I'lymntith chinch cougregutum on Sunday, announcing that he could not accept hit all In the pastorate of that dun ch. "Home claims," In said, "are inexorable; duty here commands." The dep.itch produced much excitement, and Mr. Uarry 'h declina tion is really a hard blow to the Plymouth congregation, for it in not an easy matter lo get such a church into a uuunimous mood, and now the work since Mr. Ileech t's death nui.st all be done over again. Mr. lilatne talked interestingly about the I'l esident's message last week, and his views will in the main have the approval of tlm Republican party but one fails to see just w by his opinions should bespread be fi ue the country to the extent of a three column cable message, any more than should those of Mr. Mori ill, the father of the tariff, nf Mr. Kdumuds, Mr. Sherman or Mr. Alli son. The performance has much of the druniatic element in it, and is liable to be interpreted as meuninc that Mr. Maine is the only Republican American who has "view.," w hich we do not think is the case, 'Hit ilfu that It last's yotttitf men to ket-i paiv Willi the Hint cli of thought is prm en anew in the fiiM of Se luitor Muiiill. llWiitfniil in his THIli rar, he w.is inmhle etumiiii to Ik the tirst man in cllht-i" HitiiM of Cniiitss lo IlitliHtutv il bill till st-sMou to regulate liiitiilKl'atioii It is the Rutland Herald which takes this apt way of saying that our senior Ver mont senator has taken time by tho foie-l-M-k in the introduction of an imiiortaut measure of tho character indicated. The main idea of Mr. Morrill's bill U to estab lish an inspection by our consuls at foreign potts and to shut oil undesirable emigrants before they cross the ocean. The Senator explained and advocated his bill on Wednes day, dwelling especially on the fact that already one-third of our imputation eun sihts of persons of foreign birth or foreign parentage, while in the larger citien the propoitiiiu is much greater. 'I'lte t'ouvirt nul Criminal liinniie. It is announced that (iov. Oruisliee hus appointed, under a joint resolution of the last legislature, ex-(iov. Ro,well Karnham of llradford, Dr. Henry .lanes of Water bury and Hon. Charles P. Hogan of Shel don, a commission to "investigate as to the advimhility and locution of a separate building for the cure of the criminal and convict insane, and all mat lets germane to tho subject," to report to the next legisla tuie. It will be remembered that Uth the oHiciuls of the Vermont asylum and the state lioard of supervisors have repeatedly urged tho imiortaiice and necessity of pro viding a place for the proper care of the convict and criminal insane entirely dis tinct and sepatato from tho present asylum. Thr Uulluud Ilnllrcnd Huir, Inu reiKirt of an interview with fSov, Smith, sent fioiu St. Albans to the Uoston .biurital, it is stated that Cnv. Smith denies that the Rutland road la to be surrendered dun. 1st to its new lessees, the Delaware A Hudson Canal company, (iov. Smith said that tho Rutland road was Mist offered to tho Central Vermont, but that company could iiutuirord to take it at tho price asked. He also intimated that tho road has been u losing piece of property on the hands of the Central Vermont. The latter compa ny's lease of the road has three yeuru more to run. The Rutland Herald says that the alleged loss of the Central on account of the Rutland will depend on how the fluul accounts ar settled. The Rutland proper ty has depreciated in the hands of the Cen tral, and the Herald does not believe a largo account for improvements will bo al lowed in favor of the Central Vermont. Tho Herald hays, furthermore, that the Clements tried unsuccessfully, before tho sale of the road was effected, to get Gov. Smith to give up tho lease, but failed a fact which is inconsistent with the state ment that the Central Vermont is losing money by tho operation of the road. Tho Herald thinks it safe to assume, liecause of tho prominent connection of Col. Cannon, Mr. llilliiigh, den. Wells und or-fiov. Stew art with tho Rutland road, that tho sale to tho Delaware tt Hudson company will not be detrimental to Vermont interests.

The decision of the Tinted SUitos Su i pi erne Court utnitiin the prohibition laws of Kansas, tlnough only a reallinnatiou of decisions previously pi oumtgated, w HI serve j to vt at rest the fear of fioine timid cop)e I that the liottout was nliout to be knocked out of the prohibitory laws of all the states. The com t declares that while the principle that no person shall le deprived of life. lilieity or propel ty without due process of law is embodied in the constitution of the United States ami in the constitutions of nearly all the ntates, it is not incompatible with the principle, equally vital because essential to the peace and safety of society, thai all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the own er's use of it "shall not be hijuiious to the etpial enjoyment of others of their prop el ty, nor injurious to the lights of the community." If it believes the sale of lij nor as a beverage to be injurious to the rights of the community, any state may lot liet the trallic oven to tho extent of prohibition. The Supreme court of Kansas is thus overruled, and the Kansas law will stand. II ts line Thluic lo Moiiilniile tint! All other lo Klrrt.

In view of the President's re cent utterances it remains a mutter of con sideralile dnnlit how the Southern protec tionist Democrats will reconcile themselves to democracy und aggressive free trade. Of these it must he said that they have struggled muiifulli hitherto to twist the tut ilf plank of the last Democratic platform into tlie appearance nf acceptable tiade doctrine. In face of the advanced opin ions, of the message it hnrilly seems sissi hle that business principles iitul purty alle giance can longer lie reconciled. The' South lias been gaining rapidly in prosperity un der a policy which has not been Democratic. This iHilicy they are now called openly up on to defeat.

XOTKS. .M. Jules Kerry, the ex premier of Future, wus shot in the chamber nf deputies at Paris Saturday by a ciank uf the (iuiteuu stump named Aubertin. The victim's inju ries are not considered dangerous. Henry S. Ives, "the young Xuioleon nf finance," was arrested at New Vnrk Tiles, day nu the charge nf grand hiiceny, but was released on S'.'.I.IhKI bail. The charge was preferred by Julius. Dexter, president nf the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton railroad, who alleges that Ives appropriated to his own use a draft for 

.IIKI,IKKI out nf his order as trustee. Senator .Morrill is remrteil as saying uf the President's message : "I think it's us neat u presentation of a lot of chestnuts us ever Congress us invited to listen tu." Senator Kdtnunils only said; 'it wiinld be likely tu please the Knglish." In the recnnstiuctioii of the United States Semite, the two Vermont senatnrs remain at the head of the two leading i- inittees. As a mutter of course, Mr. Mor rill is chairman of the finance committee, and second on the committees of public buildings uud the census, and is also on the committee on additional accommodations for the library. Mr. Kdtnumls is chairman of the judiciary, second on the committee on foreign relations, of which Mr. .Sherman it chairman, and on the committee on land cluiuis. That uttack ilm the interstate com merce law, which wus predicted to occur us sisiu us Cnngiess met, dues nut materialise. On the contrary, the cutirse of the Senate in making the committee on trunsMrtation routes to the senium id u standing committee (mints to a conviction that the new legisla tion is permanent. Kitchburg, Mass., furnished a paradox in her city election the other day. The pres ent mayor is a license man, but he was de feated fnr reelection by the prohibition can didate, ami at the same time the city toted in favor uf license. Mrs. John Jacob Astor of N'ew York, who liberally endoHed the 'ancer hospital opened in that city the other day, died Sun day evening of u cancer. Her father, Thoiuus S. (liblis, wus formerly a planterof South Carolina. John Jacob Astur, her husbiiud, is a grandson of the Joint Jucob Astor who founded the family's, foitune. It is believed that negotiations arc in pro gress which will result in the Kitchburg railroad taking possession, Jan. 1st, of the Cheshire road, which runs through hteene to ItelloHs Kalis.
