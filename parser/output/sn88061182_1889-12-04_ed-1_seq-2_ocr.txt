President Harrison's recommendation in regard to building up our merchant marine deserves the careful considera? tion of congress. To build up a trade with foreign countries, we mu*t be? come acquainted with the people there, and nothing will facilitate au inter? course of this kind moio tluiu a mod? erate assistance of the mail, carrying service. In regard to strengthening our navy and coast defeuses he mani? fests laudible concern, and is in full sympathy with that movement which will keep the government at work on a navy until this country wi'l have the best warships atloat ami enough of them to protect us from insult and in? vasion. He favors general education and wants the negro to receive the beuefits of governmental aid. As the Blair bill promises to do this while cir? culating a good many millions through? out the South congress will probably pass that or a similar measure this session. On civil service reform the president seems to be all right, bat there are no doubt many democratic ex-office holders who would much pre? fer that he had been possessed of his present ideas at an earlier period of his administration. A 

SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT. The opening of the sessiou of con? gress yesterday was attended by no surprises until toward the close of the day's proceedings in the house. The business of the senate was of a rou liue aud formal character. Vice-Ffcsir dent Morton's occupancy of the chair of the president of tbe senate was the most noticeable event. In the house Mr. Reed was made speaker by a vote of 1GC as against 154 for Mr. Carlisle and one for Cummiogs, of New York. Speaker Reed acknowledged the honor conferred oc him in a brief and appro? priate speech, and the sessiou began with everybody in a good humor. A flurry was produced, however, wheu Mr. Cheadle, a republican, bolted the candidate ol his caucus for chaplain, and moved the substitution of the name of Mr. Milburu, the blind demo? cratic chaplain of the last house. Sev? eral republicans joined Cheadle,and with their help the democrats after a spirited Btruggle, eiectedjMilbum by a vote of 100 to 155. The incident shows how difficult it may be for the republicans to carry party measures in the present house. The majority when all mem? bers are present being not over eight, and under ordinary circumstance lik ly to fall to two or three, or even disap? pear altogether, they are subject to all sorts of accidents. The caprice of oue offended republican, the sickuess of another, the absence ol a third, acd an accident to a fourth may at auy "time break a quorum or make a divis? ion result the wrons way. Arbitrary measures with the minority are clearly impracticable under the circumstances brought forcibly to the public notice in the election of a democratic chap? lain yesterday.?Baltimore Sun. The great German guumaker Krupp is said to be looking for a loca? tion in this country for a branch of his gun foundry, and with its im? mense resources in coal, iron and other mineral there is no better place in the United States for the location of such an establishment than right here iu Roanoke. Sooner or later our own government will build a gun factory somewhere Jin the interior for the man? ufacture of heavy ordnauce, and when this is decided upon Roanoke will he a strong competitor for the place. In fact,the more we ponder upon them the greater the possibilities of our beloved mountain city become.
