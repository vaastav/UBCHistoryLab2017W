TAFT'S MESSAGE. cut the expenses of the government $50,000,000. It i> true be lias done this by sacrificing tlie interests of the army and other departments, hut the RooseVell administration was getting so extravagant that reductions had to be made somewhere, and immediately. It looks as though Taft is going to be an economical president, as tar as conducting other departments is con cerned, although 'tis true thai the executive department' has not shown signs of economy yet. The president's sal ary has been increased $25,000 per year; he ha- spent an other $25,000 on the famous junket, and the White House offices have been remodeled at large expense. As far as the rest of the message is concerned, it is carry ing out the Roosevelt policies mildly- on a stretcher. Conservation of public resource- i- not handled. The anti-trust fight is not dealt with. Interstate commerce legislation is barely mentioned. But the president says he's going to mention till these Rooseveltian subject.- in Special messages —later. In "deliberate circumspection" the president coins a new phrase. Ileuses it in connection with the Nicaraguan I affair. Says I'ncle Sam is proceeding that way. Did you ever catch Roosevelt "deliberately circumspecting" in one of his messages f In this week's Wall street letter, Henry Clews, famous banker, says: '■President Taft's message to congress will he looked forward to with special interest: and. while he must be expected to keep his promises and maintain the; Roosevelt policies, it is probable that he will do so with as kindly a hand as the situation will permit." Ami that's exactly what he did—said he's carrying' out Roosevelt policies in a kindly way. Just as though T. H.s policies 

COULD be carried out in a "kindly" way—to those he was fighting against! Yes, Wall street will he unalarmed at a "kindly" carry ing out of the Roosevelt policies—on a shutter. Senor Smith to the Rescue. Diaz Defended From Slanders. the Bankers' Magazine against the dreadful indictment of "Barbarous Mexico" in the American Magazine, must be a Mexican. Though hi< residence is given as Tippecanoe City, (>., he cannot be an American. If he ha*d been aft American he would not have wired the president to prohibit the use of the United States mails to the American Magazine on ae cjumt of its proposed publicatibn.^. This would "go" in the land of Diaz, but not here. Presi dent Taft would rightfully have been impeached and .thrown bodily from the high seat such an action would have disgraced had he "prohibited" the use of the mails to the American or any other magazine under Mich cir cumstances. Perhaps, however, Senor Smith is a Russian. His con ception of American liberty and the powers of a president are quite Muscovite. Senor Smithovitch says that Jehu Kibbe Turner, who has given as the American's dreadful picture of the slavery Of the working classes in Mexico under- the iron rule of Diaz, is a slanderer. Senor Smith calls' Porfirio Diaz a "sterling patriot and statesman." "one of the greatest men of modern times." under whose "wise administration and guidance" "the old fighting, revolutionary spirit of Mexico has given way to one for development} enmity has been displaced bj a desire that peace and plenty may fill the life of every one of the people" "under the inflexible operation of its well-made laws." And yet Senor Smith does not say that the Ynouis and -the Mayas are not made slaves in the henequen hells of Yucatan. He does not say that Mexican workmen and women tire not herded together in the frightful slave pens of the Valle Nacional. He does not say that the govern ment itself is Dot in partnership with these horrors worse than those of the Kongo Free state under Leopold the Accursed. He tries to deny these things by general statements, and praise of Diaz. But his conception of liberty disclosed in hi.- telegram to Taft indicates that at heart lie believes in force where capital is endangered, and his failure to deny specifically the things charged really admit theni. True, Senor Smith says that "every proposition in 'Bar barous Mexico' has been proven untrue by an authoritative denial"; bid in the I'nited States the denial of yuilt by even a great man has never been accepted as proof of inno cence. It may be so in Senor Smith's native Mexico, but not here. Mr. Turner's awful indictment is too full and too convincing. At first one is puzzled that this article, which has been made tbe official defense of Diaz, apparently, and has been mailed broadcast over the country in pamphlet form, should emanate from a publication calling itself the '/Bankers' Magazine " But we see the reason when the writer rejoices in a pean of praise to Diaz that Mexico has "emerged from the darkness of financial discredit." Tlie animus of the enthusiasm for Diaz is therein dis closed fear of business disturbance if the poor slaves of Mexico should be freed, fear for diminished dividends on the stocks of Mexican flotations. It is the old pro slavery doctrine. Bill it will have the old ending. The world will not loug endure the things Turner describes —not for any number of dollars. "Snakes and stingers." Who are they.' the general public asks. They are the switchmen and train-nen, snd they're pi cud to be called by those names. The word "snake" was given the switchmen because of the shspe of the first letter in "switchman," which is uced in a big letter in their union button. • * * • * ,* , Football ia having its annual reformation in the newspapers.

The President Concludes. In conclusion, the president says: "I have thus. In a message com pressed as much as the subjects will permit, referred to many of the executive needs of the country with the exceptions already noted. Speaking generally, the country is in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial busi ness expansion, and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for . the farming com munity. But on the other hand, they mean a very considerably In creased burden upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does not expand with the improvement in business and the general prosperity. Various rea sons are given for the high prices. The proportionate increase in the output of gold, which today is the chief medium of exchange and is in some respects, a measure of value, furnishes a substantial ex planation of at least part of the Of A China Sale That the Thrifty Can Not Afford to Miss.

The-increase in population and the more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been accompanied by" f proportionate increase in acreage production, may furnish a further reason. It is well to note that the increases in the cost of living is not confined to this country, but pre vails the world over, and that those who would charge increases in prices to the existing protective tariff, must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place al most wholly in those products of the factory and farm in respect to which there has been either no in crease in the tariff or in many in stances a very considerable reduc tion."

A Quarter of a Million Dollars Interest Paid to Depositors Interest amounting to $246,000 had been paid by the Spo kane & Eastern Trust Co. to its depositors at tlie close of business November 30, 1909. Two per cent a year is cred ited on accounts subject to check, and four per cent on savings. It is nearly 20 years since the bank was opened under the direction of the president and founder, J. P. M. Rich ards, who is still actively in charge of its affairs. The 12 months just ended have been the most prosperous in its long history. Gross earnings for the year were $283,358.40, and operating charges were $95,065.42. Payments of inter est to depositors during tho year were $67,641.61. Other disbursements were $2756.44. In accordance with instruc tions from the stockholders, as embodied in the bylaws, the directors received five per cent of the net earnings, or $5894. Bonuses of $8000 were paid to executive and depart ment managers, and gratuities of $3864.25 were disbursed by the directors to subordinate employes. After all these charges had been made the net profits available for distribution to stockholders were $100,136.68, or 33.37 per cent on the bank's capital of $300,000. Regular quarterly dividends of two per cent and an extra one of 12 per cent were paid, and the balance was carried to un divided profit. Stockholders have received a total of 46 dividends since the organization of the company. In accordance with the most conservative and rigid bank ing practice, the different funds set aside to take care of taxes, interest due and contingent'liability, amounting to $24,864.58, have been taken out of tho undivided profit ac count. Under the former plan, which is approved by the banking law and is generally adopted, the book value of the stock nt the close of the year would have been $214.13 a share. Under the new practice it is $205.84. The capital Is $300,000. the surplus $200,000 and the net uudlvided profits $117,540.31. This makes a total fund of $617,540.31 placed by the stockholders in the business. On November 30, 1909, the savings department held 160 mortgages, aggregating over $403,000. in amounts from $100 to $30,000 on which there was not a penny of delinquent interest. In the bills receivable, amounting t0<41,745,2!)1.84, there were only $3474 in notes that had not been paid at maturity. In accordance with the fixed rule of the hank to procure a rigid annual inspection by a certified public accountant, Victor Smith and staff are now engaged in an examination of every department. The work will probably continue until January. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.
