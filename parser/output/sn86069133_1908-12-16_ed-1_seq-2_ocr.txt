States Attorney General The Presidents Special Message k y I Washington Dec 15 President t Roosevelt today transmitted to con gress a special message dealing with the purchase of the Panama canal q site together with a number of docu ments bearing on the same takes f up the charges made recently in con section with the acquisition of the canal property to which he vigorous ly replies The presidents message follows vTo the Senate and House of Repre I sentatives sentativesIn In view of the constant reiteration of the assertion that there was some corrupt action by or on behalf of the United States government in connec 1 Lion with the acquisition of the title et the French company to the Pana ma canal rand of the repetition of the 4story that a syndicate of American citizens owned either one or both of the Panama ompanies I deem it wlse tb submit to the congress all the Information I have on the sub sect These stories were first brought to myattention as published in a pa per in Indianapolis called The News i ditel by Mr Delavan Smith The I stories were scurrilous and libelous j r In character and false In every essen j tial particular Mr Smith shelters himself behind the excuse that lie i seer 1y accepted the statements Trhich had appeared In a paper pub lish pd in New York The World own dtby Mr Joseph Pulitzer It is idle to Gay that the known character of Mr Pulitzer and his newspaper are ch that the statements in that pa her will be believed by nobody un fbrtujttately thousands of persons are illinformed in this respect and be lieve the statements they jsee in Mint even though they appear in a newspaper published by Mr Pulitzer A member of the congress has actu i ally introduced a resolution in refer 1 ence to these charges I therefore lay all the facts before you Th tstol7 repeated at various times by If 4 World and by its followers in the newspaper press is substantially H aa follows That there was corrup d Â° oitby or on behalf of the govern ment of the United States in the transaction by which the Panama ftnal property was acquired from its French owners that there were im j jrpper dealings of some kind be tween agents of the government and j outside persons representing or act > ing for an American syndicate which jiid gotton possession of the French company that among these persons i J Who It was alleged made huge 1JItottts were Mr Charles P Taft a Irother of William H Taft then can tk ate for the presidency and Mr I Douglas Robinson my brotherinlaw that jlr Cromwell the counsel for sfce Panama canal company in the i F a ego tion S was in some way impli rated with the United States govern ment authorities in these important transactions that the government las concealed the true facts and has I destroyed or procured or agreed to the destruction of certain docu t ments that Mr W H Taft was sec retary of war at the time that by an agreement between the United States government and the beneficiaries or file Heal all traces thereof were i Wiped out by transferring all the I archives and Usecretsfo the Amer ican + government just before the hold 1ng pf the convention last June at which Mr Taft was nominated fi Says Stories Baseless i These statements sometimes ap f arpd to the editorials sometimes in tee news columns sometimes in the jlhape of contributions from indi ifflluals either unknown or known to 1e of > bad character They are false to every particular from beginning to yid The wickedness of the slanders fe only surpassed by their fatuity So mtterly baseless are the stories that apparently they represent in part rely material collected for cam jnaign purposes and in part storie originally concocted with a view of blackmailf The inventor of the story about Mr Charles P Taft for instance evi dently supposed that at some period of the Panama purchase Mr W H Taft was secretary of wart whereas in reality Mr W H Taft never be came secretary of war until long after the whole transaction in ques tion had been closed The inventor of the story about Mr Douglas Robinson had not taken the trouble to find out the fact that Mr Robinson had not had the slightest connection directly or indirectly of any kind or sort with any phase of Itlie Panama transaction from begin Wng to end The men who attacked JKr Root in the matter had not taken 4the trouble to read the public docu prents which would have informed them that Mr Root had nothing to do wjth the purchase which was entlr y arranged through the department of justice under the then Attorney General Mr Knox Now those stories I as a matter of fact need no investiga i tion whatever No shadow of proof has been or can be produced in be half of any of them They consist simply of a string of infamous libels In form they are in part libels upon Individuals upon Mr Taft and Mr i Robinson for instance But they are I in fact wholly and in form partly a libel upon the United States govern ment I dp not believe we should concern ourselves with the particu lar individuals who wrote the lying and libelous editorials articles from correspondents or articles in the news columns The real offender is Mr Joseph Pulitzer editor and pro prietor of the World While the criminal offense of which Mr Pulit zer has been guilty is in form a libel upon individuals the great injury done is inblackening the good name Kof the American people It should not be left to a private citizen to sue Mr Pulitzer for libel He should be prosecuted for libel by the govern mental authorities In point of en couragement of iniquity in point of infamy of wrongdoing there is noth ing to choose between a public ser vant who betrays his trust a public servant who is guilty of blackmail or theft or financial dishonesty of any kind and a man guilty as Mr Joseph Pulitzer has been guilty in this instance Itis therefore a high national duty to bring to justice this vilifier of the American people this man who wantonly and wickedly without one shadow of justification seeks to blacken the character of reputable private citizens and to con vict the government of his own coun ry in the eyes of the civilized world of wrongdoing of the basest and foul est kind when he has not one shadow of justification of any sort or de scription for the charge he has made Legal Action Threatened The attorney general has under consideration the form in which the proceedings against Mr Pulitzer shall be brought Meanwhile I submit to you all the accompanying papers so that you may have before you com plete information on the subject I call your attention to my communi a tions in my messages to the congress of Jan 20 1902 March 11 1903 Dec I 1903 Jan 4 1904 and Dec 17 lengththe the history of various phases of the I whole transaction I recall your at tention to the report and opinion of the attorney general rendered to me dated Oct 25 1902 with the accom panying documents and exhibits I call your attention to the correspond ence of the officers and agents of the Panama Canal company with the president and other officers of the United States printed in Senate Docu ment No 34 Dec 10 1902 Also to the copy of the official proceedings of the New Panama Canal company at Paris on the 30th of December 1903 together With a report of the council of administration of that company printed in Senate Document No i33 Jan 28 1904 and to the copy of the general conveyance by the new Pan ama Canal company to the United States also copies of certain tele grams from the president of the com pany making an offer of sale and At torney General Knoxs cablegram in response in Senate Document No 285 March 23 1906 I call your attention furthermore to the exhaustive testimony recorded in the public document Senate Docu ment No 401 Fiftyninth Congress Second Session which contains the searching investigation into the whole transaction made by the con gress for its information and fully considered by the congress before it took action In the act approved June 28 1902 uTo Provide For the Construction of a Canal Connecting the Waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans the congress provided as follows That the president of the United States is hereby authorized to ac quire for and on behalf of the United States at a cost not exceeding 40 000000 the rights privileges fran chises concessions grants of land right of way unfinished work plants and other property real personal and mixed of every name and nature owned by the new Panama Canal company of France on the isthmus of Panama and all its maps plans drawings records on the isthmus of Panama and in Paris Including all the capital stock not less however than 68663 shares of the Panama Railroad company owned by or held for the use and aid of the canal com pany provided a satisfactory title to all said property can be obtained Shareholders of No Concern It thereupon became the duty of the president in execution of thij statute to purchase the property specified from the New Panama Canal company of France provided he could obtain a satisfactory title The department of justice was in structed to examine the title and after such an examination Attorney General Knox reported that a satis factory title could be obtained Pay ment of the purchase price was there upon made to the New Panama Canal company In accordance with the act of the congress and the property was conveyed by that company to the United States It was no concern of the preside t or any officer of tlie executive department to inquire as to what the New Panama Canal com pany did with the money which it re ceived As a matter of fact the New Panama Canal company did dis tribute the money between its share holders and the shareholders of the preceding Panama Canal company in accordance with the decree of a French court and the records pt thY French courts show who were the shareholders who received I thff money but that is no concern ot ours I call your attention to the accom panying statement as to the attempt to form an American company in 1899 for the purpose of taking over the property of the French company This attempt proved abortive There was no concealment in its effort to put through this plan its complete failure and abandonment being known to everyone The important points set forth in the accompanying papers and in the papers to which I have referred you are as follows The investigation of the history physical condition and existing value of the enterprise by the congress re sulting in the enactment of the law of 1902 authorizing the president to acquire the property for the sum of 4000000Q upon securing a satis factory tiff and thereupon to under take the work of construction the failure of the Americanization of the enterprise in 1899 the transmission by me to the congress from time to time of full information and advice as to the relatio s of this government to transit across the isthmus and un der the treaties as to the negotia tions and final acquisition of the title and later as to the progress and condition of the work of construction the previous authorization of the sale to the United States by the stock holders of the new company and their subsequent ratifications the examina tion and approval of the title by Mr Knox the arrangements for payment through J P Morgan Company as the fiscal agents of this govern ment and the payment accordingly at the bank of France upon proper official receipts to the liquidators act ing under the decree of the French court the French governmental body having jurisdiction in the matter 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT and finally the subsequent apportion ment and distribution of the fund to the creditors and stockholders of the two companies under that decree The Panama Canal transaction was actually carried through not by either the then secretary of state Mr John Hay or the then secretary of war Mr Elihu Root both of whom how ever were cognizant of all the es sential features but by the attorney general Mr P C Knox at present senator from Pennsylvania I di rected or approved every action and am responsible for all that was done in carrying out the will of the con gress and the provisions of the law enacted by congress after exhaustive examination and discussion were scrupulously complied with by the ex ecutive i Cromwells Part While the transaction was pending Ksaw Mr Cromwell but two or three times and my communications with him were limited to the exchange of purely formal courtesies Secretary Hay occasionally saw him in the same manner I doubt whether Mr Root held any conversation with him The attorney general saw him fre quently ache was counsel for the Panama company Their communica tions were official as representing the two sides I enclose copies of my correspondence with Mr William Dudley Foulke who first brought these scandalous stories to my atten tion and with Senator Knox and Mr Cromwell to whom I wrote in re sponse to the request of a gentleman who wished to know about the stock holders in the Panama Canal com pany The title to the Panama Canal pro perties wa vested in the new Pana ma Canal company of France which was the legal owner thereof and the old or socalled DeLessep company had a largt equity therein The title Was not in a New Jersey company nor in any other American company nor did this have any deal ings with any American company throughout the affair The exact le gal status to the most minute detail appears in the exhaustive opinion of Attorney General Knox approving the title to be given to the United Stages which clearly establishes that the only party dealt with was the New Panama Canal company of France with the c currence of the liquida tor of the oM company and not any American corporation or syndicate Title Was Clear j The action of the United States government was of course wholly un influenced by and had nothing what ever to do with any question as to who were or who had been the se curity holders of either the new or the old company Who such security holders we e was not our affairs If as a matter of fact the canal com pany either or both had been own I ed by American a citizens tbY cite zens otany other nationality itj would not have altered in the slight st degree the action taken by this government Our concern was to get I the canal property which was owned by the French company and to see I that the title was clear Our transac tions were carried on openly and j were published in detail and we I dealt solely so far as the interests I of the other Panama company were werej concerned with the liquidator ap pointed by the proper French government ernment body the civil tribunal of the Seine and in accordance with the decree of this sane tribunal with the New Panama Canal company which also went into liquidation upon the sale to the United States I All our transactions were carried on openly and were published In de tail The distribution of our payment of 40000000 follows the award of the arbitrator chosen by the new company and the liquidator author ized by the decree of this same civil tribunal of the Seine and providing for a dissemination of the proportion ate division between the new and old companies We paid the money through the New York banking house of Messrs J P Morgan Company acting asfiscal agents of this govern ment into the Bank of France in Paris The receipts and accounts of our treasury department show the payment of the money into the Bank of Franco and account for the money being paid over to the liquidator ap pointed by tho civil tribunal of the Seine and to the Now Panama Canal company of France the proportion of the 40000000 being 128600000 francs to the liquidator of the old company and 77400000 francs to the New Panama Canal company theI France in liquidation In these pay ments we followed to the letter the decree of the governmental tribunal of France which had the authority to make such a decree the civil tribunal of the Seine We had neither desire nor authority to go behind this de cree of this proper governmental body as all the conflicting rights of the security holders of both com panies had been settled by the decree of said court by ratifications of arbi tration which resulted in that divi sion Distribution of the Money I wish to make as clear as possible and as emphatic as possible the statement that we did not have any thing to do with the distribution of a dollar of the 40000000 we paid as regards any stockholder or bond holder of the French companies save that we followed out the award of the arbitrators appointed in accordance with the decree of the French court which had dealt with the subject in awarding a 1 proportion to the old company and a certain proportion to t e new company Any question con cerning the stockholders bondhold ers or other beneficiaries of the pro ceeds of sale was purely a question for the civil tribunal of the Seine the French governmental body with which this nation had nothing what ever to do Under these circum stances there was not the slightest need for Mr Cromwell to give any information on the subject of the company for which he had been coun sel This government has no con cern with Mr Cromwells relation to these companies or either of them or with the amount of his profession al It was not the af fair of this government to inquire who were the security holders of the companies Nevertheless of his own accord he has submitted to me to gether with a copy of his statement published on the 11th instant and which I transmit herewith a full list of the stockholders of the New Pan ama canal company of France on Jan 15 1900 numbering over 6000 and a list of all stockholders who were present at a special meeting of the company held Feb 28 1902 im mediately after the cable offer of the company was made to the United States Jan 911 1902 to accept the appraisement of 40000000 made by the isthmian canal commission and to sell for said sum the Panama canal concessions and other prop erty and tue shares of the Panama Railroad company He has also fur nished me a certified copy of the final report of the liquidator of the old company which was filed on June 25th last and formally approved by the civil tribunal of the Seine to gether with a summary account pre pared and signed by said liquidator as late as the 24th ultimo I also transmit a translation of the two resolutions with the vote upon them adopted at a meeting of the stockholders of the new company held on April 23 1904 for the purpose of finally ratifying the sale All these documents herewith transmit as a part of this message No Payments On Old Stock It appears from them that the creditors of the old company number 226296 parties who have received dividends out of the funds in the hands of the liquidator who in his let ter states that in this present month of December the second and last dis tribution to the creditors will be be n and that the average dividend heretofore paid to each individual was 782 francs or 156 NP pay ment whatever was or will be made upon the stock of the old company as it was worthless from the day De L sseps failed and this cuts out from consideration all misleading state ments regarding a possible purchase by anybody of the stock of the Olu Panama Canal company It has not received and will not receive a penny Even upon the bonded indebtedness the the dividend I am thus informed will amount in the aggregate to only about ten per centum It likewise plainly appears that this distribution ot r f by the liquidator of the Old company has been openly conducted at his f office in Paris No 50 Rue Etienne Marcel where all the receipts ac counts and records fhls payments are on file The New Panama Canal company of France is in liquidation as the ac companying papers set forth This liquidated company received as its proportion of the 40000000 the sum of 77000000 france and this was distributed by the liquidation in three payments through four leading banks of Paris covering a period of the past four years and to shareholders numbering about 6000 Every step of the transaction was not only taken publicly but was contemporaneously therewith advertised in the legal and financial papers or France and the banks making the payments took proper receipts from all the parties to whom payments were made as is customary in such cases The capital of the New Panama Canal company of France was 65000 000 francs and the distribution thus made amounted to about 130 francs on each share of 100 francs No divi dends were paid during the 10 years of the companys existence It there fore resulted that the shareholders only recovered their original Invest ment with annual interest of about three per cent The accounts and records of this liquidation which was concluded in June last are on deposit with the Credit Lyonnaise of Paris as a proper custodian of the same appointed up on such liquidation Recently a re quest was made by a private indi vidual to inspect the records of these payments but answer was made by custodians that they saw no proper reason for granting such request by a stranger and inasmuch as thee is not the slightest ground for sus picion of any bad faith in the trans action it hardly seems worth while to make the requests but if the con gress desires I have no doubt that on the requestof our ambassador in Paris the lists of individuals will be shown him himSays Says Nothing to Probe As a matter of fact there is noth ing whatever in which this govern ment is interested to investigate about this transaction So far as this government is concerned every step of the slightest importance has been made public by its executive and every step taken in France has there been made public by the proper offi cials The congress took the action it did take after the most minute and exhaustive examination and discus sion and the executive carried out the direction of the congress to the letter Every act of this government every act for which this government had the slightest responsibility was yln pursuance of the act of the con gress here and following out the de cree of the civil tribunal of the Seine I in France Furthermore through the I entirely voluntary act of Mr Crom I well I am now able to present to you full information as to these actions in France with which this govern ment did not have any concern and which are set forth in the accompany ing papers It may be well to recall that the New Panama Canal company of France did not itself propose to fix the figure 40000000 as the valua tion of the canal and railroad proper ties That sum was first fixed by our isthmian canal commission in its re ports to the congress after two years of investigation and personal inspec tion of all the properties and work al ready done whereby the properties and the work done were in detail ap praised at that sum as their value to the United States The French com pany steadily refused for over two years to make any offer whatever in answer to the many written requests of the isthmian canal commission and when its president did approach the question of price it was on the basis of 109000000 Later under conditions not necessary now to re hearse the company by cable accept ed the appraisement of 40000000 made by our commission This government therefore acquir ed all the properties and concessions both of canal and railroad at its own valuation and price the congress ap proving the price and authorizing the expenditure of the money after the most exhaustive examination and dis cussion I transmit herewith lists and docu ments in the possession of the depart ment of state the department of jus tice and the department of war so that if the congress sees fit it may di rect that they be printed They are and always have been open to the ex amination of any member of the con gress There Is no object in printing them but there Is also no objection to printing them save that it Is a use less expense I also transmit a list of the docu ments furnished by Mr Cromwell
