UKItIlTMi:XT OK JISTICE Ilet-nmmeiid the Abolition of the Fee Jylen Other it ait cut ions. The report of the attorney-general con tains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the department of Justice for the past year, toyethr with certain recommendations ad to needed legislation of various subject. I cannot too htartlly indorse the proposition that th fee sys tem as applicable to the compensation of Vnited States attorney, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States com missioners, should he abolished with as lit tle dlay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the busi ness of th court, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively conducted as the ends of justice will al low. The system ! thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials depend upon th-f volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict be tween the proper execution of the law anil private gain which can not fall to be dan gerous to the rights and freedom of the citizen and an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If. in addition to this reform, another was inaugurated which would Rive to l'nited State.- commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the Krade of misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a fcreat advance would be male toward a. more decent administration of the crim inal law. In my first message f eontrress. dated lKc. K. lV.i, I strongly recommended these charges, and referred somewhat at length to tiie evils of the present system. Since that tin.e the criminal business of th federal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased. The number of critnin.il prosecutions pending in th circuit and district courts of the United States the 1st day of July. lvO, wa.s ö.sos. f which I.VnI were for violations of the Internal revenue laws, while the number of sueh prosecutions pending on the 1st day of July. l:.: was 9.ö. in whieh 4.J-X wer for violations of th internal reve nue 1 iws. The expense of the United States courts, exclusive of ji)lar's' salaries, for the year ending July 1. ISs", was $.". 74.7X1.11. and for the year ending July 1, lwi. was It.r.J.S.tfTil.ST. It was. therefore, apparent that the reasons given In l- for a change 'n the manner of enforcing the federal criminal law have gained cogency and strength by lapse of time. I a 'so heartily j"in tiie attorney-general !n recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within federal Jur llietion. as has leen done in many of the states, authorizing writs of error on behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question aris ing before actual trial, limiting the right of review in cases of felony, punishable only by tine and imprlsoi ment to the cir cuit court of appeals, and making; speedy provisions for the construction of such prisons an 1 reformatories as may be neces ary for the confinement of l'nited States convicts.

POSTAL MFIIVICK. F. fleet of the Hminew Strlngeury' Felt nellcleney lu IteeelptN. The report of the postmaster-general con tains a detailM statement of the operations of the postofüce department during the last fiscal year, and much interesting in formation touching this important branch of the public service. The business of the mails indicate with absolute certainty the condition of the business of the country, und depression in financial affairs Inevi tably and quickly reduces the postal reve nues. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between the jostofrtce receipts and expenditures is the expected ami unavoid able result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the coun try during much of the time covered by the postmaster-general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predcessor that the defi ciency on th 2'ith day of June, 1S03. would I? but a littl" over Jl..Vio,t. It amounted however, to more than $r.,ijnv.i. At the same tlm and under the Influence of like anticipations, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June So. 1MM, "which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of J71'.'J 15.71; but now. in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the current fiscal year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that at its close, instead of a surplus, there will be a deficiency of nearly $.!'.!. The postollice receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $".fO'..':.K. and its ex penditures to Sl.f74,U'l.Pi). This post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter was carried free through the mails, an Item cf which Is upward of three hundred tons of-seeds and grains from tiie agricultural department. The total number of postofllces in the United States on the 3oth day of June. lMW. was f..4'3, an Increase of l.Svt over the preceding year. Of those 3,3ti) were presidential, an increase in that class of L''4 over the preceding year. Forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free delivery on June 3), 1S:3. Ninety-three other cities and towns are cow entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of In sufficient funds to meet the expense of Its establishment. I am of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as general an Introduction of this feature of the mail service as is necessary or Justl liable and that it ought not to be ex tend! to smaller communities than are now designated. The expense of free delivery for the fiscM year ending June uo. 14. will be more than eleven million dollars, and under legisla tion now existing there must re a constant Increase in this jtfm of expenditure. There were 6.4l additions to the doraestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest Increase in any year since the inauguration of the system. The total numter of these offices at the close of the year was Kl".4. There were 13.3CS. 733 money orders issued from these otflces. being an increase over the preceding year of 1.242M, and the value of these ord:m amounted to J127.&7fi.4"3.w. an increase of $7.&.fa2.M. There was also paid during the year postal notes amounting to 112,903. 07. 73. During the year 133 international money order offices were added to those tJready provided, making a total of 2, H7 In opera tion on June 3. 1W. The number of inter national money orders issued during the year was l.(fi.V.9. an increase over the pre ceding year of and their value was XK341.S..7.s;. an increase of $1.221.r,i;.3L The number r,f orders paid was 3.m,3i7, an in crease over the preceding year of 13,53. and their value was $.".23,373.70, an increase of r4.'4.K3. From this statement it ap pears tnat the total issue o: money orders and postal notes for the year arnounte! to S1.'6.r'1.34.24. The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,3....tj 1. an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent. The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to V.37.SG9.30 and the messengers fees ' paid for their de'i-.rv arrounf-d t- $j5k r,r ti having a j.iofit t th gov rnmen- of i80,S79. The railwaj mall service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all .fnces. but it Is the especial instrumental ity which puts the smaller and way-places In the service on an equality In that re gard with the larger and terminal offices. This r.ranch of the postal service has therefore received much attention from the postmaster-general, and though it is grati fying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness. I am led to agree with the postmaster-general that there Is room for further Improve ment. There are now connected to the postoffice establishment 2i.3:'4 employe who are In the classified service. The head of this great department gives conclusive evi dence of the value of civil service reform when, after an experience that renders his t uament on th subject absolutely relta- ie, ne expresses the opinion thet without the benefit of this system it would Jxi im possil.le to conduct the vast business In trusted to him. I deslro to command as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestions of the post ma-ster-general relating to a more sen sible ar. 1 business-like organisation and a better distribution of responsibility in his department. IlKiRTlKT OF TMK AW. Progress In the Conat raetlwn of .eir Veel E xperl m en tm. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his department during the past year, and ex hibits a most gratifying; condition of the F personnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which has been made in the construction of ves sels, and makes a number of recommenda tions to which attention is especially in vited. During the past six months the de mands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolu- Hons calling for vessels to protect Amerl ! can interests In Nicaragua, Guatemala. Costa Itica. Honduras, Argentine and l!ra rll, while the condition of affairs in Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our navy it becomes necessary, in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Hering eea under the modus vivendi aKreed upon with Great Hritain. to detail to that service one vessel from the fish commission and three from the revenue marine. ; Urogress In the construction of new ves I sols has not been as rapid as was anticl i Dated. There have been delays In the completion of unarmored vessels, but for the most part th-y have been such as are constantly occurring, even In counries having the largest experience in naval ship building. The most erlous delays, how ever, nave been In the work upon armored ships. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now. however, to have 1 teen all overcome and armor is being de livered with satisfactory promptness. As a result of the experience acquired by shin-builders and designers and material men. it is believed that the dates when vessels will be completed can now be es timated with reasonable accuracy. Great guns, rapid-fire guns, torpedoes and pow der are being promptly supplied. The fol lowing vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready for service: The double-turreted coast defence moni tor Mlantonomah, the double-turreted coast defense monitor fonterey, the ar mored cruiser New York, the protected cruisers I'.altimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark. San Francisco, Charleston. At lanta and l?oston. the cruiser Detroit, the j gunhoats orktown. I nnrorJ, isennlngton. I Machias. Castlne and Petrel, the dispatch : vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Han ' croft, and the dynamite gunboat Vesuvius, j Of Ihcsn the Iiancroft, Machlas, Detroit and Castlne have been placed in commis I sion during the current calendar year. I The following vessels are In process of construction: The second -class battleships ' Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery I and Marblehead. the coast defense moni tors Terror, Puritan, AmphUrtte and Mon I adnok. all of which will be completed with in one year; the harbor defense ram Kat ahdina. and the protected cruisers Colum bia. Minneapolls. Olympia. Cincinnati and Jialeigh. all of which will be completed prior to July 1. lxd; the first-class battle ships Iowa. Indiana. Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be .completed Feb. 1, 1. and the armored ' cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by Aug. 1. of that year. It Is also expected that the three gunboats authorized by the last congress will be completed In less than two years. Since 1KSÖ congress has, at each session, authorized the building of one or more vessels, and the secretary of the navy presents an earnest plea for the continu ance of this plan. He recommends the authorization of at least one battle ship and six torpedo boats. While I am Ois tinctly In favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated of building up a thorough ami efficient navy. I can not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into ac count the number of unfinished vessels ort our hands, and the depleted condition of our treasury in considering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin tiew work. The method of employing mechanical labor at navy yards through boards of labor and making efficiency the sole test by which latorers are employed and con tinued, is producing the best results, and the secretary is earnestly devoting him self to its development. Attention Is invited to the statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system. 

DEPAHTMBXT OF Till-: IVTKUIOK. Effort to Ileflre I nwortliy nml Frna tlulent Prnnlunrr The Indiana. The secretary of the Interior has the supervision of so many important subjects that his report is ot especial value and interest. . On the Hoth day of June. 1S:C, there were on the pension rolls JHW.012 names, an- in crease of 89.914 over the number on the rolls June Z 1S91 Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revo lutionary soldiers, 5,425 survivors and wid ows of soldiers of the war of 1S12, 21.518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3.&S2 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 2S4 army nurses, and 473,ßir survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The latter number represents those pen sioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, tH?3, who were pensioned under the act of June 27, which al lows pensions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 450,i."iö. The number added to the rolls during the year was l23.t34. and the num ber dropped was 33.Gi. The first pay ments on pensions allowed during the year amounted to 9.7'..öH4.98. This includes arrears, or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of pen sions dates and the time of actually grant ing the certificates. Although the law of 1S permits pensions for disabilities not related to military service, yet as a requi site to Its benefits a disability must exist. Incapacitating applicants from "the per formance of manual lalxr to such a de gree as to render them unable to earn a support." Kxecution of this law In Its early stages does not seem to have been In accord with its true Intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute, and since that time this construction has been followed. This has had the effect of limit ing the operation of the law to Its In tended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put on the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the commissioner suspended pay ments upon a number of pension.-! which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized, pending a complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the Justice of their claims, not withstanding apparent invalidity This, I understand, is the practice which has for a long time prevailed in the pen sion bareau. but after entering upon tnese recent Investigations the commissioner modind this rule so as not to allow, until after a complete examination, Interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that au thorized by law. I am unable to under stand why fraudi in the pension rolls should not be exjosed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a Wicke! imposition upon the kindly senti ment In which pensions have their origin. Every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen: every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pensioners rob the people, not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the sur vivors of a war, fought for the preserva tion of the union, ought to inspire. Thou sands of neigh borhTods have their well known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish ap palling conspiracies to accomplish pen sion frauds. H no means the least wrong done Is to brave and deserving pensioners who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who attempt. In the line of duty, to rectify these wrongs should not lx accused of enmity or in difference to the claims of honesty. The sum expended on account of pen sions forMhe Year ending June 30, 1SD3. was $1.6.74,4'7.14. The commissioner estimates that ll'i.'i.O'in.O.in wilt be required to pay pen sions durin the year end tu June 30, Condition of the Indiana. The condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which are re lated to a sacred duty of the government, and which strongly appeal to the sense of Justice and the sympathy of our people. Our Indians number about 218,000. Most of them are located on 161 reservations, con taining 86.116,531 acres of land. About HO.OoO of these Indians have, to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. I .a nds in sev eral territories have been allotted to many of them. Such allotments have been made to 10.000 individuals during the last fiscal year, embracing about one million acres. The number of Indian government schools oiend during the yeur was 1!C, an Increase Of twelve over the Drecel!ng yeur. Of this total 170 were on reservations, of which seventy-three were boarding school and ninety-seven were day schools. Twenty boarding schools and five (Lay schools, supported by the government, were not located on reservations. The total number of Jndian children enrolled during the year as attendants of all schools was 21,133, an Increase of 1,231 over the. enrollment for tne previous year. I am sure that secular, education and moral and religious teaching must be Im portant factors In any effort to save the maian and lead him to civilization. I be- i.lieve. too, that the relinquishment of tribal relations, and the holding or land in sev eralty may. In favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seems to me. how ever, that allotments of land in severalty ought to be made with irreat care If has tily done, before the Indian kTiows its : meaning, while yet he has little or no iaea or tilling a larm. and no conception . of thrift, there Is great danger that a res- . ervatton Ufa In tribal relations may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization, , Instead of Its Independence and elevation. The solution of the Indian probier de pends very largely. uoon good administra tion. The personal fitness of scents and their adaptability to he peculiar duty of caring ror tneir wards, is or tne utmost im portance. The law providing that, except in especial cases, ar.ry officers shall be detailed as Indian agents. It Is honed will prove a successful experiment. There Is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims for Indian depreda tions, and I recommend that every possible safeguard be provided against tne enforce ment of unjust and fictitious claims of . this description. The appropriations on J account of the Indian bureau for the year ending June 30, 1S4, amount to 7.94.962.09, a decrease as compared with the year pre ceding it of $087.131.95. To Ifeeerve the Public Lnnita. The vast area of land which but a short time ago constituted the public domain is rapidly falling Into private hands. It Is certain that in the transfer the beneficient I intention of the government to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy home-seekers Is often frustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who, with their families, are Invited by the government to settle on the public lands is a despicable character, who ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart his schemes. The re cent opening to settlement of the lands In the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 6.S0tf,UJ acres, notwithstanding the ut most care In framing the regulations gov erning the locations and notwithstanding the presence of l'nited States troops, fur nished us an exhibition, though, perhaps, in a modified degree, of the mad, scram ble, the violence, and the fraudulent occu pation which have accompanied previous openings of public land. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these out rageous incidents cannot be entirely .pre vented without a change in the latfä on the subject, and I hope his recommenda tions in that direction will be favorably considered. I especially commend to the attention of the congress the statements contained In the secretary's report concerning forestry. The time has come when efficient meas ures should be taken for the preservation of our forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction. UEPAH1.MEXT OF AGItlCVLTlHE. Economical Reforms by Secretary Morton Exports and Imports , , The report of the secretary of agricalturt will be found exceedingly Interesting, es pecially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned In agricultural occu pations. On the 7th day of March, ISM. there were upon its pay-rolls 2,130 employes o the de partment. This number has been reduced, to 1.KJÖ persons. In view of a depleted pub lic treasury and imperative demand of the people for economy In the administration of their government, the secretary has en tered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by eliminating from the pay rolls of all persons not neede? for an effi cient conduct of the affairs of the depart ment. During the first quarter of the pres ent fiscal year the expenses of the depart ment aggregated $345,876.76. as against $402. 012.42 for the corresponding period of the fiscal year ending June 30. 1S93. The secre tary makes apparent his Intention to con tinue this rate of reduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year, less by $w4.2?o than those for the present year. Among the heads of divisions of this de partment the changes have been exceed ingly few. These vacancies, occurring from death and resignations, have been filled by the promotions of assistants In the same divisions. These promotions of ex perienced and faithful assistants have not only been in the interest of efficient worL. but have suggested to those In the depart ment who look for retention and promo tion, that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for the bureau of animal industry for the current year is $.')'i"; the estimate for the ensuing year Is $!toK.noo. The regulations of 12. concern ing Texas fever, have been enforced during the last year, and the large stock yards cf the country have been kept free from In fection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such as could have been ef fectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle. While contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradi cated, animal tuberculosis, a disease wide spread and more dangerous to human life than pleuro-pneumonia, is still prevalent. Investigations have been made during the past year as to the means of its communi cation and the method of its correct diag nosis. Much progress has been made In this direction by the studies of the division of animal athology, but the work ought to be extended In co-operation with local au thorities, until the danger to human life arising from this cause Is reduced to a minimum. The number of animals arriving from Canada during the year and Inspected by bureau officers was 461, 072, and the num ber from transatlantic countries was 1.297. No contagious diseases were found among the Imported animals. The total number of Inspections of cattle for export during the past fiscal year was 611.342. The ex ports show a falling off of about 25 per cent, from the preceding year, the de crease occurring entirely In the last half of the year. This suggests rthat the falling off may have been largely due to an In crease in the price of American export cattle. During the year ending June 30, ISM. exports of Inspected pork aggregated 20.677.410 pounds, as against 3S.152.K74 pounds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported for I8?t being 66T.4i.6l pounds, while In 18P3 it was only 627.3S6.6J6 pounds. I join the secretary In recommending that hereafter each applicant for the posi tion of inspector or assistant Inspector in the bureau of animal industry be required, as a condition precedent to his appoint ment, to exhibit to the United States civil service commission his diploma from an established, regular and reputable veterin ary college, and that his appointment be supplemented by such an examination in veterinary science as the commission may prescribe. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30, IS'2, attained the enor mous figure of $S"0,oO,000 In round num bers, being 78.8 per cent, of our total ex ports. In the last fiscal year this aggre gate was greatly reduced, but, neverthe less, reached $615,0i0,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports, with special reference to their destination, will show that In almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Eritain and Ireland ab sorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle the total exports aggregated In value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S&3, $26, 000. 0. of which Great Britain took con siderable over $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports were ,$2S,üuflf 000. of which Great Hritain took $24.ou0,000. Of other products the total exports were-f-x4.nnO.niin, of which Great Britain -took $7j3.0 10,000. In breadatuffs. cotton and minor products like proportions sent to the same destination are shown. The work of the statistical division of the department of agriculture deals with all that relates to the economics of farm ing. The main purpose of its monthly re ports is to keep the farmers Informed as fully as possible of all matters having any Influence upon the world's markets in which their products find sale. Its publi cations re'ate especially to ; the commer cial side of farming. It Is, therefore, of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States, who rep resent nearly one-half of our population, and also of direct interest to the whole country, that the work of this division be efficiently performed, and that the informa tion it has gathered be. promptly diffused. It is a matter for congratulation to know that the secretary will not tpare any effort to make this part of the work thcoughly useful. Distribution or Meeds. v In the year 1833 congress appropriated. $1.000. to be taken from the patent : office funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare and Improved varieties of seeds, and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and procuring agricultural statistic. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of agri culture has grown to Its precent unwieldy and unjustifiably extravagant proportions. During the btst fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $tt.548.61. The re-, .malnder of an appropriation of $l35.ooo was expended In printing the maps and dis tributing ' them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and -Im- J proved. Värietle's''of seeds for gratuitous dis tribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the purchase and dis tribution by members of., congress of or dinary seedä, bulbs and cuttings which are common In all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtained at low prices. In each : state and territory an agricul tural experiment station -has been estab lishedv These stations, by their very char acter and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and yet this Indiscriminate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators continues, answering no pur pose unless to remind constituent's that their " representatives are willing to re member them with gratuities at the public cost. Under the sanction ol existing legis lation' there was sent out from the agri cultural department during" the last fiscal year enough jt cabbage seed to plant 19,'JuO aores of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4.U00 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,.rno atres, sweet corn enough to plant1 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2.025 acres with vines and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant 675 acres.. The total quantity of flowers and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained in more than nine million pack ages and they were sufficient, if planted, to cover 8t.r&6 acres of land. In view of these facts, this enormous ex penditure without legitimate returns of benefit, ought to be abolished.1 Anticipat ing a consummation so manifestly In the Interest of good administration, more than $100.000 has been stricken from the esti mate made' to cover this object for the year ending June 3i, lsyl; and the secre tary recommenda that the-remaining $35.000 of estimate be confined strictly to the pur chase of . new and lmproed varieties of seeds, and . that these be distributed through experimenting stations. Thus the need will be tested, and after the test has teen completed by the experimenting sta tion the propogatlnn of the useful varie ties and the rejection of the valueless may safely be. left to the common sense of the people. civiii SEnvicrj nEFomi. Statuary Effect of the Luit Which Is Founded on Common Sense. The continued Intelligent execution of the civil service law and the. increased ap proval" by the people of Its operation are inost .gratifying. The recent extension of itjj limitations and regulations to the em ployes at free delivery postoffices, which has been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission, with the hearty co-operation of the postmaster-general, is an immensely important advance In the usefulness of the system. I am. if possi ble, more than ever convinced 'Of the in calculable benefits conferred rby the civil service law, not only In Its effect upon the fmblic service, Imt also, what Is even more mportant, in Its effect in elevating the tone of political life generalty. The course of civil service reform in this country Instructively and interestingly illustrates how . strong a hold a movement gains upon our people whieh has tinder lying a sentiment of justice and right, and which at the same time promises a better administration of their government. The law embodying this reform found its way to, our statute books, more from fear of the popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any love of the reform Itself on the part , of legislators; .and it has lived, and grown, and flourished In spite of the covered as well as -open hos tilities of spoilsmen, and notwithstanding the querulous impractibility of many self constitued guardians. Beneath all the va garies and sublimated theories, which are attracted to it, there underlies this reform a sturdy, common-sense principle, not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing, to be absolutely essential to the most successful operation of their government and its-perpetuity. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform as well as with Its best enforcement, to oblige the commission to rely for clerical assist ance upon clerks detailed from other -departments. There ought not to be such a condition In any department that clerks hired to do work -there can be spared to habitually , workat- another place, and it does not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform that persons should be employed on the theory that their labor Is necessary in one. department, when, in point of fact, their services are devoted to entirely different Work in another depart ment. I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry, on the work of the com mission be regularly put upon . Its roster, and that the system of obliging the com missioners to- rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other departments be discontinued. This -ought not to increase the expanse . to. Jh4 . government, i while it would certainly''' he" 'more' consistent and add-greatly to-the etliciency of the com mission.. . ,i . j I'Oll 

TARIFF. ItKFOIlM. The Supreme 1)uty of the Pnrly to Act In the People'a Behalf. Economy in public expenditure is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those Intrusted with .the control of money drawn from "the eople for public uses. It must be confessed that our -apparently endless resource the familiarity of our people with Immense accumulations of wealth, the growing 'sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some manner he to their imme diate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost stealthy, manner In which a large part of our taxes are exacted and a degenerated sense' of official accountability have led to growing extravagance In gov ernmental appropriations. At this time, when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a struggle for the necessities of life, and when forced .economy is pressing upon the great mass.of our countrymen, I de sire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that congressional legisla tion be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and-a sympathy with the straitened circumstances of our fellow citizens. The -duty Of public economy Is also of Immense Importance in its intimate and necessary relatlono the task now in hand of providing revenue to 'meet government expenditures, and yet reducing the peo ple's burden of federal taxation. After a hard struggle tariff,, reform is directly be fore us. Nothing soi Important claims our attention, and notlrtng so clearly presents Itself, as both an opportunity -and a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow-citizens and a duty Imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions, and bV the emphatic mandate of the peo ple. After a full discussion our country men have spoken In favor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hand of those who are solemnly pledged to it. - If. there Is anything In the theory of a representation in public places of the peo ple and their desires, if public officers are servants of the people, and if tolitical firomise and professions have any bind ng force, our failure to give- the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention ct disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise and care ful legislation. - . While V should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and otner renerai taxation, ana that they should be limited -by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that con ditions have grown up among us which. In Justice and fairness, call for discrimin ating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people dlpectly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduc tion in presenti tariff charges upon the necessaries t?f life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and substan tial, seen and felt by thousands, who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered.. These gifts should ba the willing benefactions of a government whose highest function Is the promotion ot the welfare of the people. . ioi IMS cioseiy reiaiea to our peoples prosperity anil well-being Is the removal of restrictions upon the Importation of raw materials necessary to our manufact ures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal legislation, through the imposition -of high tariff,- forbids to American .manufacturer as cheap mater ials as those used by their competitors. It Is quite obvious that the enhancement of the? price of our manufactured products resulting from, this policy, not Only con fines the market for those products within our own bor'lers-ta.the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor .are , certainly, though indirectly; In volved In this feature of our tu-rift system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our -manufacturers to supply the llmitea demand for tneir goois. soon fill the narrow market to which they are con fined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of em ployes, and distress In the homes of our worKingmerh H,ven-ir tne orten disproved assertion .could be made good, that a lower rate of wages xrould result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the in telligence of pur workingmea leads them. to discover that their steady empbwrment. permitted by free raw materials. 1 the most important factor In their relation to tariff legislation. The "Wilson Dill. .A measure has been prepared by the J propriate congressional commtttee em bodying tariff reform on the lines herea suggested,, which will be promptly sub mitted for legislative action.. It la the re sult of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe It deals with Its subjects con sistently and as thoroughly as . existing conditions permit. I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation, added to existing In ternal revenue taxation, will In the near future, though, perhaps, not- Immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The committee, after full consideration, and - to provide against n, temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts Itself to the new tariff schedules, has wisely embraced In Its plan a few addi tional Internal revenue taxes. Including a small tax upon Incomes derived from cer tain corporate Investments. These new assessments are not only, but absolutely. Just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable busi ness disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff , reform and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal de sires and ambitions to the general good. The local Interests affected by the pro posed reform are so numerous and so varied that If all are insisted upon the leg islation embodying the reform must in e1tably fail. In conclusion my Intense feeling of re sponsibllity Impels me to invoke, for the manifold interests of a generous and con fiding people, the most scrupulous care and pledge my willing support to every legis lative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country. GUOVER CLEVELAND. WASHINGTON, Dec 4. It is not often that the public awaits a presi dent's message with the Intense Inter est which has been manifested- In the document today sent to congress. The message was listened to with close at tention in both houses and the views of members on the document are perti nent and interesting Just at this time. Senator Voorhees "In the main the message Is a sound, strong document. I have not examined it critically and cannot go into details. I think It will be well received by the country. Senator McPberson "It is excellent all the way through. I waa especially pleased with the recommendations in regard to the general finances and the tariff and as to the principles involved in the tariff bill." Senator Murphy "It la a good mes sage." Senator Palmer "The president goes more into detail than is usual with him. The suggestions are generally in the line of democratic thought. The paragraph relating to Hawaii merely showed the president's intention to take the ques tion up again. I have no especial ob jection to what he says regarding pen sions, but I have an idea that his Im pressions are wide of the .mark con cerning fraudulent pensions. I do not know how it is among the colored er. soldiers of the South, but iry. Informa tion leads me to believe that In the North not 2 per cent, of the 'pensions are fraudulent." Senator Kyle "There was nothing striking In the message, though it con tained some good points. I was pleased with its recommendations for an income tax, but what he said about Hawaii and his recommendation concerning the Is suance of bonds were not to my liking." Senator Morrill "The president's in dorsement of a tariff bill not yet agreed upon in committee was vvy unexpected, and remarkable." Senator Hoar "It was a most remark able message in several respects. It treats the important questions affecting the welfare of the country feebly and briefly. The imputation of the presi dent concerning tivllservlce reform to the effect that the law was enacted be cause of fear of public opinion and not, because of the conviction of the legis lators who enacted it Is Without pre cedent. This reflection comes with an ill grace from a president who has dealt, as the existing president has dealt, vvith the consular service of the United States without even taking advice of his secre tary of state and whose appointment of Van Alen has been such an offense to the country's sense of decency." Senator Mitchell of Oregon "I was very much surprised to learn from the message's reference to Hawaii that the proposition is really entertained by the administration to re-enthrone the queen. The Wilson bill, which the president in dorses, strikes a fatal blow at all the in dustries of the Pacific coast." Senator Hale "The message Is made up of details. As to Hawaii he leaves that to the future. We expected him to favor the Wilson bill, and the re publicans are opposed to It." Senator Power "I understand the message was printed In London this morning. It should have been given out there yesterday so our British neigh bors could have had time to tell u what to do about it." Senator Hawley "The message- lacks vigor and Is a disappointment. The president's talk about tariff Is common place in the extreme and his remarks concerning the work of the ways and means committee are not Justified by any information the country- has. There have been no meetings of the full com mittee to consider some of these ques tions." . . Senator Jones of Nevada "The mes sage contains no suggestions or recom mendations which hold out any 'hope for sliver wl.lle the present administration Is in power." Senator riatt "It scarcely deserves comment." Have Yon Asthma?- Dr. R. Schiffmann, St. Paul. Minn., will mall a trial package of Sehlffmann's Asthma Cure free to any sufferer.

The neadinar of the 31esang;e In the Senate and Houae Scenes In the Two Hodleie Flower for Some of the Member Some Disappointed at the Amount of Spare Devoted to the Hawaiian Question. BUREAU OF THE SEXTINEL,, WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4. Congress convened today with the usual formality and the capacity of the galleries was tried by the crowds that throng-ed to hear President Cleveland's view on national matters and his In struction to congress. After the reading of the message sor rowful announcement was made of the death of the two noted Pennsylvania members, 0'Nil and Lilley. Adjourn ment in respect of the deceased pre cluded any discussion or consideration cf the ways and means report. . Mr. Bynum was accosted by The Sen tlntl for his views upon the revenue feature of the new tariff bill, and while he questions the propriety of giving in formation upon euch features, he ex pressed an opinion that the bill now In the hands of the committee on ways and means ready to be reported, contains all that will be embodied in it as a tariff reform measure. Another Revenue BUI eoear-. Mr. Bynum says that another bill will necessarily be drawn to include the revenue provisions, but when such a measure will be ready for presentation he cannot foretell. The falling of Speaker Crisp's gavel found not only the Indiana members who remained In Washington during the recess In their seats, but all the others who also enjoyed a vacation of more or less extentlon were likewise ready to proceed with the new business. While the Hon. Jason Brown has been here since Saturday he has been con fined to his home by some severe fever blisters on his mouth. His colleagues appear greatly refreshed by the rest Mr. Martin and Pension. Mr. Martin comes back with two very Important pension measures, which he introduced this afternoon, and being the first bills offered In this congress, they number one and two. His first bill de clares a. pension a vested right, and In sec. 1 he provides that the pension cannot be suspended for any time until due notice be given the pensioner that after full investigation he is found to be without title to his claims. Sec. 2 gives every pensioner or his attorney perfect right to inspect every paper in the case. The next section gives the right to appeal a case from the secre tary of the Interior and take it to th supreme court of the District of Co lumbia. The second bill prepared and intro duced by Mr. Martin Is of similar nature and defines sundry crimes against the United States In the administration of the pension laws. It provides punish ment of fine and imprisonment to any one making false statements to the pen sion department or to anyone making a false claim. This also applies to any person who makes a false statement to a pensioner concerning his pension to the effect that his pension has either been granted or refused. Mr. Martin does not think the pensioner should be scared in this manner and he is going to legislate to prepare him and secure a fair hearing. Other Miittrm. J. D. Murray, editor of one of the Peoria papers and secretary to Con gressman Bretz, and Mr. Brown's secre tary. Mr. Gladden, came in today.

The first ree-ular session of the Fifty- third congress convened at high noon today, pursuant to the constitutional nrovlslons. On some of the desks were floral designs and flowers, whose fra grance sweetened the atmosphere and un nn additional charm to the scene. On the desk of 1 the vice-president re posed a basket of rose?, while a hand some floral horse-shoe awaited Senator Voorhees. the gift of admiring friends. who also remembered his colleague. Senator Turple. All the senators present, with few ex ceptions, gave close attention when the reading of the president's, message was be run. Senator Cameron seemed at first more interested in a newspaper when the secretary began bis rather ar duous task, but soon laid it aside and ! afterward listened intently for a short time. Senator Dolph gave edtentlon to his old file of bills for a few moments, but pricked up his ears as tbv reading reached the Hawaiian paragraph.

There was a gemral hanging about In the seats of senators when the ior tlon of the document dealing with Hawaii was approached. Seualor Kyle'a ole. Many of the senators had. however, anticipated the secretary's reading by turning in thir printed coph-s to this portion, so that very few of them ap parently observed that th page con taining the president's brief communi cation on Hawaii was turned without being read by the secretary. Senator Kyle was one of the few senators who followed the reading sufficiently cloe to observe the omission, and he called attention to the oversight by sending up a note calling attention to the fact. After this Incident there was an evident falling off in interest on thi part of senators, but attention as briefly re vived when the paragraph concerning bonds was reached. When this para graph was passed senators gradually left their seats and went out into the cloak rooms, so that by the time the reading had been two-thirds finished there were hardly twenty-live senators in the chamber and a majority of thjse were engaged ia conversation among themselves. The reading of the message was Con cluded at 3 o'clock, having occupied ap proximately one hour and a half. Mr. Iolph immediately rose and s:id there had been distributed in the senate print ed copies of what purported to be the message of the president, in whieh, on page a, he found a part f a page de voted to Hawaii and h? did not hear that portion read from the desk. He desired to know, and thought the coun try did also, whether that part was in advertently or purposely omitted by the secretary, or whether the copies which had been circulated were not true copies of the message. The vice-president responded that the ' portion of the message relating to Ha waii had been inadvertently emitted by the secretary and directed that it be read. This was done and Mr. Iolph gave notk-e 'that he would on tomorrow address the senate on That part of the message. The message was ordered to lie on the table. Ileferenoe the Tariff. When the refererw e to the tariff was reached the members crowded about the clerk's desk. The forceful utterance relative to the duty of congress on the tariff question and the hearty indorsement given the Wilson bill seemed to please the democratic members greatly, but much surprise was evident when that section of the message was read stat ing that the ways and means committee had embraced in its plans several addi tional Internal taxes and a small tax on the incomes of certain corporations. As it was understood the internal revenue features and the income tax had not been absolutely decided upon, the president's announcement came in the nature of a surprise. A round of applause greeted the conclusion of the reading of the message. Numerous petitions were presented and many bills introduced and referred to appropriate committees. A joint reso lution permitting Anson Mills, United States army, to serve as engineer on the commission to survey and fix the boundary between the United States and Mexiea was assed. A message was re ceived from the house announcing the death of thf Hon. Charles O'Neill and the Hon. William Lilley, late repre sentatives from Pennsylvania. Mr. Cameron offered a resolution expressive of the sorrow of the sad intelligence and Senators Quay, Manderson. Carey, Smith and Kvle were appointed a committee on the iart of the senate to attend the funeral. As an additltnal mark or re spect to the deceased, the senate then, at 3:52, adjourned. In the IIoumo. At 1:33 p. m. Mr. Prüden, the whit house executive clerk. ari?arvd with the prndent's message and Speaker Crisp immediately laid It lefore the house. Clerk Kerr read It in a clear. firm voice. The galleries remained si lnet and the members leaning forward in their chairs listened attentively to Mr. Cleveland's views as they fell from the lip of the clerk of the house. During the reading of the first por tion cf the message relating to our for eign relations' Ex-Speaker Thomas Revd burst through a side door and came rolling across the area in front of the speaker's rostrum. When he reached his seat he deliberately lighted a cigar and sat puffing away ompla-ently while the reading proceeded. As the reference to the Hawaiian affair was reached the members straightened up and gave the closest possible attention, but no ex pression of approval or disapproval was indulged in. There seemed to be a gen eral air of disapiointment, however, that so little space was allotted to this question. Over two hundred members were present. Burlinßion Iloute.
