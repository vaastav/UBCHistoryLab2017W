"$V " - -. r THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE: WASHINGTON, D. 0., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1885. ' T'.'CE effect It is the same with Congressmen. During a heated contest on some party ques tion they sit up nights thinking of bitter philippics -with which to paralyze the oppo sition. After it is all over they meet in the ontc-rooms and restaurants ol the Capitol and DHIXK, SMOKE, AND KAT OYSTKKS together, while a spirit of grace, mercy and peace broods over them. At precisely 15 minutes beforo 12 o'clock the Sergcaiit-at-Arnis, bearing aloft bis niacc, the emblem of authority, and looking a good deal like the droni-imyor of a brass baud, moves aboat the hall warning all persons ex cept Members to withdraw. Precisely at uoon, in each assembly, there is a sharp click of the gavel upon the marble desk, and the session has begun. There is a hush for a few minutes, whilo brief prayers aro offered by the respect ive Chaplains, and then all is buzz and escite 111 en t. The Senate is a body of continuous existence, about a third of its members boinsi elected every two years. Tho Vice-President is. cx ojjicio, its presiding ofiiccr. Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, tho Senate convenes fully organized and ready for business. On Monday, however, tho Senate met without a presiding ouiccr, in consequence of the death of Mr. Hendricks. It was necessary to elect a President pro tempore of the Senate, who, by virtuo of his oliice, becomes acting Vice-President of the United States for the remainder of the Presidential term. There is no provision in the Constitution or the laws for actually lill ijig a vacancy in the Vice-Presidency. The Uouseof Keprcsentatives passes entirely out of existence on the 4th of .Mareh, onco in two years. The Members of the new House are elected by the people at the Fall election preceding, b.it they arc not sworn till the eon--rening of Congress on the first Monday in De cember following tho adjournment, so that during the interval of eight mouths THE 

HOUSE HAS NO KXISTP.NCE, unless, as very rarely occurs, the President calls an extra sessiou of Congress. At the bo ginning of the first session the House elects a Speaker and a full complement of officers. The organization becomes complete when the Speaker, a few days later, appoints the stand ing committees. All business is filtered through these committees before it is ;ieted upon, and nothing can be accomplished without them. , As Eoon as tho Speaker is elected the oath of office is administered to him by the oldest Member in continuous t-ervice, who is termed the Father of the House. Hon. W. D. ICelley, of Pennsylvania, has held this iost of honor for many years. Ho entered Congress in INil. and since that time 24 years his seat has never been occupied by another. If he lives to complete tho term upon which he has ju.-t eiitered, he will have served longer than any other person since the Government was formed. The Members are qualified by the Speaker. They are summoned to the area in front of the Speaker's desk, in detachments of 20, where, with uplifted hands, they receive the oath of office. .Now and then a Quaker, or other per son having conscientious siruples about taking an oath, appears. For such a form of affirma tion is provided, less rigid in phrase, though not less binding in its obligation. During the war Congress prescribed for its Members what is known as THE 

"IRONCLAD" OATH, which reqnired the person to swear that he had never voluntarily borne arms against the United States nor afforded aid and comfort to its enemies. As the Southern States one after another, were "reconstructed," and those who had zealously served the "Lost Cause" in mili tary and civil capacities, began to form in pro cession and march on Washington, they could not, of coarse, take this oath, and another form, called the "modified" oath, was made for their benefit, by the terms of which they promised to support the Constitution, etc, and behave them selves in future. This distinction was main tained for 20 years, and the singular spectacle was presented of two different forms of oath ad ministered to citizens of the same country, on becoming, in all other respects, equal members of the same body. The lat Congress abolished the ironclad oath, thus laying another plank in the bridge across the " bloody chasm." Now the same oath is given to all ex-Federals aud ex-Confed crates alike. As soon as the organization of both Houses of Congress is complete a joint committee is sent to wait upon His Excellency, the President of the "United States, aud inform him that Con gress is ready to receive any communication he may have to make. Then ho sends to each House a matter of 12,000 or 15,000 words, known as the President's Message. The read ing of this always 

STAMPEDES THK GALLERIES. Up to this point the spectators have watch'ed the proceedings with interest, but they do not care to sit for two long hours while the clerks, reading by reliefs, work off the Ale-soce, In fact the members, themselves, generally lack the fortitude to sit through it. They furtively slide out, by twos and threes, aud smoke and tell stories in the cloak-rooms and lobbies, or go to the cafes for "a dozen on the half shell." It is not often that a quarter of them are in fheir seats when the reading is finished. They prefer to read and digest it at their leisure. The drawing for seats in the House usually takes place on the second day. This is done by placing all the names of the Members on slips in.a box, and a blind-folded page draws them out one at a time. As each name is announced the Member chooses his seat. It is a customary courtesy, however, to first allow a few Mem bers who are stricken in years, or are snfferiug frpm partial deafness or other physical infirm ity, to make their choice without compelling them to take their chances with the rest. Po litically the House is divided by tho center aisle. The party antagonists are separated as in Scripture, THE DEMOCRATIC SHEEP on, the Speaker's right, and the Republican goats on his left. The similarity ceases at this point, as the classification is a purely voluntary one, on the principle that " bird of a feather Hock together." As the number of seats in each half of the hall is the same, whichever party is in the rnnjority must encroach upon the domain of the minority. After the draw ing there is always more or less " trading " of seats for mutual accommodation, as in the case ofpersoual friends who may desire one another's company. This system of feating gives all an equal chance to secure the desirable places and prevents the serious friction that would he in evitable were a general scramble permitted. This .completes the work of organization, save the appointment of the standing committees :is before mentioned, and the Members get ready to pour into the hopper the grists of bills aud resolutions that they have brought to the Con gressional miil. STATESMEN WnO "GOT LEFT." Of the 325 Members of the House, 112 Demo crats and 07 Republicans. 171) in all, were re elected. One hundred aud forty-six 71 Dem ocrats aud 75 Republicans are novices in the science of national law-making. Among those classed as new Members, because they were not in the last Congress, aro sever.il who have been there before. Notable among them are McKiu ley, of Ohio; Sessions, of New York, and Bur rows, of Michigan. Among the 1 1G Members of the last House who were relegated to private life by their con stituents, are niauy whose familiar faces and voices will be missed by the habitues of the Capitol. To assume that they left au aching void which others cannot fill would be unfair to those who have taken their places. No doubt time will develop among the new Mem bers statesmen aud orators, men of learning and ability, humorists aud cranks, affording the same pleasing aud picturesque variety as before. No one will be more regretted in his absence than the gtnial S. S. Cox, universally known as "Sam," of New York iux. Cox has been in Congress 24 years. Ue made his first appear ance in the Hou'vaway back in 1S57. He was then au " Oh" j man," and this fact doubtless contribu'a greatly to his success in public life. For flf.Tit years he represented the Columbus C.J district. But Ohio showed strong symp toms of bcroniing permanently a Republican State, and Mr. Cox began to think it was not a safe place for a Democrat. Attractod by the great Democratic majorities in New York city he gathered together his household goods and gods and removed to the metropolis. He chose the Sixth district, with about 12,000 Democratic majority, as a good one to settle in, and there ho pitched his tent in 1865. He could hardly expect to step right into Congress again with out a break, but he was a famous "mixer" among the boys, and in 1BG0 he appeared in the House, where he has continued ever since. Ho was re-elected to the present House, but re signed to accept the position of Minister to Turkey, to which bo was appointed by Presi dent Cleveland. Mr. Cox hts fine literary taste, nd no small ability in that direction. Before his first election to Congress he published tho Ohio Statesman at Columbus. Ho is the author of seveial books, the last being an entertaining volume of travels in Europe. He is widely known as a humorist, and both his speeches aud writings, if nqt marked by profound thought, are sparkling and pleasing. The House has'lost ITS 

THREE riNEST WITS. In this respect Mr. Cox was first, with Bolford, of Colorado, a good second, and Horr, of Michigan, completing tho-trio. " Jim." Bclford, as he was always known, was for eight years a prominent and grotesquo figure in Congress. He was some times called the " Red-headed Rooster of the Rcckies." In manner ho was unpolished, and prilled himself upon his frontier ways as be coming to a man who represented Colorado. He was a brilliant orator, and at times poured forth a torrent of eloquence that fairly electri fied his auditors. His wit was keen and always ready. Ho furnished a liberal share of spice to season tho very solid and generally indiges tible mental pabulum daily fed to the mem bers and the public Although a Republican. Behonl often startled his party friends and everybody else by his erratic ways. No one could ever tell where ho was going to break out next. Ilorr, of Michigan, was funny when a good opportunity for wit was presented, and always at the expense of tho Democrats. Short and bulbous in body, with a head as round as a cannon ball, his very appearance was enough to provoke the risibles. WJicn excited his shrill voice pierced tho ear like the filing of a saw. THOSE TWO FAMOUS SOLDIERS, Gen. Eosecrans and Gen. Slocum. were among the most popular members of tho last House. Slocum had served two terms before, some years ago. iie was elected "at large ' irouiisew lorK in 1SS2, but when tho State was icdistricted he failed ol a nomination in his own district, in Brooklyn. " Old Rosy," as he was always called'by the Army of the Cumberland, served hut a single term, and was swept from his scat by the Republican tidal wave that inundated California in 1SS1. Ho now holds the impor tant position oi Register of tho Treasury, to which he was appointed by President Cleve land. That gloomy statesman, "Richelieu "Robin son, of New York, whose great shock of bushy, yellow hair made him a conspicuous figure in the House, will be missed. Ho was called tho 

LEADER Or THE " TAIL-TWISTERS " in Congress, on account of his inveterate hos tility to England and everything Eiiglish. An Irishman by birth and education, he was a val iant defender of his people, and no music was so sweet to his cars as the raging roar of the Brit ish Lion, lie has served several terms in Con gress, but is now past 70, and will probably not appear again in the National Legislative Halls. Finerty, of Illinois, a tall, brawny Irishman, of splendid physique and with a heart as big as his body, was the faithful coadjutor of Mr. Robin son in all hi schemes to twist the tail of the lion. In lS:-2 Finerty ran as an independent candidate in a strongly Democratic district in Chicago. Ho received tho Republican vote and was elected. A year ago he tried it again, but was snowed under. Everybody will miss the fiery red head of tbatuniqiieaud picturesque individual, "Tom" Ochiltree, the only native of Texas ever elected ro Congress. Ochiltree was celebrated for his -eingso unlike George Washington, in that he NEVER TOLD THE TRUTH if he could help it. He was thoroughly inde pendent in politics, voting first with one party and then with tho other. He loft few Con gressional footprints on tho sands of time, ex cept his famous Lasker resolution, that kindled such a fire under tho throne of old Kaiser William and threw Bismarck into a high state of iullammation. Those two cranks, "Calamity" Wellcr, of Iowa, aud White, of Kentucky, were both left at home. The funniest srene in the 48th Con gress was one day when Wellcr and White got into a disputeduringdebate, aud came togcthor in the main aisle, both shouting at the tops of their voices and SHAKING THEIR CLENCHED TISTS at each other. For the moment all sem blance of order in the House was abandoned. The Members laughed and cheered vocifer ously, aud cries of "Go it, Calamity!" and "Give it to him, White!" were heard in all parts of the hall. The Speaker enjoyed the scene with the rest for a fuw minutes, and then pounded with his gavel. mid called the pugna cious Members to order. They were so ex cited, however, that they did not become quiet until the Scrgcaut-at-Arms was directed to en force the order of the Speaker. OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSPICUOUS in the House, but whoso places will know them no more, at least until after another election, aro Hewitt, of Alabama; that persistent de fender of tho Constitution, Eaton, of Connecti cut, who has served in both branches of Con gress; Calkins, of Indiana, who resigned his scat to make the race as the Republican candi date for Governor and was defeated; Cook, the wild orator from Iowa; Blackburn, of Ken tucky, who was promoted to a seat pi tho Sen ate; the bustling Ellis, of Louisiana, one of the victims of Morrison's horizontal tariff bill; Kellogg, who long waved i he Republican flag alone from that State; Holtou, a Republican, who slipped into the last Houso from one of the Districts of Democratic Maryland, and gave great promise of usefulness; Leopold Morse, the Hebrew Member from Massachusetts, laid on the shelf for his anti-tariff views; Lyman, a man of rare ability, who stood on a pedestal as an Independent Member from the Bay State; the solemn and stately Washburn, of Minne sota; Jeffords, born in Ohio, and tho lone Rep resentative in Congress of the Republican party of Mississippi, who now gives way to a Demo crat; Muldrow and Money, prominent Demo crats from the same State; Broad head aud Buckner, of Missouri, the latter a Member for 12 years; Valentino, of Nebraska, ono of the most energetic and useful of the Western Mem bers; Brewer and Fiedler, of New Jersey; dig nified Waldo Hutchins, of New York, and Dorsheimcr, who weighs over 300, and was tho biggest man in Congress sinco the days of David Davis, of Illinois; Geo. Keifer, the ex Speaker, Gen. Robinson, who w.-is elected Sec retary of State, and tho silver-tongued Kurd who is contesting the teat of his successor of Ohio; Chacc, of Rhode Island, a Quaker, and one of the ablest champions of protection; Judge Poland, of Vermont, whose blue coat and brass buttons have been seen in ono branch of Congress or the other since before the war; Casey Youug, of Tennessee, one of the old guard of the Democracy, who was defeated by a Re publican in the Memphis District; Johu Han cock, that sluidy Jacksoniau Democrat from Texas; and Johu S. Wise, of Virginia, son of Henry A. Wise, of ante-bellum fame, late a "Readjustcr," and beaten hist month by Fitz hugh Lee for Governor of the " Old Dominion." All these had to "go," and their scats are filled by strangers. A Startling: Statement. At a recent gathering of medical men in Philadelphia Dr. W. S. Janncy, late coroner of that city, made the startling statement that "no healthy man or woman ever dies in this climate fiom cholera morbus." Ho repeated the remark to the editor of the Medical and Surgical lleportcr, saying that records of the coroner's office would substantiate his words. He explained that by "healthy " he meant a person without organic diseases and of average strength and vitality. " Such a person," ho said, " when dying with symptoms of cholera morbus, always dies from poisoning (usually arsenic), and the case is one of suicide or homi cide." Tho ex-coroner first examined into these cases when a stout, healthy man o his acquaintance died after an illness of 3G hours with symptoms of cholera morbus. Ho has been attended by four reputable physicians, one of whom had signed the death certificate. Yet be instituted an investigation, and found enough arsenic in the deceased to kill a dozen men. He afterward met with five or six simi lar cases. Dr. Bartholow, in a conversation with the editor of the Reporter, sail that ho had not the least doubt of the correctness of Dr. Janney's assertion. Another prominent phy sician stated his belief in these views, and re ferred the causes of such attempts to poison with arsenic to connubial uucongeniality. A Most Delicate and Useful Holiday Present is, beyond doubt, a present consisting of that exquisite, refreshing and invigorating perfume universally known as Murray & Lanraan's Florida Water, a floral preparation which ad mirably combines both tho qualities of hand kerchief extract and thoso of a toilet cosmetic suchas"Eau do Cologne," to which it is infi nitely superior in fragrance, softness and in tensity of aroma. Such a present unites cle gauco and refinement to good sense and good taste. For sale by all druggists, perfumers and fimcy goods dealers. 

SUNDAY MEDITATION. Practical Duties Taught by a Study of tho Inter national Similar School Lesson Appointed for Dec. 20. 1i., ?Tt : 1-1 1 . One rending these notes should first carefully s-tuily tlic paragraph from tho Holy Seripture3 as indicated above. Our study now is in tho memorable 55th chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah. This chap ter is intimately related to the 53d. That foretells the coming of the Messiah; this sets forth tho grand results of tho incarnation. God is the author of tho lesson, Isaiah tho amanu ensis. What he heard from God ho wrote down for men, making it known by voice and pen. Tho jreoplc of tho Kingdom of Judah first heard it. It has been preserved and handed down to our day. It is addressed to the hungry and thirsty; thoso with quickened spiritual pro clivitics; those eager for the Water of Life, hungry for tho Bread from Heaven. All spirit ual blessings aro at our disposal. Wc can buy all wo need for our souls. Wc arc to pay not in coin, but in faith, appreciation, appropria tion. Thcro is no partiality, oligarchy, aris tocracy, nor other dillicult and limiting quali fication. Salvation is free as wator. How men toil, sweat, sacrifice for what cannot meet the needs of the spiritual nature! What a high price men pay in attempts to gratify the long ings of their souls, and yet fail of succoss! Nothing but our holy religion can avail for tho soul. None but Christ can do helpless sinners good. Hearken not to falso teachers, who promise various human devices for happiness to tho soul and contentment to the mind. Hear Christ. (V. 3.) Then you shall have the good. Your souls will not be hungry, pinched up and in distress, but you shall be so plentifully fed that your soul shall thrive, as animals do well and are in llesh which have plenty of proven der. It is fatal to turn deaf ear to Jesus. God made certain grand promises to David and his descendants. (Ps., Si): 2, 3, !.) Nothing but sin cm prevent such promises being realized. Heed Christ and your mercies aro certain. The covenant was an everlasting one, and so reaches down even to us. Then God, from time to time, renewed his covenant (agreement) made with David: God so loved tho world he gave his Son. (V. 4, John, 3: 1G.) Christ reaffirms all God's promises, testifies to tho morcy and loving kindness of Jehovah, bears witness to the reality of the ceremonial law in its relatious to Calvary. Ho becomes incarnate so as to lead. (V. 4.) But to lead ho must com mand. And Christ did not descend from Heaven merely to becomo tho pet of a Nation, the idol of a race, tho Savior of a clan. Calvary, as an clevntion, and that mado more conspicuous by a cross lifted on high, looked every way, pointed mercifully in all directions. Nevermind if you bo not Is raelites. Not a Nation but Nations (V. 5) aro interested in "The Crucified." God and Christ are at one as to salvation. If tho ono suffer, tho other elevates. (V. 5.) God glorified the Messiah from Bethlehem to Mt. Olives. Tho progress of Christianity is a magnifying of Christ. Ho shall yet bo in triumph at the judgment. All through eternity ho shall bo in honor of all tho Saints. Call is mado for im mediate action. (V. (J.) Some effort will bo necessary. God is not so conspicuously present that meu may dispense with all seekings after him. The moro he is sought the more he is revealed. By Loud wo may understand Jeho vah, and so Christ. Men cannot learn of him without study. And Christ implies salva tion. Men must work out salvation. God does not thrust redemption on us. Human effort is demanded. Saying nothing as to whether the time may over como when Jeho vah cannot bo found merciful, or when ho will not be near, wo sco what is at least implied in the verso. Thcro is reason enough for immedi ate action. One can tako no risks as to salva tion. Effort now cannot bo in vain, for, if sought, God can now be found, aud if found ho will now be placable. God now is near. Ho seems nearer at one time than another e. g., he seems near when wo have met great earthly losses; when Providenco apparently has with drawn ; when some dear friend is very sick or near to death ; when calamity or famiuo or war prevails; when wo arc reading some deeplydo vout book or listening to a searching sermon ; when wo ourselves grow feeble, lose certain physical powers, or aro evidently drawing near to our graves. These times come in the lives of us all. Naturally they draw us near to God. Thousands have attributed thoir salvation to exporiences at such times. Thcro is encourago ment to act up to our convictions. It would bo best to be holy for the intrinsic value of holiness. But there is greater inspiration. Leave sin, and it will not be in vain in tho way of reward. (V. 7.) Mercy awaits the wicked man fleeing from sin. Pardon is at hand for him who expels from his mind all unrighteous thoughts. (V.7.) Wo could not expect God would beso lenient. (V. 8.) Man would not bo so ready to forgive his offenders. But God does not think as we do, nor act as we conduct. Thcro is an infinite diilerenco between God's thoughts and ways and thoso of men. There is no use in trying to measure God by any human standards. No matter how inconsistent, impossible, unnatural it seems to us for Jehovah to be so merciful, so ready with pardon, novortheless it is a fact. You can rely on God with all the certainty you do on the laws of nature. (Vs. 10, 11.) Man's condition in sin is like barren laud. As tho rains freshen and fructify tho soil, so God'3 truth revives and enriches the heart. (Compare Deu., 32 : 2 ; Ps., 72 : G.) Agriculturists, in re gions where snow falls of Winters, know well how fertilizing it is. Neither rain nor snow fails of its purpose. Through both, buds blos som, seeds sown grow, fruits develop. God's purpose in uttering words is to benefit men spiritually. His promises descend from Heaven as moisture comes from the clouds. Truth shall prosper. You cannot utterly suppress it. Tho gates of hell cannot prevail against tho good. Rain and snow do not, as such, return tq.tho sky. They ultimately find way back through evaporation, but never till they havo accom plished their purpose. If one lend a book to be passed around among his neighbors, it finally again reaches the hand of its owner, but meanwhile it has been read by a goodly circle, and is not returned till it has given pleasure to many a one. Verses 10 and 11 are a simile. Notice tho parallelisms: VcrtelO: Verse 11: 1. Itnin, snow. Word, water of life. (Jno. 4:11.) Wine and milk. (V.l.) 2. Heaven, clouds. Mouth of God, or voice of preacher or teacher. 3. Watcrcth. Strengthencth. 4. Iiarth. Hearts, souls. 5. llmls, bceds. FrniUi of Christianity. 6. Sower, cuter. Christian workers. (Mt., 13:3-23.) 7. Bread. . Christ. (J no., G:41.) Truth. (M:G.) 8. Rain and snow do God's word is not void; not return without ef- accomplishes its object; feeling their purpose. prospers. This lesson i3 full of practical suggestions: 1. Hunger and thrist after righteousness. (Mt., 5 : 6.) Cultivate spiritual appetites. Holi ness is to the soul what wine and milk are to tho body. (V. 1.) Christ is Bread, Water, tho Vine. The soul may delight itself in fatness. (V. 2.) Eat that which is good and which fully satisfies. (V.2.) 2. Go to Christ if poor. You need not tako gold and silver. Salvation is in tho market and is to he bought, but not by coin from Gov ernmental mints. For purchase, and in pay ment, give teara, faith, gratitude, loyalty, serv ice. Christ is a gift. He could not be had by payment of any price in real nionoy. But your love is more to him than all Golconda's treasures. When dealing about salvation you step away from all human standards of wealth. You begin tho usoof a totally different medium of exchange. Here rich and poor havo equal chance. How uselessly and wickedly men spend their mouey! (V. 2.) They attempt in vain to satisfy their souls with tho same viands they do thoir bodies, but they always thus find aching voids. No human service can tako tho place of Christ. 3. Listen to Jesus. (V. 2.) Heed his com mands. (V. 3.) Obey him. Slight any who would tako his place. Ho is our- leader and comrnirlWer. (V. 4.) Ho is tho true witness. He is tho word. (Y. 10.) Submit to God. He is superior. (V. 9.) 4. Seek and yo shall find. (V. G ; Mt., 7 : 7.) 5. Let every one go to Christ. There is no partiality. (V. 1.) Let thoso without money go. Let the Gentiles go. (V. 5.) 6. No Christian work is lost. (Vs. 10, 11.) No sermon is thrown away. No prayers aro in vain. Bread cast on tho waters rcturus. 7. Confide in God's wisdom. Though often strange, ho is always right. Ho keeps all his covenants. (V. 3.) If you want salvation, ho will not bicker about the price. Ho gives his Son, not stopping to adjust a fiuancial consid eration. (V. 4.) Ho has mercy for tho un righteous, pardon for the penitent. His thoughts aro not like ours. They aro purely origiual; they aro absolutely perfect; thoy are always holy. 8. Stop sinning. (V. 7.) Forsake eyil ways u ! anl company. Drive out unrighteous thoughts. Return to holiness., jBe loyal to God and true to men.

Chicago Inter Ocean. Chicago is a mcro village in comparison with London. The metropolis of the West holds no rank as yet with the real metropolis of the world. This city compared to that is only as an infant likened to a Hercules. And yet it is equally true this in fant is another Hercules in its infancy. It is one of the plainest certainties of the future that this city is destined, and tliat before long, to be also big with teeming millions of population, crowding in here from every pnrt of the land, from every quarter of the globo.

In theso bnsy times whou city people have to go long distances, and aro in too much of a hurry to walk, tho street railway enterpriso has risen to bo one of tho important interests of modern ilnnnco and industry. It requires shrewd and ablo men to manage it, and it gener ally rewards them with a prosperous distinction among tho business men of the day. One of tho most prosperous and best known of tho New York street railway men is J. 31. Reybert, Esq., who is President of tho Houston, West and Pavonia Ferry line. The man who achieves success in this street railway business docs soat considerable outlay of brain and nerve power. Managing such au enterprise may look like easy work, but let those who think it so make trial of it. Mr. Reybort found no beds of roses in his way to prosperity, but by constant and severe attention to business fell into a state of invalidism which threatened to carry him off. Ho is now, however, restored to health and as busy as over. Our Now York correspondent visited Mr. Reybert at the oilico of the company on East Tenth street, and found him busy superintend ing the details of tho business. Mr. Reybert cheerfully assented to the request that he should tell something about his experience of sickness and recovery. "It was four or fivo years ago," said Mr. Reybert, " that I began to run down in health. It was partly owing to too closo application to bnsiuess and partly to the unwholesome atmos phere of tho place in which I had to spend most of my time. I was taken with cold in my muscles, which soon assumed tho form of rheu matism. I had a great deal of local pain dis tributed over various parts of my body, and wherever tho pain came there camo also black spots. Then rheumatism developed into sci atica. My pains wore very great. Tho doctor told my wifo that I never could be any better. This was a gloomy outlook for me. I was at my homo in Newburgon the Hudson trying to mako tho best of the situation. This was in June, 18S1. "I heard of the Compound Oxygen and sent for a ' Treatment.' Eoforc it reached me I was taken down with rheumatism of tho heart, a diseaso which is as dangerous as it is painful. My breathing was so oppressed that I felt as if with each breath I should choke. When I re ceived the packago containing the Compound Oxygen I felt that I could hardly take its con tents. Nevertheless I tried. At this time my sciatica was very severe, with sudden aches shooting down tho nerves of both legs. " When I tried the Oxygon I was astonished to find that with a little practice I could inhale it freely. Yot for several days each inhalation would send pain to some old spot. The acho would continue for fifteen or twenty minutes, nnd then go away. Gradually I was free from theso pains and I could inhale tho Oxygen with out dilliculty or unpleasant result. "Compound Oxygen brought me good sleep. I had previously been in tho habit of waking two or thrco times in the night. Now I was restful. My sleep began to refresh mo as it had not done before. I omitted to tell yon that with my other disorders I also had dyspepsia. Somotimes this would distress me to such an extent that I did not care for company. It mado my appetite poor, and the food Iatedid-me but little good. Tho Oxygen repaired my digestive organs as it did everything else about me. I had also suffered from catarrh so badly that I lost the senso of smell. Well, this Oxygen is a very strange sort of thing, for it drove away tho rheumatism and sciatica; it made my digestion so much better that I can now eat like other people, and it entirely cured mo of catarrh. Once in a whilo if I take cold I have a little catarrh, but a few inhalations of Oxygen sends it away. During all my use of this remedy I have recoived advice at tho Compound Oxygen office, No. 148 Fifth avenue, and havo followed directions in tho uso of tho powders thero given me. I have found them of great benefit with tho Oxygen and theOxygenaqna." "And as to your friends, Mr. Reybert? You havo received so much benefit from this remedy that I suppose you have advised others to use it?" "Yes. I have advised a good many, and I havo heard that it has been of great advantage. One case I will mention that of Mr. Samuel J. Holmos, of this city, a gentleman well advanced in years. Ho had long been troubled with asthma. Ho used tho Oxygen for seven or eight weeks before it made much impression on him. Then, almost all of a sudden, it be gan to do its work. It did all we could have expected. It mado him breathe freely, natur ally, and without pain. He quotes it as a largo success, just ns-I do. "Yessir ; you may put mo down as a thorough believer in Compound Oxygen. I am not tak ing it now, except a little occasionally, because I am well and hearty. If I am sick again give mo Compound Oxygen. It is a wonderful re storer." So say all who give it a fair trial. There are yet a good mauy peoplo chronic sufferers and others who have not tried it. " It is never too lato to mend." Write to Dns.

IHcaldsburg Enterprise. At ono of tho stations on tho San Francicso & Northern Pacific Railway, a few Sundays since, au elderly gentleman got off tho cars to take brief observations during the stoppago of tho train. The assistant at the station rushed out and mado a regular baggage-smasher's attack on a trunk, which ho slammed about with a reckless disregard of consequences. The other man interposed: "Young man, won't you break that trunk?" The young man turned a withering look upon tho old gentleman, and impudently inquired: "What's the matter with you? Do you own this trunk?" "No, sir!" came back in a tone that evinced much indignation; " but I'll have you to understand, sir, that I own this railroad." As Col. Dona hue moved back to the train the limp young man reclined against tho station for support. . m A ''Madman's" Legacy. "Siro ! " exclaimed a man in tho homely garb of a mechanic to Richelieu, Primo Minister of France, as ho was outeriug his palace; "Sire, I havo made a discoveiy which shall make rich and great tho nation which shall develop it. Siro, will you give me an audienco?" Richelieu, constantly importuned, finally or dered the "madman" imprisoned. Even in jail he did not desist from declaring his "delusion," which ono day attracted tho attention of a -British nobleman, who heard Do Cause's story, and developed his discovery of steam-power! AH great discoveries aro at first derided. Seven years ago a man yet under middle ago, enriehedby a business which covered the con tinent, found himself suddenly stricken down. When his physicans said recovery was impossi ble, ho used a new discovery, which, like all advances in science, had been opposed bitterly by tho schoolmen. Nevertheless, it cured him, and out of gratitude therefor ho consecrated a part of his wealth to tho spreading of its merits beforo tho world. Such in brief is tho history of Warner's snfo cure, which has won, according to the testimony of eminent persons, tho most deserved reputation ever accorded to any known compound, and which is finally winning on its merits alone tho approval of tho most consorva ti'o practitioners. Its fame now belts the globe. The Herald. Tuo Celebrated Indians. Au Arizona paper remarks: "Thoso well known Indian braves, Gee-up Charley and Short Pants, havo been arrested for drunken ness again.

QUEER PROJECT. A Colony of Women to be Founded in Colorado, Tcrhaps. Denrer Col.) Tribune. Mrs. Olive Wright, of Denver, says that thero is to bo a women's colony in Colorado, and talks in this way about it: "In tho first place, there aro a great many Eastern women who havo capital to invest and who desire to put it into something which will benefit women. They can't do anything like that in Eastern towns, because popular prejudice is against it. Getting out hero will grant them room and liberty; thoy can do what they like, and I think thoy will like to do considerable. I have tho au thority of several gifted and wealthy women in Roston and Now York on this question. I know whereof I speak." " Where do you propose locating this colony?" "In tho beautiful, smiling Valley of tho San Luis. That is where I want to pitch a tent, tho work in which shall redound to the honor and glory of women. Rich women will build up tho colony, and poor women will come hero and establish industries by which to support themselves. Thoy will likely engage in beo culture, silk culture, tho raising of small-fruits, the raising of domestic animals, the manufac turing of preserves and jellies, and various other similar industries." Somebody asked her tho other day if men were to bo excluded from tho women's colony in the San Luis Valley. Sho replied that that was the queerest question ever put to her; said sho didn't think barbed wire fences would havo any effect in keeping them out of that colony, and she had no idea of keeping adozen sturdy Amazons on watch, as the fair ladies did in "The Princess." It is understood thero will bo plenty of men on hand in tho immediate vicinity of tho sonny San Lnis about tho time tho famous colony is started. This rather knocks tho poetry out of the scheme, but its practical advantages may thus be enhanced. Men wont havo any glory down thero anyway; they will havo to resign themselves to being overshad owed from tho beginning. They will do nicely to fill in tho background, and may sometimes bo intrnsted with the duties of understeward3. As for figuring oxtensively, their sex is against them, and they will be kept down. Rare Chance for Some Veteran Soldiers. The famous entertainment given by Comrade Taylor is called "At the Front With Our Sol diers During the Great War."
