Cleveland Public Schools KzroaT rot TBI KOXTB ISDIXO XoTtHBII Jl, 1S82. The publication of this report has been de layed by the non-reception of some district reports, and the inaccuracy of others. So reliable statistics of the conditien and progress of the schools can be presented un lets the data on which they are fouaded are correct. A proper degree of cars will cer tainly secure correctness. Ko items are called for whose conditions are obscure. The amount of tardiness, absence and dis mission in the schools, as evidenced by the district reports, must hare proved a serious obstacle to thorough scholarship. It is very desirable that parents should not allow their children to be absent, tardy or dismissed, without important reasons ; bet ter than can be found in the indolence, neg ligence or importunity of the scholars them selves. Borne of the items presented in the several reports are as follows : Number of scholars enrolled since Sept. 1st, 1882 6,173 Number of scholars in attendance from Oct. Mth to Nov. 21st 4,715 Kamberol'davs lost by absentees. 0.611 Number of days lost by sickness, of tbe above - t.791 Number of minutes lost by tardiness and dismission 103,841 Per cent, of regular attendance in all the schools - 02.5 The least irregularity in the average daily attendance, in tardiness and dismission, in any Grammar Department, was in the Kock well street School, 928 minutes for 103 scholars, or t minutes each. In the Prospect street Intermediate, and in the West Su Clair and Browncll street Girls' Primary De partments, the loss was but 7 minutes each ; while in the Brownell street Grammar De partment the loss was 84 minutes each, or twelve times as great as in those last named !

L. M. OVIATT, Superintendent of Instruction. CLEVELAND, Dec. 8, 1862. Acadekt or Mcsic. Mr. and Mrs. F. B. Conway make their debut to-night in Ingomar," and from their great reputation, both at home and in Europe, we anticipate for them a full house and a flattering recep tion. Mrs. Conway was highly successful in London. The Weekly Dispatch, of De cember 15th, 1861, has an article on her per formance of "Ion," which so amusingly lixes up polities and the drama that we copy it : . It is said that the war in Ameuca is caus ing an emigration to this conntry. This cer tainly seems to be the case in regard to the theatrical profession. During the past year, we nave had at least a dozen eanaiuates tor ublic favor, all of whom have crossed the ocean to brave a peril worse than its own. There are emigrants, however, who enjoy the fortunate distinction of not being obnoxious to the perils of the ensis. These, at least, must be considered neutrals, who are ex posed to no apprehonsions, even at the hands, of tbe decisive Captain Wilkes. Rebels only in the ease or excessively bad ports, are oei llgerants, but on Saturday, at the discovery of a bankrupt treasury, the oommedian must be regarded as the true citizen of the world. ho, in his devr tion to nis art, anu to uu mamty, abjures all national asperities. American actors, therefore, need not fear the fate of American diplomatists, or that attel nd Wheaton will be quoted in ueir ease in stead of Sheridan and Shakespeare. Mrs. B. Conwav. who made her debut in ' ion on Wednesday evening, is a decided acqui sition to our Metropolitan boards. She is obviously an artiste, and has a sense of grace and dignity which gives to her a truly poetic feeling. To a thoughtful and expressive face, she adds a graoeful person, and a voice of great flexibility combined with consider able Dover, tier performance oi - ion one of the best that we have seen. If it is not so Dathetic as Mrs. Charles Kean s it is more Ulgumea, mura unuic, uw -uu . u..w look of roval oriiin. We arc happy to add , - j i : - j ;tk . fnll.. that her debut was particularly successful, the audience summoning her before the cur tain at the close of every act." Fbask Peeew's New Baek. The new a bark of 800 tons, which Quayle k Martin are building for Captain Frank Perew, will be launoked in a couple of weeks. She will car ry 30,000 bushels of grain, and will cost abont $30,000. She will be as fine a vessel in every respect as the Mary E. Perew. Captain Pe rew intends to name her In honor of a prom inent Insurance man in Buffalo. She will be fitted out by Horse k Perrine, of Buffalo. The expense of fitting ont a vessel is much greater than last year. Canvas, that sold formerly for 40 cents a yard. Is now worth $1 a yard. Upwards of 4,000 yards of canvas are required in fitting cat a bark of the above description. A Bio pice roa Tnwiwn Mr Kinsmen Sherman has agreed to pay the tug Kate Williams $500 for towing his bark Fontenelle from Port Colborne (C. W.) to this port. The Fontanelle has a cargo of Lake Champlain iron ore. She was ont in the storm of Friday night and had nearly reached this port but was compelled to put baek to Port Colborne. The Kate Williams left here last evening. In addition to the Fontanelle, she will alse bring np either the schooner General Scott or the Sardinia. The latter has a load of iron for Stone, Chiaholm k Jones. Tho Fontanelle will lay np here and un dergo some repairs this winter. in by ten at Strike amoeo CowotjCTOES. The Toledo Commercial records a strike among freight conductors on the Eastern Division of the To ledo k Wabash R. R., the strike being, not for higher, but to retain their old wages. The management wished to change the scale wares ; paving them two dollars per trip in stead of fifty dollars per month, as formerly, The management held that 4his would in crease the eonduetors' pay to nearly sixty dollars peT month. The latter eonld not sec in that light, estimating that the highest wages any of them eeu: d make would be but about thirty-five dollars permonth, and hence the strike. The Sevehth Ohio. We learn that Orrin J. Crane, formerly Major of the 7th .Ohio, has been promoted to the position Lieutenant Colonel. It is rumored that the Tth regiment is be consolidated with the I9th, ColonelLewis P. Buckley, and that the latter being senior Colonel, will have command. The boys of the - Bully Tth " arc dissatisfied with arrangement, as they are warmly attached Colonel Creighton and wish to be led by other. In faot they assert that they will fight under none other thai their old Colonel. Tbottt Cutbch Homb. In the newer forms of eharity which the war has devel oped, and Which appeal with irresistible io quenco tc every benevolent heart, there is danger that established oharities of older growth will And the well-trodden paths by which they have been sustained unequal to their requirements. This most be the ease when such are. placed in competition with those whose suffering appeals greet the eye in every telegram, and in every eolumnof the daily press. None deny that all must be supported ; but if the older charities can be helped on their way by an admixture of amusement and rational excitement with alms giving, it seems just and expedient that such should be their recourse, leaving to the pitiful wail of the battle-fleld the right to olaim for its alleviation the sponta neous gifts of every sympathizing heart. This being our view of the benevolent mis sions of the eventful period In which we now are, we urge for the projected fair for Trinity Church Home a generous patronage. To call this "Trinity Church Home" might seem a misnomer, since we are informed that its benefits are limited to no particular com munion that its doors open to the sick and friendless without regard to name or nation, and often beyond the limits of its slender support. To go into that well finished and well furnished " Home " and greet the circle of aged women who share its comforts is the best exponent of its usefulness. There in tender care and sympathy the weakness of age is forgotten, and the friendless outcast finds the genial surroundings of happy faces and a warm fireside. The wasting, wearying core for to-morrow is no more for them than for the lilies of the field.for they literally "toil not, neither do they spin," yet to-morrow brings every needed comfort as surely as it brings the sunlight. It would seem that this holy mission need only be known to secure for itself a cordial and liberal support. At present, "its rent- rolls are small, and its patrons lew, put it commends itself to the christian philanthro py of our community with the eloquence of truth. May the mite which would shrink from exposing itself on a subscription list, be so multiplied at the coming Fair, as to show an worthy the cause on whose be T.

Keferred to Judiciary Committee. Other business of minor importance was transacted, when Mr. Stevens offered a series of resolutions refering the various parts of the President's message to appro priate committees. By a motion of Mr. Edwards, it was resolved that the Committee on Indian Affairs be instructed to enquire whether any further legislation is necessary in re lation to Indian runas neia oy tne uov- ernment. and report by bill or otherwise. On motion of Roscoe Conkling, the President was requested, if in his opinion it was not incompatible with public inter est, to transmit to tbe House the last of ficial recort or uenerai Jsueu. Mr. Van Wyck introduced a bill to pro vide for the immediate cayment oi ciotn- ins: lost in service by soldiers of the Uni ted States army, also a bill increasing the pay of privates, non-commissioned omcers and musicians. Both bills were referred to the Commit tee on Military Affairs. Mr. Stevens introduced a bill to indem nify President Lincoln and other persons for suspending privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and for all acts done in pur suance thereof. The bill lstue same as that offered last week. Mr. Tallindighatn objected to reading tie bill a second time, therefore, under the rule, the question occurred, " Shall the bill be rejected ?" The House refused to reiect. 31 aeainst 90. The bill was then read a' second time. Mr. Stevens moved to oostDone further consideration nntil next Thursday and make it the special order for that day.

If postponed until Thursday, it could be examined with that care and wisdom which the House should It l ine: to bear upon the subject. What be ieoted to specially was that a measure auch great importance, and npon which .her was such a diversity of opinion, should be hurriedly thrust through the House.- ' The President had authority by law to exercise all the powers he had exeroised with regard to the writ or habeas corpus. Ho concurred with the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Stevens, that a Din oi such character was proper ; but while he thus concurred he should regret to see tne bill hurried through the House without ten members knowing its legal provisions. It was discreditable to the House and coun try, and he should feel ashamed to return to his constituent and say that Congress had passed an act without permitting a word. Tea or nav. to be said on- the sub ject. He hoped, for the credit of the House and country, the matter wouia oe post poned. Mt. Tallantligham said he had objected only to the ball being made the speoial or der. Mr. Celfax differed' from him. He did not think the immediate passage of the oill would be discreditable to the House. Instead of this it would be creditable. This question has been discussed all over the land, as to whether tne rresiaeni nau nower to suspend the writ of habeas cor pus during the rebellion. He stood ready in vote for the bill to indemnify hint. Ha hosed that it would pass at once. - ' Mr. S'CTens was about addressing the House on the subject, when Vallandigbam raised a question that Stevens had no right under the roles to do so. ' Mr. Stevens asked for three minutes explain. Mr. Vallandigham objected, unless oth ers have a similar privilege. Mr. Holman moved to' lay the bill on the table. Not carried, 45 to 88. Mr. Stevens explained that H wa n-t nil intention to put the biH on its passage, hut a postponement was prevented then members desired an amendment in order that those who had been Illegally impris oned mieht have their remedy. Mr. Stevens, in further explanation, said he doubted the authority of the President suspend the writ of habeas corpus, except from absolute necessity, during me recess. He held that Congress was the soverign power, not the President. He had care fully copied the bill from precedents of English Parliament for Ure last two centuries, not adding a word except what was necessary under the pref lent circumstances of theeountry. The Prefiident was justified in exercising the powev at the time of our extremest peril, when traitors were found in every household and township, North and South. Bill paased, 90 against 45. , . Mr." Richardson severely criticised the message, saying that the- moat of it was about the negro and noihing about the bravery of our soldiers. , Adjourned. Sin atx. Foster, Sumner.

Mr. Saulsbury called up the resolution in relation to the arrest of certain eitisens of Delaware. Mr. Wilison, of Massachusetts, objected. Mr. Bayard urged the adoption of the resolution at some length; Mr. Doolittle said that he understood that in all these cases of arrest, offers of liberty had been made, if the persons ar rested would take the oath of allegiance. He would like to have the resolution lie over. Mr. Saulsburry said he had referred to those two persons because he had never heard of any charges against them. They had been arrested in a loyal State, and for no offense whatever. Peaceable eitisens in Delaware and Maryland had been arrested and dragged away from their homes, and he thought l.-V.Tt .h. riX , ll-a into the matter. There was no disposition to " . .
