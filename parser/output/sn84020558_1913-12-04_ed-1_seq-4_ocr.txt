Robert Louis Stevenson. The "Reorganization" The mails are being flooded with literature relat ing' to tlie "reorganization" of the republican party. That is. regarded by tlie jtromu lga tors of the litera ture as of far rmre importance, and as having a j-'t er bearing on the future prosperity of the coun try, than any legislation, whatever its character, that may be enacted by the present congress. The safety of the country, it is declared, can be assured oiily under the guardianship of the party which dom inated it durir.tr the period of its greatest growth and ;niv: no -mem. It is admitted ).y the literature that the party made a fatal t ti'or when, in a moment of tempta tion anil under the domination of machine bosses !::.-t year, it disregarded the will of the majority. The extraordinary plea is offered that the repub lican party was not alone in its offending; that the I m'-cratie party at Baltimore also nominated a minority candidate. That is true, but he was nom inated according to an established rule, however unwise it might have been. The proprieties were nt disregarded and decency was not outraged. ne letter issued by tile republican national committee assures us that what happened at Chi cago a ytar ago last Juno will not happen agair.; that at an early meeting of the committee an at tempt will be made to readjast the representation s that the committee would be powerless to re peat its trime. It does not Know, it is asserted, whether the committee really has authority lo safe guard the majority against a further crime by the committee, but that matter will be threshed out at the meeting. Tiie indications are everywhere that the reor ganization will have to proceed without the aid or the presence of progressives.! Ieie and there may be one who is longing for tiie flesh pots, but for every one v. ho becomes "reorganized" there will he many republicans and democrats to take his place in the progressive ranks. They would already be. there if they had had more time than was allowed between August i and November of last year to gain a full understanding' of the progressive movement which is even now not understood by those who arc calling the progressives to come back and participate in the. crusade for offices and booty. One of the letters sent out by the committee states that there will never again need be a "party of protest." Here is a clear misunderstanding of the purpose of the progressive party. Its protest against tiie proceedings of the national republican convention was, after all, only an incident. The principles of the progressive party were, the principles of the men and women who afterward constituted the progres sive party and were entertained by them before the June convention assembled. They were the princi ples which a majority of the delegates, rightfully entitled to seats in the convention, desired should be enacted into laws. But when the majority was over ruled, the men and women who afterward formed the progressive party were left a choice between the abandonment of those principles and the organiza turn, not of a party of protest, but of a constructive part;.. It is this misapprehension of the' origin and purpose of the progressive party that permits the re ublir an leaders to hope that there may be a reor ganization. What have they to offer to the progressives that the progressives' want? Certainly not this: "The reorganization of the republican party for it will amount to that means that progressive policies will become republican principles jut as rapidly as a majority of republicans can be convinced of their wisdom." This is too elusive and shadowy. It is so transparent that it does not conceal the fact that the progressive party can work more effectively alone for its principles than it could work handi capped by allies waiting to be convinced of the wis dom of those principles, and already no doubtful of their wisdom that it will require proof to remove the doubt. That is, the republican leaders are in that state of mind which unfits men to serve as jurors when justice is to be done. The Republican and progressives almost unan imously will not trust the principles of the party to such a "reorganization" Those principles arc fundamentally right and in the end they must pre vail. An arna'gamntion of their supporters with an element which is yet to be convinced ,,f their right eousness, if not already unfriendly to them, would only delay the triumph of those principles. Commissioner and Councilman The duties of a commissioner under the new form of city government will be widely different from those of a member of the city council, .and the proper discharge of them will require a differ ent degree of ability. The most important and the first luty',vV ill' be the selection of a city manager. and for this the commissioners must be men of good judgment who must know a man of ability when they see him and who must have some talent as readers of human nature. In this matter, also, the commissioners must possess firmness. They will be beset by all kinds of candidates for the position of city manager, and some of them will be backed by personal and polit ical friends. E very possible string will be pulled. The aid of societies, lodges anil churches of which they may happen to be members will be solicited, and possibly obtained. There will be petitions filled with the names of hundreds who have no special in terest in the candidates whose petitions they have signed. They will have only yielded to the Amer ican weakness for signing petitions. All these influences the commission must dis regard. They will carry no proof and not even a hint of the qualifications of the applicants. The commission must rely entirely upon its own judg ment, after a careful investigation of the qualifi cations of all the candidates, and must not be mis led into the belief that such influences represent the will of the people. The will of the people will be expresstd in the election of the commissioners, who will thereby be dt legated to choose the best city manager it can find without any further in structions. The whole responsibility will be placed upon the commission, and it cannot share it with societies, lodges. churches and petition-signers. And. here we would urge upon citizens to refrain from embarrassing i lie commission by signing peti tions in favor of any candidate. Tiie owners of great private conoi 1 ns, depart ment stores, railroads, banks and factories do not hire their managers on petitions. The applicant for one of these responsible positions must stand upon his own merits. Reside the U.ty of electing a manager, the commission will have broader legislative duties than the thy council. It will have lngcr powers. A man who might be a fairly good councilman might be a very poor commissioner. If Phoenix is going to get the most out of the new form of go vt i n m n t , ii must choose its best timber for the commission. Voters cannot afford now to tale into considera tion the personality or popularity of a candidate JOT tic ci mai.ssien. inly two tilings are to nc cou- sidered, the ability and th dales, for into the hands . int.grity of the can. li the commission are to be committed the m I vital affairs of Phoenix. Within, at most, the next two months, the can didates will be named. That is not a long time for the people to choose whom they want. The best men v. i'.t net pat themselves forward. They must be hunted out ami induced to bei ome candid itcs. The campaign should be begun without delay. Be Patient l'.-caitse President Wilson in his message rn-g-iccted to recommend national equal suffrage, suf fragists sh..;:!d lose in ittn r heart nor patience and should not indulge in thieats of militancy or eeii agilely hint at it. Militancy in this country would be a harmful fad. as it is a form of insanity hi England. It would not, of course, reecho here the sup port of the v,oi:,.r. whose courage, patience and ,;),:; have won the triumphs already recorded, out 111. y would b- held responsible for it. Slate by state has been gained, and if the same sane methods arc pi. i sued the roil will be ientghi-nod until enough states will be Included to warrant the hope Dt.tx ; national constitutional amendment would be ratifb d. .ngre;;:; and the pr sident w ould not then due to withhold the amendment. We very much doubt whether, if an amend ment were now submitted, it Would be endorsed by the require 1 number of states. In fact, we feel certain Unit it would not be ratified. It could hardly be expected that a state which has denied its own women the privilege of the ballot would support an amendment to bestow it upon the women of the whole country. The campaign must be carried on as it has been, state by state. Tiie defenses of selfishness must be aiaaulted and carried one by one until the chief stronghold of the enemy has been reached. Militancy would almost certainly bring the move ment, now pn g"i ssing rapidly, to a standstill. It would put into the hands of opponents of suffrage a new and mere effective weapon than they have ever wielded.
