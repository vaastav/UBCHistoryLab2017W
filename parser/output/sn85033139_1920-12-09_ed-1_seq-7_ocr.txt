"There is still greater satis faction in having this opportunity to say to you informally some of the things in my heart which I could ut ter In no other way. 1 recognize that 1 am here today under somewhat un usual circumstances, and there is a delicacy about it that one in ray po sition cannot escai>e through some form of self-effacement which does not seem quite possible. “No member of fids body could be more reluctant to leave it. "I say to Hie senate that 1 came here with a very high respect for this body, and I am leaving it with greater respect than that which I came. If one could always direct his own polit ical fortunes to his liking 1 should have preferred my membership here to any office a citizen may hold in this republic or elsewhere in the world.

Something lias been said about the ‘senatorial oligarchy.’ Of course everyone here knows that to be a bit of highly imaginative and harmless fiction. But I do recognize how essential is Hie helpfulness of the senate in the making of a successful administration. "I want to express today the wish of a colleague for the confidence and Hie co-operation of the members of this body In (lie four years which begin next March 4. Ido not limit this sin cere request to tills side of the aisle. One cannot promise agreement in all things with an opposite party which is sometimes Insistently wrong, but we may find common ground In Hie spirit of service, and hope for that agreeable and courteous and oft times helpful relationship with the opposite which has added to Hie delights of fellow service during Hie last six years. "We are facing no easy task. We have our full part in Hie readjustment of human affairs, after the world tu mult. We have our tasks at home, we have our part in the inevitable work of the civilized world. "I am sure that the necessity of wise solution will Inspire us to work to gether; to take common counsel, to be tolerant of one another and give Hie best which is In nil of us to attain the ends which become our republic at borne and will maintain its high place among tho nations of Hie earth. "With propriety I can not venture upon any suggestions now, even though I am speaking as a member of this lind,v. Three months of the pres ent administration remain, and I would have house ami senate join cordially In making them fruitful rather than wasted months."
