S. GUST. Kiecntive Mansion, December 5th, lSTO, A FEW NAKED PACTS. In as much as various reports have been circulated in regard to ourself, arising from the difference in the bills, which came before the County Commissioners, at the late session, for county printing, from the two resnective nrintino- offices 4 E 0 of this place, and when we arc fur ther informed that we made our bills low because of special spite, which, it is claimed, we entertain against our neighbor, L. A. Brunner, of the Union, justice to ourself demands that we give publicity to a few sim ple facts, which will show the utter falsity of the wrong motives with which we have been charged We lifcva nor. lvxn nrtnatixl hv nnr mn. - - -v j tives ot spite or ill will towards any- h.wl... l.iit.no.,.. onnoisWiti'nn we resolved, especially as an advo cate of retrenchment and reform, and also with the conviction that, one wrons should not become the foundation of others, to charge the county no more than individuals, for the same kind of work. . Well, on the 28th of August, 18G9, the County Republican Convention, which assembled at the Court House passed resolutions, strongly advo cating retrenchment and reform, in i-very department of expenditures of the county, and also assuring the public that in case of the success of the licpubliean ticket, the expenses of printing for tlie county would be reduced one half. We endorsed those resolutions. &. vt atson was nominated as Commifsioner upon that platform , During the canvass following, and ou several occasions: we advocated economy in county i expenditures. And we well remeni-: er an incident t-at followed. Our good oatured friend, Jonathan Maf i'ett, who was then a candidate for re-election, meeting us on the street took us to task,; by remarking, '-Cuneo, you arc pitching is to coun tv extravagance, and yet, when you came with your bills, you don't want the Commissioners to cut them down." We replied, ' with consid erable emphasis, If any bills for county printing, which we may in the future present, do not conform to what we preach, and you (the Commissioners) do not cut them down, you are big fools, mark it." .air. Aiancic, we are sure, rememoeis. the conversation and we think will cheerfully bear testimony to the fact that from that hour, our bills passed along the eleetioa came and and went against us in the coun ty, but that did not change our de termination. The first bill we pre sented amounting to 825, wa for publishing ''Times of holding Courts iu 1870," for which we were allowed 845 the year before, and on a for mer year as high as $72 By the la t exhibit we see that Mr. E. Zimmer man, was paid the same amount that we asked and no more. We don't know what his original bill was. The next bill we presented was for 'notice to contractors," for the In firmary, $17.50. The original bill ot Mr. Aiomerinau, tor trie same work was $24, which the Commis sioners cut down to our amount $17.50 . Then came our bill for publishing Tabular Statement of the number of horses, cattle, dec, in the State, which amounted to $42. The bill of Mr. Zimmerman, for the same was $52. Here again the- Commis sioners reduced this bill down to the same amount as our original bill,. namely $42. And when the last exhibit made its. appearance, we learned that for this very same work for which we asked $42, and deemed that a fair compensation, Mr. Zimmerman last year was paid $120.": See Annual Report last year in the Republican of September 10th, 1870. Our next bilfwas for publishing Notice to tax payers, for 1870, six times, for which we pre seated a bill of $80. For this same work Mr. Zimmerman presented bill of $100, which was allowed in full notwithstanding the protesta tions of Mr. McClain. And, as will be seen by reference to the last An nual Exhibit, for the very same pub iicauon, jht. Zimmerman was paid $150 last year. Lastly, comes our bill tor publishing the Annual Ex hibit of Receipts and Expenditures, of the county for the last current year, which two years ago was pub-and his resolution from the Cham lished two weeks, last j car not at bcr. all. We had not forgotten onr preaching and presented a bill of $94, That is what it came to ac cording to our rates of charges, making a little allowance for unnec essary space occupied. Mr. Ij. A. Brunner, presented a bi'l of $250, for the same publication. When we presnted our bill, that of Mr. Brun ner, was already in, and we had no idea as to what charges he intended to make. When these two respect ive bills carce up for the censidera- tion of the Commissioners, Mr. McClain took the position that if P. Cuneo could afford to do the publication for $94, Mr. Brunner ought to be able to do so too, and earnestly protested against paying one office more than the other, for the same work. But he was over ruled by tire other gentlemen, and aftej a deduction of $50, the balance of Mr. Brunners btll, still amount in2LtL$200, and move "than double our bill, was allowed, to which ac tion Mr. McClain entered his pro test on the journal. We have made the above explana tion, as before stated, in justice to ourself, and have no complaint to urge against the Commissioners. Our bills, which we regard as rea sonable, were allowed, and if they see proper to pay other parties, for reasons best known to them for the same work, double the amount we asked, it is theirs and the people's business, not ours. It will thus be seen that our re trenchment and reform, in charges for public printing, did not begin with the bill for the last publication, but long before any one dreamed that Mr. Brunner, who formerlj' pre sided over this paper, would be come editor of the Union. To the question which might be asked why we did not begin this reformation, when we first came here, we reply, that war prices, in printing, as well as other business, declined reluct antly, and that it is better to begin a good work late, than never. And here the question naturally arises "Why did the same Commis sioners cut down the bills of Mr. Zimmerman, refused to pay him more than ourself, at previous ses sions, and bills too, which even as originally presented, ' were much smaller than thjr paid to him for the same work before ? Was it bo cause of a little unpleasantness then existing, which finally resulted in a change of proprietors of the Union ? Finally, we consider it hardly nec essary to say that ;we ' enter tain no Hi will or spite against our neighbor, Mr. Brunner, or any other man, and shall rejoice in his honor able prosperity, and that of man kind generally, providing the same is not used to oar injury. We like money too and need the article as badly as most people, but we tJoa's believe in preaching re trenchment and reform, with one hand, snd then rob the publie treas ury with (the other, at the first op portunity. Hos. J. W. Douglas acting Com missioner, has our acknowledgments for a copy of the Annual Report of ex-Commissioner Delano. It is quite certain that General Schenck has been tendered the ap pointment of Minister to England. This is a selection that, we think, will give eminent satisfaction throughout the nation. Gen. AtFKED Pleasoxton, of New York, has been nominated by the President as Commissioner of In ternal Revenue and will of course be confirmed. The General was one of those gallant leaders of the Union Army during the war, whom the people delight to honor, and will therefore, be glad to learn of his meritorious promotion. Harpers Weekly, of this week, thus concludes one of its political leaders ; "It is long since there has been "so- pure an Administration as that "of General Grant, or one more "sincerely and unostentatiously "devoted to the public welifare." Well said and every word true as the Gospel'. Costgress is earnestly at work and we-believe will accomplish much of wise and needed legislation tin: the House, last week a resolu tion of inquiry tis to the Port of Entry bill was passed. The House adopted, by a vote of 164 to 5, Mr. Kelley's resolution in favor of abol ishing the internal revenue system, except as to whisky and tobacco, and referred to Committee of Ways and Means a resolution' offered by Mr. Cox lor revenue reform. . And on Tuesday, the bill for the consol idation of the Postal Laws, and the abolition of the Franking privilege passed without division. That Democratic fool, Senator McCreerv, of Kentucky, in the Senate, on Wednesday asked permission to offer a joint resolution with a view of digging. up the Union dead at the National Cemetery,, at Arlington and the restoration of the estate to the widow of the dead traitor, Gen. Lee. The Senate ought to kick him 

FROM WASHINGTON. Washington, D. C, Dec. 10, 1870. Mr. Editor. Now you'vedone It, but I forgive you. I am very glad of a chance to exercise that christian virtue on somebody, for there is a case coining up that will require more christian grace than I piave got to forgive. I may forgive this new subject but it will be during my last sickness and after taking leave of all niyYriends. I allude to old Zeb Vance of North Carolina, just elected a United States Senator from that State. When my regiment .in the 10th corps under G eneral Terry joined Sherman near Goldsboro, N. C, on our way up to Raleigh, newspapers w ere scattered among us containing Governor Zeb. Vances' speech which contained the following sentiments, and in the same language or words to that effect, as with jestures wild and voice at a cracking pitch foam ing at the mouth he cried out: "Men of North Carolina rise, take your rifles, your shot guns, your pistols, dirks, clubs, anything boys rise as one, and take axes, picks, spears of your fathers. Women rise a unit, take pitchforks, rocks, hot water and anything available and annihilate these beasts of Yankees. Send them to putrid graves and save your State from Yankee rnle ." On the 11th of May, 1863, Gov. Vance issued a proclamation against deserters from the Rebel armies, and against the Union men of North Carolina-who harbored them and assisted them to escape. In the proclamation he said : 'The father or the brother who does it discourages a member of his family from enlisting should be shot instead of his deluded victim, for he deliberately destroys the soul and manhood of his own flesh and blood. ' And the same is done by him who harbors and conceals the deserter. What honest man will ever wish or permit his own brave sons or patriotic daughters, who bore their parts with credit in this great struggle for independence, to associate, even to its third or fourth generations, with the vile wretch who skulked in the woods, or the still viler coward who aided him, while his bleeding country was call ing in vain for hi help." &To the Union men of the State he said : 'If permitted to live in the State at all, after the close of the war, you will he infamous. You will be hus tled from the polls, and insulted in the streets. A jury ot your coun trymen will not believe you on oath, and honest men everywhere will shun you as a pestilence.", Shortly after the surrender of Lee, ex-Gov. Vance said, in a speech at Greensboro, N. C. : "We have failed this time tltere can be no doubt that but the time is yet coming that the principles for which we fought will succeed. I may ant live to see it, but certainly my children will, and, if I live to be an old man, I shall see it also." . In a speech delivered on the 7th of February, 1868, he said that, when his party should get posses sion of the State, the condition of the Republicans would "be worse than that of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah." "Boys, fight till h 1 freezes over, and then tight on the ice. Fight until you fill h 1 so full ot Yankees that their feet stick out of the win dows." And now this man is sent to leg islate for those Yankees as United States Senator ! I remember well seeing the crowd soon after rush along through Goldsboro, and learning that Zeb Vance had been caught and the Blue Boys were taking him to the cars to start him for Washington a prisoner. I followed after, went into the car, took a seat opposite the ckinless beauty and contemplated his greatness and could but think of the pitchfork speech, and thought to myself that he could have had no good reason to complain if we should make him discount hit) own issue, and toss him over to Wash ington on a three tincd pitchfork. Maybe Congress will forgive him. It will take a divine stack bigger than I can raise till the hickups get me in my last sickness: He boasts that he has not been forgiven, has never asked it, and never will stoop to the hellish Yankees to ask it. The two great marvels of the age are : First The horrible character of the unnatural rebelion with its An- dersonvillc, yellow feverysmall pox fire audjissassination. Second The leniency and mag nanimity of the 'loyal government. Maybe Zeb Vance will sit in the Senate and occasionally graciously permit a loyal visitor to enter the Senate chamber into his august presence. Thurman will vote "yeay" Sher man, "nay." ' N. A. G. Commissioner- Delano, in his In ternaL Revenue Report just publish ed, recommends-the discontinuance of the detective branch of the serv ice as carried on by spies and in formers and by the payment of moieties; 1 he suggestion is a good one.- Nothing has tended to bring theTnternal- Revenue system into so- much- odium as the system of espionage and'the corruption engen deredbyiG The copulation of Pittsburg and its surrounding suburbs is 167, 933. of which Alleghany City has 53,201, The President's Message. We cannot doubt that General Grant's seco'nd Annual Message will be read with hearty approval by a great majority of his countrymen and with interest and pride by them all. The prominent features of his Administration hud already com manded popular approbation, but this Message will still more endear the President to the hearts of his countrymen. Peace unbroken even bv an Irdian massacre, though our Western pioneers insist that Indi ans are fitly dealt with only when treated like rattlesnakes : an ample Revenue, a rapidly diminished and dimishing National Debt, reduced Taxes with persistent reduction of tne National Expenditures such are the general outlines of our last year's Instorj'. Why should it not be regarded with complacency by the President and with crratitnde and pride by the American people?. With regard to San Domingo, the President is clearly right ia his po- smon it not misinformed as to the material facts ; and we think he is not. If the people of that republic heartily desire to unite their desti nies, with ours, why should we cold ly repulse them ? That they do so desire, the continuance in power of Baea seems to establish. His an nexation proclivities are proved and unquestionable; ifthev are odions. why .as he not been overthrown ? We submit that Congress will be constrained by public sentiment to admit San Domingo into our Union unless it can te made to appear that her people are prepond erantly averse to such a fusion. If they are so, that fact should be con clusive ; but the weight of testimony is now in the scale of Annexation. Unless the aspect shall be materially changed, the Repnblic of San Do mingo will be merged in the United States within the year 1871. We do not anticipate from that acces sion all the blessings expected bv the President : yet we are snre that San Domingo is worth a dozen Alas- kas or, if 3'ou prefer, that twelve Sau Domingos would not weigh so heavily upon us as one Alaska. There can be no mistake as to the general accord with Gen. Grant's recommendations on this head. What is saiii by the President re specting the War now raping in Cen tral Europe is so well said that we are impelled to wish that he had said more. However,"enonghi3sgood as a feast." ' The President's suggestions and recommendations' with regard to the Public Lands and Landgrants are generally wise and tirrely. His commendation of the services of Postmaster General Creswell has been richly earned ; and we wish the President had thanked him espe ciall for his efllcient warfare on the odious Frankiuj Privilege. As to '-Revenue Reform," Gen. Grant is in hearty accord with the public judgment. He favors all possible reform, but no destruction either of Revenue or Protection. He might have defended the latter more emphatically : but his heart is in the right place, and bis best efforts will not be wanting to sus tain the exposed and assailed depart ments of our National Industry. ' Many will bo surprised by the President's hearty indorsement of Civil Service Raforni ; hut he has been there all along. We trust that reform will receive a decided impe tus from his earnest commendation. Finally, the President's umaiin up of the leading objects of his pol icy, and especially his desire to se cure "a pure, untrammeled ballot," must appeal cogently to the judg ment and affections of the American people. He is Abraham Lincoln's lineal successor, and the popular heart beats in unison with his aspi rations and his efforts. ye to York Tribune. Sad Accieent. One of the most melancholy and heartrendering accidents which it has been our duty as a news gather er to chronicle, occurred near this village on Sunday last. Theparticu lars, in brief, are as follows: A few weeks since Dr. A. P. Pownall of this place, after a brief courtship, was married to Miss Mar J. Wilson, also a resident of this place. Short ly after his marriage Dr. Pownall united with the Christian Church, aud Sunday last was appointed as the day of his baptism, he having requested his pastor, the Rev . J. B. Hough, to perform the rite. At the appointed hour a large number of persons assembled on the banks of Crooked creek, the place chosen for the immerson. After singing and praver, cvervthing being ii readi ness, the Rev. Hough entered the water, leading the doctor, and the descent being very gradual they were oblidged to proceed some dis tance from the shore in order to reach a sufficeut depth, but sudden ly both were seen to go down, hav ing stepped over a bank concealed by the water; both soon arose to the surface, and the Rev. Hough regained the bank, but the doctor being unable to swim was swept by current under a floodgate only a short distance below , every exertion was made to save him, but in vain. The body was soon after found and brought ashore amid the most heart rending screems from bis young wife and friends. Everything possible was done to resuscitate the doctor, but alas! the vital spark had flown. This sad occurrence has cast a gloom over th e country miles arouud, all joining in nxtend- ng tbeir sympathy to Mrs Pownall 'Cincinnati' Gazette. The President's Message, con taining 8,085 words, was sent to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York over 10 wires of the Western Union Telegraph Company in 374 minutes, actual time emplojed, or at the average rate of 25 words per minute on each wire, including all "breaks" or incidental delays. The pardon by the President of T. C. Callicot, who was some Vears ago sentenced to the Albany Peni tentiary for revenue frauds, only affects the fine against him of $10; 000. He had served his full term of imprisonment, and was- held" for the payment of his fine; The Pres ident remitted this part of the sen tence upon the representation that Callicot is poor, and cannot pay it. The Roman Catholic Protest. Are not American citizens of the Roman Catholic faith making a blun der in protesting against the occu pation of Rome by the Italian gov ernment? That they should send to the Pope, the head of their re ligious denomination, a letter an nouncing to him their devotion to tbeir faith, their reverence for his person, and their desire for hi com fort and welfare, would be natural It would have well become them, too, as American citizens, living in a country where church and state separated, and having experience of he beneficial results or our Ameri can system, to congratulate the Pope upon his release from the cares of temporal government, whereby be is enabled to give his whole attention to the spiritual administration of the numerous body of Christians who acknowledge him as their bead and chief bishop, and look to him as their principal guide and coun sellor. American Roman Catholics, know ing that the Pope had given up un illingly the temporal power and honors which he has recently lost, might well have pointed oct to him, in the most respectful manner, that the loss is a benefit to all Roman Catholics, as well as to himself; that it relieves the Pope from re sponsibilities incompatible with his religious office; and from reproach es, concerning civil misgovernment, which he found it difficult to answer. and which affected, while he lay under them, bis whole religious ad ministration. Moreover, these American Roman Catholics might usefully have told the Pope that the experiment of sep arating entirely civil and religious administration had worked noinju ry to the cause of sound religion in this country, where it has been tried ever since our government was founded. They might have added that this separation had their cor dial assent here, and that the pres ent position 6f the Pope, relieved of civil powers and responsibilities, makes him, in fact, if he and the mesabers of the church of which he is the head wisely acquiesce in tnis change, a far more effective head, guide, counsellor and bishop than he was before. Instead of this, we are sorry to see the Roman Catholic bishops and clergy speaking of the occupation of Rome by the Italian government as a "robbery of the Pope ;" an act to be condemned and resisted by all Roman Catholics. The address of the bishops speaks of the "unjust, and sacreligious usurpation and spoliation of the city of Rome by the wicked Piedmontese govern ment;" "the injustice done to the Pope, unparalleled since the cruci fixion ;" "a conspiracy of anti Christian anarchists who covet and steal," who are "thireting for bliod ," arid who wouJJ "destroy the very ideal of honesty," Ac. TLcse are hard words from pro fessed followers of Him who suffer ed a cru 1 death without resistance, and who said: "But I say unto you that ve resist not evil ; but whoso ever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." The protest read in the Komao Catholic churches in this city on Sunday, denounces the act of the Italian government "with the just and religions abhorrence of Chris tians who revere th' sacred sover eignty of the Holy Sec over its tem poral domain," and speaks of "'he right which we, as Catholic, pos sesses of being governed by a chief complete' exempted from and in dependent of all civil authority." The protest read in the Roman Catholic churches of Philadelphia asserts that "the spoliation of the Holy Father" "trammels him and deprives him of that freedom and independence which are necessary in the government of the churches." Now, when an American reads such . assertions as these he very naturally remembers that the Epis copalians, the Ba-lists, the Presby terians, the Methodists, the Qua kers, get along very well without a chief or head "completely exempted from and independent of all civil authority;" and remembering this, he must regard these claims of the Roman Catholic priesthood as un reasonable, not to say preposterous. The Roman Catholic demand in fact separates those who make it from the sympathies of all Americans, It asserts for the chief of that denom ination something different from what it wuld grant to all others. It arrays, so far as such a protest can, Roiian Catholics against mod ern civilization. It is a blunder which the most zealous friends of Roman Catholicism ought to have prevented. We ought to add, that as a mat ter of fact the Pope has not been ill-treated by the Italians, as the bishops assert On the contrary, he has received the greatest respect ; and if he is uncomfortable in Rome, he is at liberty to live elsewhere. What a stroke of genius it would have been in the American Roman Catholics, had they invited him to come to this couutry, and offered to provide for him a home as splendid as his heart could desire. 2f.
