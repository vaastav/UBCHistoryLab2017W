CONDITION OF THE SOUTHERN 8TATES. OUR MILLEBtEWlE COIBESPOtlKWCt. Hi. i wmittiiijEf Gft-i Dec. 6, 1800. The meeting of the Legialature concentrates Informa tion In reference to all parts of the .-Hate. Milled/eville la i small place of some two thousand Inhabitants, half and half, with but one hotel of any prominence, in which a majority of the members, and those of most Intelligence and influence at home, are domiciled to gether for the spaoe ef the six woek* which the session la-ls. Tno utmost freedom prevullv in tho intercour o of tho members. All disguise is thrown off, and que tlous of all klndq nre dlacussed with all tho abandon that prevailed in the palmiest days of the confederacy. There Is a disposition, to which I think propor to allnde, among some who have lost all by the success of the United States arms, and who ha\ a not entered upon tho work of repairing their fortunes, or who may have settled down In a permanent sttle of dospondonoy, to talk, In a very free and unlicensed manner, against the measures of the government. This freedom of speech they sometimes use with a sort of flcndlsh pleasure, whenever Northern correspondents are pros ent, little recking how their conversation would appear In Northern prints. And sometimes this sort of speech Is need with evident Intention to mislead those whom they think would gloat over tho revelations they pretend to make, as evidence of lurking troason In the Southern ?eart. It Is possible that sometlmos Ignorance profound and depravity unexampled may lead to tho expression ef disloyal sentiments towards a government all have ?worn to support, and under whose protection they en joy the very freedom of speech which they so grossly pervert At home their conduct Is regretted. But wher ever you see men determined to reinstate themselves in the atniles of fortune, and to build up for themselves name and fame, nothing of the kind alluded to occurs. The deprivation of fortune and the sudden plunging Into the vale of poverty, If not oT penurv, has ofton proved a source of demoralization; and not tho lo.sof property in slaves nor other pecuniary losses so much excite our pity and commiseration as the Absence of self-reliance, em rgy and oconomy where tbmt Is all that can avail for the attainment of cornp" tency. If you hco a man industriously at work to set himself up again, and to make use of all the means 10 Ilia power to re-establish the fortune be may have lost, you may set It down as certain that such a man leaves the government to go Its own way, and politics to take care of themselves. Nothing would make a Northern man more regret the nnn-reMoratlon of tho iftely re bellious States than the plea that is made by some of Ihe fact to engage in ho work by which Individual pro" Klty may be promoted and tho general weal of the te and of the whole country enhanced. We do not wish to be understood as implying that any vary large class of the citizens of Georgia are hopeless or desponding. The results of the crops this year prove Uta contrary. In the faco of one of the most baleful drought* that the Plate has ever seen the crops are such aa to give the greatest encouragement for future agricul taral labor. Reasoning man will take Into account the pbsUclee in the way of successful agriculture this year, aad will be encouraged by partial success to strive harder the coming year. Already men have expressed (heir regrets that they have lost a year in inactivity, and another year they are determined to dob" tier ; while (ha feeling of hope has sprung up gouoraily In the Afri aaa breast, and higher wages are u.-kod and promised the osxt year. The Legislature af the State is also Influenced by gene ral hope which has revived. Railroads have been char tered to run In evary direction through the State. State encouragement has been given to foreigners and people from the North to settle here, aod manufacturing and mining companies are as abundant as could be dial red. No | > papers are shunned because they are radical tf they are truer A" the principal papers of Now York are freely circulated, and I even beard the JYibune spoken ef by a prominent member of tho Leg'hlaturo as one of Ibe best and ablest papers la the country. In mauy Instances the transformation of habits among people Is truly wouderful. I have often seen the keecl * ' " i character sticking out so plainly In native born e Georgians that 1 have wondered myself. Men and even Woman and children have gone to the field or to appro priate work, while the African is loft foe to fllTlhe ?eboolhousos t i with his children, and to refuse to allow MB children to do menial work. The change will still go - cbsni la addition to ttiis a very marked change is taking Sin thj comparative number of whites and black* in of the reunites. The counties best adapted to the J of cotton, whero the best prices for lanor can be are d'-pluiiug rapidly the grain counties, while ever the road* thai lead to the more fertile lands of (be West a constant stream of block population is flow ing with Increasing volume. A bill will be Introduced lite the Legislature to tax negro brokers $f>00. as it is seriously apprehended that under the enticing influence ef high wages some counties may lose land the loss will be forever) mure of tho black population than can be gl spared at tho present time. Under the inspiring uSnce of hope aDd reviving prosperity the demoral .ion and marked mortality among the African race been arrested. The great incubus on Georgia Is private debts. The eu Legislature strongly squints at repudiation ? but it certain)? will not be attempted in this session,nexcept py tbe influence of stay and exemption laws of the kind Indicated formerly. The bonds of the ra lroad to run from Maoon to Bruns wick will be endorsed by tbe Mate, and In consequence frs friends to the measure who have been using ad iheir Mfrglss to carry the measure through the Legislature think the road will be tin.*hed In twelve or eighteen months. The railroad known a* the Alt Lino, whose President lives in New York, will also have Its bonds Corsed by the State; at least such Is tbe probability. Legislature has pasted a hill to that effect, aud tbe ?ly doubt on tho subject Is whether a two thirds ma ?ty In both bousfle dan he obtained to pass it ovsr kins' veto, for be wilt certainly vetq Ik The Prmldent's Message was received in Milledgevlll* |be day after Its delivery In Washington.
