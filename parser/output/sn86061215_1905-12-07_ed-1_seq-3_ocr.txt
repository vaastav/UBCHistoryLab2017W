William Allen White, though simply ft Kansas editor, has long since estab lished his claim to distinction as a reader of men. His keenness and ability along this line was readily ad mitted generally when his character sketches of Bryan, Cleveland, Hanna, Piatt and others of the most prominent public men of the day were given to the public. These and his other writ ings on timely subjects have given him a reputation as almost a national ora cle, and It is no more than natural that his article on Governor Folk of Mis souri, which appears one of the current magazines,-should attract con siderable attention. Mr. Polk is probably the foremost possibility as the democratic presi dential candidate in 1908. It would be hard to get Hearst followers to admit this, of course, but it is nevertheless true, and he will be, from now until the curtain is rung down at the end of the campaign three years hence, a prominent figure in the public life of the nation. Mr. White's article then, will no doubt have a large part in the shaping of Folk's own future, whether "Folk would have it so or not. Mr. White takes a very cool view of ^he young David of democracy. He calls his sketch, "The Story of a Little Leaven in a Great Commonwealth." Of the things that Folk has done he says: "The truth is, that they are of the sort that are simple enough if one cares to undertake them with aft hon est and hardy purpose and as for the man Folk, he is a most ordinary young man, equipped with the usual physical and mental accouterments whose only difference from many other young gentlemen in Vanity Fair is that Folk has sense cirmgh THE to be honest and to make it ray." This is what ho l*"" to stv of his candidacy for the -r~-- —in 190S: "The friends of good government in this land should •'1--ii i.ho:]- emotions while thinking of Folk as pmsirlontial candidate, and give hir.i such nbsent treatment as they can to make him a good governor of Missouri and, after that, an active citizen of his community until he stall grow in mental stature, to keep up ith his moral stature, and shall be ripened for whatever- great and good work his country-may have for him. Just because a sapling is straight, is no reason why it should be strong enough for a beam of a ship. With ten years of seasoning in public life—perhaps six of it at Washington —Folk would be sound and strong and worthy of any burden but now his duty lies In Missouri, at his appointed tasks." ROGERS CASE. Mrs. Wm. J. Blickensdorfer, the re cognized leader in the efforts to free Mrs. Mary Rogers, the woman con demned by the Vermont courts of the murder of her husband, is to make a last appeal to Governor Bell of the Green 'Mountain state. Mrs. Rogers' friends hope that she may be saved "WtSii'W from the gallows that must end her life within a week. Her case has been carried through the Vermont courts, and the United States supreme court, without securing a reversal of the orig inal decree of guilty, but still her friends do not give up the fight. While there is nothing pleasant in the Idea of a woman being hanged, there is no reason under the law why \J\Z P?y ,, ^7ei715'ata^1 her husband. of the most brutal criminals of which a a ™an, COI?Y su®erer come^consWut^i^^The1^6catarrhal twr* •h: nothing to the womanliness of any woman to labor in behalf of a person condemned of a base crime, be that person man of woman. It is true that the chivalry that is inborn in a man prompts him to pro test against the execution of Mrs. Rog ers, but it is also true that the law, following the Biblical injunction,"Thou shalt not kill," makes the crime of murder punishable by death. Whether the murderer be a man or a woman, matters not in the eye of the law, and the law should govern in a case where guilt is so clear as it is in the case of Mrs. Rogers.

GERMANS SHOULD TAUGHT A LESSON. BE Des Moines Capital.—The German government has formally notified tne United States of America of the term ination of an existing treaty fixing mutual tariff rates on certain articles. By arrangements heretofore made a number of German articles were ad mitted into the United States at a low rate of duty and In return Germa.ny granted to the United States the rates on certain other articles equal to any concession to any other government. Now Germany announces that she wants a better Arrangement or she will quit dealing with us except that we pay an increased duty. There is some indication that the state department will stand pat and tell Germany to proceed In her own way. American freight and passengers are enriching German steamship compan ies every year. There could be scarce ly a German ship on the sea were it not for the American dollass paid to the companies owning such ships. German steamship companies receiv ed this year $15,000,000 for bringing immigrants to the United States. Therefore the conduct of Germany is an insult to common fairness and jus tice and our state department ought to give the German government some plain language. In Germany there are guides and commercial organizations which pay export bounties to enable German manufacturers to unload cheap goods into the United States. There is an export bounty paid on coal shipped out of Germany. German iron and steel makers receive a bounty on their exports. And It is almost a German rule to sell everything abroad cheaper than at home. Manufacturers are bet ter organized in Germany than in any other country on the globe. The Ger man coke syndicate sells to the Iron companies in Austria blast furnace coke for $1.97 per ton, while the price to German furnace men is held stiff at $4.04 per ton. The steel girder syndicate fills orders from abroad at $21.18 to $21.89 per ton while maintain ing a home rate of $28.56 per ton. Steel rails made In Germany are'sold at $7 per ton cheaper abroad than at home. The wire mills' sell their pro duct abroad at $25 per ton and at home at $35.70 per ton. These facts are stated in the official report of Frank H. Mason, consul gen eral of the United States, dated at Berlin, Germany, September 27. 1902. If Germany pays bounties' for ex ports to cause the Sale of her goods away from home, and If Germany is paid millions of American dollars for freight and passengers on her ships, the state department of the United States and the senate ought to be able to give Germany some plain language at the present time. What is needed in the United' States is a stroi -'er determination to stand by our own country and teach the Ger mans an important lesson. THE 

PRESIDENT 18 RIGHT. Des Moines Capital.—The President will undoubtedly recomihiend the right enactment on the railroad question and congress will undoubtedly act In pursuance of the President's recom mendation. These have been assured fact? for a year. The Iowa members' of congress have been with the President on this ques tion from the start, and iiiteilTgent men know it. The country can be congratulated on having such a President and the state of Iowa can be congratulated on having such a strong and loyal delegation In congress. Publicity has done much toward wiping out some of the wrongs Jn rail road management, and wijl do more In the future. Railroads cannot^ afltord to go against public opinion.

Henry Mulvey was one of the principal heirs prior to the reconciliation oi his aged brother and the divorced wife, and the act will cost him many thousands of dollars. Nevertheless he cr.ya he is satisfied be cause he did right. Having balanceu all earthly ac counts, Charles Mulvey, the veteran iron manufacturer, died yesterday aft ernoon at his house, 361 Thirty-sixth street. His wife, to whom ha Lad been remarried but thirty hours, and in whose favor he had redrawn his will half a day before, was at his side. With his last wprds he told Mrs. Mul vey he was dying happy because of the reconciliation, which brought him again within the pale of the Catholic church. Mr. and Mrs. Mulvey were married in Ireland thirty-eight years ago. Last May they were divorced, and were re married last Friday night. Fearing the verbal will of Saturday afternoon might not be binding, and desiring that his wife get a part of his estate, late Saturday nioht Mr. Mulvey insisted that a written instrument be drawn up.
