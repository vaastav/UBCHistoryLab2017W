Its malig nant power and uuscrupulousness, the dead mischief of its purnoses and its frigid and calm style invested with ter rible force bespeak his death as a great public man. There is much of hideous levity in the document iu which I'arnoll w ill press his pen across the treatment given by England to Ireland and home rule. Happily 1'arnell is but an isolated factor. The Irish party has its Dillons, O'Hrieus and Healys as well as Parnell. Until these men meet and decide upon a 1 rupture of the situation existing between i the nationalists ana liberals, it is needless to talk of a dissolution of that which will never be dissolved by the act of one man. the enlargement of our currency through the passage of the ti!ver bill, lint the natural and desired offset of silver legis lation was by many attributed to the tariff net. It is not just that the subject of tariff revision shall be opened before it has had a fair trial. The cause will justify the support of those who believe in de fending American industries.

To-day a meeting will be held in this city at the auditorium hotel at which another effort will be made to organize the old silver smelters of the United Statea into one gigantic trust. A combination was attempted about a year I ago but fell through on account of the declination of two or three of the most I prominent companies to enter. Since that time, however, Mr. Thompson, president of the National White Lead Trust, has ; been working hard to reconcile the differ ences that developed during the negotia tions of last year, and it is believed that the call for a meeting to day is an intimation that he lias succeeded. At present the white lead trust is the only combination of any magnitude exist ing in tne lead industry. Every whito lead company in the country save one, is a member of the trust. There are twonty one lead smelting refineries in the United States, and they represent an invested capitnl of many millions. The capital of the whole trust is $3,000,000 and a com bination of the smelters would mean a joint investment many times greater than this amount. The Pnbllo Fund). Washington, Dec. 1. The report of the secretary of the treasury contains sev eral tabulated statements showing as near ly as is possible the exact amounts of various kinds of money in actual circula tion among tne people at several different periods from 1870 to the present time. From these tables it is shown that during the twenty years from October 1, 1870, to October 1, 189t), the total increase of cir culation was over $727,000,000, making an average increase per month of $3,032, 33d, and an increase per capita in 1870 of $19.07, and in 1890 of $23.96. For the period of three months from July 1 to October 1, 1890, the aggregate increase in actual use among the people was $08,354,339, making an averago monthly increase of $22, 782,778.
