WASHINGTON. Dec. S, The only mcasuro of Importance which tbo senato lias on Its calendar for the present week Is tho now Hny-Pauncefotc treaty, making provision lor the abrogation of tho Clayton-Bulwer treaty and opening tho wa for the unob structed construction of an Isthmian canal by the United States. Acting for the com mittee on foreign relations Senator Lodgo will nsk tho senato to go Into executive session tomorrow for the consideration of the treaty und each day thereafter until tho treaty Is disposed ot. It can be said that at this time the prospect Is very strong that the treaty will bo ratified and It now looks ns If this remit would be secured after comparatively little delay. There will be some debate nnd some fea- mrps o the document will bo criticised as undesirable, but there is no probability of ruptlous opposition. Tho criticism will bo along the lines indicated by Senators Money and Bacon. In the committee on foreign re lations at Its meeting on last Friday. No Mkh nf 0iinltlnn. No senator has thus far shown a .dispo sition to carry his discussions to a point of ultimate nffort to defeat ratification. Tho principal authors of the criticism, of tho treaty aro southern senators, who arc" generally very anxious for the construc tion of thrf canal, Tbey find that all cansl legislation will be tfed up until action can bo secured on the treaty nnd they are ou this account less llahlo than they other wise would be to do anything to delay action upon tho treaty Itself. Tho most actlvo friends of the treaty uow claim that rati fication will bo secured during tho present week, and tho opinion Is very general that ratification will be obtained before the Chrlstmah holidays, l.lttlr llnlno Iti-fnrr llnllrtn? . Beyond tho consideration of the treaty very little business will bo undertaken bo foro tho holidays. It Is now generally agreed that the question of reciprocity will go over until January, probably without so much as being montloned, and It may be added that from being for u time tho sub ject most likely to attract early attention, It has taken a position among the matters which will not be vigorously urged. When the reciprocity treaties do come up for consideration there will be persistent op position to the agreement with France nnd lo that with Great Britain covering tho West Indies. There i not so much feeling over the conventions with tbe South American re publics. The present outlook Is also against tho Immediate action in tho senate looking to tnrltf legislation for tbe Philippines and there are some indications that the senate will wait upon the house of representatives in this matter. Probably tho Chinese ex clusion act wjll be reported from com mittee during the week. The nomination of Attorney General Knox will bo reported nt tho first executivo session, but imme diate confirmation will probably ho antag onized by sonio senators. 

DIFFER ON INSULAR TARIFF Expect llnnae to l'n it Mrnrinrc Meet the Situation Till AVttk. In WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. The house this week will probably pnss a mcasuro to meet the situation treated hy the Philippine de clslon of tbe supremo, court last Monday. Up to the present time, however, tho re publican members of the ways and means committee have Dpt decided upon the char actcr of the measure which will bo re ported. A difference ot opinion exists as to whether there should be a temporary en actment of the Dlnglcy rates on goods en tering the United States from the Philip pines, or whether a permanent possession of the island should be prepared. It Is said Chairman Pnyne favors the latter course. The republican committees will meet again tomorrow. If It Is decided to enact terdporary measure the procedure will be exceedingly simple and It probably can be passed In a day. If, on the other band, an entire scheme of tariff legislation is to be consummated more time will be taken up In the preparation and passage.
