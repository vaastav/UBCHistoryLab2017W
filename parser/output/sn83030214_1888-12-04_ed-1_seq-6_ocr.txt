The farts set forth in the report Of the committee which has been eons-dering th" question of niovinj; ujitoAvn are oonvinbing of the need of a change. It ls proposed tn ck ct a new build? ing between Fortieth and Fifty-ninth sta. and Third ami Birth ave-. That would bc a cen? tral location, which is in even way desirable. There is little floobl thal the Board of Educa? tion will act favorably on tho committee's recomniendaiinns, and the Hoard of Estimate teed not hesitate to make the necessary ap? propriation. Compaiatively little interest ivis aroused by tho opening of the la.st session of the Lth Con? gress. Apart from the reading of the Presi? dent's Ifcosagc which did not attract extraor? dinary attention, no business of Importance vhs transacted. dThc contract between thc scenes yesterday and those of last year was striking. The Democrats, who entered i year ?go on a campaign thal led to defeat and dis usfr, were naturally downcast.

The people of thil country. howCTCT, ari- not to he deOdTCd OJ honeyed words. They know by actual experi? ence what Anarchism is and what it leads to, and they will have none of it. . TBE MESS Hi E. President Cleveland's Message is the snarl of a Lenten candidate, lu a document which should he a dignified State paper he has taken pains to exhibit tho soreness of a discarded politician because the policy which he had forced upon his party \a:us defeated hy the people. In his passion he loses his sense cf the titnes* of things. Kven his worshippers in "The Evening Post*' attribute his nae of "terms here and there which may bc con? sidered injudicious'' to "the natural feelings '? of one who has"' Leen beaten. No ono will find his respect for President Cleveland in creased hy his passionate talk about thc "self? ish greed and grasping avarice*' of manufact? urers as a class, or hy his suggestion that they " Improperly influence" voters, or by his frantic assertion that corporation- "are fast becoming the people's masters.'' lt is not true. Mr. Clevi - land, and your defeat is proof. No other Presi? dential candidate has ever had behind Um as powerful an array of " trusts, combinations and monopolies" as that which had been brought hy EzecntiTC and legislative favors to thc sup port of .Mr. Cleveland. The telephone con? spiracy, the Sugar Trust, the whiskey ring, the combination Of Wall Street sharpers with hank? ers who held over fifty millions of the public money, the Washington real estate lobbers, the hod of other Jobs aad monopolies which leagued with foreign manufacturers and importers lo I.reak down an American policy, hoped to own the Government after Mi. Cleveland's re-el.ty. ti. n. They failed, and Mr. Cleveland and his Free Traders went down with them, and the decisive votes were cast, as everybody knows, hy the phtis people of the farming regions who are not mastered hy corporations, and do not mean to bo. Ile who scolds sixty millions of people for failing to appreciate his transcendent wisdom and devoted patriotism offers n<> new argu? ments in self-justification, hut not unnaturally borrows fi-,,m the Anarchist, and Communists of Paris a phrase, " the communism of capital," and hy comparison Justifies the bomb-thrower who "attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule." Most conservative anil dignified, these suggestions ! Hut they move the Nation to re flecl "ith satisfaction that it nol only Reclined to re-elect such ;i Chief Magistrate, but never would have elected him had not the voice of the people been suppressed in certain states. The arti mpt to stir up Anarchy in this coun? try, hy p;i:i.!> ring to ignorance and passion, by inflaming employed against employer and poor again-; rich, is not worthy of any ritizen in a self-governing State, bul it is nevcrtheli fM the only resort of the Free Trader in debate when confronted With evidence of tho harmoni? ous progress and unexampled prosperity of ail classes and all industries under the protective system. The President sacrifices historical accuracy t.. his free-trade theory when he argues thal tie- necessity for a reduction of revenue is as great and urgent as it was. The public reve? nue is no long.-r swelling but diminishing, and would diminish much more were tho laws im? posing duties on imports construed and en i f. reed in the interests of the people of this country, and according to th" manifest intent of those laws. Th.- appropriation.! have been largely increased by the present Congie'-, a fa?t which the President's brief reference t" ?lie finances d .es not make prominent. Put it is true that there is no controversy between par? ties as to the propriety of a reduction of reve? nue, and in reaching that conclusion ihe people do not need to adopt the ignorant notion tha* all money left in their hands is worth to them <: percent annually, which, strange to say. linds its way into thc Message of the President. The review of tlie operations of various de? partments elaborately compliments those Call? ine! officers whose performances have been acceptable t" (he country. Th" manage? ment of the .Navy Department is lauded, as if it had not been made ridiculous hy the defects of costly vessels built upon plans purchased from England. The postal service is praised, as if it h.ol nol been, hv its notorious and , shameful inefficiency, a potent oauso of the , President's defeat. Kven Mr. Garland is com , plimented, hut not for lifting a finger to enforce United States Suffrage laws in Southern States nor for refusing a gift of stock in a corporation seeking Executive assistance. To many the President's melancholy silence on the subject Of <i\il Service reform will suggest tha; the occasion for professions of zeal in that direction has pgssed. The Message js not as carefully written :is the President'- other official papers, lint its i crude or awkward phrases count for nothing in comparison with its mischievous tone. It ' would no*, be out of place f,,,.,',,. Senate sharp l.\ t<. rel.ul;.- a chief Magistrate who Mts himself to inflame blind prejudice and lawless ] passion against employers generally, whatever their persona! worth or merit, and against the institutions and laws which the people have recently sustained hy their verdict. Mr. Cleve? land gained in reputation for courage and can? dor when he cut through disguises ami avowed tree-trade theories. Put he doe.s not gain in any respect when he gives vent, to personal soreness and passion in his last annual Message 

EORE1GS ELLA TIOSS. The Message contains a perfunctory rather than a luminous review of the Nation's foreign relations. The President contents himself with referring to his special DMSSagCS 00 the Fish? eries Treaty and Retaliation as embodying his views respecting questions a* issue between tho United States and Canada. A- those tun mea presenled two antagonistic policies, each of which excluded tho other, ii was manifestly Impracticable for him to reconcile them. He prudently leaves each 'ul. to stand on its own bottom. Vet he cannot conceal a cynical In? difference to the questions ol American rights ; involved in the fisheries controversy. Ile re? peats with complacency the remark tha* since March '?>. 1 S^7, no complaint has been mad,. of unfriendly or unlawful treatment of Ameri . can fishing reseals for which reparation has not been promptly ol,tained from ( umida. Out? rages, it is true, have 11 ased (luting that period on the Dom.m.,i. ?eataerd, bul American ti>l? - lng vessels have beeysystematically deprived of their commercial righi*. The state De? partment has roi secured reparation for the long seri.-. ..f outrages which occurred during the lirst hali ..f thc President's term, nor has it I enforced, recognition of those commercial privileges which are guaranteed by the prin? ciples cf maritime reciprocity. Tin." ques nous ot Americas rights an- dismissed in the Message as .,1 trivia] consequence. The Presi? dent apparently considers that he ha~ done will enough to prevent the recurrence of ag grossive. outrages during the second half ol his term The President, in disoussing the State De? partment's relations with Giant Hritain. wan embarrassed by the political us.- which ba had made i f Bi kaliatioo and the^Sackville incident. Ordinarily, diplomatic questions do not fall within UM rang" of National politics and are rigidly excluded from them. Tho exigencies Of the recent Presidential canvass compelled the Administration to violate time-honored precedents. Something had to be dene te re? trieve the unpopularity caused by the negotia? tion of ia un-American treaty and by th" adoption of aa EnfUsh econ..mic policy. The Retaliation Message wai a political counter? stroke designed for campaign purposes. Tho expulsion of Lord Sackville was a similar manoeuvre rendered DCCeesaiy by his untimely identification of Democratic with Knglish pol? icy. Each incident was a detail of the political canvass in which the President was looking re? election. Both episodes an- out of place in a seri? ous review "f purely international affairs. Tho Retaliation Message involved a direct reversal | of nearly four yean of diplomatic policy. Tho President perceives this lack of continuity, and is exceedingly wary in discussing Retaliation. Cut when he thinks of Lord Sackvilb-'s indis? cretion his reflections are embittered by politi eal disappointment and baffled ambition. Ho denounces th" lin'ish Minister's conduct in un? measured terms, and socks to justify tho pre? cipitate haste with which the offender was dis? missed. Americans as well as Knglishmen will read this passage with amusement. Kve.-y ..ne knows that Lord Sackville Ava* sent heine in response to a loud and imperative demand fr. tn Democratic headquarters. Something had to be done without another day's delay to pre? vent a general stampede of the Irish vote. The remainder of the diplomatic chapter of the Message comprises dull summaries of unin? teresting controversies with various nations. The revolution in llayti is dealt with perhaps too briefly, hut the requirements of (he neut].il. itv laws are clearly ami cdrrectly stated. The treaty with China li&hts up alioth.-: reminis? cence of th" President?) political canvass. The Sam. an negotiations respecting Germany's high-handed acts of meddlesome intervention in the political affairs ofthe islands are not dis dosed. Only oin- State secret is hinted at. namely, international action by the chief mar? itime Powers fd 'li" protection of fur-seal in Bi hiing Sea. This will he a most useful con? vention, provided i' Involves no sacrifice <>f maritime Jurisdiction obtained by the United from l'ii--ia by the treaty of ce;ssi..ii. 'lhere are the usual recommendations for the revision of naturalization laws and tho reor? ganization of the consular service which every Administration makes ami then neglects to ..?un om. The diplomatic career of the Ad? ministration, inglorious and vacillating from th" beginning, is practically brought to a close by this dull and spiritless review. 

NORTHERS MA-HiRl HES AND CUSS. In tie- Eastern States, Kew-England, New . oik. New-Jersey and Pennsylvania) the plu ralit] for Harrison was ovei 150,000, and in the Western Mate- formerly non-slave-hold? ing it was about 295,000. Thus the Repub? lican party carries every Northern State except New-.b'isc\ and Connecticut, iind, in neithei of these has the Democratic party a majority. while the Republican plurality,in all the North? ern Statis will he al,..ut 1 15,000, though in the absence of official returns from some Western States it cannot yet be precisely stated. The complete official vote of the Kastern States showi an increa-e of 861,000 in four veins, or about 11.7 per cent In ISSI) the population of these titates was 15,766,000, and the vote indicates an increase since that .Mar of above 1'! per cent in the entire section, BO that its population maj nowbeaboq/ 18,200, noe. Th" gain in the different States npp.at to have been rerj unequal. New-Jersey gains most. acc.riling to the voting, about 21 per cent; Massachusetts gained .'.'- percent; New fork gained al.t 20 per cut; Pennsylvania only il per cent; Connecticut 16 per cent, .-ind Maine and Vermont lost in votes. Pos sihly. on account of the character of the con t"-t, the disaffection of the Randall Demo? crats, and tin- certainty of tin- result in Penn? sylvania, the vo,e in that State was not as full as the other Kastern States, In that case its population maj have Increased somewhat more, and the population of the Eastern states ma.v he a little larger than th,' rote ind. ates. of the increase sinoe 188. only ah.,ut l-l.onn votes went to the Prohibition ticket in the Pastern Slates, which thor-- received iH,1*j. rotes this year. The Butler vote in 1884, which was mainly Democratic, has nearly all disappear, d. With that reinforcement of near? ly cu.ooo rotes Mr. Cleveland bas 192,000 nc,!" than he had in 1?S4. Hut notwithstand? ing a loss of some Prohibition votes tho I{e pubHeans have 215,000 more than thev had in I-?si. s.. that relatively the Republican gain in all the New-England States, New Voil.. New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, was ai.out hti.(iou votes. Had 'he new voters been equal? ly divided, this would Imply a transfer ?.f 15,000 votes from ..ne parly to the other. Hut part of the Republican gain may have been doe to a larger share of the. new voters. The number of rotes cast for every Con? gressional district in the Eastern States is 86,202, bm it is sm low because the suffrage has hitherto been limited in Rhode [stand, and Lovauso most of the New-England States an* gaining hut little in population. In Connecti? cut the ratio is 88,498 to a district: in Xow Vork, 28,987ria New-Jersey, 43..*i!i2. and in Pennsylvania, 26,615. When these figures aro contrasted with tht> 15,201 to a district in Louisiana, 16,642 in Mississippi, and 11,266 in Smith Carolin:!, it may he realised how many of the voters in some Southern States are de? prived of their rights. In the more rapidly growing Western States the number of Voters to a district is still larger. It is over 10,000 in Ohio, 11,204 in Indiana, 1.12of. in Michi? gan, aid about 4:-'.one m California, the re turns from that Btate hoing perhaps not com? plete. Is there any reason why one vote in Mississippi or South Carolina should have moro power than three rotes in New-York or N'cw Jersey, Indiana or Michigan '! A YALE t A WBBIDGB H li /.

DR. SULLIVANS REAPPEARANCE, Thc inst taint echoes or the nampalgn bars died away below tin- horizon. The country is again indlstttfbed hy the ominous tramp of the torch? light pWTfdt, and the sharp cry of tho stump , orator hus ceased to reverberate among mir hills. I Hi" aSSapaigB lies, With nails in them, have been serried away. And With ths calm theH comes m.metliing else at which all must bc pleased. It is this: Dr. J. L Sullivan has again placed his BOUth in commission. We are at peaes with foreign powersi there is no internal conflict to make us afraid, famine rests not on our fair land, and?not least?the talking apparatus of Boston's foremost citizen is again all that could be desired. John Ix Sullivan's voice conics back to him af a peculiarly appropriate season?with the asbering in of the Christmas time with its peaes on earth, good Will toward men. That has always been exactly the Doctor's idea?peace on earth, with half the irate receipts As the iee dBi may probably know, Dr. Sullivan has recently been very ill. Disease hud thc Doctor in chancery some time, but was Itself at, last knocked heavily against tho ropes. He lay Tor many weeks sick of a fever, and walked nigh unto the valley of the shadow of death; but la? tins recovered, and it has brought home t.< him a realization of the fact that the Bight cometh when no man can work, and he is accordingly put? ting In his whole time in lolling how badly he wants to fight. Ile thinks noticing of three or four challenges a day. After a week's hard work in telling what ho can do and what he is going to (h., he is apparently as fresh as when he entered the ring. His lunars and the muscles of his thront ure said to be in the very junk of condi? tion. Wo wish to commitulate him on the (Set timi Ids klekneoS has cr.st him none of his former iictiv itv "f mouth. The .nicer of Dr. Sullivan is one which should inter, ii the student of American biography. Horn of poor but honest pan nt-, he war. thrown npon the world at an early age with nothing but his own hands with which to carve out his fortune. Patting on a pair of four-ounce gloves, h.- began til-' task. The .rowiun. f< iltur" of his O-MOT v.as a icw jrean ugo, when he made an appoint? ment to mc I that other justly popular citizen, Mr. Paddy Wynn, with the raw 'una Ile kept his appointment* ami, owing to Judge Ryan's in? ferior agility in putting up his (hikes, the Doctor easily defeated hun. Then (lid his professional Mle, sli well known to us, fairly open up before him. Tuning his back on thc raw 'mis, he put. on ih.- pillows and started out on a tour for the llimsi.s. And tiie llinisies, its well us the hard 'mis mil the yellow boys, caine to him in (.Teat quantities. Attired in light but neatly Utting kn,.,- breeches mid a pair of heavy buckskin gloves, with curled-hair dressing, h.- nightly stood up before creat. crowds ol his fellow-countrymen and pounded leading citizens. These citizens were not usually professionals in thm great leveller, Ihe twenty-four-foot ring, but rather Local lights who stood up for the distinction of ssying that Dr. Sullivan had knocked them down. These were the Doctor's palmy days. His challenges were strewn about like th.- sands on the IBS ShOTO H.- announced that he was afraid to strike any mun BS hard SS he could from fear of killin'.,' hun. Ile wanted to light an elephant Au elephant, that is, a large elephant with a bad disposition, was something like it. If he couldn't have an elephant, he must insist on having at least a rhinoceros with its mouth open. And the more th..- Doctor talked, thc more llimsi.-s did he uko in al th" hoi otlico Last spring the Doctor mode a tour of Great Britain, which was extremely sueoeosful from a llimsi.al point, of view. He was, however, un? fortunately drawn int.. a controversy with Sir Jeni Smith. It is not likely tl.it Sir Jem was any more desirous of getting hurt or ol' hurting any body than was the Doctor. Sir Jen didn't want any trouble about this thiner. They were both men of peace. However, they were into it, and so they fought?judiciously and carefully, M that ticre might be ao disagreeable bloodshed or any? thing of that kind about it. Hut this is where the Doctor made his mistake?getting into tlc controversy with Sir Jem at all. people asked embarrassing questiona <>f emirs*!, sir Jem wasn't an elephant* but why could not the Doctor have lapped him B Light 'un? Why not have struck hun one easy 'dow- so that he would have searched blindly fur grass, and his attendants have tossed up th* sponge from their corner with a quick, de? cisive movementf Why not. at hast have held out his bunch of fives and let Jem run into them '?' This was the heartless way in which au unfeel? ing public, talked. Soon after he returned to his native Hoston, and lately he has had the mill with sickness to which we have referred Hut, as we said befojv, he appears to have fully recovered Hie use of his great feature?-tis mouth. That we shall have from him mach loud and entertaining conversa? tion as tim- mils on now seems t.. I... oertain. I lie Tribune welcomes hun again to the ring of theoretical and oratorical pugilism. Mr. Jacob Kilrain and Mr. Charles Mitchell, two other gen? tlemen deeply versed in pure, as opposed to ap? plied, prize-lighting, arc also with us, mid we ruay expect a lively s.-asi.n in long-range encounters P..it tin- Doctor will down these recruits Give John Lawrence Sullivan a tweuty-foiir-foot bar? room and a good shorthand man to take down what he mys, and he ena wind any man in America. _ It is trident that Befosm with a lug i. is needed in the ofllec of Journal <"lcrk of the House of Representatives. The Journal of tin- last kestton is rv[Kjrifd to be full of errors, and the reason thereto! i> that a min unfamiliar with the dillies of the ..Iii.?? was thrust into it for purely partisan reasona ihe Importanoe of havinu this official record absolutely complete and accurate is obvi? ous. This should cau.se sven hungry and thirsty Democrats txi retrain from dealing with such a post as il it, was legitimate spoils.
