McK IX LEY'S BOOM LAUNCHED Postal Spies at Work-Numerous Offi cial Are Beheaded for Talking Too Much - Postmaster 'Vandllng la Town-Other Topics. Tribune Bureau. No. 615 Fourteenth st., N. W., Washington, Dec. 9. Senator Cameron's letter to State Senator McCarren today declining to be a eunaidate for re-election canned quite a breeze among Republican politicians who are here attending the national committee meeting, as well as Con gressmen from Pennsylvania, and his colleagu-s In the senate. It has been known among Senator Cameron's friend for sometime that he would not be a candidate for re-election. In fact. Is was whispered among the knowing ones at the time he took such a bold stand against the repeal of the Sher man silver act during the extra session of the fifty-third congress over two years ago that he would not again be a candidate. Me .discovered then that his stand for silver finished him po litically, but he hoped that In time he would be able to convince the voters of Pennsylvania that they were wrong, and he was right. . . , Senator Cameron has at last seen the "handwriting on the wall." He has had his .ear on the ground and heard the rumblings In favor of sound money. During the past year. Senator Cam eron has been feeling the public pulse, and he has discovered that public senti ment was strongly against him all over the state. His old time friends have told his that It meant political suicide for them, as well as himself. If he entered the race again. His letter of declination today, while somewhat of a surprise to everybody here was not wholly unexpected by politicians who knew him best In an Interview this evening, Senator Campron said that the only ambition he ever had had been fulfilled. His only desire, he said, was to serve In the United States senate as long as his father did, twenty years, and when his present term expires on March 4, 1S97, he will have been a mem ber of the upper bruncn of congress Just that length of time. Senator Cam eron has no further political ambition. He will retire to private life. He will reside In Washington during the winter and will spend the summers on his farm at Donegal, Dauphin county. Sen ator Cameron is not a old man. He Is Just as old as Quay sixty-two years. The first political office Senator Cam eron ever held was recretary of war, under President Grant, from May 22, 1876, to March 3, 1877. He' was chair man of the Republican national com mittee mo, during the Garfield-Hancock campaign. Senator Cameron is reputed to be Very wealthy, having In herited most of It from his father, the late Simon Cameron, and made a good deal of money himself by fortunate in vestment. Mentioned as Snccessor. There Is much speculation as to who will succeed Cameron In the senate. There is no lack of timber to select from. The woods are full of It. Among the names mentioned by Republican politicians here today from various parts of the state. were ex-Postmaster General Wanamaker, District Attorney Graham, State . Senator . Penrose, Charles Emory Smith and Thomas Do Ian, all of Philadelphia; J. Hay Brown, of Lancaster; State Senator Walter Merrick, of Tioga; Congressman Jack Robinson and ex-Lieutenant Governor Watres and William Connell, of Scran ton. If Philadelphia cannot agree upon a candidate It Is more than likely that a man from the northeast section of the state will be selected. The western part of the state will not be sonsidered In the selection of a senator, A good many of the politicians here today are of the opinion that Philadelphia will get into a snarl over a candidate, and that a mmi from the country will be select ed as a compromise. Northeastern Pennsylvania has never hud a United States senator, and as It Is now but of Its swaddling clothes. It would seem that It has the right to demand recog nition at the hands of the Republican party. Mr. Vandling in Town. Postmaster 'Vandllng is here. He wants the department to establish two branch postofflces In Scranton Hyae Park and Providence. ' He also wants to get consent of the treasury depart ment to allow the state Superior court to hold sessions in the public building. Postsl Spies at Work. The postofflee department is evident ly determined to break up the habit of employes talking too much. Three of the oldest employes of the department have been removed for giving Informa tion concerning their respective bur reaua to members of congress, who wen? unable to gain the desired Information from higher officials. The discharged employes are charged with "Conspir ing to belittle the department." One of them has confessed to giving Infor mation to. members of congress. He says that A. W. Machem, superinten dent of the free delivery system, as sessed and collected an Involuntary contribution of $30 each from a number of clerks In his department and which was devoted to the late Democratic campaign in Ohio. For ' this he was dismissed. His colleagues were dis charged for the same offense. A con. irressional Investigation will likely fol low, and some rich and racy develop ments arc expected to result. Samuel Belght, one of the men discharged, says he has employed counsel and will in sist upon a usbllc investigation. He claims to have a letter which shows that certain postomoe omciais leviea and collected money for use In the Ohio fiamnalgn . Postmaster General Blssell Inaugur ated a "spy'aystem a year or more ago whifh resulted In the dismissal or sus- wnston of a large number of mall car riers who had committed such great crimes as taking a glass of beer or a glass of soda water while on duty when the thermometer ranged anywhere from to degrees to 100 degreei in tne snade. Such a violation of the de tartment rules wax nnoardonable. But nothing was said about the higher officials gusxllng all the beer, whiskey and wine they wanted or could pay for. Some of the best letter carriers in the service were either dismissed of suspended for the above named offence during Mr. Bis- sell's administration. . His exit from the pnstofttce department has not changed matters in this respect, his successor, the Hon. William L. Wilson,' it seems, Is more particular than the Buffalontan. He has Just lsued orders to tbe eueot that any postmaster or employe of tne postal department who, in any way, manner or form, whether on duty or on kiave of niv.nee;, who takes any active part in the passage of legislation relat ing to the service or the betterment of their Individual or collective conditions, will be dismissed Instantly. This r.rder is directly aimed at the letter curriers' assoclat'on, which has been working for several years to better the condition of its member?. It Is alleged that the "spy" system cost Uncle Sam $36,000 for the quarter ended September 30 last. Tha MeKinlov llntim - The launching of the McKlnley presi dential boom at the meeting of the Na tional Committee in tnis city is consul cred mighty poor polities. Whether or not Governor McKlnley authorizes his Ohio friends to come here and shout for him at this time Is not Known, but his presidential stock has undoubtedly fal len several points all the same. The na tional committee has little If anything to do with nominating a candidate, and if It had It Is doubtful If the committee, as It stands today, would favor the Ohloan's nomination for ' president. Governor McKlnley's friends see the mistake they have made, but 't Is too late. The mischief has been done. The friends of Reed, Allison and other can didates are chuckling In their sleeves over the awkward position In which the author of the McKlnley bill has -placed himself. Senator Hill has returned from his Ill-fated lecturing tour through the West. He doesn't like to discuss his late, trip. He attributes his failure to draw crowded houses to the hard times. Senator Hill, for the first time since his arrival in Washington, has taken a house for the winter. It is located on Lafayette square and was formerly oc cupied by Senator Dolph, whose Oregon constituents loved him so dearly that they voted to keep him at home with them. While Senator Hill Is a con firmed bachelor and Is said to hato women on general principles, rumor has it that he will shortly marry. I think he realizes the fact thut the American people do not want any more bachelor presidents, even if they do get married after they have served a por tion of their term. Senator Hill can see the White house by sticking his head out of a fiont window in his resi dence and looking south. t.iiptiilii Itusseti' Condition.

READY FOR THE STRUGGLE. Representatives of Various Cities Will Present Clalm-i to the National Repub lican Convention. Washington, Dec. 9. The three not able events connected with the meeting of the Republican national committee, which developed this morning, were these: 'First The decision of Messrs, Cart er and Manley to hear the claims of the rival cities this afternoon Instead of Wednesday, as had been agreed upon. . "Second The combination of the Pittsburg and San Francisco forces. ' "Third The withdrawal of Salt Lake as an aspirant for convention honors. The decision to pern'lt the several cities to present their claims today was reached at an early hour this morning, after a "conference of the members of the executive committee. A meeting of the executive commit tee was held this evening in Chair man Manly's room to discuss the ar rangements for tomorrow's meeting. The national committee will sit In open session to hear the claims of San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, Pitts burg, New York. At the conclusion of the speechmaklng, the committee will go Into executive session and select the convention city. Some time last night, after the Cali fornia delegation reached the city, they were visited at their headquarters by Senator Quay, of Pennsylvania. Sena-i tor Quay Is understood to have in formed his California friends that Pitts burg was very much In earnest, and that the metropolis of Western Penn sylvania was In the fight to win. He said, however, that he, personally, was well disposed to San Francisco, and that if he were satisfied his own state could not secure the convention he would use his Influence for San Fran cisco. In this effort he will be warmly seconded by Manley, of Maine; Mr. Fes senden, of Connecticut; and Mr. Clark son, of Iowa. , The delegation which will present the' claims of Pittsburg to the national com mittee arrived this morning. Numer ically it contains as many members as those from the other cities combined. Two of the number, Messrs. W. N. Randolph and M. J. Billows, are col ored attorneys, of recognised standing at the Allegheny bar. f,. In company with the other delega tlons the Pennsylvania opened head quarters at the Arlington, where they were speedily visited by Senator Quay and Representatives Dalsell and Stone. Congressman Dalsell, who la a very effective speaker, will place Pittsburg In nomination. His efforts will be sec. onded by his colleague, Congressman William A. Stone, of Allegheny, and by O.

SHOT FOR PAIXCEPOTE The Speaker Lashes tho British Ambassa dor with an Unsparing llsad-Tao . . First Bills Passed by Congress. New Senators Appear. Washington, Dec. . The senate wus addressed to-day by Mr. Morgan (Dem ocrat, Alabama), chairman of the com mittee on foreign relations, and former ly a member of the Bering sea Paris tribunal. In support of his resolution of fered on tbe third of December, referr ing to the committee on foreign rela tions the president's special message of February 13, 1895, and his recent an nual message, relating to the payment by the United States of the claims of Great Britain arising out of the Bering sea controversy, with Instructions to examine Into the question of liability on the part of the United States and of liability on the part of Great Britain or Canada. Senator Morgan's speech on the Ber ing Sea claims was in substance a con tention that tho award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration, of which he was a member, contained no provision mak ing the United States liable in the lump sum of $425,000 for damages sustained by English vesselB held up while fish ing In the disputed waters. If any agreement was made to settle with England on that basis it was, he de clared, unconstitutional, because not ratified by the senate; and for one, he did not propose to have either the pres ident of the United States or the British minister, Sir Julian Pauncefote, mis represent the American position on this matter. The senator paid his respects to Sir Julian In spirited style. Referring to a political circular In which the latter had contended that no aamission oi nu bility became necessary from the mo-' mnnt that the Paris tribunal, by its award, had rejected the legal preten sions of the United States to a special property In the fur seals resorting to the Prlllof Islands, and had said that that decision at once proclaimed the Illegality of the seizures and the lia bility of tho United States to satisfy the claims, adding that he ((Sir Julian) was "at a loss to conceive what other view could be taken without disput ing the Paris award," Senator Morgan said: ' "I am equally at a loss to conceive how the tribunal should refuse to consider the question of the liability of either govern ment to the other, being prohibited by the treaty from any such attempt, and how by such refusal they have man aged to decide the Question and' -give to fh.tr lndinnent the effect of an"estopcl bv matter of record. Being urged my me f these vessels was illegal, they express. oi mesa vunnciH was m-...tj . - )y , eon.wer the request, and yet tne prit,h ambassador permits himself to state the absurd conclusion as a fact I that 'that decision at once proclaimed the occu-tillegallty of the sclsures and the liability of the United States to satisfy the claims.' . 1 flan)ly . , f he BPb,traton! to consider the question of the liability of either government upon any claims as serted by the other? "If Sir Julian had remembered that there was no negotiation of the question of liability, or as to the rightfulness or Justice, or the Items of the claims or the amount of them, or whether they be- j longed to citizens of the United States, I he would have comprehended my objec tion, In part at least, to the diversion, or this question from the consideration of the senate, without which no negotiation can mature into tne eneci or law, lie would have seen, as he doubtless saw, very clearly that a conditional agree ment for a 'lump sum' of $425,000 In com promise of all claims was a convenient way to avoid a negotiation required by treaty, Instead of Its being a diplomatic negotiation, which the senate must ratify by a vote of two-tnlrd or a quorum be fore it Is an engagement that binds tho United States. The senate Is an ensentlal part of 'tho constitutional authorities of the- United States.' without whose consent, as Sir Jullnn perfectly understands, no execu tory agreement with a foreign power can be valid under our constitution. The sen- nate has constitutional powers to examine- and revise negotiations with foreign governments, which are a part of the per manent foundations or tne government or the United States, Tho arrangement for a 'lump sum,' provided congress would consent to vote It, and for a negotiation for a Joint Commission, If congress should refuse, was not a diplomatic agreement concluded or negotiated through the con stitutional authorities of the United States' compatible with the dignity of either government and Its Injurious ef fects are obvious In the irascible ani censorious criticisms of our people and their representatives in congress, wltn which the intrusive circular os tne untisn ambassador abounds. The failure to drive congress Into making a 'lump sum' appro priation as a compromise of these claims, which were neither proven nor discussed, so far as congress was Informed, is made the pretext of the statement or tne Brit ish ambassador that congress has refused in meet 'tha national obligations of the United States.' He makes an analysis of ha vnto In the house of representatives on the rejection of the 'lump sum,- ana in forms Earl Klmberley that It was 'Repub licans. Populists, and forty-eight Demo- .rnta and uoon that basis he says In his dispatch of Feb. 28. 1895, that, 'Strong par ty feeling would seem alone to account for the rejection of so just and desirable an arrangement, and, as your lordship will h.. nniril from the Inclosure In my dis patch, statements have been mode In con gress which are entirely misleading.' "It Is getting to be a familiar method .n-.innifnt' of our national polfcy when it Is disappointing to British de mands and Interests, however unsatis factory they may be to our country, to attribute our action to the influence of party politics. Iir-thls Instance Sir Julian Pauncefote does not hesitate to Impute to the action of the house of representatives. In an unjust and offensive manner, this motive of party antagonism as the Tea- . . a 1 1 .. V. I 'Limn iim1 an. son ior tne miiwiu - i.,.im.nt of the claims of his government. Not satisfied with this form of accusa tion. Blr Julian arraigns sonktors and .k.i nt the house of representatives In debate, and charges them with Ignor ance and misstatements or iiw ana iun, and Imputes to them discreditable motives. "I have no fault to find with the British amhauador for any opinion ne may en. .in nf mv conduct as a senator, or .as an arbitrator, nor do I ctnsure him for freely expressing those opinions to his own .m.ninuot, That Is his privilege, and he has the rightful choice of the language best suited to his tastes la making such communications; only that he Is still re sponsible at the bar of publlo opinion for his motives and for the verity of his. .i.imiuiu and the fairness of his deduc- iloasIut tte BritUs eapsasadgr aa M right to question a member of congress for words spoken in debate, by printing, under cover of a privileged communica tion to his own government, a diatribe of criticism and Invective upon his utter ances in congress, and then pursue the ex traordinary method of handing out those diplomatic papers to the American preys for publication and comment, thus fore stalling a reply with an unjust statement. "I do not know whether this paper, which was handed out to the press of Washington by the ambassador, has been sent In to our state department by the British government. If It has. It Is prob able that It will bs laid before congress with some note of approval or disapproval by the president. I do not know, or sup pose, that tbe president wllK Join Great Britain In these severe comments upon the opinions of members of congress ex pressed In debate, although they voted against his recommendation of this Mump sum' appropriation. His criticisms. If he has any to mitke, will come from a source that is responsible to the country along with the senate for our treaty relations, and along with congress for our legisla tion. - It will have none of the Intrusive arrogance that has Induced the British ambassador to attempt to Influence our legislation by harsh denunciation of our votes and arguments, and by taking an appeal to our people against the attitude of their representatives In pongress, and supporting it by flattering alluulans to their superior sense of airness and jus tice. His manifest aversion to negotia tion and his persistent purpose to escapo It will lead the American people, to whom he appeals, to a very careful and sincere Inquiry into the motive that causes the concealment of the real merits of these claims from scrutiny, by grouping them into an indistinguishable mass, and cov ering them with a 'lump sum' appropria tion. "If the plea of a technical estoppel by the award of the tribunal cannot avail Great Britain to close tha doors to the truth and to exclude Justice, equity, good morals, and friendly dealing from all con sideration in the 'further negotiations,' It will be found that her claim to damages cannot be sustained unless there Is a prin ciple of International law or morals that prohibits a nation from preventing a wrong to Its territory, its revenues. Its property, and the support and peace of Its people, even If It Is committed with force and violence within a few yards of Its boundaries. I have found' no such declaration In the laws of nations, nor any such precedent In the usuages of na tions. "If the award Is entitled to the benefit of the rules of construction that obtain in respect of all agreements, decisions. Judg ments, treaties, and transactions that dis pose of the rights anil impose duties on men and nations that It should be con sidered In all Its parts, as an entire decree the Alleged liability of the United States ior tnese seliures, if it Is covered by the principles of the award, must be de cided airalnst Great Britain. That is my contention, and for this reason, and others I ask that the senate will cause the facts to be investigated and laid before con gress. We have been asked to vot x, lump sum of

She had been confined to bed for five years, a victim of nervous prostration ami her case was given up by the attendlng physlcdans who said that she would never regain the use of her lower limbs. Six months ago Rev. J. H. Von Neldn, puBtor of Salenrt United Brethren church, of which Miss Shroff Is a mem ber, had Dr. John Alexander Dowle. the divine healer of Chicago, interested In her behalf and to-day between the hours of 9 and 9:30 a. in. was fixed as the time of deliverance. Dr. Dowle In structed Rev. . Von Nelda to pray for Miss Shroff at this time while he would do the same at his home, the Invalid to do likewise. As the time drew nigh when she was to be relieved, she offered a fervent prayer while Rev. Von Nelda was similarly engaged at his home, ' At several minutes'before 9:30 o'clock Mrs. Shroff went to her daughter's bed side and commanded her to rise.. This the daughter did and when she discov ered thajt her faith had made her whole her joy, was great and she. lifted her voice in prayer and thanksgiving for her restoration.!

Their tes timony was In regard to the scurrilous anonymous letters which constitute a marked feature of the case: They told In what manner they were received by Llbbte Knapp, the victim of the poison ing, and how others were received by Mrs. Howell after the girl died. In ad-' illtion a lot of letters, perhaps forty In all, were read to the jury. They 'were all In the same style as has been before Indicated, indeed too vile even to be read aloud in the court room. One of the letters read was revolved by Mrs. Howell about ten days after Miss Knapp died. It had been pinned to the front door of the Howell house and was found by Mr. Waters when ho call-'d.

If I was, I would not try to help you. Ha, Ha. By G If a man comes and asks If you done all this, say 'Yes,' and they will say you are crazy and let It . Now, the men from Wellsboro said that If you owned urf, you did all'thls they would drop It. So you see I tell you this as the best way for you to get out of it without any more trouble." Before this letter was received by Mrs. Howell, the disappointed lover, Rlghtmire, had been suspected of the crime and an information had been made against him before a Justice, but he had not been arrested. His evidence shows that counsel advised him to keep still and lot the matter drop. After that no more letters were received by Mrs. Howell.

President Cleveland's Message Canses a Commotion in tho Reichstag Charges Hcvold of Foundation. Berlin, Dec. 9. In the Reichstag to day the minister of foreign affairs In reply to remarks concerning the tariff situation between Germany and the t'nlted States, said that the American congress had some time since adopted a differential duty upori sugur. tier many had protested against this and Mr. Cleveland did loyally all that he had the power to do In the matter, but congress refused to modify its preylous action. Germany, lie declared, main tains that the differential duty adopted by the American congress Is a violation of the existing treaty. President Cleve land's message charging.Oermany with applying differential treatment to cer tain American exports was a great sur prise. He then proceeded to Bhow that the charges made by the president were devoid of foundation. The presence of Texas fever In cuttle proved that pro hibition of the Importation of the Amer ican meats into Germany was neces sary, but the same measures were In existence against other states than America. ' Concerning the cancellation of the li censes of American Insurance compan ies he said that certain American insur ance c6mpanles doing business In Prus sia had had their licenses revoked be cause they would not conform to the laws which were the same for German companies and foreign companies. If the American companies Would under take to conform .to the laws nothing could prevent them from reopening their business. This matter, he said, was purely a German concern, over which he could not admit the criticism of a foreign government. Germany, he declared, would loyally continue to ad here to her treaties, not allowing her self to be frightened by threats.
