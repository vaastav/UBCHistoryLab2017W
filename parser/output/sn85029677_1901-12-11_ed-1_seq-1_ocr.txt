Native, He Says, Are Amiffo and Foe .Alike In the Self-Same Hour Mili tary Condition, la the Islands Snmmed t'p. Washington, Dec. 7. The war de partment yesterday made public the Jirst annual report of Maj. Gen. Chaf fee, military governor of the Philip pine islands. Gen. Chaffee sums up the situation in the Philippines from a military point of view bv stating that the provinces of Batangas and Laguna, in Luzon, and the islands of Samar, Mindoro, Cebu and Bohol constitute the area now disturbed by any embodied force of insurgents. He says that to the physical charac ter of the countrj', to the nature of the warfare of the rebels, Who are amigo and foe in the self same hour, to the humanity of the troops, which is taken advantage of by the rebels and the inhabitants who sympathize with them, and to the fear of assas sination on the part of the friendly disposed if they give information to the American forcss, is due the pro longation of the guerrilla warfare. Gen. Chaffee recommends that there be no further material reduc tion of troops bffore Januar3 1903. On the subject of the military gov ernment of the city of Manila, Gen. Chaffee says: "In the government of Manila for three years, if the mil itary have done nothing more, it is everywhere apparent that an excel lent foundation has been laid and a turbulent and hostile community brought to observe the laws and in dividually be orderly; this has been done without undue harshness or se verity of treatment of the inhab itants." In anticipation of a partial concen tration of the troops in the Philip pines next year Gen. Chaffee submits estimates of cost for the construc tion of quarters and barracks. Gen. Chaffee devotes a good part of his report to the terrible disas ter which befell company C, Ninth iu fantrj', at Balangiga, Samar, and which, he says, was "largely due to over confidence in assumed pacified conditions and in a people, who, to a great extent as yet, are strangers to and unappreciative of our humane and personal libertj' beliefs and ac tions." American soldiers, he says, fail to discriminate between real and assumed friendship on the part of the Filipinos. PUSHING CANAL TREATY.

Senator Hoar (Mass.) said the difficulty was that assassins of kings and rulers always gloried in their crimes and were in no wise deterred by the fear of punish ment.
