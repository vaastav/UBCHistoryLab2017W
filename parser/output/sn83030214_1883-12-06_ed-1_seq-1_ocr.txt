DEMOCRATS AND THL MESSAGE. THU PU! TBA OK KAtiiOM DKXO0XI i. ir AB BVA SIVK. (BT TT.UKOK-1-ll TO TUP. TBIRL'NB.) Washington, Dec. 5.?The comments of the I)einoe,ratic Representatives on tho President's sage uv lav ors bio M un lu voluble, according as the men who utter them belong to one or the other of tha factions. For it is already plain that the majority in the House is divided into two hostile camps?the larger being composed of the free trailers and " tari(T n-foriii'Ts," who range them? selves under the banner of Speaker Carlisle, and the lesser number of men wini sympathize with Ibo views of Messrs. Kandall, Eaton and Curtin. The former are deeply vexed because the President did not recommend further tariff legislation. Colonel Morrison, who is a prominent leader of tho Carlisle faction, said: "The financial portions of tbe message are evasive, and stamp it a mean spirited, partisan document. For party reasons, the President dared not say what he believes?that the tariff ought to be reduced?and so he shuffled, for the sake of his party, in order to annoy us." In thus accusing tho President of bad faith, Colonel Morrison fairly reflects tho opinions and expresses the sentiments of thc Southern and Western Demo? crats generally ; for nearly all of them bilong to the Carlisle wing of tho majority. On the other hand, nearly all the Pennsylvania and New-.Iersev Democrats and ethers, who agree with them that American industries should lie pro t. .-ti il, praise those portions of tin- -Meengo which are most lierccly denounced by their fellow-Dem? ocrats. Thev say, too, that had a man like Mr Randall or "ur. Eaton been elected Sneaker, it would have baan practicable to reform t l.e tai ill in some in c.-sshry particulan without a general disturb? ance of tue business interests of th>* country, whereas it will now be impossible to do anything. Hut the views of these men are treated with a* scant consideration by the dominant fa- ion of the ma? jority as if they were held and expressed by Re? publicans. ?
