The president is, figuratively speak ing, standing on his left ear again from the effect of a speech made by Diitrict Attorney Benton of Missouri. Arizona's bullion output during 18S6 is the smallest for the past five years. Her beef output is the greatest and the agricultcral outlook has never been better. The governors of New Hampshire and Texas studiously refrained from acknowl edging a Supreme Being in their Thank giving proclamations. The ministers of New Hampshire boycotted the Gover nor's proclamation, and read that of the President. General Mahonc declares that "when every vote in Virginia can be honestly counted, the state will show a republican majority of 40,000." There can be no doubt about the exact truth of this assur ance. The south is kept solid by "fraud and violence. A London cablegram says a European war is now definitely looked for. Com mencement of hostiliiies is expected in February next at latest, if the weather at that rime -hould permit of military operations on the enormous scale nec essary to carry out the plan of campaign supposed to have been decided on While the number of chemical ele ments bad not reached seventy a de cade ago, Prof. H. C Bolton has pre pared a list naming over forty elemen tary substances whose discovery has been announced since 1877. No less than nine of the supposed new elements have been detected this year by Crookes. John Doane, of Wagon Wheel, Idaho, died recr.tly, and his mother, a widow, and his two unmarried sisters ect to town to attend the funeral, and remain ed to look after his property. They were the only unmarried women in the town, and before the flowers had wither ed on John's grave the widow had been married to the sheriffot the town, the elder sister to the sheriff and the young er to a prominent citizen. The three weddings were held at the same time, and all of the town attended. The new two-cent pastage stamp which is to be in circulation about the first of January is to be one of the handscraest designs ever issued by the postonice de partment. Upon a blue-tinted back ground will rest an enbossed head of Georse Washington. For a permanent and popular design the face of the illus trious George has never been surpassed. The kindly features of Lydia Tinkham bare many devoted admirers, buf'thc benignant countenance of our nation's father is, as he was himself, "first in the hearts of his country." Ex. Most dream representations, accord ing to the investigations of Wundt, emanate from actual, though weak, im pression on the nerves during sleep. Thus, an inconveniint position excites visions cf laborious or painful experi ences, difficult respiration produces the agony ot nightmare, flying is suggested by the rymthmic movements of breath ing, nudity by a fall of clothes from the bed, crawling things by skin irritations, etc The reproduction of past memo ries is associitcd with events vhich have left a profound mental impression. Ex. With the completion of the railroad to Prescott, an organized effort should ba made on the patt of our citizens to secure the diversion of at least a por tion of the California bound eastern winter visitors. I: is estimated that not less than 40,000 eastern people will visit California to spend the winter. While the frnperature of Prcscctt is not SO mild as portions of Calilornii, it is, if anything, more healthful and is not as severe the rig-jr jus climate of the un" in aliunde of ;6oo feet, the air is pure and dry.tht reentry car.net be surpassed and it is in every respect a de sirable place for t;ie health or pleasure seeker. Notwithstanain the fact that the government has about $25. or tI,e purchase of cavalry horses in this terri tory and is anxious to give preference for their purchase here, the board ap pointed to inspect and purchase horses finds it difficult to secure them. They vere in session two or three days at Whipple and only succeeded in pur chasing two horses From here they went to Flagstaff, in this county, and met with better success, having pur chased eleven horses. The failure to purchase, certainly does not arise from the tact that the horses arc not in the countryt as we have assurances tha1 there are plenty of horses which will stand the test of an army Iward. But hore raisers do not seem to take in terest enough to bring such" horses in as will raett the requirement of the cav alry service. Aw-or.a U a horse and rattle rai.ing cour.try and if the govern ment can s jeeeed 1:1 finding a supply of horses here for service in tW ' South west, it will in future look to it, and horse raisers can always depend on finding a good market 211 the army. From the exn;iitr.ce, however, of offi cers it loDks as if the government will give up m despair and look elsewhere for cavehy horses. THE 

MESSAGE. The president's message is to hand and is very volumnious. In his reference to our foreign affairs he speaks very sym pathetically of the "cruel treatment of Chinese" in thiscouutry, "in some of the far western states and territeries," at tributing it to "race prejudice." Mr. Cleveland evidently does not under stand the Chinese problem, else he would not make such an assertion. " "Race prejudice" is a very small factor of the evils he complains of, the whole question being one of cheap serf labor. Coniiderable prominence is given to the Cutting case and in the language of the San Francisco Chronicle, "Mr.Cleve land'reiterates the blunders of Mr. Bay ard's diplomatic papers by failing to dis tinguish between the mere act of publi cation of a libel and its circulation after it is printed. It was not for its publica tion in Texas that Mr. Cutting was prosecuted, but for its circulation in Mexico, and it was on the strength of this fact that the government of Diaz caused Secretary Bayard to back down and swallow his own declarations." It will be of special interest to the citi zens in the remote and sparsely settled sections of the western states and terri tories whese mail, service has been ma terially cut down and in some instances abandoned entirely by the democratic adrainistration,.to learn from the mes sage that "at the close of the last fiscal year the expense of transportation on star routes stood to an annual rate of cost less by over $560,000 than at the close of the previous year." Half a million dollars saving, in expense, to a great government like the United States, will strike the intelligent miner and prospector or resident of a mining camp, who has left family and friends in the east, while he assists in developing the re sources of the frontier country and who is deprived of all except periodical com munication with them, on the score of democratic economy, as being some thing very small to boast of. It will also be gratifying to the above class to learn that while the government has saved $560,000 by cuitailing their pos tal facilities the residents ot the more populous centers, have had their mall facilities "correspondingly increased by the expansion of the carrier delivery conveniences and addition to the rail road mail facilities." Another feature cf his message which will be appreciated as greatly as the above on the postal question, in the sil ver producing section of the great west,is the renewal of his recomuendation of last year against the continued coinage of silver. In this connection we are happy to note, that our contemporary, while swallowing and endorsing last yecr this recommendation, without a protest ol criticism, it very evasively this year admits that "most of its friends do not agree with him." While "most of his f riends do not agree with him," how ever, there is nothing to indicate how it stands on the question itself. While practicing largely the time honored tcntts of the democratic party, that "to the victors belong the spoils," and making removals en partisan grounds solely, he has the following to say in regard to civil service reform: "The civil service reform may be im perfect in some of its details; it may be misunderstood and opposed; it may not always be faithfully applied; charges may sometimes miscarry through mistakes; it may sometimes tremble under the af saults cf its enemifs or languish under the misguided zeal or impracticable friends; but if the people of this country ever submit to the banishment of its underlying principles from the operation of their govern ment, they will abandon the surest guar anty of the safety and success of Ameri can institutions. I invokeforthis reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of .this congress. I renew my recommen dations made last year that commission ers be made equal to the other officers of the government, having like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable appropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the use fulness of the cause they have charge- af." A Model Proclamation. Of all the Thanksgiving proclamations issued by the executives of the different ststes and territories, and copies of which have been received at the state dcpaitment at Washington, that of Chief Bushyhead, cf the Cherokee Indian Na tion, is considered the most unique and original. It reads as follows: "Executive Department, Cherokee Nation, I. T. To the Cherokee People: Let us again publicly confess and commemorate the good of the Great Spirit, by devoting one day in this year to thanksgiving in unison. It is a good custom, and should impress upon our minds a truth that every one ought to realize more and more and more, as the days and hours succeed each other in our shoit lives. That truth is, that everjthing we have comes from God; and that everything is good and will be profitable to us, even as we regard and treat it, for the due observance of our duty to our common Father, and our brothers. Therefore, I, W. D. Bushyhead, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, do now appoint Thursday, the 25th day of November, 18S6, as a day of thanksgiving and praise throughout this nation, and recommend to all Chero kees to "keep" the said anniversary soberly, gladly, lovingly, as befits a reas onable and Christian people ss to do. Should there be poor or unfortunate in any neighborhood forget and neglect them not. Our system of society and government will not allow of excessive and individual wealth, nor of its sure attendant excessive poverty for which kt us pive special thanks, and hold fist to that which is good. But what is called accident or misfortune will ever present oppoitunitie to the generous and vigilant ia well doing to do acts of benevolence. May the next Thanksgiving day find us, as a nation, and as individuals, mure virtuous, prosperous and happy for having kept this one. In witness whereof, I have hereunto sit my hand and afced the seal ot the Cherokee Nation, on the 1 atb day of November, A. D. 1&S6. 

SEAL D. W. BUSMYHKD Later and Industrial Maws. There were 1,500 strikes in New Votk last year. An effort is to be made to establish labor bureau in Georgia. A union of all the printing intctetU tn New York it probable. The police- estimate that there is ao 000 professional criminals in that cky. A co-operative underwear establish ment is to be suited in Rich -nan d. The Trenton Knights of Labor have declared war against the Star rubber company. The Minneapolis Knights will soon have a new hall which will be a credit ta the order. The Solidarity Watch Case company, with fifty-one members, ii a successful cc-operative concern. The Chicago co-operative packing and provision company, will shortly trt into business with a capital of $100,000. The Faustus club of Brooklyn prin ters contemplate erecting .a fine club house somewhere near the center of the city. The Girls' local assembly, 7,707, are about establishing a co-operative cloth ing manufactuung company in New York. Sauthera planters are combining in an effort to crush out the attempt of the tfniht of Labor to organise field hands. The Knights of Labor of St. Louis are boycotting all the brewery establish ments because of the formatien af a brewers' ring. Up to November 1st 3,704 new build ings were erectwi in New York at a cost of $43,000,000, an increase of $13,000, 000 over the same time last year. Typographical Union, No. 6, has 1.500 members; Pressman's union, No. 9, hts 900; the Franklin association has 400, the stereotypers, 350; the book binders, 3,675; the phcto-engravers, Dhtrict assembly, No. 14, cf Chicago, composed of 125 local assemblies, with an aggregate membership of a 5,000, have passed a stt of resolutions to use all honorable means to prevent the exe cution of the sentence against the an archists. The 18,000 car drivers in New Yurk and Brooklyn gained a strike at a cost of $100,000, which has added $2,000,000 to their annual pay roll, and which has lessened the hours of labor twenty-three hours per week, besides creating em ployment for 3,000 men. News Notes and Commenta. Kansas stands st the head in the miles of wilroad built this year, and Dakota is close second . A member ot the Georgia legislature hts introduced a bill providing that no person will charge a profit of over 15 per cent on the cost price of the neces saries of lite. The signal service officers in Minne sota aod Dakota report that the weather during November averaged colder than that of any preceding November for twenty-two years. Richard Gunther, who was elected to congress in General Braggs' district in Wiscomtn, is a native of Germany. Fifteen years ago be landed at Castle Garden with $24 in his pocket. In Georgia, where the prohibition law is in force, twenty new distilleries went stilted last year. If the folks down ihcre have really quit drinking whisky it is because they are too busy making it. It if said that Washington will soon furnish a divorce scandal suit that will equal that of the "luds and juks" of old England. A prominent member of the administration i disagreeably connected with the affrir. Ruled by the South. As a rule the democrats adhere strict ly to precedent in promotion 10 place in congres. If thi rule is adhered to by Speaker Carlisle, and under the circum stances it is to be expected that he will do so, the next session of congress "will see the south in the saddle" to an even greater extent than it was before the war. It is the general custom of congress whenever a chairman of a committee dies or leaves congress to promote the members of the committee af the same party who has served next longest in time. Following out this custom the chairmanship of the thirty-five leading committees will fall as follows. Seyen to Georgia, five to Alabama, five to Mis souri, three to Texas, three to Arkansas, two to Illinois, two to Pennsylvania, two to South Carolina and one each to Louis iona, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Vir ginia. The chairman of committees practi cally have the shaping of all legislation. At the next session of congress Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Texas and Arkan sas have the majority of the committees. New York has no chairman at all; neith er has New Jersey nor any of the great northwestern states. Truly, it looks as if the country would again be ruled by the south. Phiadelphia News. C. S. Hutchinson, of the corner drag store, received a lot of new goods to-day. A 

PLAIN BUSINESS TALK. A prominent merchant of Prescott, on being informed a few days since, by a gentleman, who is in a position to know that for the last few months several hun dred dollars per day had been sent from Prescott for dry goods to California and the eastern states, cemplained of the injustice of the government sending goods 3,000 miles as cheap as they did three. He also spoke of the import ance of patronizing home merchants as the proper thing to build np a town. We fully and heartily agree with the sentiment expressed, but at the same time would call the attention of this same merchant to the tact that he is getting his printing done b the east and that the government sends it through the mail for him st just the same price that is charged for sending it a shorter distance. Prescott has two daily and one weekly paper and three well-ap-painted joe offices. These offices dis tribute annually in Prescott not less than $20,000 to $25,000, a large part of which is rcciivcd from subscribers and from other sources abroad. The money is all spent and put in circulation here, and yet there are business men who send abroad for all their printing, who save probably front $ao to $15 per year the operation. The Joubkal-Mikks, and we believe the other papers do as well, purchas all its supplies in Prescott that can I procured here. It believes in patroniz ing heme imt-tationi and should mer chants and all others do the same thing our tewn would be mare prosperous. With railroad communication and cheaper transportation our merchants should be able to sell goods, so that this enormous sum would not be sent off evrrv month. The newspapers, which j . are working for the prosperity of t town and country, should be patronized and enrourazed. It all our citizens would units in patronizing home institu tions entirely the community would be ore prosperous snd the small pittance saved bv sending- abroad for arti.-les would be more than returned to each individual during the year. Chrlatmaa In Sang and Story. Christmas stories, merry jingles, and bright holiday articles vie with each other in the December Brooklyn Mag azine, which takes on a special and ha nd some Christmas cover for this it-sue. One scarcely knows what bright piece of song or story to read first, so varied and full is the table of contents offered Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford opens the feast with a spirited and delightful de scription of "Christmas in New England" during the time of the Puritans and now. Following this comes one of those exquisite bits of verse to which Miss Edith M. Thomas's talents are eo well adapted, entitled "Northern Heart in Southern Clime." A most interesting article is contributed by William Perry Browne descriptive of "A Christmas in the Tennessee mountains." A new writer, Edward Irving, tells a powerful and short story, "Which Was It!" Dr. Talmage has a brief and characteristic article on "Christmas Belli," and Flor ence L. Snow and Sophie L. Schcnck have each a Christmas story. Beesie Chandler, Lee C. Harby, George Birds- eye Thomas S. Collier add each a Christ mas poem, while Mr. William H. Ride- ing closes his series of gossipy papers on "The Boyal Navy of Great Britain." Flora Adams Carting continues her ab sorbing novelette of "A Social Diplo mat," and Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher goes into a retrospective mood in "After Thoughts of My Visit Abroad." Then coma articles on "Neatness in Dress at Home," "Christmas Charity," "Seven Ways of Marrying," "The Closing of the Year," and in addition to all there is given eight sermons by Mr. Beecher and Dr. Talmage as specially revised by themaelves for this publication. Our readers would do well to bear the Brook lyn in mind when making up their mag- asine list for the new year, especially as it costs only $2 per year. No. 7 Murray street, New York. A Postal System Failure. The special letter delivery system in augurated by the present federal admin istration has proved a grand failure. It first went into effect in October, 1885, in all cities having a population of 4,000 or more. The experiment for the first year demonstrated its failure as limited to this class of cities. In October, 18S6, it wss extended to all pottcffices. Since going into effect, now nearly three months ago in Prescott there has been six such letters received' at the postoffice here representing a revenue to the gov ernment abovo tho regular two-cent postage required the princely sum of fogty-eight cents. One of these letters was addressed to a gentleman here only temporary, and the requirements of the system calling for its immediate delivery Postmaster Marsh stowed it away care fully in bis pocket and started out in search of tha gcatleman. He traveled the streets for three or four hours in a vain search after his man, who in the meantime had called at tho postoffice three or four times, being informed on the first visit he made of the arrival of the letter. Mr. Marsh, however, finally found him and delivered the missive to him. Had tho letter been sent aa an ordinary letter it would have reached him within half an hour or less, whereas as it was it took three or four hours. The law provides for letters of this kind being delivered within one mile of the postoffice and allows eight cents for the delivery. To hire a messenger here to deliver one at the limit of a mile would cost not less than twenty-five cents and probably fifty cents. In cities where mail ia dslivered by carriers there eanbe but little saving of time in the delivery of such letters so that, taking it all in all, the system is a failure. Against tho Railroad. The jury in the suit of H. A. Tweed against tha Southern Pacific railroad company returned a verdict last evening in favor of the plaintiff for the-aum of $600. The suit was brought to recover damages ia the sum of $5,000, and the causa of actio was about as follows: ' Sometime since Mr. Tweed was at Mar icopa, en routs to his home in Tomb stone. A washout had occurred and the regular passenger train was delayed thereby. Mr Tweed had secured a first class ticket, and having Important business in Cochise waa desirous ol traveling on a 1 pec Lai train, consisting of engine" and 'caboose which was to leave Maricopa for Tucson. The agent at Maricopa telegraphed to Tucson for necessary permits, and the reply as given by the Maricopa agent was that the plaintiff in the suit could not ride. This, it is claimed, was a mistake in tel egraphing. Howbeit, Mr. Tweed was under the necessity of 'securing a team and buggy and traveling to Tucson. The expense thus incurred was in tha neighborhood of $100, and besides this Mr. Tweed took a cold which resulted in a severe illness. Gazette Fire Alarma. A false alarm of fire was sounded at 2 :30 this afternoon by the consent af the chief of the fire department for the purtttse of getting the department out. The supposed scene of the fire was in the vicinity of the Arizona brewery. The fire boys responded promptly, the Dude securing the first stream. After extinguishing the imaginary fire the hose wasreeled andthe companies depart ed for their headquarters, before reaching which, however, an alarm -was sounded tor a fire which had broken out in the assav office of F. A. Tritle, Jr., and which threatened so be serious, on account of the lnfhramable nature ef the building and those adjacent Another vktary was scored by the Dudes by Retting the first stream oa the flames which were quickly subdued, but not nnut the entire office was a wreck. 

FIRST ACC1DKXT. In rtrMRjndinn to the first alarm, J. If. Kt?tuv, in assisting the Tough hose cump-iny, met with an accident try which he sustained the fracture of M left nrm. Tha Mineral Bolt Road. Col. J. W. Eddy, of the Mineral Belt railroad company, with Chief Engineer Jackson and a force of eight assistant engineers, arrived on the train last even ing from the east. General A. A. Mc Donald, vice president of the road, was already in town. Work will be at once commenced to build the railroad from this point. Scrapers and materials for grading are now on the road and as soon' as the im plements are on the ground a force of men will be put to work .to grade the line. After long delays the construction of this important enterprise will ba prac tically commenced. It is bow a sure thing and Flagstaff will be boomiag. Champion. Mining I tame. Bigelow & Park, W. A. Bowed: Bra, and Dan Hatz have shipped abou twenty tons of ore recently from mines in the vicinity of Slate creek and the head of the Haseayampa. The Lynx creek hydraulic mines will be placed in first class order for working as soon as a supply of water can be ob tained. W. A. Bowe and brother are busy taking out ore from tho Davis mine. Next year promises to be one of the most prosperous for mining in the his tory of this county. More interest tlian usual is being tak en in assessment work this year. Own era of claims prize them more highly and are not willing to take any risk" of having them "jumped." Another rich find in Lynx is reported. The parties locating the claim, which was done- several months ago, have said but litto about it, but have taken out a lot of rich ore. Placer miners nave washed and brought to town large quantities of gold since the storm.
