THE NEWS-HERALD, HILLSBOkO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER i3, 1066. r t, t, IKE A CRAZY QUILT SAYS JUDGE GROSSCUP OF ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE. JAP QUESTION HOT FOR PRESIDENT Chicago Jurist Asserts Legislature Alone Should Act Attacks Sim plified Spelling. niUtlmorc, Dec. li. JiulRe Peter Stonier Qiyirscup, of Chlcnu, Is spend lug a fow (lus in llnltlmuie, ns the guest of John M. ItlnnUenshlp, super intendent of llio .Meichnnts' and Min ers' Transportation Co. When nsUotl for his opinion of the iiicsriikc of 1'rus Ident Hoosevelt to congtess, Judge Orostcup tepllcd. "It's like n crazy quilt. It covers nlmoql every pos-tlblo subject, nnd many of thrni me hardly important enough for n president's massage. It Fecms to me," continued the Judge, ultli a laugh, "that the question of pioUilliig sclioolliuv gallcrios for school chlldien nilt?lit snfely have been left to the school diiertors. "The trouble with the mossugo Is that It is out of proportion. Uttle things are placet! side by side with big ones, and all are treated from a preaching attitude. Tho president himself has no sense of proportion. 'lie thinks everything under tho sun that Interests him Is Important enough to be put In a message to congress. Tiidei stand me, I nm not raying anything which conveys the kast feeling against him. Ills great power with the people Is held by his lntcnso sincerity." After reading what President Uooso vclt had to say on the Jnpaneso ques tion, Judge Orosscup said: "That Is a question for tho legis lature. The national gorcrnmont has no right to make a treaty that will in terfere with the regulation oC schools by a state." Judge Orosscup's nttontlon was call ed to tho claim of the Japanese that under the treaty with tho United States their citizens arc entitled to the same treatment as those of the "most favored nation," and that tho public school prlvllego therefore should be theirs. He then paid: "So far as tho treaty Is concerned, It Is the old question of a contract mode with an ngont. The agents' powers should be closoly understood. In this case the United States govern ment Is only the agent, and In the treaty or contract thore should have been a clause Inserted preventing con flict with state laws over which the government has no power. "Just what Hip president means when he says ho will uso nil tho forces of the United States, military and civil, which he may lawfully employ In tho matter affecting the' Japanese, I do not know. "It Is the old trouble with Roosevelt: lie tecommeuds a thing In a general way, but does uot make clear tho de tails. ' Has he used simple spelling In tho message? It Is a monstrosity. Those of us who were educated In old and fiirt English do not care for the new way or arranging letters. I see the fiuprcmo court has 'lefusod briefs spelled In that way. Their action speaks for the bench."

TORTURED THE RARALYTIC GIRL AND THE THWARTED ROBBERS BURNED HER TO DEATH. Evidence of a Fiendish Crime Is Re vealed In the Ashes of an Iso lated Farm House. Zanesvlllc', O., Dec. 7. A helpless oung woman was ciematod In hor own home, two miles from New Con ruril, and thore are evidences that sho was the victim of one of tho most atrocious crimes ever committed In Muskingum county. Tho decedent Is Miss Sarah Wiley, U10 invalid daughter of a widowed mo ther, Mrs. Mary Wlloy, who with hor son Jf.hn manages a large farm nenr New Corcord, the mother and the two children living thoic alone. The farm Is Isolated to a certain ex tent tho nearest neighbor living almost i mile away, and thoio aro no houses n sight of tlio Wiley home. .Mrs. Wile) has always been consld ed well-to-do. nd It has been the opin ion o l'o iir,v"'orliood that hor homo contained considerable wealth In the lorm of valuable papers nnd money. Mis. Wiley and hor son drove several mllos away from their homo on a bust ii'sm mission, leaving Miss Wiley alone .it home She wn a helpless paralt c, unable to move nuout In the rooms. 1 .if left her sitting In an Invalid's i-halr. Returning home late Mrs. Wiley nnd liur son weie horrified to 11 ml tho ;ruatcr ixirtlon of the houso reduced to nshvs. In the ctebrls they found 1 he charred remains of Sarah Wiley. Tho Interior of tho room In which sho was left was wholly destroyed, but ho position In which the charred body was found Indicates that she had been brutnlly tortured and ma liciously burned to death by some un known person. The theory Is that robbers entered the homo after discovering tho ah seuco of the mother and son and loot ed all the rooms in search of valuables. It Is furthor believed that they sought by all manners of cruol means to compel tho invalid girl to disclose the hiding place of tho aupposod vnl uablos and money and that upon her refusal or Inability to satisfy thorn tho llcndB sot fire to tho bod and ottior Inflummablo articles in tho room. Tlie family's coal oil can was'found Just outside tho door, empty, and It is surmised that tho contents of this can were used to start tho blaze. Tho girl's body was found sovcral feet from tho Invalid chair. ltIs not known whethor tho burglars secured any valuables. Mrs. Wlloy Is uncom municative on this subject; besides, the hoube having been burned, sho Is In doubt as to what may have been consumed In the llamcb. None of the neighbors learned of tho tragedy until John Wiley aroused them from their sleep and I0..1 ti.c jvhnt had occurrol. Tho community U greatly oxIctoJ over tho tragedy. Thorn Is no clew whatover to the prob able robbors Tho empty oil can Is thus far tho single bit of positive ovl deuce. Another Respite For Mrs. Myers. Jefferson City, Mo., Dec. 7. Gov.
