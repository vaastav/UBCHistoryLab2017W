Advices have been received that the new crome steel cages for the t Colfax jail were shipped from Canton, Ohio, on the 1st. The governor gives us another surprise this week. He has ap- t pointed Mr. R. M. Horn, magistrate i of ward seven, and Mr. W. H. Latham, constable of the same E ward. t Thousands of lives are saved an- e nually by tlhe use of Ayer's Cherry Pectoral In the treatment of croup and whooping cough, the ( Pectoral has a most marvelous ef- t fect. It allays inflamation, frees the obstructed air passages, and controls the desire to cough. t Rev. H. M. Hutson, former po- E lice juror of ward three, passed I through Colfax on Wednesday last, on his way to Garrison, Nacado ches county, Texas. Besides his own family, he was accompanied by his son, E. L. Hutson and fami- a ly, G. T. Arrington and family, Jas. M. Arrington and family, and G. S. McCarthy, and family. They j go overland in five wagons, and ex pect to make the trip in 10 or 12 t days. For pity's sake, don't growl and grumble because you are troubled with indigestion. No good was ev er effected by snarling and fretting. Be a man (unless you happen to be a woman), and take Ayer's Sarsa parilla, which will relieve you, whether man or woman. The reports received from the sub-committee on Agriculture, t which is investigating the low i price of cotton, are to the effect that the committee has already con cluded its investigation in the cot ton-growing districts. The com- t mittee spent some time in New Or- f leans looking into the subject. The I investigation has been very thor- t ough into the cause of depression, J and the testimony of many per- c sons who are in possession of the a facts bearing upon the question and of those who hold opinions, has been taken by the committee. There is some complaint of over- a production and the lack of diversi- t ty of crops in the South, but the r general belief seems to be that the scarcity of money is the one great t reason for the existing depression. a The Adaptability of Women. Man is a creature of cast-iron f methods. Woman adapts herself a to circumstances. A man refuses t to drive a nail unless he has a ham mer. A worran does not hesitate e to use a poker, or the heel of her f shoe, or the back of a brush. Man t thinks it absolutely necessary to '1 have a corkscrew to draw a cork. d Woman will gouge it out with her a scissors, or a knife, or button hook. I; If it won't come out it will go down, c and, after all, the contents of the o bottle are what is wanted. A man b regards a razor as consecrated to i one calling. A woman has a high- r er opinion of its versatility and uses it to sharpen pencils. This office surreptitiously performed leads her husband to say malignant a things about razors and their mak- 0 ers.. When a man writes he de- a mands pomp and circumstance, and t as wide an orbit as one of theta planets. Pen, ink and paper must a be "just so," and he shuts up the whole family in a tower of silence 0 and nobody is allowed to think hard. When a woman write she gathers up manuscript paper, stray copybook leaves, backs of old en velopes, sharpens her pencils with s her scissors and, placing her ma- I terial on an old atlas, tucks one 1 foot under her, rocks comfortably J back pnd forth, bites her pencil periodically and produces litera- I ture. She is oblivious to Tommie b distractedly adding and substract ing in a higher key; Mollie best- : ing French verbs into her brain by a Fuccession of audible thumps I and much vibrant buzzing; to S al lie running the scales; to the cook who demAnds supplies every few P moments. She makes her lovers ( woo and quarrel and msrry and the c villians kill each other in the most ii circumrncribud Fpn ce.--N. Y.World. a The President's Message. z Washington Dec. 4-President Cleveland's message was presented t to Congress upon its assembling a to-day. A synopsis of its princi- n pal topics is herewith submitted: q He refers briefly to the reports s of the various heads of departments submitted and calls particular at tention to those reports as furnish- c ing worthy matter for legislation. e While our foreign relations, he v says have not at all times during a the past year been entirely free o from perplexity, no embarrassing t situation remains that will not f yield to the spirit of fairness and t, love of justice which, joined with d consistent firmness, characterize t truly American foreign policy. s Ife characterizes the act of Ad- f, miral Stanton, in saluting Mellos o at Rio, as a "gratuitous sanction t to the local insurrection." For- t eign ministers are instructed not to o harbor offenders. The necessity of the deportation t of Chinese may be avoided through a compliance with all the require- n ments of the law. a He recommends the adoption of I1 an act prohibiting the sale of fire c arms and liquor to Africans by our s citizens. Our relations with the French Republic continue to be intimate and cordial. I sincerely hope that 9 the extradition treaty with that country as amended by the Senate, e will soon be operative. While oc casional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with Germany, e our relations with that conntry continue satisfactory. r The questions affecting our rela tions with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness a Negotiations are in progress be- e tween the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations r agreed upon by the Behring Sea t tribunal of arbitration practically 8 effective: and it is not doubted that Great Britian will co-operate p freely with this country for accom plishment of that purpose. Our relations with Mexico con tinue to be of that close and friend ly nature which should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics. e Nicaragua has recently passed , through two revolutions, the party: a at first successful having in turn 9 been displaced by another. Our newly-appointed minister, by his t, timely good offices, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the contro versy involved in the first conflict. The large American interests es tablished in that country in con nection with the Nicarrgua canal a were not molested. The canal company has become financially and seriously embaras sed, but treatment has been ex tended to it by the government of 1 Nicaragua. The United States are especially interested in the success ful achievment of the vast under taking this company has in" charge. P That it should be accomplished un- o der distinctively American auspices y and its enjoyment assured not on- I ly the vessels of. this country as a a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but the ships of the world in the 1 interest of civilization, is a pro- k position which, in my judgment, a does not admit of question. 5 More than fifteen years ago this $ government preferred a claim n against Spain in behalf of one of n our citizens for property seized ti and confiscated in Cuba. In 1886 tl the claim was adjusted. Spain li agreeing to pay unconditionally as sl a fair indemnity, $1,500,000,. Ae respectful but earnest note was re cently addressed to the Spanish h government insisting upon prompt I fulfillment of its long-neglected 1 obligation. 5 It is hardly necessary for me to a state that the questions arisin. t from our relations with Hawaii n have caused serious embarrassment. tl Just prior to the installation of the w present administrationr. the exist- a Ing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a 1 treaty of annexation had been nego- b tisted between the provisional gor- el ernment of the islands and the o United States, and sent to the Sen- 5 ate for ratification. This treaty h withdrew for examinatisn, and dis- J patched .Hon. James A. Blonnt, of 'I Georgia, to Honolulu, as a special a commissioner to make an impartial o investigation of the circumstances i1 attending the change of govern- $ ment, and of all the conditions bear- I ing upon the subject of treaty. Af- I ter a thorough and exhaustive ex- e amination Mr. Blount submitted to V me his report, showing beyond all I question that the 'constitutional i government of Hawaii had been s subverted with the active aid of l our representative to that govern ment and through the intimidation t caused by the presence of an arm- i ed naval force of the United States, t which was landed for that purpose C at the instance of our minister. Up on the facts developed it seemed f to me the only honorable course c for our government to pursue was c to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us, and I to restore, as far as practicable, the t status existing at the time of our t forcible intervention. With a view t of accomplishing this result within a the constitutional limits of execu- a tive power, and recognizing all our t obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed condi- f tions brought about by our unjusti- 1 fiable interference, our present t minister at Honolulu has received i appropriate instructions to that end. a Thus far no information of the ac- t complishment of any definite re- a suilts has been received from him. c Additional advices are expected. t When received, they will be I promptly sent to the Congress, to gether with all other information t on hand, accompanied by a special t executive message fully detailing t all the facts necessary to a com plete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the ma terial events leading up to the pres ent situation. The Secretary of the Treasury a reports that the receipts of the gov ernment from all sources during a the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, Y amounted to $461,716,561 54; its expenditures to $459,374,674 29. 1, There was collected from customs a $205,355,016 73 and from internal t revenue $161,027,623 93. Our du- t tiable imports amounted to $421, 856,711, an increase of $52,423,907 ( over the preceeding year, and im- k portations free of duty amounted t to $444,544,211, a decrease from the preeeeding year of $13,455,447. . Internal revenue receipts exceeded f those of the preceding year by $7, 137,445 32. The total tax collected on distill a ed spirits was $94,720,260 55; on n manufacturrd tobacco $31,889,711, and on fermented liquors $32,548,- t 983,07. We exported merchandise during t the year amounting to 8847,665,194, n a decrease of $182,612,954, from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year 2 in the history of the government, amounting to $108,680,844, and ex ceeding the amount exported dur ing the preceeding year by $58,485, 517. The sum paid from the treas ury for sugar bounty was $9,375, 130,88 an increase over the pre- - ceeding year of $2,032,053,09. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the re ceipts of the government for the p year ending June 30, 1894, will be A $430,121,365,38, and its expendi tures $458,121,365,38, resulting in t a deficiency of $28,000,000. On the first day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or not includ ed in treasury holdings, was $1,178, 544,682, an increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our pop ulation at 67,846i,000 .at the time a mentioned, the per capita circula- e tion was $25 49. On the same date " there was in the t.asury gold bul- t lion amounting to $96,527,273, and p silver bullion, which was purchas ed at a cost of $126,261,553J The purchase of silver under the a law of July 14, 1800, during the last fiscal year, aggregated 54,008,-.e 162,59 fine ounces, which cost $45, 531,374,53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time - that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the first day of November, 1893, was 168,674,590,46 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940,84. Between the first day of March, t 1878, and the first day of Novem ber, 1893, the goverment purchas ed under all laws, 503,003,717 fine F ounces of silver at a cost of $516,- i 522,948. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of 7 Jaly, 14, 1890, number 36,087,285. a The seignorage arising from such coinage was 86,977,098,$0, leaving on hand in the mints, 140,699,760 fine ounces of silver, which cost [ $126,758,218. Our total coinage of all metul;, during the last fiscal year consist ed- of 97,280,875 pieces valued at $43,685,178,80 of which there wa $30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,344,715 in silver dollars, $7,7,2,220,90 in subsidiary silver coin and $1,086, 102,90 in minor coins. During the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1,596,375 fine ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage value of $33,000,000 and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or marked value of $50,750,000 and of the coinage value of $74,989,900. Recent monetary legislation, im migration, the military, navy and the pension laws, the condition of the Indians, puphel larid falling in to private hands, civil service, were all treated in an exhaustive manner, and here is what he said on the tariff. After a hard struggle tariff re form is directly before us. Noth ing so important claims our atten tion and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty-an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the peo ple. After full discussion our coun trymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemn ly pledged to it. In conclusion he urges the adop tion of the report of the committee on ways and means. The Millsaps College Muddle. Editor Colfax CArafeks: In reply to the article from the boys of Milleaps college, of Jaekso r Mise.. in your issue of last week, allegia that I spoke falsely when I told you that the drunkenaMes and rowdying in that col lege was intolerable, Iwould like to state my poition in the astair, and at the same time insist that my report is true, while their denial is largely untrue, beside be mg unfair and unmanly. I had no idea of my statements being printed in the Cnaoxwonau by you, or I should never have been guilty of "telling tales out of school." But as I was so indiscreet as to tell you the truth of the matter, as to why I left the ch`eg' I will not quietly submit to the boys branding me with a falsehood simply to protect the standing of the college or shield their mates in wrong doing. I will cll no names, but, while I am only one against the whole student body, I will say that drunken nees and rowdyism has existed in the college, in spite of the denlal'made by the committee, and I believe that two of the members out of the committe of six who are so liberal in branding me as a falsifier must have known that whisky has been brought upon the grounds al most every day or night.
