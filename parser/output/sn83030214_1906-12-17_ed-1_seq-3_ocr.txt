Bjrwaters, a well known citizen of this county, and known over the country as a fox hunter and breeder of hounds and horses, was shot last night by James and Philip Strother«. who live at Rotherwood, three miles from this place Bywaters had married Miss Viola BtrothCTO, a daughter of the late Colonel John R. Strothera and a sister of the brother! who killed him. After the weddinjy Mr. By water « attempted to leave his bride and the Strothers home, and one of her brothers objected. Bywaters later climbed to the roof and endeavored to escape. He was seen by James and Philip Strothers, who opened fire on him with pistols. He died almost instantly WHY MAT SOS RESIGNED. Inventor Tells of Alleged Slight to U. S. by La Provence's Captain. Harry Matron, formerly .'.-<' steward on the French liner I^a Provence, who resigned because he considered the French Line bad committed an af front to the United States, arrived here yesterday on the steamer I«i Touralne. Mr. Matson said that Captain Alii of La Pro vence had been relieved of the command of hi« ship and thnt Captain Poirrot had taken his place. It was laid that Captain Alls was removed because he had offered an affront to Captain Ira Harris supervising steamboat Inspector of this port. 111 refusing to permit a teat of the alatson life raft from La Provence. The t»*st had been prepared especially for Captain Harris and representatives of the navy and the Department of Commerce and Labor. Paul _ .-a! rppro.=<>nt;itiv<» of the French Line, said last night that Captain Aiix bad not been relieved ■ ommand of La Provence, hni ■ -••- months' leave on a> Mr. Matsoa showed copies of several letters writ ten to Mr. Fag;;- 1 ! by Captain Harris relating to the incident of Captain Alix's refusal to permit the test. When told of the contents of the letters Mr. Faguet said he had no knowledge of receiving such correspondence, and declined to talk further of the controversy. Mr. Matson. who resigned his position soon after Captain Alix"s refusal, said yesterday that the officials of th» French Line had given their con pent for the test and that Invitations had been sent out to representatives of the navy and the Department of Commerce and Labor. According; to the letters of Captain Harris to Paul Faquet, as shown by Mr. Ifatson yesterday. Captain Harris informed Mr. Faguet that, while he had examined the life raft and Its dtsenpaKlns device from the. deck of a steamer, it was neces sary for the supervising board of Inspectors to Fee the raft in th» water to approve o* it Charles W. Morse had ordered two rafts from Havre to lie placed on th» Metropolitan Line, to Boston, and the Inspection had to be made before he could use them. After summing up the situation in his letter to Mr Farjuet. <*ar'taiii Harris, according to the letters yesterday shown by Mr. Matson. Bald: "This Is a plain statement of facts. Bur one In ference can bo drawn. The captain of I^a Provence has affronted th» United States Steamboat In spectors and the United States navy. Whether you have any authority over him or not I don't know. If not. of course., we can consider him responsible. If you nave such authority, it seems to me that you should have ordered him to pre pare th« test. If an American captain announced that he could rot ?■• his lifesavlnc equipment ready for use Inside of twenty-four hours, the con dition of his ship and his personal efficiency would be investigated. I believe the test could have been made at any time, but that the captain pre ferred to furnish "his gratuitous insult to the United States authorities rather than allow an Inspection which would be of benefit to the chief steward of his vessel. "Speaking only for myself I shall never volun tarily visit a ship commanded by the present cap tain of I*i Provence.*' SAY

Pasquale Capozza. an Italian, nineteen years old. of No 79 Bpettcer street, Brooklyn, was he'd in $2,000 ball yesterday in the Lee avenue police court on two charges of felonious assault.

Mrs. Crawford alleges that while she was passing along Park avenue Capozza accosted her and made an Insulting remark. She took no notice, but later, she says, he again spoke to her and tried to embrace her. Mrs«. Crawford had an umbrella, and she turned on the man and be gan to thrash him. Capossa, she says, pulled a revolver, and. befor* she could run. fired thre« shots, the first passing close to her face and the third striking a glass ball of one of her hat pins. She reamed, and Credidio ran to her assis tance, whereupon the Italian, after firing a shot at htm, began to pommel him with the butt end of the revolver.

The provision in the bill looking to the carrying into effect of the Pure Food law Is re garded by both the Senate and the House as really urgent, and it is not only expectea last the Senate will pass the bill, but that it will dispose of it early enough in the week to return it to the House In time to permit that body to take action before the adjournment or.

It Is possible that the provision in the Deficiency bill to meet the ex penses of the Intervention of. this country In t*uba will provoke some debate, but otherwise the bill is expected to pass aft^r brief consideration.
