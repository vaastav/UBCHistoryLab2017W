Then Applied the Torch Force p Firemen Away. Louisville, Ky., Dec. 3.—A special from Princeton, Ky., says: The to-1 baccp stemmeries of John Steger and I the John G. Orr, the latter controlled by ^ut the Imperial Tobacco company of New York, were destroyed by a fire, kindled in by a mob of masked men. The loss I is estimated at $170,000. The mob, which numbered about 3001 men, entered Princeton be'tween one and two o'cIock, seized the night mar-1 shall and disarmed him. They then I went to the factory and quickly ap-1 plied the torch. Hie masked men stood on guard, | permitting nobody to come near while the buildings were enveloped in flames I and help was useless. A squad of the mob took charge of the telephone of- A floe and no word of the affair was per mitted to go out, When the mob saw that the Are was I at beyond control they left the town, go lng In the direction of Hopkinsville, I discharging revolvers and rifles as they departed. When the fire depart ment arrived it could do nothing more is than prevent the Are from destroying!a buildings in the vicinity. The Steger in stemmery was located on the south | side of town on the Illinois Central | railroad and the Orr building in the northern part of town. | The Steger factory is controlled by the American Snuff company and Mr. Steger is the Princeton agent for that | concern. Mr. Orr is the agent of the Imperial company. There were about 160,000 pounds of tobacco in each warehouse and all of it was burned. The mob, in addition to disarming the night policeman, took charge of the station and the waterworks. Even had the fire company responded they could not have obtained water. | „ .... , , , ,, . , I The work of the mob Is believed to* be only a furtherance of the agita tion by the tobacco raisers aga nst the^ tobacco trust. Th e organization of farmer is known as the Dark To-1 bacco Grower?' Protective Association, but it is not known that any memberL^^ was in last night's mob. It is not improbable that Governor 1 Beckham will be Rsked to call out the militia to protect property in those dis trlcts in view of past outrages. C. F. Snyder, secretary of the state I board of fire underwriters, says the I insurance companies will not *> e | responsible for the loss of the plants under the clause exempting them in cases of riot and Invasion. The pro tective association was formed throughout the dark tobacco district and severest measures were taken against growers who refused to join It. Marauders visited their farms at night and cut down their tobacco plants with hoes, set fire to their barns and committed other depreda tions. The ill feeling began about six years ago" whenTheTta~Uan government | sent agents into the dark tobacco field. These agents paid such high prices for the tobacco that other agents were driven out of the field. Crown Prince In Name Only.

The director of the mint says that Nevada will show for 1906 a much larger gain in both gold and silver, and that'the state will likely make a contest for first place as a producer of the various previous metal. The to tal output of silver is about 1,500,000 ounces under that of the previous year, the three heaviest producers, Montana, Colorado and Utah, showing a decline. Washington produced $370, 000 gold and 119,400 ounces of silver. Idaho produced $1,075,600 gold and 8, 126,600 ounces of sliver. Oregon's gold output was $1,244,000 and Montana pro duced $4,889,300 gold and 5,863,600 ounces silver. The total number of ounces of gold produced was 4,265,742, and the com mercial value of the silver produced was $34,221,976. The director of the mint has also completed a compilation -of returns upon the production of gold and silver In the world for the calendar year 1905. The totals are $376,289,200 gold and 157,339,362 ounces of silver.

The average value of silver In New York, based on London prices, converted at the current rates of ex change, was 61 cents per fine ounce, which may be compared with 58 cents U. which may be compared with 58 cents for 1904, 57 cents for 1903 and cents for 1902, the lowest year's price on record. The United States produced $88,180, 700 geld and 56,101,600 ounces sliver. Mexico produced $15,261,200 gold and 54,652,892 ounces silver. Canada produced $14,486,800 and $5,974,875 ounces silver.

SUMMARY OF 1REJES5AGE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IN THE FAVOR OF JAPS. to on on the desks of all who olosely follow ed the reading. President Roosevelt, in his message delivered to oongress, urges: Passages of a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to cam paign expenses of any party. Law conferring upon the government the right of appeal in oriminal oases on questions of law. This measure is designed to prevent government prose oution of trusts and other violators of federal statutes being blocked by unfa vorable rulings in inferior Joourts on technicalities. A law to prevent setting aside judge ments of inferior courts on immaterial technicalities is also recommended. A bill limiting number of nours of labor of railway employee. The presi dent enters a general plea for the intro duction of the eight hour day in branohee of labor. He excepts the Panama oanal work on the ground that existing conditions are most unfavora ble. ' Federal investigation of the ohild and woman labor problem. Also dras tio law for territory under federal jur isdiction. More complete employers' liability law placing "trade risks''for injuries sustained by embploye on employer. Institution of federal commission to investigate and arbitrate disputes be tween labor and capital. Withdrawal of remaining govern ment ooal lands from sale on entry ex oept under especial circumstances. Lands to let to private individuals un der royally system, with government retaining suffloient control to prevent excessive prioes to consumers or unfair freight rates in transportation of pro duct Graduated income and graduated in teritanoe tax on the theory that the man of great wealth ewes a peculiar obligation to the state because Jhe de rive special advantages from the mere existence of the government. An aot specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become Amerioan oitizens Recommends amendments to permit president to enforce rights of aliens nnder treaties. Aotion shutting Japanese out of San Franoisoo schools denounces as wicked absurdity. Concerning the prevailing trouble over J apanese in schools of San Fran cisco the president says he will do all in his power on behalf of the Japanese, and all the forces of the United States military and oivil, whioh he may law fully use, will be so employed. His re marks are highly laudatory of the Jap to out ter on 000 in the of of of In regard to the application of the injunction process to labor tAubles the preident urges that abuse of the power be provided against by some snoh law of a old the the of be provided against by some snoh law as he advocated last year. Pn6bibition of the use of injunctions altogether is not favored. Hasty aotion of judges in granting ill advised restraining or ders is criticised. The president takes his nsnal strong stand against lynching, devoting con siderable time to discussion of the race question in the South. He advoeates oapital punishment by legal process for the orimeof rape. The path marked ont by oongress last year is recommended as the best plan for dealing with the differences between oapital and labor. Preachers of discontent on thé laborers' side and wealthy violators bf the law are placed in the same oafegqry and the snppres sion of both are.urged by all regular means. The"operation of the inter state commerce law is cited as réfuta tion of the claim that it would ruin the railroads on the one hand and that it did not go far enough on the other. Greatly increased earnings have been shqwn by the roads in the five months law baa been effective, and the same period has produced an unpreoe dented number of reductions in freight tariffs shd fares. Two days before the law ttnnt into effeet on Aug. 27 the commission received notices of over 6,000 separat tariffs, eaoh representing a reduction. Federal oontrol of the roads is urged as the beet possible anti dotes for the agitation toward govern ment ownership aod socialistic princi ples. The president holds that the govern ment should not oonduot the business of the nation, but that it shuold exer oise suoh supervision as will insure its being oonduoted in the interest! of the nation. This rule is .made applicable to both organized oapital and organized labor. Hearty oonounenoe ls given the Grand Army proposition to erect an amphitheater for the observance of Memorial day at the National oemetery at Arlington, near Washington oity. In regard to the marriage and divorce question the president believes that problem should be relegated to the au thority of the national oongress in or der to secure uniformity of divorce laws and also because it would oonfer on oongress the power to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy. I Encouragement to Amerioan ship ping is urged along t e lines laid down in the report submitted to the last con gress. The president does not press any par to of Al ticular plan for currency reform, but argues its necessity and ealls attention to the scheme proposed by the secretary of the treasury and endorsed by bank j era and business men for scouring elas ' tioity of currency in crop moving times andjother periods when greater volumes of money are needed than ordinarily. Lower tariff or absolute free trade is recommended for the Philippines. American oitizenship should be oon ferrtd on the inhabitants of Porto Rico. Attention is asked for Alaska's i and favorable mention made of Alaska-Yukon-Paoiflo exposition to held at Seattle. The recent revolution in Cuba and ' action of this oountry is rehearsed and j the eoming eleotion in the island se | as the mark for ending the provisions to of government unless it is shown that the Cubans are Btill nuable to carry on their governmen unaided. The president promises a full report later on his visit to Panama. The need for amending the laws gov erning sealing in the north is pointed out in a recital of the ruthless slaugh- • ter of seals that has reduoed the herd on Pribolof island from nearly 5,000, 000 to less than 200 000. The incident in which five Japanese poachers were killed last summer is mentioned and the government will establish still more adquate patrol next season. Under the head of peace and right eousness the president makes a strong plea for honorable peaoe.bnt holds that war is justifiable and imperative when peace oan be obtained only by sacrifice of conscientious oonviotion or of na tional welfare,. Along these lines the maintenance of the navy at its present standard is urged and additional trained men re quested for coast defense departments of the army.
