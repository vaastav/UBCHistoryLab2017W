Accordfng to the Berlin report, the& Russtans suffered severe losses add are In retreat. The success of the Gemarns is con sidered by miltary experts a really re markable achievement. Less than a forthight ago the army to which'this victory has fallen was surrounded by Russians and cut its way out only at the last moment, losing great numbers of men and many guns. Yet it has beeln able within a few days to reor ganize, take the offensive and defeat the Russians defendihg Lodz. Mobilty Counts. This was made possible by the net work of strategic railways on the Ger man side of the frontier, over which reinforcemenits can be sent where they are most needed. The Russians, on the other hand, vigorously attacked on both wings, were unable to send fresh men to stiffen their center to meet the German wedge and were compelled to fall back. There will be undoubtedly much more fighting before the campaign in this- district is concluded. Lodz was won only after hand-to-hand fighting in the suburbs of the city and the whole Russian line from north to south is now straightened out and will contest every foot of ground with the invaders. Allies Active Again. In' the meantime, taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Germans in the east, the allied French, Bel gian and British forces have begun an odfftdslve inovelnent in'the West. They are now virtually in possession of the left thank of the Yser canal and in northern France, particularly in the neighborhood. of La Basse, where the Germans hold a very strong position, COLORADO MILITIA. BOSSED BY "BRUTE' MACHINE-GUN MURDERER AT LUDLOW SCORED BY PROF. BREWSTER, WHO RELATES OUT RAGES PERPETRATED ON MINERS Denver, Colo., Dec. 7.-That consti tutional guarantees were wiped out, by Adjutant General Chase, as head a of the Colorado militia; miners were c 'robbed by the militia; that that body a was recruited with "scoundrels" and c that the right of search had been exer- t cised by the militia while the civil courts were open was the trend of tie a testimnony of Prof. James H. Brewster of the University of Colorado, attor- 1. ney for the United Mine Workers, tes tifying before the federal commission on indlistrial relations today. Profes sor Brewster had been chairman of t the state federation of labor commit- 1 tee thht investigated the strike in De cember, 1912. "A Brute" c He declared that Lieutenant K. E. (Monty) Linderfelt, in charge of the machine gun at the Ludlow battle, was a "brute unfit to associate with .anybody," and that because of his brutality, the committee had asked that he be suspended. "Had he been suspended then," lhe declared, "Ludlow would never have happened." He asserted Linderfelt had trained the gun' on the Lydlow colony during a search of the colony by the militia for weapons, and patting the gun, de clared he could sweep the whole col ony. Adjut&nt 'General John Chase, he said, "thinks he is a soldier, and I thinks that way because he cannot help it. He honestly thinks he is a soldier." Chase had enlarged the military dis trict under the Moyer decision, which he declared, was a blot on the juris prudence of Colorado, until it includ ed the *hole state. Louis Tikas, leader of the Greeks, Iwho was killed in the Ludlow fight, ,Brewster declared, was a factor for lpeace id the Ludlow colony. He was a graduate of the University of Ath ens. He related the verdict of the court mhrtial at which Linderfelt was exonerated for the killing of Tikas. "I am not attempting to justify the events that followed Ludlow," he said, "but if those G..eeks had been Ameri cans, they would have risen long be fore."

He declared merchants of Huerfano and Las Animas counties had been intimidated by the "company," with loss of financial and social position. Those Mexican Juries A glance of an attorney's eye was sufficient to "fix" a Mexican jury that tried accident cases, he declared, and he related the case of a mine guard deputy sheriff tried by a jury of seven or eight brother deputies in Huerfano county and exonerated, for breaking a miner's jaw. This Was in the "King dom of Jeff Farr," he said. The witness said he had seen a youth whose head had been cut open by Linderfelt because one of Linder felt's men had driven his horse against a barbed wire fence in cross ing the open prairie and at that time Linderfelt believed some one had stretched barbed wire across the road 'with malicious intent.
