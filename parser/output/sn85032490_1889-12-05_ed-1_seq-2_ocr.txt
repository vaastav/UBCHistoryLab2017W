Councilman Jack son, of the Coweescowee district, has in troduced a bill in the lower branch of the legislature providing for three delegates to negotiate with the Cherokee comission ers. The clause which relates to a consti tutional prohibition of a sale was left out. The bill provides that the Cherokee dele gates shall report to the council before con cluding any agreement, aud that the whole matter shall be left to a vote of the Cherokee people. The bill passed both houses of the legis lature today and almoat immediately re ceived the signature of Chief Mayes, who named V. P. Boudinot, R. M. Walker and ex-Chief Bushyhead as members of the :ommittee. The senate refused to con- 5rm the tht appointment of Bnudiuot and Walker and Chief Mayes then named W. A. Dunkin and Ridge Pascal in their places. It is believed the senate will con firm their appointment at tomorrow's ses sion. The bill providing for the committee places no restriction upon the committee beyond the instructing them to obtain as much as possible for the land. It provides also that the decision reached by them shall not be binding upon the Cherokee government until it shall have been rati fied by a vote of the people at an election jailed for that puipose. The legislative action is regarded as very favorable by the United States commission. This morninc a joint resolution, intro duced by Jackson, passed the council against L. E.Bennett's confirmation by the United States Semite, as agent of the five civilized tribes. The resolution ob jects to Bennett's annual report, which lays the Cherokees have systemically rob bed the Shawnees. The resolution inti mates that Bennett was connected with the late Creek steal of Oklahoma. NO TROOPS TO BE USED. St, Loins, Mo., Nov. 1. A special from Washington says in regard to the Guthrie railway troubles: It seems that there is a good deal of fric tion at Guthrie, in Oklahoma, between a railroad company known as the Choctaw Coal & Railroad company aud the citizens of that town. Ihe railroad company claims that it has a right-of-way through thecenterof the town, and threats have been made that United States troops would be used to dispossess the settlers. Mr" Mansur, of rissouri, in behalf of the settlers, presented n petition to Secretary Noble today from citizens of Guthrie against the ue of troops to aid the rail road company. Mr. Mansur called the secretary's attention to the fact that the right-of-way of the railroad wn. ap proved February IS, 1&S; that Oklahoma was proclaimed open by the presi dent in April. 1S59, under which the town site was laid out. That ou July 1., lfcS'J, the managers of the railroad company tiled with the interior department their selection for the right of way, and it was approved. Stcretary Noble felt iudiunant when the matters, were called to his attention, anil insinuated that a fraud was practised on him, as there was no montion of a town being located ou the right, of way. Mr. Noble took the papers with notes of Mr. Mausur's statement, and promised to lay them before the president. He intimated -i onj,l Tl .it troops would not be used to ponS"s.s xhf suters. It s-esuis that Monger CL.idwK.iv, ot the raia -ad coni i my, had .si iti d recently at Guthrie that he had asMir mew, that troops would be used to dispossess the settler if they did not voluntarily retire from the railroad coinpauy's right of way.

FARMERS AND LABORERS. St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 4. The larmers' aud Laborers' union., resumed its session this morning, but in the absence of reports from standing or special committees the most of the time was taken up in speech making. President Macuno of the South ern Farmers' alliance, made his annual address. This alliance is now consolidated with the union. Committees were nu poiuted on tare and bagging, on constitu tion and on president's message. The joint committee of the union and the northern alliance appointed vesterday after a long conference last nitrht failed to agree upon a plau of constitution and this morning a new committee of live was ap pointed to tackle the matter. Mr. Ralph Beaumont, chairman of the national delegation committeo of the Knights of Labor at Wash ington aud one ot the commit tee to confer with a eomui.ttee from the Farmers and Laborers union said this afternoon: '"We have no intea- ( tiou oi endeavoring to cttect a consolida tion with the Farmers and Laborers uuion. As 1 understand it, the northern and southern Farmers' alliances, the Farmers' Mutual Benefit association and the Agricultural Wheel have consolidated and we are to confer with them with a view to furthering the interests of both organizations in the way of co-operating, not consolidation. Wo "shall acreo that when the farmers put a candidate in the field for either a legislative, senatorial or presidential nositiou wo will support that candidate and they will do the same for us." 

KANSAS AND NEBRASKA 'RATE QUES TION. Chicago, 111.. Dec. 4. The managers of the lines in the Interstate Commerce Kail way association resumed their meeting to day and again grappled with the question of rates to Kansas aud Nebraska points. Thay were unable to make any better headway than on the preceding da v. Finally a committee was appointed to con fer with the roads inost directly interested with a view to adopting if possible some compromise plan of adjustment, and this committee was directed to report t the adjourned session tomorrow. WmDOM'S EEPOET. Similar Eocommendations and Showings to Those in the President's Message. Washington, Dec. 4. The report of the secretary of the treasury shows that the ordinary revenues of the government from all sources for the fiscal year ended June SO, 1689, were $387,050,058. Ordinary ex penditures, 281,930,015, leaving a surplus of $105,053,143, of which there was used in the redemption of notes and fractionhl cur rency and purchase of bonds for the sink ing fund the sum of $47,583,313, leaving a net surplus of 57,470, 129. As compared with the fiscal year, 1SSS, the receipts for 18S0 have increased S7,7S3,9S4. The ordi nary expenditures have increased 22,342,053 For the present fiscal year receipts from the revenue actual aud estimated are S3S5, 000,000; the expenditures are 293,000,000; estimated surplus $92,000 000; estimated amount re quired tor sinking fund $48,221,117. leav ing a net surplus of S43!67S,8S3. The reve nues of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1SS1, are estimated to be 3S5,000,000; total estimated expenditures, including sinking fund, f292.271.405, or an estimated surplus of 92,728,859; estimated amount required for sinking fund 49,159, 073, leaving a net surplus of 43,509,522. There was applied to the purchase and redemption of the debt 90,979,427 as com pared with 103,220,064 at the close of the fiscal year 18S8. The cash balance in the treasury over and above all accrued liabili ties at the close of 1S89 was 71,484.042 If to this balance there can be added the estimated suiplus for the current fiscal year, the amount that may be ap plied to the purchase of bonds to June 30, 1890, will be 163,484,042. Bonds and other obligations of the United States have been puicnased aud redeemed to the extent of 50,404,435, leaving the available cash ou hand November 1, lfctti, .Ho.itto.rW. 

TENSION EXPENDITURE. The amount expended for pensions for the year ended June 30. 1889, was 95,021, 719; appropriated and estimated for same period, 97.75S,700; estimated for year end ing June 30, 1891, 98,587,252. A comparison of the expenditures of 1S79 with those of 1889 will show that during the last ten jears the increase of pensions has not differed very widely from the decrease of inter est on the public debt. Pensions in 1879, 35,121,48.'. Pennons in 1!S9, 95,G24;779. Interest on public debt 1879, 15,327,949. Interest on public debt 1SS9, 41.001,484. No patriotic American has ever complained of the vast amouuts of interest paid to the men who loaned their money to preserve the integrity of the nation. Much less will they complain of any just and proper recognition ot the claims of men who, in tne nation's hour of extreme peril, sacri ficed their lives to save it. TUBCnASE OF BONDS. During the twelve months ending Oc toherSl. 18s9, there were purchased United States bonds to the amount of 99,253,952. In spite of the diminished supply of bonds for sale in the markets the government has been able to obtain at constantly decreas ing prices a sufficient amount of bonds to meet the requirements of the sinking fund for the current fiscal year and carry out the provisions of law respecting the in vestment ot the surplus revenue. INDUCING THE SURPLUS. It appears from the foregoing estimate that after due provisions shall have been mads to meet the ordinary expenditures of the government, there wiil remain under the operation of existing laws an annual surplus of about $44,000, 000. An accumulation of mouey in the treasury beyond the necessities ot the gov ernment endangers legitimate business, leads to excessive and wasteful expendi ture aud to encourage extravagance in pri vate affairs. To decrease this surplus and l hereby do away with its attendant evils the secretary recommends that a portion of it be used to enlarge our foreign mar kets and to strengthen our coast defenses. But after making such provisions a large annual surplus will still remain tinder ex isting laws. The only means now open to the secretary for the- use of this money is a reduction of the interest bearing debt of the government, by the purchnse of bonds To require from him this measure of responsibility is of doubt ful wisdom. It is manifestly wrong to take money lrom the people tor the can cellation of bonds to the saving of only ahont - per cent of interest when it is worth to them perhaps three times as much in their business It is through a reduction of custom rates and iuterual taxes that an unnecessary accumulation of money iu the treasury should be avoided. Reductions in receipts from customs presents the only other advisable means for diminishing the revenue. This can be accomplished: First, by reduction iu rates of duty upon those articles whicli by rea son of inconsiderate legislation, or changes which have occurred in the devel opment of our industries are found to be exces-ive: second, 1)3 increase in rates upou articles which have not been success fully produced here, because not adequate ly protected; the obvious effect of which increase would be to stimulate domestic pioduction and diminish importations and revenue. It is nlain that such articles should either be fairly protected or else placed on the free list; thiru, by transfer rins' to the free list articles which, from c'imatic or other causes, are not, and can not be successlully produced here, also articles which under existing circum stances, we can not economically produce in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our people or to serve the purpose of comueti'ion with foreign productions, and articles the production of which is of in considerable imuortance. The causes are exceptional under our tariff in which mo lerato or reasonable re duction of rates wouul result in a decrease of the revenue. This, as a general r"le, would iucrease importations iu ureater proportion than the xates were reduced and so increase rather than diminish re ceipts. This m its turn would largely iu crease the surplus and correspondingly re duce the price of labor. REVISION OF THE TARIFF. Whatever differences of opiuion are en tertained as to the best methods of effect iuc it, it is generally agreed that a revision of the tariff and custom laws is urgently needed. In the adjustment of duties on imports protection to home industry should be a governing consideration. While there is a wide divergence of judgment on the proposition, it can not well be de nied that it is the settled policy ot this government that such duties should be so levied as to result in protection of labor. One of the fundamental objeda of levying duties ou imports declared in the "first tariff act as pas-ed by congress in 1789 was the encouragement md protection of home industries. Tne wisdom of this doctrine lias been demonstrated by the marvellous development of those industries protected by the high unties demanded by the gov ernment incident to civil war. It should, however, lxi remembered that the prime object in the imposition of these hih du ties was the raisiug of revenue, and rates were adjusted to that end, rather than to the development and protection of domestic i industries. It came about, therefore, that the measure of protection was unequaland some industries were s;reatly prospered hile others lancuibed. The tariff act of lNSl, while intended as a protective measure, was based on former tariffs and perpetuated mauy of the inequalities and defects with which these acts abounded. It is. therefore, urged that iu revising the tariff, schedules can be taken to avoid con flicting provisions and ambieuities, which have produced the evils mentioned, also that rates be so adjusted a toaoid the j inequalities or tne exiting law so hurt ful " to domestic industries. Further more, iu the construction of a tariff law in its broader sene, reference should also be had to the culti vation and extension of our trade rela tions with those countries whose geograph ical situation and resources are such as to make intimate commercial intercourse with them particular! y desirable. FOREIGN COMMERCE. The total value of our imports at.d ex ports of merchandise and specie during the last fiscal year was $1,613,187,633, an in crease over the preceding year of S7,473, 843, and was greater than for any year since 1881. Of this amount there was nold exported to the amount of 59,952,285; the imports were $10,284,858. This excess of exports over imports of gold was mainly due to the increase of foreign travel on the part of our people and the consequent for eign increased demand for foreign ex change. The total valub of exports of domestic merchandise was $730,282,609, an increase of $46,420,505 over the preced ing year. The imports during the last fiscal year was tbe-Jargest on the history of our commerce, amounting to 745,131, C52, an increase of 21,174,538 over the fiscal year 1S8S. MERCHANT MARINE. It is but a few years since we stood first among the nations in ship building and were excelled only by Great Britain in the amount of our ocean tonnage. Now so tar as our foreign trade is con cerned our ship yards are comparatively silent and our flag has almost disappeared from the high seas. Once 75 per cent of tonnaue was carried by our own ships; now 87 per cent is carried in foreign bottoms. .Alien capital now levies UDon the people an annual tribute of 150,000,0i,0 for freight and fares. Our farmers and mechanics are practically ex cluded from the markets of the world. An overwhelming public sentiment demands that this humiliation and loss should cease. The report goes on to state various amounts paid by foreign nations out of their treasuries to steamship compauies for mail contracts and subsidies while the United States has utterly neclected and abandoned her great foreign maritime in terests, even declining to pay fair rates for services rendered by vessels of the United States, although congress had appropri ated money for the purpose. Fully convinced that American steam ship builders and owners can not unaided compete with the governments of Europe: that without proper aid and encourage ment from the Uuited States, we shall fail to retain the small amount of foreign trade that remains and that the extension of our foreign trade is dependent upon the restoration of our merchant marine, I do no hesitate to recommend that liberal aud judicious aid aud en couragement be given for the construction or steam merchant vessels; that fair and liberal rates be paid to American steamers for transportation of mails to loreign countries. TRADE WITH AMERICAN NATIONS. Excluding specie Mexico and estimat ing from the trade returns of the fiscal year 1SSS, Mexico imported 43,380,000; of this amount came from the Uuited States, 19.000,000; Central America fM.SOO.OOO, from the United States 4,592,080; South America 304,833,005, fioin the United States 29.579,227; West Indies 97,544,!520, from the United States 7,809,102; Brazil 114,S35,G70, from the Uuited Stutes 7,137, 00s; Argentine Kenublic 113,244,801, from the United States $6,043,553; Chili 02, 077,831, from the Uuited States 2.433,221. SILVER COINAGE. The continued coinage of the silver dol lar at a constantly increasing monthly quota is a disturbing element in the other wise excellent financial condition of the country and a positive hinderauce to any international agreement looking to a free coinage of both metals at a fixed ratio. Since the passage of the act of February 23, 1S34. there have been coined 343.G3S.C01 silver dollars. To coin this amount of money the purchase of 299,8S9,41G standard ounces of silver was required at a cost of 520,930,033. On November 1 of the pres ent year there were iu circulation 60,093, 4S0 sliver dollars, the remainder, 33.539, 521. beinir stored away iu government vaults, of which 377,319,941 was covered by outstanding certificates. The price of silver on M.trch 1, 1878. was 54 15-10 pence, on June 30, j8S9, 42.499 pence. The lower the price of silver the greater the quantity that must be purchased and the larger the number of silver dollars to be coined to comply with the act of February 28, 1878. No proper effort has been spared to put into circulation the dollars coined under this law. The stock of these dollais which can perform any useful function as a cir culating medium must soon be leached if it has not been already and the further coinage and storage of them will then become a waste of public money and a burden upon the treasury. In this country public seutiment and commercial and industrial necessity demand the joint use of both silver and gold as money. With a stock of 343 633, 000 silver dollars sharing equally with our gold coins the ruuctionof lull 'egai tender money, aud an annual product from our mines approximating 60,000,000 (coining value), it would not bo the wisest policy to discontinue the use of either metal as money. Therefore the question is, "how shall we use both." Various solutions of this problem have been proposed, among which may be mentioned the following: First, an international agreemeut fixing a ratio between silver and gold, and opening the mines ot the leading nations of the world to the free coinage of both met als at tlio rate so established; second, the policy of purchasing and coining 4,000,000 worth of silver per mouth; third, increased coinage and purchase of silver to the max imum of 4,OJO,000 per month, now au thorised by law. Since March 1, 187S, there has been no contraction, but on the contrary an expansion of our currency, as appears from tne following statement: Total increase of circulation of all kinds has been 713,970,403, total decrease 114, 752,210; net increase 599,224.193. Tha statement, therefore, that this country is suffering a paralysis from a severe contrac tion does not seem to be sound; fourth, free coinage of standard silver dollars: fifth, the coinage of silver dollars containing a dollar's worth of bullion; sixth, issue certificates to depositors of silver bullion at the Tate of one dollar for 412,1., grains of standard sliver. The secretary recommends the following measure: Issue treasury notes against deposits of silver bullion at the market price of silver when deposited payable ou demand in such quantities of silver bul lion as will equal iu value, at the date of presentation, the number of dollars ex pressed on the face of the notes at the market price ot silver (or in gold) at the option of tha government or in silver dollars at the option of the holder: repeal the present features of the present coinasre law. Special attention is called to this proposition by the secretary. The advant ages to Ikj derived from such a measure are obvious. The report then treats of the purchase of silver, deposits of public money, the na tional bank system, immigration, the Chinese exclusion act and ends with civil service laws. 

CAPITAL NOTES- WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 Senator Cockrell today presented a memorial of the citizens of Balls and Pike counties, Missouri, pro testing against the passage of any bill for the observance of Sunday or any religious institution or rite, and also against any amendment to the constitution providing for religious instruction iu the public schools. It prays that the government be kept strictly secular and that church and suae be entirely separate. The total collection of internal revenue for the first four months of the present fiscal year were 40,753,350, an increase of 4,039,364, as compared with the colletions duriug the coireponding period last year. The increne was" principally due to the increased consumption of spirits, tobacco aud fermented liquors. Someone has declared deceit worse than consumption, and the comparison is a true one. Many are the "conceited" who cry down legitimate remedies, and who delude suffering humanity, whose only snlvaiion is the immediate use of Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup.

A Controlling Interest in the Live Stock Organization. Chicago, HI., Dec. 4. E. P. Savage, of Omaha, was made chairman of the second days' session of the live stock dealers' con vention. The committeo on constitution and by-laws for the proposed national or ganization made their report. The third section, providing-for the basis of repre sentation in the exchange, caused a wrangle which lasted until 12:30, when an adjournment was taken until 2 o'clock. Ou the basis proposed Chicago would be entitled to 34 out of the total of 57 members of the national exchange. There was a lively "kick" on this from Kansas City and Omaha. When the meeting reconvened the Kan sas City delegation had dropped its bel ligerent attitude and was concilliatory. Section three was again taken up and finally adopted, the Kansas City delegates, however, voting no. J. A. Hake, of Omaha, chairman of the committee on organization, submitted a resolution asking to have tne rules and by laws submitted to the local exchanges for ratification, to be reported back by Decem ber 15, and if adopted by all local exchanges, the same to take effect January 1, 1890. The Kansas City delegation opposed the resolution. The Omaha delegation voted for the resolution and because of the al leged treachery. Colonel Peters, of Kansas City, treated the Omaha delegation to a strong and rather pointed. Amendments to the resolution were pre sented and finally a substitute that the rules and by-laws be adopted by the ex changes ratifying them, as submitted by Delegate ScrugVs of Kansas City. The substitute had a soothing effect and was adopted. Chairman Hake introduced a second resolution that the first aunual meeting of tho national exchange be held in Chicago on the first Thursday in October, 1890. A committee was appointed to select officers for the ensuing year. The committee sub sequently reported the following and the selection was unanimously adopted by the convention: Vice presidents, M. D. Scrugus, Kansas City; J. A. Hake, Omaha; E. J. Senshee, St. Louis; J. V. Vincent, Peoria; A. J. Parson, Sioux City. C. W. Baker, Chicago, secretary. Levi Dodd, Chicago, treasurer. President Thompson appointed the fol lowing executive: Charles P. Chuds, Kan sas City; J. B Blanchard, Omaha; W. L. Cassidy, St. Louis; J. Rosenbaum, Chi cago; M, V. White, Peoria; Thomas Coro bin, St. Louis. The meeting adjourned until tomorrow. At the conclusion of the session the opin ion of the Kansas City delegation was that their exchange would refuse to ratify the convention's work. The reports are nflo it that the organization of tho exchange meant a new live stock trust but it was emphatically denied by the delegates. "There are evils enough in the live stock business," said Mr. Thompson, "and if wo correct them, which is our only end in view, we shall accomplish a good thing for everybody from producer to consumer."

WILL ABIDE BY THE DECISION. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 4. Chairman Downing, of the state board of railway commissioners, held a meeting today with the grain elevator men. It was agreed that the constitutionality of the state grain inspection law should be referred to the state supreme court. When the law went into effect a month ago the elevator men refused to qualify under it. Mr. Downing notified them that they were doing busi ness contrary to law and that he proposed to take action against them. As a result today's meeting "was held. Both the rail way commission aud the elevator men en gage to abide by the supremo court's de cision without going through the usual legal form. Pears' soap is the most elegant toilet adjunct. IGOE AND MILES BURIED. Minneapolis, Miun., Dec. 4. the ruins of the burned Tribune building were still smoking today as the two hearses bearing Operators James F. Icoe and Walter E. Miles, of the Associated Press, were driven past, taking the lifeless victims of tho disaster to their List resting place in the east side Catholic cemetery. Four fellow operators fiom the Associated Press, four from the Western and four from the North American Telegraph company acted as pall bearers. High requiem mass was celebrated at the Holy Rosary church. Father Brewer preached an impressive sermon and the two men together in death as in life were carried to the city of the dead. It is now believed that Miles reached tho fire escape on the night of his death and seeintr Igoe was not there turned back to look for him. The delay proved fatal. Commercial Editor Williams' funeral was held this afternoon and the body was tonigtit sent to Broadhead, Wis.
