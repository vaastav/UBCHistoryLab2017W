Mr. Stevens ( Pa 1, from the Committee of Way? und Means, reported back the joint resoluti an explanatory of so much of the Internal Uevenuo act us referred to the duty on cigars (an abstract of winch whs printed on 'Wednesday morning). Mr. lliooks (N. Y.) said that tho' Secretary of the Treasury hud recommended the tax, and ha now wi.-hed to know whether the Commi'tee of H uys und Means intended to change the duty on lonaeoo. Mr. Stevens replied that ho had given the su'' jict some consideration, but he did not know what the conclusion of the committee would be. Mr. Brooks suggested that the bill be postponed for a few days for further examination. Mr. Stevcnii remVd tutu in the opinion of tluHO tK-st instructed the Department had lost millions of dollars by the coui.iructi.rn of tho Commis sioner of Internal Hevenue, Mr. brooks said in the opinion of a large num ber of manufacturers, it was quite impossible under the principle ol tho luweverti have honest n, anufacluring ol cigars. The temptation was so great, tiie duty so immense, ami the punishment so severe, as to render it utmost impossible te prevent frauds. iiy tne measure now n lore tnem tuere was no doubt, trom the last iiifoi'inatiou, that tin) best way was to attach a one cent stamp to each ciar sold, aud this would produce u larger ri venue than the principle 'ia tho bill. Mr. Stevens explained that utl the committee had done wus to put a proper construction on the law, in contradiction to a very erroneous decision ol the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Dawes (Mass.) said that some of the manu facturers had g'opped nearly cntiicly in cinso qiionie of the very singular construction of tu j law. The construction went beyond even tho law ib-elf. lie thought something more thin a simple joint resolution was necessary t' reuiedv tho d'- I Inla Mas. - fi,, il .1, . uuiru urn iiimu ..v..., ii-iiiisTivi'iia would be patient in clearing up the dillicultics whic h i-nrround the subject. Mr. S evens then proceeded to show that ninc tetiihs ol the cigars manufactured sinca Congress adjourned, hud paid but S I instead of frs a thou sand, owing to the construction of tho Commis sioner of Internal Revenue. The measure peiidiml was fere lcpcaled to give the proper couslracuon to the law. Mr. Prooks expressed the hope that the Cotn niittee would take time to consult with hunest manufacturers in order to remove the existing (lilhciiilics by, as the Secret try of the Treasury hud r commended, a owy on leal lon&cco. A duty oh cigars should ha ronsidercj in the same connection. He r.'pc ilcd that experienced liicn had ad', is, il a st laip duty on eii'ars, si nil ir to postage siamps.

It has been our disagreeable duty, on more than one occasion, to declirc against legislation npon gold, and in every in stance the pernicious tdfcc'S of the m- asares we denounced were visible in fortyight hours af cr the nr.lclc was written.

Tho tinkering with the tariff at the close of the last session was an instance of thlssortof folly. The prices of silk goods were advanced .'10 per cent, in a day, and Importers and holders of such goods were put ull at sea by this surprising act, which nearly dou. bled the duties without notice. Orders in Luropo had to be suddenly countermanded, an 1 con sumers found prices marked tin over night, from ;id to W -T cent, on articles which th"y ln'eded Immediately. 'Il.e currency came in for the same kWd of inco moderate legislation, and acts in relati n to gold were passed aud repealed with a ma.5ic.1l celerity that would have astonished Wit, but which was perfectly disgraceful to the National Lcgisla urc. Our readers will remember how wo expostulated In regard to the Gold bill, and how quickly "ur worst fears were realized ; for it was manifest 10 tlig most shallow clerk in any broker's (lice, that if the loyal people, who were resisting the gold rl-e by selling largely when cvir it was put np, were prevented altogether from dealing iu it, that a few experts Oiuld carry the pi ire np ten or twenty per cent, any day they pleuseU ; f.nd the result wiii just as we had fore- ! in Nation to the parties who sell gold mi spceu ' ., latum and claim that they are cxouipt trom tlx told. As if the folly of the last session was not suf fu iei.Cy glguntic, we have at this session, on the very lirst (hiv, a repetition of this sublime non sense, with improvements and variations. It was propieed not only to mako gold transictlous penal, but it was resolved to cmircrt paper itfn )nlil hi 'in net of CvHiiiest. Now, when these gentlemen can perform this feat, if they will "call spirits from the vasty deep," they will find tl.em appear upon the lloor of the House with tl'rmonds in tiieir laps, ready to shower them iu prof, ion upon such grand magicians. Gold it as much an article of merchandise now as coin, and Is a- liable to be affected by tho law Of mi ply and demand. Both may be changed in pre favorably or adversely by speculation; but i o law on earth can change their essential Character. If we attempt to feed tweu'.y thousand men on a half-peck uf crn meal we shall fail ; if we attempt to pay a million of men a high salary in gold out of twenty millions, we shall probably fail also. We shall be obliged, we think, to select some other commodity, iu both cases, to consum mate our purpose. If auy act of Congress could possibly accomplish this feat, surely tho present body woullbe the one to attempt it. It will be found, however, tiiat if we are to carry on this gigantic war for the suppression of this wicked Rebellion, we must feed and pay our men; and if we have not gold, we must have paper; and if we cannot keep down prices whilo we go on expanding nnd spending money, we aro in the same tlx that all nations have been who have had heavy wars upon their hands, and have adopted paper us the medium of exchange between the buyer and seller. The only things that will keep down gold are contraction, taxation, rigid economy, and bold strokes at the foe in tho ficld As for all the rest. Congressional speeches, acts of legislation, town nice ings, newspaper articles, and telegraph despatches about a starving enemy, aud reliable con'ralnnds, who say that tho Con federacy is caving In they are all, every on) of them, to use a Turkish expression of greit forco, Iiish! essential humbug, of which wo have had more tiiau enough for four long ycari. The war Is on our hands, and we must fight it out, and accept all the attondant diilleulties of the situation. Like nil disagreeable dutios, wo should perform it ns quick!;' as possible ; and if oou,?"0 more men and tenhundred more minimis will not do tho Work up by next midsummer, io the nnmc of all reason and common sense let us double both the men and tho money, and tin suinmale the business promptly and thoroughly. We shall then have amp'e ability to return to a sound financial bacis, in what the soldiers call "a double; quick ;" and we shall 6ive time, save credit, and ltd a proud iatislaclioiiln having done: our duty nobly, like men who ha0 au earnest love of countiy, which no impediments can cn- ijiicr no disaster dismay to whom inop assibili tiis are unknown, aud tlie glovy of success is assured. Another oil compwy that we cau reom mend has been added to the list, called tha Comt! onwealtU tlil Company, of Lawrence county, Pennsylvania! Notwithstanding the actual value cf the property of this Company, it represents a cupital of only two hundred thousand dollars, divided in o shares of $l-M each, the subscription price at present for which is only Sl id each, the territory of the Com pany Is thirty-live ucres, In fee simple, on Slip pery Hock creek, Lawrence county, Fa., aud is part of the famous " Matthew Stewart' oil tract, und adjoins the ' Phillips Well." Tho results thus finr obtained In b iriug arc hig'ily satisfactory, tho existence of vast deposits cf oil nt a moderate depth being established. There is Also an abundance of Coal of the test quality on the projierty, to furnish fuel for steam engine', and ilcb veins of iron ore have been developed. sVlr,(iOn unpaid capital has been reserved by the company. Samples of the oil, c .il, and iron from this tiuct can be seen at the oilice, No. Hi Ches nut street, where subscriptions arc received. Tie market this morning is quite steady, with a fair ihmand for shares of all kinds the public feeling more assured of the future, and since the Gold bill in the House has been tabled by a de cisive vote, it Is hoped that the currency tinkers will abstuin from further rash experiments.
