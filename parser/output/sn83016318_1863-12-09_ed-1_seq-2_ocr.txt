The W hile 3Ian In America. TLc lecture of Chancellor JJavt-a, tQ this ub jtct, on Wednesday ever.ing last, was a complete euxe-n. lieore the Lour announced for the kc lure, trj eat in the Representative Hill was filled, and many came afterward and wer.t away. A introductory to Li, subject, the lecturer '.focM:d the 'ligation of the unity of the hu man race, and came to the conclusion, on scien tific ground exclusively, that there had been but one creation of man, and that all the races which exint, and which naturalist. Lave various ly estimated frcm three to ixty three, or more, in number, have arisen from individual differen ce! in the original ancestors, modified by clima'e and ether exterriil ir.fhje'.ces. lie showed the immense variety existing throughout the animal and vegetable king lorns; and that more varie ties are constantly appearing, not by creations of new leedi or animals, but by modification of placU and animal already existing. New breeds of ca'.tle, and of all domestic animals, different from any known to our ancestors, are now com mon all over the country; whih; gardeners and fruit growers arc presenting us with specimens almo't without number, of new fruit and flow er. All varieties of wheat, he thought, must have come from one a-ed ; and so of other plant. from the-e analogic, the lecturer argued that ail the varieties of lueii, a wi li an of the plants and animuN, ii.ust Lavi come from one Mock : but aa som- of the. varieties were a distinctly marked, 1 'Oo vc:irs ago, a they are now, a shown by the paintings on the Egyptian tomb, he admiu. d that the uiu.kiiid must have livd on earth rii'i'h longer than is getiera'v pup posed. Th; white- men of America came from Europe, which I. inhabited by whit-: men exclusively : an 1 the white meti of Kurope had their origin in the neighborhood ot the Himalaya mountains. This he argued from the similarity of plant, do niestic animal and language. He regarded the S.mscript a the original language of the Lite man : and distinct traces of it were found in the Latin and (ireek languages, a, well a thoe of modern Europe. The two principal varieties of the white men of Europe were the Celt and the Teutons ; and al most every white person in America was deacon ded from one of these. Each of these vai ietics have peculiar and, in same respects, opposite trait of character. The Celts are impulsive, volatile, move in masse, cluster together, love to be ruled by a strong arm, and have great at tachmcnU to individual men. The Celtic race had produced O'Cuiinell and Napoleon. The Celts are Catholic by nature, having great rev erencc for authority : and tho Celtic nation of Europe are all Catholic. Had Washington been a Celt, he would have made himself Emperor : had our fathers been Celts, they would have ia" sisted on making him an Emperor. The Teutons love individuality and personal iudependeuce ; have less attachment to leaders; will not follow them in great masses ; are jealous of supreme sutho-i'v, and withdraw their allegi ance, and divide up into small communities Hence all Germany is cut up iuto little States : and Eu gland retains her immense possessions, by giving to each part an individuality of action which amounts almost to independence. The Teuton are Protestants by nature, and believe ia individual judgment on religious matters. The Teutonic nations of Europe are Protestants. Everywhere the Teutons carry with thrin trial by jury and religious toleration. They have also a great repect for women; and the race ha produced more noble women than all other ra ces combined. Through the progress of these two races, Europe for throe centuries, ha been the heart and brain of the world. The lecturer argued that these two leading varieties of the white man will fuse together, and produce a new rare, combining the charac teristics of both, in a country having greater natural advantages for human development than any other. The new race he considered as al ready established in its traits, o much so that an American is immediately recognized in Eu rope by hia characteristics. This raco will be taller than others, more muscular, nervous, en during, long lived, shrewd, enthusiastic, active, prompt, practical, confident, deciding readily on everything, and ready to give an opinion on any abject. The lecturer touched very lightly on the lartTs of Jonathan's character : and conclu ded, that as every age has had but one leading nation which has stamped its impre on that ge, so this new race, thus formed by the union of the Teuton and the Celt, will by it peculiar traits, take the lead of all others. Mr. Haven spoke an hour and a quarter, and the discourse contained as great an amount of facU, arguments and ideas, as could well be con deosed into that period. He seems to know no thing at all of the " spread eagle " style of elo quence, or the art of using n-any words to say nothing; and the promptness and confidence with which be gave lus views on the numerous topics presented, proved conclusively that be had at least that characteristic of the rew race of men which he described.

Mr. Hoes, of Chicago, offered a prize of a $50 gold watch to the largest contributor to the great Sanitary Fair. It turns out that President Lincoln was the largest contributor, his proclama tion havirg brought $3,(v5 for the benefit of the Fair. Accordingly, Mr. Hoes decides that the the priie belongs to -v 3 President, and he sent oa the watch last Saturday not a 50 watch, but a magnificent one, worth $15t with this in scription upon it: "Presetted to Abraham Lin coln as a memorial from the Northwestern Sani tary Fair, ia consideration of bis being the larg est contributor to the enterprise."

The object of this law was to prevent the possibility of tiiiii g the House with bogus member from S juthera States, who had never b-.cu really elected, but might nevertheless present certitic it- s of Svrae sort, and gala aJin'r-lo:. ia sull'jie:.. !:um'ers to control the House. The Clerk chiime 1 that this law required him to insist that cieh cert.2c.ite should specify in this given forui that the mem ber was elected according to the 1 1 of the .UA and of the United Mat-.-s. No th: certiLca'es from Oregon, Minne--ta, Wst.-rn irg:.'.;a. Maryland ard part of Missouri, read that the member wered i! elect t 1 nceordlr g o hw.

This would have two important results - it would till up the thinner rank of o-ir army, and would relieve the governm-.r.t from the burden of supporting the families of these people, whom we shall now- have el.vming our protection in great number.

These nations, while undergoing the tiial -f war, were oppressed by the evils of an immense exo L.s of their people, eau-e i by the density ot their population, the impossibility to provid- occupation f..riheiu, the low price of !alor, and the scarcity of territory. Compare i with our own oe.ritry, they pos,ssvd slight room for future development ; they were settled in every pirt, arid no vast territory lay invitingly open to encourage enterprise and set t'eniet.t. Their great problem ha been whit to do with their surplus population, which, iu it turn, ha sought new field U t adventure and self support in countries like our own, whe'e an illimitable territory waits to be developed, and whore incalculable resources invite industry and energy. The encouragement to be derived from these facts aril comparison ot circumU:iC' 3 is very grea', and to the raind of any ihsonssionnte reioner i conclusive that the eour- of this great country i onward anl upward, and that its eredlf will live unimpaired to the end." 15.
