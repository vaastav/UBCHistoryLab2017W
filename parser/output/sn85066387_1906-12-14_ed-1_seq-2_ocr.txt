2 CATHOLICS THRONG PARES CHURCHES tnents pay that wherever mass was celebrated charges were drawn up and summonses issued. At Chalons the Abbe Panaudln claim ed that the church bells were not rung and that no person was invited to mass and that therefore the assemblage had not the character of a pjibllc meeting, whereupon he was compelled by a po lice officer to Inscribe his protest upon the summon!. At the final meeting last night of the diocesan council here it was decided that neither the ecclesiastical residence nor the seminaries should be abandoned except before a show of force. It Is officially stated that the letters of Monslgnor Montagnini. the expelled secretary of the Papal nunciature here, show that the majority r>t the French bishops favored observance of the law of ISSI and bowed with reluctance to the papal decree. The official state ment adds that the inviolability of the diplomatic correspondence of the nun ciature was scrupulously respected be fore the rupture fcw?«.*-een the Vatican and France. /, ' SEMINARIES BEING CLOSED During the day pummonses were is sued charging illegal assemblies in the case of sixty-nine churches of Paris. The Official Journel announced today that only eighty of the Catholic cult ural or diocesan associations formed were legal, while 903 Protestant and seventy-eight Jewish associations con formed with the law. About fifty seminaries which refused to comply -with the terms of the law ere being closed. It was rumored during the afternoon that the Government was instigating this course in order to insure keeping the churches at the disposal of the clergy and forcing the latter into 'the position of deliberately discontinuing public worship. The abbes of the Church of St. Pierre dv Gros Caillou. St. Augustln and St. Roche, are being prosecuted under the law making it an offense to utter in places of public worship words cal culated to provoke resistance to the lawful authorities. PRESENTS DARK PICTURE SIOBBISTBor .Moniasrulni Telia Anxlons Pontiff of Situation In Prance ROME, Dec. 13. — Immediately after his arrival here today Monsignor Mon tagnini. the expelled secretary of the Papal Nunciature at Paris, went to the Vatican and conferred with Papal Sec retary of State Merry del Val and Mon signor della Chiesa and Monslgnor Gas parri, the assistant secretaries, and made them a long report on the situa tion in France. Immediately afterward Monsignor Montagnini went to the Pope and pre sented to the pontiff a rather dark pic ture of the situation, saying he be lieved the present French Government would not be, induced to change the attitude which" it had assumed toward the Vatican. Monsignor Montagnini remained at the Vatican, and it is expected that he will not leave there until the acute stage of the Franco-Vatican crisis has passed. The Vatican in addition to a semi official statement made last evening in the Osservatore Romano says: To make the applications as intended by the French Minister of Worship, M. Briand, would mean submitting to a moral and material situation which is unbearable to the clergy of France, especially as the churches, places con secrated to God, would be regulated In a worse manner- than' the dance halls, and officiating priests would be reduced to the humiliating condition of being eimply tolerated. ' These' unjust and dishonorable regulations are aggravat ed by those regarding- the episcopal residences, presbyteries and semina ries, and therefore accepting the terms of M. Briand's circular would have meant betraying the vital Interests of religion. - ' The Holy See ordered the clergy to refuse to make application prescribed "by the law of 1881, not on account of the application itself, but because of the other regulations in M. Briand's circular.

' King Solomon's Hall FHlmore St. , near Slitter San Franc isc o; Evidence of Graft Is Complete in the Trolley Scandal Case Will Soon Come Before Grand Jury The evidence In the trolley graft is complete and is" ready for presentation to the Grand Jury. It is so positive that Abe Ruef, Mayor Schmit«*and a majority of the Board of Supervisors cannot hope to escape indictment. The case will not be placed before the Grand Jury until pending matteYs havo been cleared up. The money paid to Abe Ruef by the United Railroads has been traced to the bank In which he deposited it. In tracing this sum it was discovered that Ruef . is a heavy depositor in almost every large bank in San Francisco. Ruef has nearly $500,000 on deposit in the financial institutions In this city. The evidence shows that in with drawing the boodle money from the bank Ruef exercised the utmost cau tion to avoid suspicion. He made a large payment to Supervisor Gallagher, who, in turn," handed the money to those members of the board who were in on the deal. Ruef will set up the claim that he was employed as special counsel'by the United Railroads at the time of the transaction. This claim will be com pletely shattered by the evidence to be introduced. It has become known that the matter was placed before Ruef by the corpora tion some months before the fire. He was to engineer the deal by which the city was to be sold out. Everything was in readiness for its consummation when the outburst of public wrath at the suggestion of the blanket franchise frightened Ruef and he decided to post pone the deal. The fire gave him the opportunity for which he j had been waiting, and he handed over the »city to the corporation under the. cover of ur gency legislation. * - -:i\ Important conferences have, been held this week In the offices ,of . the United Railroads at Oak and Broderick streets, at which the trolley scandal has been discussed. Thornwell Mul lally has been the' leading spirit at these sessions. Following the trolley scandal the telephone, deal is to be placed before the Grand Jury. Several attorneys will be summoned to give testimony in this connection,- among them George/Hat ton. •He is in the national capital, whither he went at the opening of Con gress. He will be asked to return to go before the Grand Jury. ROOSEIELT'S plan FOR LEGISLATION SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE CALL.

Ignoring the Rights of the State HEARINa TOvBE HELD The Southern Pacific Company has made application to the War Depart ment for permission to widen its Oak land, mole. , The mole at present covers fifty .acres s and ;the proposed addition would , increase its extent by . twenty seven I acres. The. matter has^ been re ferred' by the War Department, to the United States Harbor : Line Board of San Francisco for report. Major Will iam /W. Hart of the ; Engineer Corps will conduct a public hearing on be half of the board at the rooms of the California Promotion Committee/ in Union Square on January 8 at ~ 11 o'clock. - - " \u25a0..'. As the proposed extension is beyond the bulkhead and : would affect naviga tion," it was necessary for the Southern Pacific to apply to the federal authori ties for permission to undertake the work. The railroad company has failed to take into consideration the rights of the State of California. The tide lands which ; the company proposes to grab are owned by the State. A; year ago, when the Southern Pa cific \u25a0 first displayed a disposition to seize the land In question. Mayor Mott of Oakland published a letter of pro test.. Governor; Pardee took no ac tion, ; nor has I he, as far \u25a0as is known, takenVcoenizance of the railroad's ap plication. N f ' It will be recalled that 'when the Key Route Company, understood to be affiliated with .the S^nta Fe, requested permission of the Government to fill in its trestle in the bay, the Southern Pacific lodged a vigorous protest, and succeeded in defeating the Key Route project. Now' the railroad seeks a privilege similar to that against which It protested.
