The dominant note of the president's roes- sage to the reconvened congress It war and peace its reference to the war in Europe, and lis emphasis on the obligations of peace in America. The other topics dealt with are un satisfactory because of Indeflnlteness, but on the one point that the United States thall re main neutral, and shall not deviate from its long established military and naval policy, Mr. Wilson Is clear and uncompromising. True, we hear a great deal In these days about our unpreparedness for war, and the necessity for enlarging both army and navy to put us in position to cope with possible foes. There are advocates even of compulsory military service In this country to supplant the system of voluntary enlistment, and some demands for military expansion beyond all previous limits of peace strength. The president gives the effec tive answer to these outcries, when he says that we have no foreign foes .o fear now any more than we had before the war conflagration, and lhat we will not have hereafter any more than before If we do our duty as a great neutral nation, and he is determined to have us do It. The only thing -we need to be prepared for is to defend ourselves from attack, and for thla we have been prepared right along. To maintain and Improve our army and navy establishments on this basis will, of course, require constant outlay and better co-ordination with state mili tary establishments, but to try to match the mili tarism of Europe Just at the time when the arm aments of the great powers are sure to be sub jected to limitation aa the result of the war, would be, as the president Intimates, short sighted and unwarranted. Incidentally this re assurance against a popular misconception 4a gratifying. "The country has been misinformed," he de clares. "We have not been necUrant ef national defense. We shall learn and profit by the les son of every experience and every circumstance; and what is needed will be' adequately done." But what Is to be done, It must be understood. Is not to be done In response to a temporary clamor1, but pursuant to a permanent and settled policy, a policy which looks forward to peace, and not to war. In this declaration the chief executive unquestionably voices the sentiment of the vast majority of our sober-minded and peace-loving American cltixens. Arizona's 8. 0. S. "For God'a sake, help us!" This is the cry, not of war-besieged Euro peans, but of, peaceful American cltlsens, who are being shot down with Impunity by reckless Mexican bushwhackers. The cry cornea from Naco, Arizona, where five persons have been killed and forty-two others wounded by the Mexicans across the border. A ciuiens' com mittee has been organised to provide some method of protection and in the extremity of the situation this cry of distress goes up to Washington. - , What has become of all our hlgh-soundinr warnings to Mex'co to' keep its bullets on its own side of the boundary line? What can be done to prevent such shooting when Mexican towns across the line are besieged? The people of Arizona seem to hava suggested a wise and ef fective measure--ret our. f overnment take such action as will automatically close any port on the Mexican border whenever It becomes the scene of battle. That ia one way among others if those responsible for affairs would only try to find them. ' The people who reside where Mexico borders on Texas, Arizona, New Mexico or California, should have the same rtrtts to the security of life and property as those who happen to live further back In the interior. The Sane Old Story. . One of the "nine cardinal causes" of in dustrial unrest most generally agreed on by employers and employee alike, named in tb re port submitted to congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations is "A deal re on the part of the workers for a voice In the determination of conditions under which tbey labor." Failure to satisfy such a desire la said to figure vitally la conditions existing in Colorado coal mining fields for the last four years, during which loss of property and life baa been the climax of a rule of terror that defied state civil and military autnority and for a time tried the mettle of armed federal power. Itself. It would be Ignominious foil to attamnt t Uy taii ,u1 b!m for this prolonged outlawry on the miners any more than on their employers, but it must be laid largely to the blind and un reasoning seir-mterest which has prevented so much progress toward what wa mav reallv hati as an Intelligent method f handling industrial aiepuies. tjj, fgCt is. that while aelf.lnt.r.. is at the bottom of most of the trouhla It ul timately defeats Itself. . No set of men or Interests, whether wage earners or wage payers, may Justly arrogate to Itself the right to organise and carry on its af fairs as an organization and then rraa recognli, the righv of th6 other side to do the same thing. Vet we find almost invert. hi. i. these disputes this same old story "refusal to recognize" when the facts are all brought out. The board of mediation appointed by the pres ident to adjust the Colorado differences may, let ua hope will, succeed in its mission and that the miners will act upon the recommendations of their chiefs to call off the .trike and go to work If given the chance, but the mediation board would fail of its dute if it . pbaslse this point, that neither aids has any exclusive HKhts of organization. The mine owaers have notably acted in this Colorado, situ ation as a body and they must expect their em ployes to want to act the same way. The Plnchot senatorial campaign In Penn sylvania cost the candidate something over 142,000. The elimination of money from poli tics Is evidently so more feasible for the pro gressive party reformer than for the old farhloned old party politician. As far as anyone baa learned, Colonel Watter son has not as yet Joined Secretary Bryan in the demand for national prohibition in the next democratic platform. - Once more it seems safe for a man to atand up and la an old-fashioned way declare his be lief La the constitution Just as she is. Active Service in War Time Graphic Description by . Charles Vivian in Book Juit limed Enti tled "British Army from Within." Fart X. The popular conception of act've service Is of a succession of encounters with the enemy. Isperate deeds of valor, brilliant charges by bodies of troops, men saving other mm under fire, tha storming of positions and the flush of victory after strenuous action enter largely Into the civilian conception of war. The reality Is a smher business of marching ami watching, nls-hta without sleep and days without food; retracing jne's steps in order to execute the plan of the brain to which a man la but one effective riflo out of many thousands, marching for days and day, seeing nothing mora exciting than a burnt-out nous and the marching men on either aide and to front and rear and then the contact with the enemy. A vicious crack from somewhere, or the eolld boom of a piece of artillery; somewhere away from tha front or flank la the enemy, and his pieces do damage in tha ranks: there Is a starching for cover, some orders are given: ret haps a comrade lies utterly still, anJ one knows that lhat man will not move any more; there Is a desperate aense of Ineffectiveness, of anger at this cowardly (as It seems) trick of hitting when one cannot hit back. There la the satisfaction ot get ting the range and firing with results that may be gueesed, but cannot bn known accurately by the man who rirea: there Is the curious thrill that comes when an angrily singing bullet paaaaa near, and one realises that ona la under fire from the enemy. In a normal action there ia tha sense of disaster, even of defeat when ona's slda may In reality be winning, for ona seea men dying, wounded, lying dead one knowa tha damage tha enemy has inflicted, but has no idea ct the damage one's own force has inflicted In return. Often, when It begins to be apparent that the enemy la nearly beaten, there cornea the order to retire; ona doea not understand the order, but, with sullen sensn of resentment at It, retiree, ducking at the whlsttng of a shell, though not all tha ducking In the world would avail If the ahell were truly aimed at the ona who ducks, or starting back to avoid a bullet that whlsaedTjy as If by starting back one could get out of the way of a bullet! After a day of action, or after the chance has coma to rest for a while after days of action, ona gets a aenae of horror of the whole business the tragedy ef lives laid down. In a good causa certainly, but the man are dead, and one questions almost with despair If it Is worth while. So many good men with whom one has joked and worked and playad In time of peace have gone under and there are probably more battles yet to fight. It Is not until a war has concluded, and men who have served are able to get some Idea of the operations aa a whole, that they are able to under stand what -has been done. Men who coma back wounded from Mons and Charlerol, away from the magnificent three weeks' retreat that was then in progrese, for the British and French armies ware in many rases- fully convinced that they had bean de featedthat their armies ware beaten and had to retreat to save themselves from destruction. The 'man In the ranks cannot understand the plan of the staff who control him, for he sees so very little of the whole; at the most, he knows what la happening t a division of men, while engaged in the retreat to the position on the Marne were, at the least, twenty divisions on the aide of tha all lea Had ona ef these been utterly shattered In a aet battle, the other nine teen might still hava won a decisive victory, and. If news of that victory had not come through for a day or two, the survivors from the shattered division would have spread tidings of a defeat which it would hava been, to them. The man In the ranks sees so little of the whole. Here the war correspondent makea the most egregious mistake, for, untrained In military service himself, ho takes the word of the men In the ranks the man on the staff of army headquarters la far too busy and far too discreet to talk to war correspondents and out of what the man In tha ranks haa to say the war correspondent makes Up his story. Though) the man In tha ranka may believe his ow story to be true, though he may tell of tha operatlona aa he conceives them, he may be Riving an utterly false Impression of what la aatually happening. . The man In the ranka la one cog In a machine, and he eannot tell what all the machine Is doing at any. one time least of all when a battle la In progress. Every battle fought dlffera from all other battle, for no opposing forces aver meet under precisely Identical conditions twice. Thus It is useless to speak of a typical battle except In tha broadest general sense, and useless to attempt to describe a typical battle, or action of any kind. Usually the artillery get into action after cavalry have reconnoitered the enemy's position; tha guns shell the eaemy until he la considered sufficiently weakened to permit of In fantry attack, and than tha Infantry go forward, even up to the rarely occurring bayonet chavge. If their advance dislodges tha enemy, the cavalry are sent on to turn retreat Into rout; tf, on the other hand, th attacking force Is compelled to retire, the cavalry cover the retreat, and. In order to make good in a retreat, a part of a force Is taken been while the re mainder hold the enemy In check. In modern actions artillery fire their shells over the hsada of their own Infantry at the enemy, distance and trajectory per mitting of thla. ' By trajectory ia meant the curvn that a projectile describes In Its flight; both rifle and big guna are so constructed and sighted that thoy throw their projectiles upward to counteract the pull of gravity, and the missile eventually drops down toward ita object It does not travel In a perfectly atralght line. But It la bad for infantry to be In front of their own guns, with their own artillery shells paaaing over them for too long morale suffers from this after a time, atnea a man cannot dlatlpgulsh In auch a case between' hla own artillery's shells and those ef tha enemy. Whenever possible tha artillery In rear of an Infantry force are posted slightly to either flank: circumstances, however, do not always admit of this. (Ooaolnatoa Tomorrow.)
