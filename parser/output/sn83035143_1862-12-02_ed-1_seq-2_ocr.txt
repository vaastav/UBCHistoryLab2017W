COWLES k CO., Publishers of Leader. The President's Message. We have, by telegraph, a brief abstract of the Message of the President, present ed to Congress yesterday. From that ab stract it is needless to attempt extended comment. The President says that if our foreign relations are not as satisfactory as formerly, they are more so than might Tiare been apprehended. Amicable con ventions and consultations have been proposed to foreign governments whose subjects have considered themselves ag grieved. Nothing has been done as yet In the way of colonization, no foreign States having expressed a willingness to receive the col ored emigrants. The President considers the financial . necessities of the Government, and urges the reorganisation of the banking system of the country by act of Congress, making United States notes secured by United 8tates bonds, the basis of circulation. This system of national banking he considers well adapted to give financial stability. He favors the early completion of the Pacifie Railroad, the enlargement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and the At lantic Telegraph. . The Postoffice Department shows an im proved condition from last year : A change of the business relations with the Indians is suggested. We shall doubtless have the document in foil for to-morrow. The South as seen by the Army. A correspondent of the Cincinnati Ga satte, writing from Nashville, gives an in teresting resume of the condition of the Bonth, ac found and commented upon by the men of the Federal army. The colors of the picture are dark and its features for bidding. Tet the assurance is given that it faithfully represents the scenes that three-quarters of a million of U nion soldiers look upon every day. The South has long appeared to the credulous eyes of the North as aristocratic, cultivated and refined, with, ehivalric hosts and beautiful and ac complished women. That there are such to be found here and there is not disputed, but to far as the mass of the people are concerned, there was never a greater sham. This false-glory has fallen from the gaze f the soldiers of the army and they see in its stead barbarism, ignorance and vice. The views of the writer have been formed, he says, with the Army of the Ohio upon its long marches through four States, marching in all directions, crossing its richest tracts as well as the mountain regions, and moving alike through its wealthy districts and its poverty. And with all this experience before him, he asserts that the army will bear him out in the statement that the South is farther behind the age in everything that belongs to. true civilisation, than the Sandwich Islands. These are his general conclusions. Some tacts leading to them will be of interest. Of ail the houses passed by the army, more than three-fourths were of logs, and most of them, poorly constructed. The writer does not remember of entering a house which contained either carpets or cooking Stoves. The plows, harrows and other ag ricultural implements are made of wood. The army has passed through sections where the inhabitants never saw a wagon. Utter "ahiftlessneBS " is written in unmis takable terms on the face of all things. As to publio intelligence, there is nothing' that deserves the name. A majority of those who visit the camps for the purpose of jetting certified accounts of property taken, cannot read the papers presented to them. The mile posts of the South are constructed for the benefit of the mass who cannot read. Instead of stating how many miles ft is to the points indicated, there are a number of notches cut in the posts, but a marks exist to show whether the notches indicate the distance passed over or that still in advance. It is from such evidences as these that the mind of the writer and of the army is made up. Can it be wondered at T Of course there are exceptions, as in the North there are exceptional cases who cannot read, but these facts show the all-pervading ig norance and demoralisation. Fighting Strength of the South. That the South is exhausted of its fight ing men a correspondent of the New York Evening Post is fully persuaded, and gives the following fact in proof: The county of Coosa in 18C0 threw OT.r 2,290 votes. It has sent to the war over 2,300 soldiers ! And this is the ease in almost every neigh borhood. The negroes are very calm in ti midst of the terrors of the war. In the ery beginning they said : " This war is going to kill np all the white men in the Conta, and leave the land to be tilled by the negroes." : He says they are confident they will be all free, and that, as a people, they are at this moment far better fitted to take care of themselves than the poor poor whites. Ex-Governor Dennison is at Washing ton, as a witness in the case of General McDowell- Massachusetts and South Carolina---An Instructive Contrast. The December number of the Atlantic Monthly has an article by Hon. K. J. Walker, in which the respective positions of the 8tates of Massachusetts and South Carolina are set forth clearly and forcibly, the statements being based upon statisti cal facts. These conclusions are most dam aging to the advantages claimed for slave ry. A most astonishing and convincing fact developed by the last census is that Massachusetts, with free labor and free schools, produces three hundred dollars per capita yearly, while South Carolina produces only fifty-tix. To this, Mr. Walk er adds a table showing the average pro duct of savage tribes to be fourteen dollars and sixty cents per capita. Maryland pro duced ninety-one dollars per man. Thus it appears that Massachusetts, with free labor and free schools, produces per capita three times as much as Maryland, and five times as much as South Carolina; and that Maryland, with few slaves, produces near ly twice as much as South Carolina, with many. But the most astounding disclo sure is the fact that Massachusetts, in this respect, is further in advance of South Carolina than the latter is in advance of the savages. Mr. Walker makes, on this basis, three divisions in the progress of civilization: First, Massachusetts, the most highly-civilized community in this coun try, and in the whole world. Second, South Carolina, semi-civilized; and Third, the barbarous savage tribes. Another significant fact is the relative circulation of newspapers im the three States. The annual circulation of news papers and periodicals in Massachusetts is one hundred and two millions, Maryland twenty millions, and South Carolina three millions ! 80 much for the State that pro poses to instruct our own country and oth er nations in the great problem of Govern ment. Mr. Walker shows, by his tables, that if each State and Territory in the Union produced as much every year, per capita, as Mussachusetts, onr whole annual products would exceed nine billions of dollars. West Virginia. Among the unfinished business which will come before the House of Representa tives, at the present session, will be the admission of West Virginia. The bill pass ed the Senate at the last session and would probably have passed the House had it not been for the traitorous efforts of Sena tor Carlile, who succeeded in delaying it in the Senate until almost the close of the session, when it could not be properly dis cussed in the House before adjournment. The people of West Virginia are exceeding ly anxious to have the matter put through and decided, feeling that now or never iB their time. They have no community of interest with the slaveholding districts of Eastern Virginia and desire to make of the western portion s free State, with all a free State's advantages. In this they have the sympathy and good wishes of all the lovers of freedom, justice and progress. This bill provides for the erection of for ty-eight counties into separate State to be called West Virginia, of which the counties of McDowell, Mercer, Monroe, Greenbrier and Pocohontas form the South eastern tier of counties, the boundary thenee crossing the mountains and includ ing Pendleton, Morgan, Hardy and Hamp shire. It gives the new Slate three mem bers in the lower House of Congress. It provides for gradual emancipation by a provision that all children born of slave parents within the limits of the State af ter the 4th of March, 1863, shall be free from birth, and that all slaves within the State at that time under ten years of age shall be free when they become twenty-one, and that all between ten and twenty-one shall be free at tie age of twenty-five ; and further, that no slave shall be permitted to come into the State for permanent resi dence. The Plain Dealer and Tribune. 

CLEVELAND, Nov. 20, 1862. Editor Leader: The editor of the Plain Dealer, whoever he may be, which appears to be somewhat doubtful, seems to be afflicted with too much Greeley. Every number of that delectable sheet is devoted, more or less, to the abuse of Greeley, or the Tribune, much to the disgust of decent people, and very little to the injury of the parties attacked. Yet in the face of this the aforesaid edi tor, whoever he may be, is compelled, in order to make his paper at all readable, to copy articles from the Tribune, but with characteristic meanness he withholds prop er credit for the same. In proof of this, see the paper issued this evening. All the lengthy articles in said paper which have been copied from other papers have been properly credited, with the single excep tion of the one from the Tribune. It seems as if the fellow has some little sense of shame left, for he is not willing to let his readers know that he is indebted to Gree ley's paper for matter to help fill up his own, while he is heaping . nnmeasured abuse upon poor Greeley's head. It may, however, be but another phase of his unmitigated meanness. V1SDEX. Important from Richmond. A special to the Cincinnati Gazette says that the Philadelphia Inquirer has what is considered reliable and important news from Richmond, to the effect that the rebel leaders had calculated that the Virginia campaign had ended for the winter, and Longstreet, with a portion of his corps, was withdrawn to operate against Foster in North Carolina. The removal ofMcClel lan, however, and the movement of Burn side, convinced the rebels that the winter campaign was not ended, and threw Rich mond into a panic. Longstreet' s men were put into the works around the capital ; Lee was ordered to throw his forces on the Rappahannock, and Jackson was recalled from the Valley. Other occurrences and apprehensions Berved to increase the panic. This report states the'rebel force at Rich mond 25,000, and 60.000 north of that place. This estimate is probnbly . not.far from the truth. Military Items from Columbus. Colonel McMillan, of the 95th, has de manded an investigation into the charges against him. . . . Lieutenant-Colonel Swinney, of the S2d, has been honorably discharged from the service. . Lieutenant W. H. Jones, of the 41st, hat been dismissed from the service. ; New States Preparing for Admission. ""The Thiladelphia North American calls attention to the question of admitting new States into the Union this winter. It says: " We have now attached to the Union the territories of Dacotah, Nebraska, Colo rado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada and Wash ington, seven in all, the whole of whose governmental expenses are paid outof the National Treasury. These territories had the following amount of population when the census of 1860 was taken: Colorado, 86,688; Dacotah, 2,676; Nebraska, 28,841'; Nevada, 17,364; New Mexico, 83.009; Utah, 40,699 ; Washington, 11.168. None of these have the population required by the ratio of representation. New Mexico has once before made application for ad mission as a Free State, and would no doubt do so again if there were any chance for admission. The case of Utah is anom alous, and eanaot be treated of at present." Since that census was taken, there has been a large emigration to Colorado, lying as it does in the pathway of emigration and being rich in gold mines. It is as populous as Oregon when it was admitted, and more so than the average of the South ern States. Nebraska, lying adjacent to Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri, has re ceived a larger influx of population than Colorado; It has been claimed, also, that the census was fraudulent, and that the territory actually has a larger population. Tho North American says: " By the admission of New Mexico, Colo rado and Nevada, we could reduce the num ber of our territories to four, diminish the outlay from the National treasury, enlarge the strength of the free States, and give a representation to people who have now no voice in the National Congress. The latter point is' one of no mean inportance, for these seven territories now contain 220, 195 people who are totally unrepresented, taking merely the census of 1861) as our guide. If a census of them were taken now, the number would be near four hun dred thousand." " These people are all as loyal as any inhabitants of the free States, and have a right to share in our deliberations in some way. They have left comfortable homes elsewhere to brave the perils of the wil derness, and run up new communities re mote from friendly aid, and it becomes us to recognize them at the earliest practi cable moment. This was the consideration urged in the case of Oregon. " Congress at this session should also work for the future. It should pass acts providing for the admission of Dacotah, Washington and Nevada, whenever they shall have a fixed amount of population, say fifty thousand, and authorizing the Territorial authorities to call conventions whenever such a population is reached. " Utah territory should also be divided. Important gold discoveries have been made in the unorganized part of old Oregon ter risory, which lies between the one hundred and seventeenth meridian of longitude, the Rocky Mountains and the forty-second and forty-sixth parallels of latitude. Large numbers of emigrants have poured into this wild region, and a new community has been raised there as suddenly as in Colorado and California. This region, nominally, is attached to Washington ter ritory, but really has no government. Now let it be made the basis of a new ter ritorial organization, comprising also all Utah north of the fortieth parallel of lati tude, which includes Salt Lake City and all its adjacent settlements, fixing the seat of government on Salmon River, in old Ore gon. "There are numerous precedents for this. The Red River settlements, made long ago by Lord Selkirk, belonged to the British, then to the North-west Territory, the a to Wisconsin, then to Minnesota, now to Dacotah, and may yet pass through two or more territories before being finally disposed of. . " Since Dacotah was organized, the terri tory of Nebraska is a long strip of territo ry stretching from the Missouri river to the Rocky Mountains, but the western half will no doubt be separated when Ne hnuafea ia ai m i 1 . e ub a. Stato, and will, with the northern part of Utah, constitute a new territory at some future day." The Rumsellers are Abolitionists. This may be a standing assertion, and contrary to all our previous ideas, but the following abstract of their creed by an ex change, shows that they are abolitionists : "1st. They abolish the distinction be tween the proper and nourishing use of the corn, and that which destroys health and life. "2d. They abolish the distinction be tween a high-minded and honorable use of time and means, and that caters to the low est passions and appetites of the worst of men, for the purpose of gratifying a money- loving spirit. " 3d. It abolishes the distinction be tween sober, honest industry, and loafing, lazy drunkeness, degrading to humanity. " 4th. It very often abolishes the sacred marriage relation, by converting the hus band into a beast of a man, and leading him to abuse his wife, so she must, for self-protection, leave him. "5th. It abolishes the relations and care of the parents to and for the children, by sending them out into the world, degraded by having a drunken vagabond of a father. "Gth. It. abolishes the law of the Sab bath, for every distiller that I know of, at tends to business on the Lord's day. " 7th. It abolishes the Eternal distinct ion which God has made between the righteous and tho wicked, and takes every disiiller to glory, who imagines himself a child of grace ; and I might go on with ibis abominable Abolitionism and fill pages, but (his will do for the present." Ulondin Outdone. One 01 mar, who has appeared at the Al hambra Palace, London, has put Blondin and all other trapezists in the shade. A part of bis performances are thus de scribed: " A more wonderful piece of dexterity followed, when Olmar mounted the trapeze, still higher up, and balanced himself on it on one foot without support of any kind, the trapeze oscillating the while, and ren dering the maintenance of an equilibrium a matter of wonder to the audience. It was this feat which placed his great merits beyond a doubt. Ascending higher still, to a distance of bet ween seventy and eighty feet, we believe, Olmar reached a large square platform, in outline dotted at inter vals of about three feet with rings, to the numberof two-and-thirty. Turning about at this giddy height, with the will of a lion and the supleness of a cat, the artist sud denly .threw one of his feet into the first ring, and holding on by his toes, traversed the series of rings, head downward, tower ing over the heads of the bewildered spec tabors. Descending from this platform, Olmar was called before the audience five times, and received quite an ovation. Won ders seem to have ceased in this singular performance. It would appear that phys ical strength, skill, and daring had cul minated in this new comer. Like Leotard, Olmar is prepossessing in appearance, and his symmetrical frame is also a model of Strength." The "Divine Institution." " Burleigh," the New York correspond ent of the Boston Journal, tells the follow ing anecdote: George Francis Train is here amusing our citizens in the debate with C. M. Clay. One of the best things said was uttered by an old man in the fur ther part of the hall. ' Train was shswing the benign influence of slavery, and wound np the climax with the remark, - ' Slavery is a divine institution.' 'So is h 1,' said the old man, and the house came down." The 30th Ohio reziment have gone into winter quarters opposite Cannelton, Kan awha county, Virginia, ten miles , below Gauley Bridge. NOTICE OF DISSOLUTION OF COPARTNERSHIP. Th.
