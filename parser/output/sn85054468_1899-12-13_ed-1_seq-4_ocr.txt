WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1899. , The Iteiuihllcan Programme. The (act that the gold standard bill ; aceaeated by the Republican Adniinistra "ataa ii tiie House of Representatives, js as vicious as it is from either the polit ical, moral, or economic point of view, MH not constitute any good reason for BenaocratJc sorrow, or ground upoe which to despair of the Republic On the whole, It is boat such a production as a oertain hfatorical character might have bad in mtnd when 'he exclaimed: "Oh, that mine -enemy would write a book!" Beyond anything in the recent annals of legislation, the Overstreet gold bill repre sents the hoht effrontery of1 what its back ore believe to be unbridled power. Its ,!WABWiilone are in direct violation of Ke oubtican party pretaaafoes and pledges, Unelr used to gala the victory of 196. So flagrantly does this appear, that no con fession is needed to prove that the meas- ane is offered in deliberate settlement of 1 a secret deal by virtue of witich the Hanna organization agreed with the money in ' tercets to throw off the hypocritical mask Of bimetallism, and appear openly in cbam SJonship of sold, in return for the millions usatutaiated to secure Mr. McKinley's eiec taw. Wbe terms of the Overstreet bill demon strate Administration confidence In the: extinction of the American masses as a dominant factor in national politics. The President knows. Mr. Cage knows, Mr. atxthna and everybody else know, that aatlihia, conld be more offensive to a ma jority of dttsens without distinction of party, than the enactment of legislation which woutA place the power of irrespon sible expansion or contraction of the cur rency in the haetfe of those who deal in money as the sole commodity of their buei- j ess. Yet that is what is m- proposed without the slightest effort to conceal the It does not require great education in 1 fwauiniriT. or huge financial experience, to understand that the scheme to tmpound the i&aeenbocfcs involves a speedy reduction of the circulating medium to the amount of the greenback issue. ' It must be reroem iaered that these notes constitute a free cir culating medium not subject to withdrawal vhes the bamkc dhsnne to create panics, and and by taking money out of circulation property of oil debtors under the What the Republican syndicate oates by way of offset to this withdrawal of money of redemption, merely accentu ates the wickedness of the general plan. la place of national money absolute money it it proposed to provide means for the enlarged issue of credit money. Small na tional banks are to be encouraged in the villages wbJcfe up to bts time have kept out of the mouth of the money shark by reason of his inability to reach them di rectly. We do set say that small banks would not be a boon to the farmers and rrpssmadi trade mien of the country, under a sdenUnc and equitable banking system, conceived add organised to make the bank other than a pawnshop and Its customers comething better than judgment debtors. But anything Hke eueh a system is exaotly whot the maaomoialUat currency squeezers desire to avoid. They knew well enough how to set about their work. The Overstreet bill would give " national baxfc the 'power to innate credit -'''money, in praotSce, almost without limit. . If they so destte. they can Issue as many national aautk notes as they please, by de posttiBe with the Treasury bonds of equal face aloe. Titos they would have unlim- Tted power to ruiav their patrons and wreck the prices of all commodities, and the -value oCall real property, by sudden con traction; for they would only have to avail themselves of the redemption previs- ion in this bill aad hr turning la w "tful money retire their excess circulation. - Thus, the only lawful money being gold, or a demand ior gold, a huge volume of what the people moot have for the payment of debts aad taxes would be locked up, and "an equal volume sf bank ere credits upon which tkey had been doing bustaess would .be wiped out of existence. If it be the policy of the present Admin istration te make a record of this kind ' Kpen urWok to go before the country next year, we da not see why Democrats or ear friend of the people at large should Object. The ashsiac to fasten not only gM bat a system of hapetoss financial Slavery smen the maases is so obvious that its adweacy by the legislative leaders of the Republican party will do more than earthing tse could to show voters how f .oib they were to trust to the promises of the same men aad their political copar rcfrs tnrt- jear &go. Peraar.f at last SSbt -theplain people may get the fact through their heads that they were buncoed In 1S9G. Pcrliaps they may be willing to think it was all for the best; and again march meekly.jntb the slaughter pen in 19C0, fully convinced that whatever may be the sins and hj'pocrisias of their masters as far as the currency is concerned, they are to he trusted this time because they so hate the trustsjtliat helped to put them in power andteontrol them, that they will never ap pear hereafter without an octopus spear in j each hand. Perhaps this is the way the j plain people will see it; perhaps not! TIu Trusts us nn Issue. j We are glad to see that one at least of the Democratic leaders in Congress real izes the imminent necessity for bringing the trust i66ue to the front, and Re publican professions regarding it .to a test. Doln without delay. Such a course is at once demanded in the interests of a raon- opoly-ridden people, and because, if the party of the masses fails now la seise its j opportunity, the issue which bouid be as ! important as any other in the campaign of 1940 will be taken out of Its artith. We have read the imposing utterance of j the President on the subject of the trusts i in his message to Congress. The majority , in each house has listened to his admoni- tion. to the effect that if it finds any reason to think that additional legislation is need- ed to control or resist the power of com hinations which it may discover to ne in restraint of trade, it should consider the mater with pious and punctilious care. 4 We "have heard the Presidential mouthpiece j on the jioor of the House of Representa- j tives in an interview which he has not yet , denied, declaring that no trust legislation appears to be required; and we are strong- j ly impressed by much other evidence that the Senators and Representatives who have j charge of the Republican record-making j for ,ta& session, are actively plotting and ; working to find ways and means of dodging this taynamitic question. j Yet it is to be our privilege to see the j Republican State platform makers and con- 1 veaWolis,make up, as far as they can, for j whatever, omissions may be managed by their friends 4n Congress, by causing the air j lo tremble with denunciations of trusts and monopolies, and by pointing with pride to the Supreme Court decision in the Ad- j dyston Pipe case. The Administration theory is that if the platforms and resolu tions of the party are only loud and savage j enough the raaEs of voters will not notice wha goes on. or does not. on Capitol Hili;- AVew men like Senator Morgan realize the opening which the divergence between Republican pretension and Republican purpose offers to the Democratic minority; adwe" "hope it may be generally recog nised and utilized. If the majority is sin cere it will not attempt to obstruct or gag suelr reasonable legislation as that pro posed in the Morgan resolution. If it is not sincere then its course and actions will makehat dear in spite of parliamentary tactics in the Senate, and the suppression of free speech in the House. ',Jij Democratic party has seemed to be badly in want of an issue. Here is one upon which it can score handsomely be tween .aagK Mad next summer, and with whidh, upon the strength of its Congres sional record, go before toe country with some degree of confidence. Under the wise leadership of Senator Morgan and Repre sentative Richardson, perhaps a great deal may be done in connection with the gold and bank slavery legislation proposed by the Hanna syndicate machine; but the trust question should not be neglected even for so good a purpose as the exposure of Re publican designs on the money of the peo- I'pie. Possibly there may be Democrats even in Congress who have not yet fully absorbed "and digested the bitter lesson read to ahem in the results of the November elec tion; and who still may hug the old anti imperial delusion which is responsible for ihe precarious position of Democracy before the American people today. Filipino and territorial contraction Democrats, if any have survived, will have every encourage ment and temptation offered to them by the Republicans to carry on the fight on such' issues as Aguinaldo's independence Bd-tbssurreadr of American possessions. Just that kind of opposition is what Mr. Hanna, Mr. McKinley, and the like are hop ing and praying for. It would give them the whole country, and blind its eyes to tally to trust oppression and threatened national servitude to the dealers in credit money. Today the most vulnerable point in the Republican armor has trust robbery writ ten all around it. That is the place at which to thrust the Democratic spear. An JiiiercstliiK' Decision. .Sl-SOtnewhat celebrated case, decided by the United States Supreme Court on Mon day; MrC Justice Harlan delivering the pplnionc,,. Is deserving of more than pass ing notice on the occasion of its final dis position. In one way or another the La Abra .mine claim has been before the Government and the courts for many years perhaps twenty or more. The case has a peculiar interest at a time when we are paying close attention to foreign lelations', and analyzing professions of friendship and geod faith toward us oa the part of foreign powers. The reason being that the history of the 1a- -Abra. claim from its inception to taoMiaal act of the Suprame Court deserves to be always remembered in evi dence of the loyalty and hlghmindedness of the Mexican Government in its observ ance of, an international engagement which it had every temptation and vouldlavo bad mucli excuse for Ignoring and dc- 1 nowncing, ueruuu .rimeriuans .cianiicu luhi tney ac quired a property In Mexico known as tho La Abra mine, which they occupied and attempted to work, "but were driven away from It and out of the country by the Mexican -citizens of the district These exiles appealed to the United States Gov ernment for redress. The matter, with other American claims, was presented to the Mexican Government. Finally, as one of a number of claims of Americans against Mexico, and of Mexicans against the United States, it was referred by virtue of a convention to arbitration. A com mission consisting of ono American, ono Mexican, and Sir Edward Thornton, Brit 4sh Minister at Washington, heard and passed oir'-all the claims presented to It, and, among other things, found that tho Republic of Mexico was liable to the La Abra claimants -for a very large sum of money, for the loss and destruction of their property and for damages. Mexico accepted the award and proceeded to pay into ouxv Treasury tho amount amerced against her; in Installments. After sev eral pay'inents had been made, the Gov ernment of President Diaz, acknowledging and recognizing the award of tho tribunal as final and binding, represented io our authorities that it had discovered evidence that the La Abra claim was unjust and fraudulent; and rested upon the American sense of justice and fair play for relief. Nevertheless. Mexico continued to pay as agreed, and finally made full satisfaction of the award. After much delay and discussion a meas ure was finally passed by Congress au thorizing the Court of Claims to consider the questiou of fraud in the La Abra case, with right of appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The matter came before the Court of Claims accordingly. It de cided that the La Abra claimants had never had a tenable cause of action against Mexico. The claimants appealed to the Supreme Court with the result that it confirmed the decision of the Court of Claims and directed the return of the money or so much of it as remains to (he Mexican Government. Part of the Tund had been distributed before evidence of fraud was secured, and that portion Mexico will unfortunately have to lose. The point of interest in all the foregoing is the upright conduct of the neighboring and sister Republic, in continuing to pay over important sums of money which she knew to have been exacted from her wrongfully. Mexico's confident reliance upon our honor to correct the mistake and remedy the Injustice done her, was an in ternational compliment, the delicacy and generosity of which should not be for gotten either by our Government or our people. The impertinent proposition that the American Government extend its sympathy to the Boers in their conflict with England will doubtless meet the painless death ! i,of ,..i. . t. ...!! that overtakes such measures in the Jutli- I cial atmosphere of the committee room. i JUium uiavusaui the merits or de merits of such a resolution, it would be a melodramatic absurdity, a piece of im politic nonsense, for an intelligent law making body to even vote upon such a proposal after the strictly neutral attitude of tho nation has been declared. If the pyrotechnical Western Senator feels that he must do something in the commiserating line, he might draw up a series of pre ambles and resolutions expressing Con giessional sympathy for the inoffensive citizens who are almost daily held up and maltreated in the .precincts of the Windy City. Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio declared in the House yesterday that two-thirds of the Republican --campaign fund of 1S9G were used in printing and distributing literature Think of it' Nine million, thres hundred and thirty-three thousand, two hundred dollars for "soft stuff" and postage. With interest and excitement we must ask, which was the happy paper mill, and who was the printer? And' how was the sum dHided? What Philadelphia lacks in rapidity it makes up in modesty. The Quaker team organized to secure .the next Republican National Convention for its city came to Washington yesterday, and with character istic diffidence at once struck President McKinley to use his influence in its behalf. After that we shall confidently expect to hear that Mr. Quay has demanded two seats in the Senate one for himself and one for the plum tree. Fresh petitions are coming from Porto Rico, begging the United States to release the island from its present deplorable, posi tion as a "xeooncentrado" possession. It is American, yet Is without status. It is loyal, yet treated as an alien enemy. Its trade has been suppressed for no crime on its part; but only for tho greater glory of Dingleyism, It hopes and prays for mercy, and Congress ought to extend it and not wait until after the holidays, either. The Boer report that Waschbank Bridge has been damaged may possibly mean that Sir Redvers Buller has sent a di vision around, to the east of Colenso by the Helpmaakar Road to attack Joubcrt's rear. Some movement of that kind was rea sonably to be expected. If feasible, it would be a jiatirraLjQne.and one likely to demoralize the Boer plan of defence on the Tugela line." But, ft it has been exe cuted it is queer that some more definite hint has not crept out by way of Pretoria. "William Dean Howells laiu his working career as a flwirinill hand." ISoaton Transcript. And concludes it as the greatest literary bore in America. Although General Buller is not likely to reach Pretoria in time to eat his Christmas dinner at the Boer capital, the elusive Aguinaldo may nf&uhge to" double on his tracks and reach Manila in time to hang his stocking on the gates of the Otis palace. Pettigrew desires to know if this coun try ever saluted the "flag of the Philip pine Republic?" It has done to, but only on the occasions when the presiding officer .has recognized "the Senator from South Dakota." Cat Overstreet Leaps From the Ite pultliean IlaK. (I'rom the New York .Sun.) In his speech in the, House of ltcprescntatives, yesterday, on the currency bill, Mr. Overstreet of Indiana, the introducer of the bill, said tliat the Secretary of the Trcajury, "'by a single order directing the ue of silver in the discharge of our obligations, may completely destroy the parity, and shift the standard to the metal so usied." ' This is sheer nonsense. The Secretary of the Treasury has no more tower to uie the metal iler in the discharge of our obligations than he has to use the metal gold He can use only gold coin or siher coin. Gold coin is, indeed, north as currency uo mo-re than the gold it con tains, because any owner of gold can, at pleasure, hae it converted into-coiu-in unlimited quantities free of charge, but the case is quite different with silver. Silver dollars pass current as equal to gold dollars to the number of 450,000,000, al though the metal of which they are composed is equal in value to only about 40 cents in gold, for the reason that the coinage of them is a Government monopoly, and is not open to the public Nothing but unlimited free, silver coinage can reduce the value of the silver dollars to their value as metal, and Mr. Overstreet betrays on tlte subject an ignorance of fact and of law, which in a leader in Congress is ludicrous, not to say disgraceful. Tlie Itluhts of the IV-oiile. (Prom the St. Paul Dispatch.) There is an inherent feeling in the people that their right of partieiiation in the councils of the party must not le curtailed, and when they find a disposition among the leaders to ignore them it is the signal for an uprising sometimes bois terous, like tliat in Kentucky, but more generally Mlent and well maintained to crush the leaders and establish a new order of tilings. 3Ir. lticlMirdxon. (From the Cincinnati Enquirer.) He is the ablest parliamentarian in the House. The same might have been said of him in the last Ilouse. He knew more about parliamentary law and practice and was a better presiding of ficer than Thomas It. Iteed or any other man in the body on cither side. 

POLITICAL NOTES AND GOSSIP. A Modest Member. When the mem bers call on Speaker Henderson and begin to talk committee places the Speaker gen erally hands them a piece of paper, saying: "I am very busy now; just think over the committees you want to serve on, write out the names, and leave it with me later." This pleases tho member, who takes the hint and next day he hands in the paper containing the names of a few committees. According to a story circulated at the Capi tol yesterday, one of the members of the Illinois delegation, who resembles n Span iard, and has been taken for a Cuban Commissioner, handed Mr. Henderson a list of committees that caused the Speaker to gasp for breath. The member was very modest in his request, naming the follow ing committees he desired to serve on: Appropriations, Ways and Means, Judicia ry. Foreign Affairs, Banking and Currency, District of Columbia, Insular Affairs, Naval Affairs, Military Affairs, Postofiices and Postroads, Rivers and Harbors, Pacific Railroads, Interstate and Foreign Com merce, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, In dian Affairs, and Public Buildings and Grounds. ' When the Speaker recovered he is report ed to have remarked: "Is this all? I think you had better name a few more commit tees." The LalJi- 13rle limn Project. Rep resentative Corliss of Michigan is exert ing himself in the Interest of a bill which provides for the construction of a dam at the foot of Lake Erie or in the Niagara River, by means of whicli it is hoped to control the level of the lake. The bill has Deen Prepared arter consultation wun a number of prominent engineers who have ,,,, th nlnn nnd "ho sav that the proposed dam will deepen all the harbors j in Lake Erie. The subject has been in vestigated and approved also by the Deep Waterway Commission. Large appropria tions have been made for dredging the harbors of Gleveland, Toledo, and Buffalo, It Is believed that the dam will save a vast amount of dredging. An Interested Audience. A good story is being told on Gen. R. B. Kennedy, who was Chairman of the Insular Com mission. The scene of the story is laid in Porto Rico. It is said that the general is fond of making speeches. While in Porto Ricp he mounted a platform before i. vast audience. At his side stood an interpreter. The understanding was that when the orator would conclude a sen tence the interpreter would tell the audi ence what it was all about. But it is said General Kennedy forgot the inter preter and spoke for an hour and r half. There were but two persons in the audi ence who understood English General Kennedy and the interpreter. Attorneys' Liens. Representative Moon of Tennessee has evolved a bill to orovide liens in favor of attorneys at law in original and removed causes to the United States courts, and to provide for the enforcement of these lipns. Mr. Moon is a practicing lawyer, having been ad mitted to the bar in Alabama and Tennes see in 1874. and to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1878. He was attor ney for the city of Chattanooga in 1SS1-S2, He seeks to have it enacted into law that tho attorney's lien In the cases in dicated shall have priority over all other liens except those for taxes. Mr. Moon will also seek to secure the passage of a bill to restrict the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence so as to permit persons guilty of negligence which Is not the proximate cause of an injury to persons or property, to recover damages. The Democratic utionnI Conven tion. As the time for holding the Demo cratic National Convention has nqtbeen fixed, the question is naturally open for discussion, and is being discussed with i vigor by Democrats in all sections of the country. lany letters have reached poli ticians in Washington on this subject. The opinions expressed vary widely, but each adviser seems positive that public senti ment is unanimously in accord, with his views. A Nebraska politician has written that there is a cyclonic wave of popular senti ment in tha State in favor of postponing the national convention until thirty days prior to thePresidential election. A Dem ocrat from the East gives the unanimous opinion in his section as favoring an early convention, and mentions an early date in March as the best time. The powers that "have the deciding of this matter in thein'hands the members of the Democratic "National Committee are non committal on the subject. As yet Chair man Janes has Issued no call for a meeting of that committee. It is expected, how ever, that this call will be forthcoming in the near future. Snlzcr'.s Sweater Tax Hill. Repre sentative Sulzer of New York has a bill the avowed purpose of which is to raise additional revenue for the support of the Government, but which is aimed really at the "sweater system." Mr. Sulzer would have it a law that every person or cor poration engaged in the manufacture of shirtfc, skirts, neckwear, cloaks, coats, vests, trousers, underwear, cigarettes, ci gars, furs, or fur trimmings who shall let out the goods to be made In rooms or build ings occupied for domestic purposes shall pay a tax of 300 a year for each person en gaged to work under such conditions. Chief Clerli of the Document lloom. The first and most important appointment made by Doorkeeper Glenn, of the House of Representatives, since the organization of the House took place yesterday, when Mr. Babcock of Wisconsin, who is slated for Chairman of the District Committee, cap tured the prize for his district. In point of fact, Mr. Babcock secured two appoint ments. J. B. Walker resigned the chief clerkship of the Document Room to ac cept the position of special agent of rural free delivery, Posiouice Department, re cently held by Henry Casson, the newly elected Sergeant-at-Arms of the House. The place made vacant by Walker's resig nation, which pays ?1. 100 per ifunum, was filled by the appointment of J. B. Brunnel, one of Mr. Babcock's constituents. Thus does the Badger statesman draw first blood in the distribution of the spoils. More changes under the Doorkeeper are expected this week. The House Librarian. The story was current yesterday that a change may be looked for any day this week in the office of House librarian, now held by C. B. Brockway, of New York. Tho Republican members of the Ohio delegation are hot after the place. They are urging the ap pointment of Guy Underwood, of London, In. that State. Mr. Underwood, for the past three Congresses has been on the laborers' roll of the House, detailed for duty in the library, where it is said he made himself very useful. Mr. Boclcway's sponsor. Representative W. B. Hooker of New York one or the prime organizers of the "hog combine" in the Fifty-fourth Congress, is now on the bench in New York, and this, it is asserted, explains why he will have to make way for some one with a stronger pull. The position conies under the Clerk of the House, tfco is reputed to think well of the Ohio. delegation. a . Knlr Ilay lit lventticUy. (Prom' the Boston Globe.) Prophecies have been made without number that the Democratic election commissioners would count In Gocjjel. ,- Now we see they have done nothing of tire kind, but on the contrary, have refined to take advantage of their Republican opponent's in"1an Selection so elos as to have afforded thenl many opportunities for giving tho certificates to their own party. All who iiave demanded fair play of the -commissioners should be really mw to applaud the fair play which they have displa3-ed in the face of great tcmjitatioc SILVER AT THE CAPITOL. Several AVhlte Mernl aicnstirex In troduced in Cmt&rrenN. While the gold bill of the Republicans occupies-the attention of the House of Rep resentatives, silver coinage measures con tinue to be introduced In both branches of Congress. Mr. Bell of Colorado has introduced in the House a bill "to restore the bimetallic system or the United States, and for other purposes." Mr. Bell's bill, which was referred to the Cemmittoe on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, provides that the silver dollar of 371 1-4 grains troy of pure silver or 412 1-2 grains silver, and the gold dollar as now authorized by law, shall be the unit of ac count or value, and the standard silver dollar. In like manner as the gold dollar, shall be a legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private; that all holders of silver or gold not too base for the opera tions of the mint, of the coinage value of $100 or more, shall be entitled to deposit the same at the mints of tho United States and to have the same coined into standard legal-tender gold and silver coins. It is further recited that depositors of gold or silver at any mint of the United Statis may receive therefor coin notes equal to the coining value of the gold or silver deposited, and the gold and silver so de posited shall become the property of the Government and shall be subsequently coined Into any of the authorized standard legal-tender coins of the United States, and f the coin held in the Treasury for the re demption of the coin notes issued therefor; that the coin notes shall be of denomina tions or not less than 5 and not to exceed ?1,000, and shall be legal tender in like manner as the standard gold and silver coins of the United States. Senator Pettigrew has introduced in the Senate a bill, which has been referred to the Committee on Finance, to restore the ! Inno-o ,.f oI1.. ,111 1, U,.l that 7iT i7J r ,h ' it-u-h cT-r. Vh-ii be open to the coinage of silver, and there j shall be coined dollars of the weight of 112 1-2 troy, of standard silver, nine- u rr01", ,, tuc -..- uary 18, ISSi. and upon the same terms and subject to the limitations and provisions of law regulating the coinage .and legal- tender quality of gold, and whenever these coins shall be received into the Treasury. certificates may be issued therefor in the mannern,ow Pvueu, b' law- a , Mr. Bell of Colorado has introduced a bill directing that the Secretary of the Treasury shall be required to cause to be paid out standard silver coin the same as gold .coin, and without discrimination against either form of money. Under the provisions of the bill It shnll not be discretionary with the Secretary of the Treasury to determine "the financial policy of the Government in tho paying of its' obligations, otherwise than is pro vided by the contract, and he shall pay the obligations of the Government in any kind of legal-tender money that is most convenient to the Government, unless otherwise especially provided. Among the other silver bills in commit tee are: By Mr. Shafroth, to coin gold and silver bullion on equal terms; by Mr. Mc Rae, for the free coinage of gold and silver and for the issue of gold and silver certi ficates. IN MEMORY OF GARCIA. Annhcrarr of the Cuban General's Ilea tit Oliserveil In Havana. HAVANA, Dec. 12. At a meeting today to commemorate the death of Gen. Ca lixto Garcia, General Hernandes said that Garcia was one of those great Cubans to be classed with Maceo and Marti. He had saved at Santiago the honor of the Cuban people, which was so much majigned by the Spaniards. In regard to the Spanish flag he sold it was impossible for Cubans to forget the signification of the colors of those Spanish guerrillas who were so greedy for Cuban blood. General Ludlow has written to Senor Sagraria, the Spanish Consul General, In regard to newspaper articles, saying that the widows asylum is private property and therefore should not be treated as a Gov ernment building by the Americans. Gen eral Ludlow says he has discovered that the asylum was built with Government money and tisks Senor Sagrario if he has any doc uments to prove the contrary to kindly fur nish them. General Ludlow believes that the building was not mentioned in .the offi cial list of buildings handed over to the Americans by the Spaniards, owing to a possible oversight. The municipality of Pinar del Rio has pe titioned the Secretary of War in Washing ton to send aid to the people, as they are without means to cultivate the land. A circular has been sent to all the judges and fiscals in the island, ordering that in the future any attempt at lynching or mur der by an individual or a crowd will be severely punished. "La Lucha" says that Governor-General Brooke owes his removal to the confidence placed by him in the ill-advised policy ot Secretaries Lanuza and Capote, which pol icy has been out of harmony with the de sires ot the Cuban people. Collapse of I inliiKt rials. (From the Philadelphia Keeord.) Promoters ami professional manipulators hac SHCceeded in unloading upon weak investors a great anety of industrial stock?, nearly all of them having some merit, ,lmt vuterwl to the limit. Whenever there i-s a little pressure upon the part of monev lenders these tocks collapse by sinking to something near their actual value. Weak investors are shaken out; thsn ensues a season of recovery and recuperation, and in due time the game is plajed over again. It- is a trross abw-e of terms to call the collapses in speculative values at-tuul los.es. They arc a mere letting out of wind a beneficial process of relieving the flatulency of tlie mar kets by enforced liquidations, with results which are advantageous to legitimate business. Admiral Cervera. (Prom the Atlanta Journal.) Cervera'ri ability .is a naval commander was dimiotwtruled in. a striking manner when lie hue teeded in eluding the large fleet which our Government expected to intercept him and had anchored in ?antingo harbor before Admiral Samp son or any of the otiicers under him Knew that he waa even near that point. The developments of the Official enquirj in Spain as to the conduct of tho war lias brought out information which pliow-i bow far superior (fervent is to the men who were above him in authority, whose orders he had to obej and of whose stupidity he was the victim. The Subsidy Bill. (From the Philadelphia Ledger.) It has every semblance of being a raid on the Federal revenues to be continued for at least twenty years, eieii if Congress should repeal the act at the session following that at which it shall have leen enacted, it involves legiskv tion for tho lieneflt of a class at the expense of the general body of citizens, and for no neces sary or justifiable public purpose. Such a scheme sliould find no defenders outside of the compara tive few who expect to gain profit by it. The Overhanging: Fear, (From the llouaton Post.) However gratifying to the gold standard de votees the unqualified determination of the Re publican Administration to establish and main tain the iingle gold standard may be, they can not escape the fatal criticism that a serious and dangerous diminution of the currency volume is thereby inevitable created, against which the pro posed currency legislation has not presented a solitary safegnaid. The Sniircinc Court. (From the 'Richmond Dhmaich.) There is no question about the fact, however, that our Supreme Court justices are greatly un derpaid. In Washington they occupy a high social and official station, and it is hardly prob able that they can live in booming style on the incomes they receive. Congress, at least, could not make a serious mistake in increasing the emoluments of their office. A REGEPTION TO DELEGATES. The Gittherinf? of the AVashlnRtou 3Iemnrinl Association.

JLEGAUZE POOLING. A New Interstate Commerce Commis sion Hill Introduced. Senator Cullom, Chairman of the Com mittee on Interstate Cooimsrce, yesterday introduced in the Senate a bill to Increase the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission and to legalise pooling or joint traffic agreements between railroads. The bill provides for the "formation of joint traffic associations under the control of the Interstate -Commerce Commission, all agreements as to rates and conditions be ing subject to its approval. It prohibits, under penalty of $10,W0 line, any rebate to shippers on the agreed rates or the granting of any special privileges in receiving, stor ing, or handling freight. It also provides for a national freight classification by the Interstate Commerce Commission which is to be binding upon all interstate carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce act. Penalties of $5,000 for violations of the rates so fixed are provided, each day to be deemed a separate offence, the fines to be covered into the United States Treasury. In onbar to enforce the through rates upon the roads which are partly in the 'United States and partly in Canada it is provided that they must maintain the rates agreed upon or else the freight shipped from the United States and thence through Canadian territory into the United States shall be subject to customs dues like freight of foreign production. The bill gives the "Interstate Comerce Commission power to award damages to complainants and enforce its decision, and its powers are further augmented as follows: To fix a maximum rate covering the en tire cost of the service; to fix both a maxi mum and minimum rate or differentials in rates that may be necessary to prevent dis crimination; to determine the division be tween carriers of a joint rate and, the terms and conditions under which business shall be interchanged when that is necessary to an execution of the provisions of this act; to make changes in the classification, aad to so amend the rules aad "regulations un der which traffic moves as to bring them in conformity with the provisions of this act. Consul I'rntt Kxjilnlns. (To the Editor of the .e York Evening Post.) Sir: Believing in the principle of govern ment of the people for the people and by the people, I can but sympathize with the Filipinos In their present struggle. At the same time I must refute the assertion, so often repeated, that it was I who, by Dromises made to Aguinaldo, inspired the Filipinos with the hope that independence would be accorded them, and that I am therefore primarily responsible for the de plorable state of affairs now existing. Whatever my personal feelings in the matter. I had been too long m the service and had too keen an appreciation of my duties as a Government agent to allow such feelings to influence me in my official dealings. My action with regard to Aguinaldo was limited to obtaining such. Information as he was able to furnish concerning the situation in and about Manila, enjoining him against allowing his people to eon duct hostilities except in accordance with the principles of civilised warfare, and upon learning that he was ready anil will ing to confer with Admiral, then Commo dore. Dewey with a view to co-operation, communicating this to the commodore, in compliance with whose request Aguinaldo proceeded to Hongkong, being thence taken in an American Government vessel to Cavite. It will be seen, therefore, that I did not act of my own accord in the matter, but in response to instructions from superior quarters. I entered into no agreement with Aguin aldo nor did I make any promises. Let the responsibility for what has oc curred accordingly rest where it" belongs, and the American public understand that the present conflict in the Philippines arose from the misunderstanding engen dered by the vacillating policy, or rather want of policy, so Ions displayed by the Administration nnd theaetioa ot the rep resentatives of American authority on the spot in furnishing the Filipinos with the means of prosecuting the war against the common enemy, from which they very naturally assumed that we considered them, if not actually allies, at least aux iliaries. Did our Government, I ask, act squarely by the Filipinos from the start, and in form them then that they had nothing to expect from us but "benevolent assimila tion?" E.

"Ptek University, made famous arl o.rec the world as the origin of the jub:!eo singers, wilt furnish a complete - ot bound volumes of written, work of the en tire institution, through watch will bo scattered large numbers ot photograph, making each volume an illustrated book "The Washington colored pubth: schools are preparing, however, what wiU b- the most attractive feature of alL It a to be a series of modeled groups, with minia ture figures of persons, school bouses, aad surroundings, showing by three or four groups, the evolution of the negro school bouse from the most primitive backwoods hut to the finely appointed aad eawnvo.iiooB colored high school building in Wa-fc-ington. As a dramatic tableau represonca tion in school equipment, I predict for it great attention. "There are more than a doxen other phases of this exhibit already under way, but one other in conclusion. Nearly fifty colored men have received medals of honor in the United States Army and. Xanry. Photographs of these men, with the e3 cial record of the valorous deed for which the medal was granted will be displayed. "The success of the exhibit thus far is due to the warm encouragement of Presi dent McKinley and Commissioaer General Peck. Although Mr. Peek received from Congress nearly $2ap.Mi less than ate schedule called for. and while there wa no provistoB in this schedule for this negro exhibit, he has undertaken to pro vide from a small contingent toad far this new feature. The colored people them selves are attempting to supplement Mr. Peck's generosity with their own. means and bv various devices, with perhaps seme miracles we nope to pull through, aad fol nll the prediction of Assistant Commis sioner General Woodward, given te pub lic interview in Paris, and printed hi thia country December 2. It is as follows: " 'There is much talk in Paris as to what will be the chief attraction of the exhibi tion. It will be the educational work that is being done for our negroes. I think this exhibition will show other nnUoaa that we know bow to solve the negro problem upon intelligent, civilised lines. Some foreigners, think we have nothing for the aegm hat the bludgeon and revolver. We shaR con vince them otherwise.' "There are three strong reaaoas for a negro exhibit at the Paris Sxposhna next year. The first reason is a general see aad is found in the peculiar attitude la which. Europe is now situated. The 'Fas bode In cident' aad the present Boer war art only the outcroppings of a uemendomT 3u ropeaa invasion el Africa. This Dark, Ceo tinent is no longer dark, as the most gigantic efforts of capital are being direct ed toward opening up the continent tor the overplus population of Europe. The mil lions of native Africans in the contiaont, who must in some way be assimilated into the body politic will more and mora fcroa upon the statesmen of Europe and VfricK the same negro problem, which this coun try has struggled with for three centuns. Whatever faults may be charged to the people of the United States the people of African descent in this country are civil ised, christianised, possessors of vast ?lu cational privileges, and owners of perhaps a half billion dollars' worth of property. They are engaged in every industry aad ptTsuit common to white Americans, .itsd, universally accredited with rapid proqese. America can. therefore, furnish Europe with such evidences of the negro's &'no as a laborer, a producer, and a c-.tizen that the statecraft -of the Old World will be wiser in the shaping of its African poii aj. "A second reason for the exbiau lies is the faet that much criticism of the Tailed States is indulged in abroad oa the gionad that this country has assumed to Annex sew territory largely populased with dark races, when, it is charged, this nation pro scribes in every possible way the a.W,- 000 of such people in its own borders. This exhibit can shew other awttons the other side of the story and can furnxah evidence of marvelous progress of the colored peo ple, as an offset to the charg.ojt pro scription. While the United States mast plead guilty to horrible lynching occas ionally and many forms of prejmttBsv we can more than balance these fasHfk wkh the rapid development in education aad in dustry of ld.ftov.MO of former staves, who. in the space ot thirty-five years, have pro duced an item of 30,601 teaches, to say nothing of a hundred other sccupadeas re quiring training. "The right of the colored people to have occasional opportunities to show fat a dis tinctive way the evidences ot tluitr pro gress, furnishes tha third reaseat$tor such an exhibit. The average Americas cHisea never stops to consider that practically every cotton fabric he wears ht a product of negro labor so far as the zaw mmartal is concerned. So scattered i the negro and so varied his industry, that ft is only by such exhibits that the negro caa prove his value te the body politic. ataay Southern white people, who have lived all their lives in regions thickly popoiate-i with negroes were amaxed at the negro ex hibits at Atlanta and Nashville, Those expositions havo opeaed up several fac tories for negro labor and have crystal lised a strong sentiment te assay parts favoring him as an operative."
