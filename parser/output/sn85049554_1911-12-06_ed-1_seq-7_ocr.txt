III Order to Press rv# Polities! I MUM ftp Future Um Net to Bf Per- mHM-*S«yi Country Wants Leg islation. j-.. jsn (Special Correspondence]. Washington. Dee. 5.—Speaker Champ Clark, who came to town the other day, fresh from tour of nineteen •tats* where he talked and was talk ed to, where he felt the public pulse and made careful diagnosis of the pub llo's symptoms, is calling in the dem ocratic members of congress and telling them they must not think they are go ing to lire la idleness this session. He Is telling them that It Is up to them to do things and to get legislation. In other words, Speaker Clark is mighty impatient over the talk that this Is going to be a do-nothing ses sion*" He Is saying to the rest of the house democrats that this Is all non sense and and that the democrats must see to It that this shall prove to be ajesslon of achievement. Sffoaker Clark has heard the boys talking about the house corridors and in the rooms over In the office building that It will be fine business to put up a great show of doing things but to manipulate matters carefully so as to embarrass the republicans and put the administration in a hole regardless of whether the public gets any of the legislation it wants. In fact, he has heard It whispered about that It would be clever polftics to take care to leave the chief issues over until: the 1912 campaign is fought out. "liet's not get rid of these issues," some of the democrats are talking. "We can win the election on them." Clark's lr« Stirred. All Such talk has stirred the ire and wrath of Speaker Clark. He is saying In effect that he will not stand for any such program. He accounts the so called position that dictates such poli cies as the one outlined to belong to the stone age. "Boys, the best politics is not to play politic," is the axiom which the speaker is laying down to the demo cratic members. A lot of democratic talk is being in dulged in about not doing things be cause If they are done the administra tion Or the insurgents or some other factor In the situation will get the credit. "Go ahead and legislate for the relief of the republic without reference to who gets the credit," is the effect, of the counsel th'eSp^aker is dealing out to the brethren' In large, allopathic doses. Ceuntry Wants Legislation. Speaker Clark's view, as he Is ex pressing It' to the democrats to whom he talks Is that the country has its mind made up definitely that it wants legislation that will relieve it from legislation ii.at win relieve it irom some of the things from which it now thAt Inn" I In th^ Intt^rt^If thp ^nhltr A«j? in the interest of the public and do, their utmost to bring such legislation about, the speaker hasn't much doubt they will get credit for it. But he is pretty sure that if the democrats put themselves In the attitude of merely playing politics for the sake of em barrassing the administration or the republicans, the country will not stand for it. This news of the attitude of Speak er Clark which got out today is one of the most important developments of the legislative situation at the open ing of congress. The speaker intends to do his utmost to bring about legis lation and there Is not much doubt that the advice he gives will have much weight. That there will be op position to his counsel goes without saying but the chances are he will largely have his way, because he has strong support in his position. Much May Be Accomplished. The result of this attitude on the part of the speaker, it Is not unlikely, will be to make the session one In which much more will be accomplish ed than Is generally supposed. For one thing it Is likely to profoundly to affect the course of tariff legislation. It Is understood that Speaker Clark Is not going to be stickler for passing tar iff bills that will be on strictly demo cratic lines and that if he finds that combinations have to be made with in surgents he will advise making them If there Is no other way to get bills thru. He is going to insist from the very day the session opens that the country expects this session to do things and for his part he proposes to try to live up to that expectation, let ting the chips of credit fall where they wUL Incidentally, sagacious politicians, peroelve that persistence hvspch a polr icy, if sufficiently aggressive, is likely to please a large share of the popu lace mightily. It may even result in landing Champ In the White JttSijija. 'J'"- Trssr News Notes. Special to Times-Republican.

A HALF OOZEN BILLS TO COME BEFORC HOUSE Cummins Hss Ons All Bendy For Pre sentstion to Senate—Constitutional Phasss of QuMtion to Be Empha sised—Big Polities Lurks Baok of Forthooming Contest Over Primary. [Special Correspondence.] Washington, Dec. 6.—Congress is go ing to get into a seething mass of dis cussion before long over the question of passing a presidential primary law or some sort of a law making It pos sible for voters to express their pref erences on the question of presidential nominations. The presidential preference question is looming large before congreM al ready. Bills on the subject are begin ning to pour in. Senator Cummins has prepared a bill on which he has been working for some time. In the houses there ace about a half dozen of them. One of the first which was prepared was by Hobaon, of Alabama. Close on the heels of the introduction of these bills there will come a flood of talk about the constitutional phases of the question. It Is possible to do some close splitting of hairs on the point whether the federal government can say how nominations shall be made for president. Senator Cummins is convinced that there is room for such legislation under the constitution. Senator Bailey is convinced otherwise. And the constitutional lawyers show all the symptoms of getting busy with this inviting bone of contention which may occupy them, especially In the senate, a goodly share of the winter.

On the one hiM). the friends of Presi dent Taft anajtn^ backers of Governor Judson Harm&i are not hankering for direct nominations.. On the other hand, the friends of IrsiiYrtlette and the sup porters of Woodrow Wilson are eager for them. Senator LaFollette and his friends are oonvlnced they oould beat President Taft for renominatlon In a popular primary. Governor Wllaon's friends are oonvlnced he oould walk away with the nomination if he had a chance for the support of the demo cratic voters with the democratic ma chines left out of consideration. It Is possible to predict with perfect safety that there is not likely to be any legislation on tho subject of a presi dential primary at this seMion. The constitutional lawyers who are not anxious to see Wilson nominated and those who want President Taft re nominated are likely to find a way of stretching out the discussion until well along toward the national conventions and until the most of the atates have picked their delegates.
