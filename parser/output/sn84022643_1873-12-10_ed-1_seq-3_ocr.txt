DEEP. December 8th, 1873, in Dalles City, Wasco county, Oregon, COLON T. Finlatson, of consumption, in his 33d year. Colon T. Finlayson was born in Dunblane, Perthshire, Scotland, Janu ary 7th, 1841. At tlie early age of three months, his parents removed from Scotland to tlie United States, settling in Indiana, where they resided for twelve years, when they moved to Oregon, settling in I. inn county. As a boy, Colon was known among his young acquaintances as a genius. He finished his education at the Salem University, graduating with high hon ors.. He afterward filled the Chair of Mathematics at tlie Albany Collegiate Institute, giving the fullest satisfaction. In the science of mathematics h e had few equals. A pamphlet published by him a few years ago, entitled the "True Philosophy of the Tides," gained for him a wide reputation, both in the United States and the Old World attracting the attention of the first scientists of both countries. In later years, as an Inventor, he projected a "Submerged Wheel" for propelling ocean and river steamers, which is thought, by competent judges who have examined the invention, will rev olutionize, eventually, the system of propelling boats. In the death of Colon Finlayson the world loses one of its brightest intellects. Some two years since, while residing in Califor nia, deceased lost a loving wife by tlie same disease which has at last taken him from among us. He leaves two children and a large circle of friends to mourn his loss. Peace to his ashes. Sleighing Is what's the matter in Portland.

Evidently they have been having cold weather up there. The Lower Columbia is re ported full of floating ice, seriously impeding navigation. Wheat quotations in Portland give $1 95-2 05 $ cental tlie latter only offered for large lots to be delivered immediately. Our latest advices from Liverpol quote the wheat market at 13s 2di313s 4d for average, and 13s 4d13s 6d for club. A dispatch from Halifax, dated De cember 6th, says the missing steamer Picton is supposed to have been burned at sea, and all hands perished.

The Democrats claim Texas by 40, 000 majority. A man at Trenton, who found sev eral thousand dollars over two years ago, and lias advertised it every day since that time, gets great credit for his honesty. Any man would have quit looking for an owner long ago ; yet this Trenton man keeps on adver tising. But he owns the paper in which it is advertised, and pays at full rates out of the money tuna. After three years more of advertising the whole amount will have been absorbed. They have a very smart business man In New Jersey. Last week a young man was struck by lightning in a field near Trenton, and when the people began to flock to tlie spot to look at the victim, they found a man standing by the corpse trying to sell lightning rods to the cro I.

Bismarck says he wants to get rid of all the fools in be army, therefore he encourages dating. Una C A correspondent of the Oregonian, writing Irom Harrison rg, puts up the shipment of wheat from this county for the present season at about the right figures. He says : The shipment of wheat from Linn county will be greater than many cal culated. Albany will ship at least 550,000 bushels; Tangent, 100,000; Halscy, 105,000; Harrisburg, 188,000; Miller's Station. 15,000; Peoria. 30, 000; making a total ot 1,148.000 bush els. There is as much wheat in the hands of the farmers yet unsold as will bring the surplus for shipment up to 1,200,000 bushels, and the total pro duction of Linn county is fully 1,500, 000 bushels, including what is kept for Imiiie consumption and seed for the coming crop. This will give $1,200. 000 to be distributed among tlie far mers of Linn county tor wheat alone, not taking into account the amount availed for oats, barley, hay, sheep, cattle and tlie other productions of the farm. From every part of Linn county there comes tlie cheering news of plen ty, prosperity and satisfaction as the result of the year's industry and a smiling providence. The same correspondent, in speak ing of the price of land in this county, says: In the southern part of Linn county, farm land is not as good as the Albany prairie nor so well cultivated, and tlie improvements are not so far advanced. This is evident from the difference In the price of land and the production of wheat to the acre. In the Albany prairie land sells at 35 per acre and produces an average of thirty bushels of wheat to the acre. In the south eastern end of the county prairie farms sell from $14 to $20 an acre and raise from eighteen to twenty bushels of wheat to the acre. These are average prices and quantities. There are farms in the Albany prairie that would bring $50 an acre and that produce from forty to fifty bushels to the acre. The best farms in Linn county are capable ot still higher cultivation and increased production. Lands in the foothills. adapted for sheep, can be bought from $4 to $5 an acre, with a considerable free range in tlie Cascade mountains. The farms for sale are held linn at present rates, with a decided tendency upwards. As soon as Oregon has di rect communication with tlie Eastern and Western States by railroad, emi gration will come in nipidly and prices of land will advance in propor tion. More direct communication with Europe by sea will secure a great ly increased demand for the fine wheat and choice flour of the State atenhano ed prices. A Good word is spoken for the Pat rons of Husbandry : Such is the popularity of this organi zation in Linn county, that tlie great majority of the local granges have to hold meetings once a week to initiate members. They are wisely confining the membership to farmers exclusively. If the past is a guarantee tor the good judgement, wise counsels and prudent act ion oi me ini ure, me ratrons oi Husbandry will work a great revolu tion in favor of themselves and the In dustrial classes generally ; when the farmers are prosperous in an agricul tural State like Oregon, all other indus tries are benefited to a great extent. A Towel eor Each. It is not un common, in country houses, for all the members of tlie' family to use tlie same towel for wiping their hands and faces. 1 am often surprised to see how this practice prevails, even among people of considerable cultivation; frequently, the towel is made of .three yards of good crash, sewed together at the ends, and hung over a roller. This seems very generous and nice when it is clean, but not se after it has hung there three or four days, used morning, iioor and night by half-a-dozen persons. We may no able to endure a great deal of our own dirt, when we are obliged to, but it Is not a morbid delicacy that shrinks from us ing a towel soiled by other persons. Each human body gives forth its own peculiar exhalations from every pore of the skin, waste matter, more or less filthy, so it Is not merely tlie impurity derived irom external sources that we wash and wipe away when we perforin our ablutions. It is also this one's dyspepsia, that one's bllllousness, the other one's tobacco ugh! Give me a clean towel, please! And please give every child its own towel and Its own comb as soon as ft Is old enough to use it. I want to add please, O fellow citizen ! give every human being a chance to wash the whole body, pri vately, whenever one wishes to do so, in a comfortable bath-room, with plen ty of hot and cold water, and a good bath-tub, and all the clean towels de sired.
