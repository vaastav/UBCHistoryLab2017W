DEMRED TO SENATOR HOAR TODAY Charges of Anti-Trust League and Knights of Labor. MORE STATEMENTS TO COME The evidence prepared by the joint com inittee of the American Anti-trust League and the Knights of Labor, alleging rea sons which, they claim, should prevent the confirmation of the nomination of Mr. Knox as Attorney General, were today delivered to the Senate committee on the judiciary, through its chairman. Senator Hoar. It will be remembered that Mr. Hoar gave the Joint committee until today in order that it might submit in writing its charges against Mr. Knox. It was ex pected that the committee would be able during the early part of next week to ex amine this evidence and to agree upon a second report to the Senate. which would allow action on the nomination before ad Journment next Thursday for the holiday recess. But the joint committee, in sub mitting its evidence, stated that there would be supplemental evidence, all of which it would probably not be ready to submit to the committee on the judiciary until after the holidays. The Evidence Submitted. The evidence delivered to the Senate com mittee today by Mr. Wm. L. Dewart, secre tary of the Joint committee bringing the charges, was partly in typewriting and partly in printed form, and in bulk suffi cient to make a printed book of about 400 pages. The general charge is made that Mr. Knox has refused and neglected to in stitute proceedings against trusts which have been charged with violating the fed eral statutes. The special corporations named as having violated the federal statutes are the United States Steel Com pany, the armor plate trust, the railway combine, which is the successor to the Joint Traffic Association, commonly known as the official classification committee; the an thracite coal trust and the Standard Oil Company. It also includes the case of George Rice of Marietta, Ohio, against the Standard Oil Company. Does Not Know Steel Trust People. The papers submitted to the committee on the judiciary include a letter written by Attorney General Knox. disclaiming any cor.nection with the formation of the United States Steel Company. This letter was in reply to a communication addressed to him by H. B. Martin, a representative of the league, asking for information regarding the steel trust. Mr. Knox replied In part as follows: "Primarily, permit me to say that your request is founded upon an erroneous as sumption. I do not know who the indi viduals are who organized the United States Steel Corporation. If they are the persons usually named in the newspapers a- the promoters of that organization, with the single exception of Mr. C. M. Schwab, I do not know, never saw and was never in any way connected with any one of them. I never heard of any agreement between them and the constituent members of the teel corporation. Neither at the time of the formation of the United States Steel Corporat!on, nor at any time, was I officially connected with the Carnegie Steel Company. I was for merly one of its legal advisers in the con duct of Its manufacturing business, but Was never consulted with reference to the formation of the United States Steel Com pany, nor in relation to the sale to that company of the shares of stock held by the stockholders of the Carnegie campany. "I have never seen any papers or agree ;nents to which you refer, nor have I been informed of their contents. I have no owledge whatever of their existence. terms, or scope. I am thus specific. as I desire to cover both the spirit and the let ter of your inquiry." The case against the United States Steel Company is set forth at great length, the mature of which, it is claimed, is in viola tion of the Sherman anti-trust law. Other Coimbinations. The armor plate trust, it is claimed. 4onspIred to monopolize trade and com maerce In armor plate and sold to the United States government armor plate Which cost *2?uO per ton for $:-W per ton. It is claimed that the Carnegie company and the Bethlehem company, associated to form the armor plate trust, are combined in violation of law so as to control the United States Steel Company. The same general charges are made against the Standard Oil Company, the railway combine and anthracite coal trust. The case of Mr. George Rice of Mariet ta, Ohio. against the Standard Oil Com pany is recited at great length, and copies of the correspondence of Mr. Rice with the Attorney General are submitted. NORTALlTY IN BOER CAMPS. Pitiful Story Told by the Last British Bime Book. LONDON, December 14.-The delay in the publication of the October a-id November yeturns from the concentration camps, erhich were issued today, was apparently du* to the government's desire to accom pany the announcement of the pitiably high death rate with some kind of official explanation. The blue book issued today shows 3.156 deaths of whites in October, of which number 2,033i were children and 2, 80 deaths of whites in November, of which 2,271 were children. This makes the total munrher of deaths for the last six months 13.941, or a death rate apprnximating 253 per year per thousand. Among the colored persons there were 1,3ti8 deaths in two anenths. The blue book contains the government's plans for breaking up the camps, as re eently outlined in the speeches of the war Secretary, Mr. Brodrick. PR@BENG PESION FRAUDS.

J. J. LENTZ ASSAULTED IN COURT. Former Congressman Pream Ohio in Altercation With a Jfdee. COLUMBUS. Ohio, December 14.-There was a sensatinal scene In Judge Bigger's court yesterday-when Judge D. C. Bdser assaulted former Representative John J. Lentz. The episode was the outgrowth of the appointment of a receiver for the Wolfram Guitar Company by Judge Bad ger. Lentz had, as attorney for Mr. Wolfram, filed an affidavit In Judge Bjger's court, alleging prejudice on the part of Judge Badger and asking Judge Bigger to hear a motion to vacate the receivership. Judge Badger happened Into the court while the matter was being laid before Judge Bigger, and he accused Lents of having misstated the facts. Lentz entered a denial. Judge Badger then assaulted the ex-representative. Lentr made no attempt to retaliate. but told Badger that Inas much as he was a judge he would not strike him. DISCUSSING ENGINEER CORPS. Major S. S. Leach Confers With Gen. Gillespie. Major S. S.

Controversy Upon Which Appeal Was Made to Commissioners. A discussion between neighbors has arisen over the parking fence between premises 1614 and 1616 11th street northwest. The matter was brought to the attention of the Commissioners on complaint of E. W. Key ser of 2108 0 street northwest, who stated that the fence was not only off the dividing line between the two lots but was in a di lapidated condition. The matter was made the subject of in vestigation and report by A. L. Thomas, and the facts were brought out to show that several years ago the fence had been built, as the result of an agreement be tween the two property holders, seven inches from the line. Under the old condi tions, it appears, the fence did not Inter fere with the premises 1614. Now, how ever, a new house has been built, and the fence interferes with the erection of the fence fronting that house. Col. John Biddle, the Engineer Commis sioner. after receiving the above report laid the case before his associates with a motion that the owner of premises 1616 be required to remove the fence to the division line, which was marked by an inspector of the En'gineer Department for the pur pose. "NO RESIGNATION." Secretary Gage Has Had Two Signs Made. "You'll observe that the 'no resignation' sign is on my door today," said Secretary Gage, with a smile, this morning. "I have had two signs made," he con tinued; "one of them says, 'No resignation,' the other 'Resigned." The 'no resigna tion' sign will be on the door until I de cide to leave the Treasury Department. When I do you may expect to see the other." Secretary Gage has been besieged from morning until night during the last few days by newspaper men, who have all re ceived "straight tips" on his resignation. He has been called up by telephone at 3 o'clock in the morning to deny the report. He has reached such a state of mind now that every time he sees a newspaper cor respondent he exclaims: "I have not re signed today." 1-e believes that the sign idea will save him a great deal of trouble. MRS. ROOSEVELT'S RECEPTION. A Long Line of Visitors at the Hour of Commencement. All arrangements were completed at the White House for Mrs. Roosevelt's first pub lic reception from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock this afternoon. Mrs. Roosevelt and those who received with her took positions In the blue room while the line of callers passed in through the red room into the blue room and then out through the green room into the east room. Twenty-five pieces of the Marine Band furnished the music, and the various rooms and the hallways were beau tifully decorated for the occasion. The decorations were simple but most tasty and attractive. The exit was through the im provised door next to the east room. The visitors began to assemble before 3 o'clock and the line was a long one at that hour. REAL ESTATE EXCHANGE. Committee on Plan of Organization Receives Encouragement. The committee appointed at a meeting of real estate brokers to prepare for sub mission to an adjourned meeting, to be held We*dnesday evening next at the Hotel Ba.rton, a plan for an organization of a real estate exchange is receiving a good deal of encouragement.

WHITE HOUSE Many oallers, but Few So the Pensidont. A1BSSADOR MIME 8T E Still Talking About Mr. Carnegie's Git. REQ.U'ESTS FOR OFFICE Two or three prominent men occupied much of the President's time today, and only a part of the large number of callers saw the chief executive. They grew tired of waiting and went away without seeing the President. Ambassador Choate was one of those with the President a good while. Mr. Choate pre. sented his son. The ambassador will leave this country to return to his post on Janu ary 15. Mr. Choate and the President are close, warm friends, and the opinion pre vails that in case of the resignation of Secretary Hay either Mr. Choate or Secretary Root would go to the head of the administration cabinet. Mr. Root is probably closer to the Presi dent than Mr. Choate, but the former might prefer to remain in his present position. A most interesting suggestion has been made that Secretary Hay and Ambassador Choate exchange places, Mr. Hay returning to his old post at the court of St. James. This can be nothing more than a sugges tion, however, as such a trade would de pend upon the desires of both men. Mr. Hay is Known to be indifferent to remain ing in the cabinet, but he might not object to going back to England again. Opposed to the Carnegie Gift. The President continues to ta.* with mem bers of Congress regarding the $10,000,000 gift and to receive their opinions as to the advisability of accepting it. The belief of a maJoritf of those who talk with the President is that the gift cannot be accept ed in its present shape. The opinion is that if the gift is changed to cash or United States bonds from steel corporation bonds the offer will be accepted. Senators Allison and Spooner had a long conference with the President this morning, probably in reference to the Carnegie gift. Statehood for Oklahoma. Delegate Flynn of Oklahoma called at the White House today. "Congress will not pass a bill making one state of both Okla homa and the Indian territory," said he to a Star reporter. "I think we will undoubtedly get statehood for Okla homa, but the Indian territory will, in my opinion, be provided with a territorial form of government. There is really no govern ment in the territory now. The Indian councils and the Dawes commission are'at the head of the government." A Place for Dr. Payne. Senator Scott, Judge B. F. Kellar and ex Gov. Atkinson called at the White House today with Rev. C. H. Payne, colored, for whom a position is desirea. Dr. Payne was a chaplain in the volunteer army in the war with Spain, and was highly recom mended for a chaplaincy in the regular army. He is said to be one of the ablest colored men of the country. Representative Burkett of Nebraska called on the President with E. A. Tucker of Humboldt, Neb. Mr. Tucker is looking for a suitable government position. Senator Deboe and R. C. Kinkead of Ken tucky asked the President to appoint Clar ence Grinstead of Louisville in the regular army. Senator Kerens presented three Utah men to the President-ex-Gov. Thomas, post master at Salt Lake; Ridge Smoot and E. D. R. Thompson. Senator Kerens has rec ommended the renomination of Mr. Thomas as postmaster at Salt Lake. Assistant Secretary Brigham of the De partment of Agriculture and W. S. Cox, chairman and secretary, respectively, of the government board to the St. Louis ex position, saw the President and talked with him about the work in arranging the gov ernment exhibits at St. Louis. Representative Powers of Maine paid his respects, this being his first call at the White House. Invited to St. Louis. Ex-Senator Carter, chairman of the St. Louis exposition commission, saw the Pres ident to invite the chief executive to attend the ceremonies incident to the beginning of the erection of buildings for the big fair. The time fixed is December 20, but the President will not be able to go. Senator Spooner's Throat Trouble. "I have just come from the torture chain ber,"~ said Senator Spooner a he paused at the head of the stairs before entering the President's private office. "A throat spe cialist has just been burning my vocal chords. Last night I suddenly discovered a lump in my throat about the size of a hick ory nut and thought that I'd strangle to death before I reached a doctor. "The physician assured me that it d!d not amount to much, but I think it does, if pain is any sign. I have been rather unfortunate with this throat of mine. Sev eral years ago I argued a case for four hours before a jury with a nish bone in my throat. Every word I spoke cut me like a knife. I won the case, anyway. Perhaps the jury was inclined to think the argu ment I made a little fishy, but it was evi dently better than the one put up by the other man."

SHAPI-NG PDILEES Pre int Roousew s AIition Upon HIS ITAIDIJI l88 PLAIl No Lack of Pouiven When Mind is Made4 SOME ISSURS STATED President Rooseveelt ias shaped policies on many important matiers with sufficient definiteness for the public and the poli ticians to know just how he stands on these subjects. On these maatters, as on everything else with which the President deals, there has been no -lack of positive ness when the executive mind was once made un Civil Service Reform. The President has beeli active in carry ing out his ideas of civil service reform, extending the classified -ervice over the rural free delivery system and over some places in the War Depa t*sknt, removing officials who have violateC'the rules and approving rules to make:ivil service re form more effective in 4ieration. When he appointed William Dlidley Foulke as civil service commissionei' he gave notice of his purposes. During tb- week impor tant changes have been made in the civil service rules that will leisin the tempta tion to evade them. Th e"ivil service com mission has now power, in the case of a person holding a position in the civil ser vice in violation of the civil service act or rules, to certify to the head of the de partment the fact of violation, and if the employe is not dismissed in thirty days to have his pay. stopped. Then there is to be no transfer from one department to another unless the employe has worked six months and in some posi tion in the classified service. This will prevent the appointment of men with po litical pulls to unclassified positions, their almost immediate transfer to the classified service and promotion to a good position, as has been frequently done Is the past. Again, the same strict -adherence to the merit principle is insisted Upea in the in sular service; so the mhilipgnes, Porto Rico and Hawaii are nit to *e dumping grounds for political favoritea His Position on Judicial Apngintments This week the President announced that he will make judicial apintaients him self, but will be glad of!redononendations and advice. It means that Sudicial ap pointments are not to bemAsd4 to pay polit ical debts, and that th* Pt'esident, after consultation with his Atternle General, will decide who of thoseepresented to him deserves appointment. Ae Preident fully understands the necessity of a $udiciary of the highest standard, an&Droposes to main tain that starIdard. S6at,h influence is not to be regarded, 014y the upstion as to what lawyer, no mattet by vihom recom mended, comes nearesttiZ filUmg the re quirements of a federal-julge. This posi tion was taken in the Indiana appointment. Merit to Govern Army Appointaments. This policy is practically tip same as that governing military .promotions, which was announced some time ago, when the Presi dent let it be known that he proposed to make his promotions upon the service rec ords of the officers of the army. And he does not regard seniority in rank as giving preference in making selections for line officers, where the law dpes not give senior ity the casil. The question in his mind is as to the fitness and capacity of officers whose names are brought to his attentioa, and the fact that an officer has youth, with the steadiness and experience which usually comes with age, is, rather to his advantage than otherwise.' In .his annual message the President, appteciating that there was some dissatisfaction with this attitude, made it stronger b saying that where senatorial or social influence was ex ercised in an officer's behalf it would mili tate against him. Can't Mix Politics. The President has shown that he will not countenance, much less will he permit, in terference in local politics by federal offi cials, for he has removed several who pro moted factionalism by.. their ,meddling with local concerns. He doe$ ngt object to le gitimate political activity 1 6'promote the success of the party, but he removes im mediately the officials who romote faction alism or become too partigan. He wants federal officers to attend tp their business and make their office buginai-Uke in every respect. The President has severaf-l-mes impress ed senators and representa#ties with his objection to receiving- writlen recommen dations. He knows how easy it is to sign a petition or a letter oif recommendation and that this is so often done to get rid of a persistent applicant 4 to place the re sponsibility for failure :to secure an offie upon the President. President Roosevelt wants recommenda tions made in person by' senators and rep resentatives, and then hE interrogates them regarding the men they sug ,t and holds them to -account for the ~reentations made. If, however, he findes tt a satis factory man has not been piriposed, he in sists that another being namned or selects him himself.

SCHLEY FINDINGS Opion of Nava O er a to Dewey's Position. Opinion of Members of Congress as to Further Action, GENERALLY ADVERSE The Secretary of the Navy now has be fore him for review the report of the court of inquiry in the Schley case. He is nat urally taking time to do this carefully, so that immediate action is not expected: Meanwhile the court is technically in ses sion and will remain so until dissolved by order of Secretary Long, who convened it. The practice in such cases is laid down specifically in naval regulation number 1TlU, respecting courts of inquiry in the following language: "The proceedings of a court of inquiry must be authenticated by the signatures of the president and judge advocate of the court only, and are then to be submitted for the consideration of the officer conven ing the court, after which the court may adjourn temporarily to await his further instructions." Adamiral Dewey's Position. The question has been raised since the appearance of the reports In print how far Admiral Dewey, the president, subscribed to the opinions expressed in the first re port and the findings by appending his signature, that signature being required of him apparently by the regulations above quoted, regardless of his individual opin ion. In response to inquiry on this point the judge advocate general (Capt. Lemly) of the navy said this morning: "According to naval practice Admiral Dewey; by affixing his signature to the re port of the court of inquiry in the case of Rear Admiral Schley, expresses full con currence in all the findings of fact and In all the opinions reached by the court. ex cept those with- respect to which he has In terms signified dissent in his minority opinion." No Congressional Innquiry Likely. While there is little doubt that efforts will be rmade to reopen the Schley-Samp son controversy in Congress through a proposed congressional investigation, it is the belief of well-posted men in the House and Senate that the leaders of the domi nant party will d!scourage such attempts and will rather incline to let the case drop. The House and Senate committees on neval affairs are in accord with the ad ministration of the Navy Department, -and that branch of the government service is known to be averse to further agitation of the subject or action in the premises. A good excuse for non-action by Congress is furnished,. it is said, in the recommenda tion of the court of inquiry that no other steps should be taken. Another factor which operates to discour age an investigation is the desire of men friendly to the navy's growth and expau sion t6 prevent further bickering, which they fear might -react unfavorably upon the navy's general Interests before Congress. Talks with several prominent men in Con gress, which follow, indicate some of the feeling in the House upon the question: Expressions of Opinions. Representative Loudenslager of New Jer sey, a republican member of the committee on naval affairs, said today: "For Myself I am willing to take the ad vice of the court of inquiry that 'no fur ther proceedings be had In the premises.'" Satisfied With the Findings. Representative Dayton of West Virginia, who is the ranking republican member of the House committee on naval affairs, said: "I am entirely satisfied that the find ing of the court of inquiry is just and right. It should be accepted as the un biased, sincere judgment of three able, sen sible, upright naval officers, who are thor oughly conversant with naval affairs and wholly devoid of any prejudice or passion, and far better able to decide than the gen eral vublic. "So far as an investigation by Congress Is concerned, I would be entirely adverse to it. Such an investigation could not be carried on without political partisanship forming its basis, and it wQuld only result in further Injury to the navy, which every true American citizen should be'anxious to build up and support rather than tear down." Surprised at the Verdiet. Representative Wheeler of Kentucky, a leading democratic member of the naval committee, said: "First, I doubt the wis dom of atempting a congressional investi gation. "This matter has been stirred enough al ready, and to the detiment of the Amer ican navy. "Admiral Schley needs no vindication at the hands of Congress. "Admiral Dewey summed up the judg ment of every man in the republic who has cared to keep track of the testimony before the court of Inquiry outside of a very few. "I am surprised at the verdict. It is ex ceedingly uinfortunate for the navy that a mani who has rendered such signal serv ice Ydr. his country as has Admiral Schley should be besmirched and condemned, and doubly unfortunate that the Navy Depart ment was in :any way Identified with his condemnation." No Further Investigation Called For. Representative Southard of Ohio (rep.) believes the verdict- Justified by the evi denee, and also that any further investiga tion of the subject Is entirely uncalled for. Representative *Hay of Virginia (dem.) said: "If I were a maember of a jury I would h'ave voted to aequit Sehley on the evidence adduced. Howeever, I thinir the recommenation of the court that the anat ter be dropped is agood opae. Chairman Foss of the House-.gval corn Jnittee declined to express opinion as to whether Congress woniS deal with the Schley case. .He says he hs been eareful to avoid takring aides on the subject,- as it might come before the onnmittes, ad he wishes to preserve a wholly Inmpartial atti tiade. Ao i' cs ncaei n~ at favorsbie to co0 .~satlan Chairanah Payne, the naagory leader when asked if a sonse-al. tien a likety to be ls, u MT omid si~re la~ite the s ? inh~ eble his day ine g m I ~twhtbt it e Congress to go ovet grens fqal eovered by the court." of the House demoeratic caucus, said: "1 think my democratic associates would be glad to support a resolution for a congres dosal investigation. which would go to the bottom Of the Schley case. But I very much doubt whether the majority In control of the Rouse would emit such an investi gatIon to be undertaken." Representative Sherman of Now York said: "I think the country wDi accept Ad miral Dewey's view as conclusive and that Congress will take the same view of It. Dewey's concludions will live in history low. after the other 1mmbers at the court are forgotten." WGI Ask Congreslienal Investigaties. Representative Pearre of Maryland, who represents the MaMylgnd 'distrct from which Admiral Schley came, stated today 'that he would introduce a resolution for a congressional Investigation of the entire Sampeon-Sehley affair, unless his colleague from Maryland-Mr. Schirm-who had con templated Introducing such a resolution. carried out this action. Mr. Pearre says he has not formulated the details of the proposed congressional inquiry, but he thinks it would be desirable to have it con ducted by special committee, rather than by one of the regular committees of the House "The main purpose,"'said he. "is to get the subject before an impartial body of men, wholly disconnected with the navy and free from the prejudices which seem to exist in certain naval circles. It is by having an Investigation by men of such disinterested character that the real facts can be brought out. The proceedings be fore the court followed the strictest legal and oMcial formality, and much evidenc4 was barred out on technical grounds which congressional investigation would bring out. I will defer, however, to the wishes of. my colleague, Mr. Schirm, as he fint announced the purose to introduce a reso lution of Investigation. But in case he does not act my resolution will be Introduced." Opinion of Senators. Senator Hoar expressed himself as con tent to abide by the opinion of the Admiral Dewey because of his superior facilities for reaching a correct conclusion, and Sen ator Mason took a similar position, add ing that the opinion of the Admiral of the navy would be accepted as the verdict of the country regardless of what conclusion other members of the court might have reached. Senator Hale thought there would be and should be no further Investigation. He Is chairman of the committee on naval affairs, and said he would use whatever influence he might possess against further inquiry as detrimental to the best interests of the navy. Senator Cullom declared that further in quiry would be tomfoolery, and that no more light on the subject could be secured than had been. Democratis Senators gen erally seem disposed to wait upon the ex pression of opinion by the friends of Ad miral Schley. Senator Martin, said that while he did not feel called upon to present a declaration he thought that Congress should adopt a joint resolution stating its confidence In the adniiral. Senator Bacon said he would be glad to vote for a resolu tion declaring Admiral Dewey's position to be the correct position. Senator Money assented to the proposition that Congress should act If action was desired by the friends of Admiral Schley.
