Washington, Dec. 14. The chief is sue In the selection of delegates to the Republican national convention is to be the question whether they are to go Instructed or uninstructed. Tho nntl-Taft Republicans, and these include the men who are seeking to throw the nomination to Roosevelt, will bend every effort to have as many uninstructed delegations ns possible. President Tnft's friends are fully nwaro of this program and the motive behind it and will strive for instructed delegations. The meeting of the Republican un tlonal committee here, If It accom plished nothing else favorable to the president, effectively disclosed the hoi lowness of the La Follette boom. Republicans who are urging Colonel Roosevelt to run again believe that the surest way of promoting the Roosevelt boom is for the former president him self to remain silent on the subject. There were indications 'that Mr. Tuft's suporters were also appreciating this fact and that their efforts in the near future would be directed toward put ting Colonel Roosevelt in a position where he will be obliged to sny some thing personally on this subject. Mr. Taft's friends are apparently of the opinion that the quickest and most effective way to meet the Roosevelt issue will bo to bring tho colonel into the open if possible. Harry S. New of Indiana, chairman of the subcommittee on ur f .gements of the national committee, called At the White House and had a conference with Charle D. Hllles, secretary to the' president. Mr. New said that u preliminary meeting of the subcom mittee will be held in Chicago in tho second week of January to discuss plans for J he convention.

SIMONS, Auditor. rr i i tn i.n tntt -inn o Washington, Dec. 14. By a vote of 300 to 1 the house of representatives passed the Sulzer resolution, which proposes to abrogate the commercial treaty of 1832 with Russia because of Russia's action In refusing to honor passports issued by the United State? government to American Jews. The single negative vote was cast by Rep resentative George W. Malby of New York, a Republican. Government officials believe thnt the vote by the house on the Sulzer resolu tion will bring Russia to a keener realization of the resentment felt in the United States over the treatment accorded by that country to American Jews. It is taken for granted that If the president reports that St. Petersburg still refuses' to make concessions the senate will at once concur in the Sul zer resolution. Representative McCall of Massachu setts spolie in opposition to It. Repre sentative McCall expressed the opin ion that the trouble should be adjusted by arbitration, declaring that as a mat ter of policy It was unwise to abrogate a treaty of amity in the way proposed. Representative Mann complained that the language employed was curt and Impolitic. Ho objected specifically to the provision which set forth in terms that Russia has discriminated against American Jews. He urged that the language be softened so as not to give offense. Every motion that was made proposing a change in the resolution was defeated by a practically unani mous vote. Nearly forty members of the house spoke In support of the Sulzer resolution.
