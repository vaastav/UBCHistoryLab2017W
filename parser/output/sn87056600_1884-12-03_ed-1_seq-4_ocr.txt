He ears that Hendricks proffered no eaestiona to the rresideat-e'ect, and will not make any unless his opinion ehould be asked. 'No man,' says llolmao, 'better knows the rela tions of a Vice Trepidant to the President, and he will never ask that thia or that ap pointment be made or policy adopted unless Mr. Cleveland asks his opinion on the sab jf ct. He is Dot that sort of a man. He has no desire to dictate abont anything. Dar ing the Tilden-IIayea contest he did not Lave a word to sav.

ROYAL PAIS. Two very royal looking birds arrived at this oce yesterday a rooeter and a turkey; the one emblematic of a victorious Democ racy, and the other suggesting that the time had come to give thanks for the recent tri umph. The donor is our gcoi friend W. B. Miller, a Btalwart Democrat in principle and physique. He believes in big things, big roosters, big turkeys, big Democratic victories; therefore we were not surprised to find that the tur iey weighed twenty-four pounds. The rooster, too, is a noble looking bird, but as his value lies In announcing Democratic vic tories we did not balance him against iron weights. Mr. Miller says when Blaine waa claiming New York and two Southern States the turkey winked his eye and disdalnf ally exclaimed "peet;" He was satisfied then that it waa a Republican lie. IT WAS BLAINE. Hon. Richard T. Merrick, of Washington City, eaya it waa Blaine wno compelled the Republican committee to make the claim of ?ew York after the real result was known. He was formally notified by the committee lhat New York had gone for Cleveland, and xie telegraphed back directing them to claim the State, Why, saya Merrick, I met Don Cameron at the PoetwfLce a few laje ago. He and I are good friend?, and we naturally talked of the elec tion. He admitted that Cleveland waa elected, and" I said: "Don, why don't yoa put a stop to thia foolish claim that New York baa gone for Blaine?" He replied: ,I "wish I could, but I can not. Blaine ia be hind the committee and forcing them to this course. Ha wants to pom aj a mat tyr, that lie may secure the nomination four years hence," "Nrw,H Mr. Merrick added, "Blaine waa willing to paralyze the besinees Of this country, at a loss of millions to busi ness men, to gratify his own ambition." CONKLINO AND THS DEMOCRATS. There ia not a more corxsplououa object of Republican hostility In the country to-day than Mr. Conkllng, and the phenomenon it ia Impossible to explain exoept on the grounds of bis sterling Integrity. His pub lic life from the beginning to the end of a long career baa been one of singular purity as well as force. "Though I may frequent ly have misunderstood Mr. Conkllng." aaid Hi. Hendricks, in a conversation relating to him two years ago, "I never Xor a moment doubted hfs fidelity to troth according to his judgment or hia patriotism. The largest thrift would certainly have followed the fawning to party vices, which be waa too honest to Indalge. pre'ering the poverty of a church mouse to iortuce achieved by methods so corrupt as those leadina to the defeat of Blaine and other leaders, now apparently canonized in the Republican heart "Mr. Cenkilng can not retire from public Ufa," said Mr. Julian, .lately, "and his only place of nsef olness will be in the Democratic party. That ultl- result neither Mr. Co-ilia nor - the Democratic party can reaif M The great rejoicing of the Democratic party waa because victory signified a return to the principles of the Republic! more virtuous day P. It meant a return to posttlea of men wboee personal integrity and clean hands gave assurance of public worth, ths ass am- ingof power by a party that demands of Its leaders the strictest honesty. Torsos of covemment let fools contest, The test administered It boit," It ia a carious fact of Pemoc ratio history that while it has forgiven every ahade of political difference, candidly advanced, it Las never condoned treachery or theft. While Mr. Conkling nay have legitimately incurred the imputation of Republican boss, a tyrant in what he expected from Inferiors; though long an object of uncommon hate, the shadow of a suspicion never tarnished his came. In that he certainly resembles a Democrat And it accords with the eternal harmony ct thicss that his return to the United States Senate should be at the request of the only American party capable of appreciating his redeeming virtue. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Every reader of this state raper, though perhaps disagreeing with some of the eug gfstiocs, will form a favorable impression of its anther. There ia a wholesome breadth about the message aa a whole, and the dis agreement: that it is li-elj to quicken merely attests that among those who have the lest Interests of the country at heart, are "Ifany men of many minds.' One reccoinmendation that will meet with a elow response is that the coinage of silver be suspended. That this metal Is one of our meet valc&ble product) toems to be fixed in the public mind, and no argument that Las yet, or will likely I? adopted, that can prevail against its issuance as a circulating medium. The country will not soon repeat the exper iment of legisiatlng against the interest of of cne of her principal industries. While doubting neither the candor nor the patriot ism of h'r. Arthur, Congress in all human probability, will take a widely different view of the matter. The suggestion that larger and ampler scope be riven the diplomatic and consular ser vice will be heurtily approved by those who have made the subject a study and familiar ized themselves with the depressing in ilaenee of the present system. For the want of rank, perhaps more than authority, aa oScer representing tbls country would stand second at a for eign court to an agent commissioned with no more power from the Gov era merit of Belgium. The efficiency of the American consular and diplomatic service ba3 long been impaired, to the great embarrassment of the country for want of rank. The recommendation to abolish all excise tariffs except those relating to dis tilled spirits will meet with some opposition. for the reason that tobacco is not Included. Though the tar on distilled epirita alone might furnish sufficient revenue to defray the expense of Government, economically administered, there is a feeling or sentiment extant that tobacco, being so especially an article of luxury, should bear a public bur den. Even the question of avoiding rev enue will hardly reconcile the popular mind to the idea that wisdom would put tobacco on the free list. That our foreign trade should be increased, all, It is reasonable to suppose, or acrreed. and the President's suggestion of a commis sion to solve the problem aa to the best method will certainly be approved. Also hia suggestions aa to a more secure coast defense and every measure tending to facilitate the interchange of American pro ducts with foreign Nations, and the opening of new markets to our commerce, will cer tainly meet with no discouragement. The President joina the Secretary of the Interior in advising the repeal of the Pre emption law, which will not be accepted without the weightiest reasons are advanced. That law having solved the problem of settling the frontier, and having worked admirably for the last century, will likely endure while a public domain remains to the Government A statute fixing a pun ishment equal to the enormity of the crime against the country that results from its misinterpretation or abuse would Cad readier indorsement The pledge made by the Republican party to extinguish the crime of polygamy before it waa allowed in . 1SGO, to assume the responsibility of government, might arouse a sense of humor if printed in parallel columns with Preeident Arthur's grave discussion of the Utah question. Where the Edmunds bill failed, what policy will succeed? is an inter cgation now confronting the American statesman. Mormonlam, which must go, the message re min des us, has not as yet gone. 

SOFT PLACES UNDER TUB FLAO. Keep your coat on, Mr. Republican. The disgraceful scramble for office that charac terized your party, when It came into power, it will be impossible for the Democrats to repeat In 185. From the moment that the returns indicated the election of Mr. Lin coin, that gentleman was constantly be sieged by spoil hunters. Every political road led to Springfield, HL Artemus Ward made the Preeident say in accents of despair: "They come to me from the East, from the West, from the North, from ths South, from the sky (as an enthusiastio constituent dropped down the chimney), and from the bowels of ths earth, (aa another bounced np through ft cellar door). The New York Herald and several other Metropolitan papers sent correa-ondenta to the home of the Pres idenielect, and the story of how he wm Im portuned for place humiliated the whole country. The first work, after the party took pos session of the Government, continuing for something more than a month, wis to parcel out the offices, strictly on ths grounds of party service. NeTer in the history of this Republic did an administration proceed with more fidelity to the theory that, "to the victor belong the SDOlla." Occasionally some displaced Democratic Postmaster, with his back up, spoke of the policy in terms uu complimentary, but he was promptly spotted as a rebel. No wheel of the Government moved toward the restoration of the Union until the Federal organization throughout the Northern States was such as to facilitate party clrcasalooritlon. A war was impend ing; that fact was felt by the whole Natlea n Its ben es, and because of that, a manifes tation of greed never before nor since ap peared so obscene. The opposition jsarnalist of ths period was, to be sure, aublimely disgusted, at the spectacle, and chronicled his criticism in rhetorical carbonic-acid gas, bat without effect, on the hanger or thirst of the average Republican office seeker. The element in human nature that longs for toft places under the flag, it is ratsonable to sappaje, is .boat the same without regard to party affiliation; but the dogs laagh when a Re publican editor, who is alio a Federal office holder. Inveighs against a Democrat wboee only crime is the prompting! ef a kindred Impulse. HOW IT 

LOOKS AT THIS NATIONAL CAPITAL. When the campaign waa over we expected that the defeated party would subside grace fully and retreat In good order. For the meet part thia has been done by the rank and file c the Republican party, but its newspapers and correspondents seem to have entered upon a new campaign of miechlei makicg and false statement A Washington special to the Pittsburg Post eays that the Republican pre38 seems to be making des perate efforts to commit Cleveland to the retention of the rascals. Some ot the able correspondents in Washington are sending oat reports to the effect that Democrats In CoDgrea f tvor such a policy. A New York correspondent has gone 80 far as to state that Cleveland quarreled with Hendricks upon the htter' s visit to Albany on accoant of the Brooklyn speech. Noth ing could be farther from the truth than the impression intended to be conveyed cy all this writing. The Democrats In Washing ton, to a man, expect Cleveland tobe a Dem ocratic President who will surround himself by a Democratic Cabinet and weleoma Dem ecrats into every branch of the public ser vice. Any other theory would be absurd. The Democrats have been working for twenty years to regain possession of the Government, and will not be content with a barren vic tory now. In regard to the regulations of the civil service protecting anybody from aiem'ssai, ino wasmnf;ton corre spondent of the Poet says that both Senator Pendleton, the author of the reform, and CommlEsioner Thoman say that any clerk coming under the provisions of the law may be discharged at will without even a charce being preferred. Some of these men were notorious for their violation. during the campaign, of the law, the protec tion of which they now invoke. Should they be discharged they can enter no com plaint, and the men who put them out will not be violators of the law. They will simply get the punishment due to their offenses. There ate enoarh of this sort who ought to go, and faithful, efficient, attentive clerks will be left at their desks. The places of those who are dismissed will be fired by the Civil Service Commission, and the Democrats will at least stand an equal chance of entering the public service after having seen the door closed In their face for a sccre of years. While it is neces sary to break np the department rings and seek greater honesty and better business methods, it will also be absolutely essential to change the entire public service of the South era Slates. Northern people have no idea of the character of the scalawags and scamps who infest every branch of the Fed eral service of the South, They are rarely, if ever, gentlemen; they are generally la efficient and often dishonest. They spend their time in politics and in stirring up race prejudice. The Southern men demand that these fellows shall give place and quickly, too, to a better class of citiz-ns, and to men who have tome interest in the welfare of the people among whom they represent the Government interests. Mr. Cleveland proposes to gite the country a business administration, but it is a mistake to assume that he will not. other things be ing equal, prefer Democrats to Republicans. He does not propose to indorse the Eepubli can slander that Democrats are not fit to govern or conduct public alLiIrs, and this is the way that Cleveland's coming policy is regarded by both Democrats and Republi cans at the capital, aside from those whose only interest it is to keep the trust they have already betrayed.

Thia struck the audience as very funny, and they roared. Next day Lawyer L. 6.

The Colonel said he would look into the matter. Wednesday the actor received the following letter: Mr. Dlgby Bell, Casino, New York: 8ir I am informed to-day that since my call upon Colonel McCaull and his instructions to yon you have repeated your indecent use of my revered lather's name at the Casino.

Its doors tioecd this morning. The failure waa caused by President Thomas King, who accepted large drafts from Benjamin D. Brown, a grain dealer of Indianapolis and Barling ton, without security. Brown has made an assignment. The bank's capital ia $200,000; surplus, ? 115,000. The extent of the loss ia not known yet definitely. The depositors will lose nothing. President King takes all tbe blame on himself. His recent advances were made without the knowledge of other officers and directors. The Bank Examiner L on hia way from Washington. A slight run was made on the Savings Bank here, but the latter is in no way involved and will etand a run easily. Newbceo, N. Y., Nov. 28. The Dews of the Mlddletown bank failure caused some excitement in the eastern part of Orange County. Newburg banks are not much af fected by the failure. The Middletown in stitution owed one of them $3,000, which will probably be paid. Amone the direct ors of the suspended bank are United States Senator Van Wyck, of Nebraska, formerly of this county. Mi delicto wk, N. Y., Nov. 2s. Bank Ex aminer Georg T. May, of Washington, is now in possession of tue Middletown Na tional Bank. President King takes all the blame on himself. In July last the direct ors notified King that Brown's credit um it cot be extended, b t reduced, hin; diso beyed the instructions and broke tne bank. The record of the acceptance of Brown's drafts on the bank were kept by King m a book in bis possession, and concealed from tbe other officers. Bo far as known, no more than $200,000 of such acceptances are out. It is the opinion of those beat in formed that tbe entire capital and surplus will be wiped ont. The run on the Savings Bank here drew $20 000. to-day. The bank ia solvent and ready for any emergency. HouBtonitOonklin, andCC. V. Ketcham, gram dealers of this village, who are in dorse rs for considerable amounts on Brown's paper, have made as-djn meats to protect their creditors. Preeident King is home very ill, it is not though here that he baa profited by the crooked transactions, but he waa infatuated with Brown. The operations were very heavy, aa much aa half a million of his paper waa handled by the bank in a single week. Hooking Valley kStrlke About Ended. CoLCMBca. O.. Nov. 2S. By persistent ef forts the local authorities of Hocking, Athens and Perry Counties, aided by the of ficera of the Columbus, Hocking Valley and Toledo Road, the Ohio Coal Exchange and syndicate operators, the indicationa are that the strike, which has been in progress in the Hocking Valley for the last six months, will soon end. Indictments have been found against more than twenty intimidators, who made the assault on Murray City November 5, and all but three or four have been lodged n jail. Their triala will begin next week. The detectives expect soon t make new de velopments and secure the arrest of a still larger number of Btriking miners who took pert in tbe burning of the bridge ef the Hocking Valley Road. It has been decided by the officers to proeecnta these under the Conspiracy act passed by Congress some twenty yeara ago. President Oreene, of the Hocking Valley, ia of the opinion there will be more intimidation, as the arrests will be pushed to the farthest extent The three bridges burned will be ready for trains to pan to-morrow, when three additional mlL ill be opened. The output it is thought, will soon reach the point it waa be fore the strike began, and it is thought a large number of the old miners will return to work December 1, when they learn they will be protected from the lawless element. The companies, however, aay they will not discharge any new miners to give place to the old. All the mines in the Valley are now being operated at fifty cents per ton. Permanent.
