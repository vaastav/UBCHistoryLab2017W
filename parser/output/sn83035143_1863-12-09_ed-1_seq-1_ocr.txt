There is an abundanoe abandoned land; they cn protect them selves agiinst guerillas, and at the same rim protect the commerce of the river.

They will receive very ooouragement from the Govern meat, and all the protection consistent with the exigenoiea of the service. They will be allowed to arm their own negroes, aad by to doing can oomM. e together aod organize a resident army all along the banks of the river.
