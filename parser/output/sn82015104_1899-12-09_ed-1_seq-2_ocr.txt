The copperheads will not conceal their delight over the news from Luzon that the insurrection has manifested signs of new life, and that the war of suppres sion is not near its end as yet. Any Jubilation over the news of the possible escape of Aguinaldo from the toils that were thrown about him in the north, will the more emphasize the dis loyalty of the copperheads. The man ■who can rejoice over the defeat of American arms is not a true American and ought to be expelled from among Americans. But as a matter of fact we have not suffered reverse, but have made splen did advances and won every fight. Whether the person of Aguinaldo re mains in the north or the south makes Very little difference. The north coun try had to be scoured. Regardless of Insurrectos in Cavite the valleys of the Rio Grande had to be cleared as it has been, and the entire line of the railroad from Manila to Lingayen Bay had to ba brought under our control. This has been accomplished. More than that, as ■will be seen by this morning's advices, we have cornered Aguinaldo's guard in "the north, have taken the stronghold and center of dense population, Ban gued, by the sharp work of Colonel Hare. We hoJd Vigan and all the ap proaches to Lingayen Bay. Batcheller has made a dash for Aparri, the ex treme northern port, to close that ave nue of retreat. "Young has defeated General Lino with a superior force, and the insurgents on all sides in the north are beaten back and hastening to mountain fastnesses. In short the Aguinalrloites' outlook in North Luzon is exceedingly gloomy and ours is correspondingly bright. Our officers re port that everywhere in the north the people receive them with sincere and joyous greetings. They are glad to be freed from the burden of Aguinaldo's exactions, and the quartering of troops upon them. It was very necessary that the peo ple of the north into which section we have penetrated for 200 miles, and where there are districts as populous as in the south, should see for them selves that Americans are not tyrants, that we do not murder prisoners, that our soldiers do not feed upon babies, and that we are not the fiends the Aguinaldoites have represented us to be. General Otis in a report to the Gov ernment has dwelt upon this point, and in so many wopQs has said that even though the rebels closed in behind our advancing columns, and reoccupied towns as we left them, the effect of the comparison made in presence of the people, has been and will continue to be extremely beneficial to our cause, and is worth the cost it entails. The simple fact is that the news that the insurrection has not collapsed with the advance of General Toung to the north and with the sweep of Lawtoa up and down the Rio Grande Valley was to have been, expected. The Taga los have for several years, witn brief Intermissions been fighting just as they are doing now, and which consists mainly in firing from shelter and then fleeing; conducting a campaign of mur der; executing those who refuse to Join with them; pillaging and looting at will. It was not to be expected that they would quit because we have driven them here and there like sheep. These Tagalos are really an undisciplined lot and wholly unused to warfare such as we prosecute. They nave a certain kind of courage, not that of the higher or der, for they are dominated by the in fluence of ambitious leaders. They are likewise actuated by the opportunity given them to handle guns and pose as patriots, though they have very slight idea of what liberty is, and what con stitutes true patriotism. Their reduction, however, to our au thority is assured, though the time re quired cannot now be definitely meas ured. No one who has been intelligent upon the subject has expected that these resisting natives would be paci fied in a few weeks or months, or that the resistance of the Filipinos in arms would cease all at once. Unquestion ably we would be much more advanced in our work at this time, but for the material assistance the enemy has re ceived from the American Tagalos, the copperheads among us, who give aid and comfort to the foe and counsel them to hold out In hope that the sen timent of the American people will be reversed and our authority in the archipelago withdrawn. The vigor of the campaign now be ing prosecuted is much more marked than it could possibly have been when we had the volunteers in the islands. "While they are brave, heroic and un questionably splendid fighters and noble defenders of the flag, they cannot be used as effectively against the guer rilla system of the Tagalos, as can the men of the regular army and the tem porary supplement to the regular force. The army we now have in the field la not one In which insubordination will ever appear. It will not seek to criti cise the commanders, or lay down the lines of the campaign according t,o the notions of privates or subordinate offi cers. The chief officers in command now are regulars who know what is ex pected of them, as also is the greater majority of other officers. They know how to obey and to carry out orders without interjection of their own ideas. They have material under them that will obey implicitly and can be hand led with perfect assurance that there will be no after criticism or camp chatter about what should be done, and no seeking for the purposes of con trolling minds. The insurrection will be crushed; not without employment of time and pa tience beyond the expectation of many who do not take sufficient account of the difficulties in the way, but it will be crushed all the same, and the war reduced to care for the intermittent as saults of small bands of robbing guer rillas. The very sensible idea is suggested by a San Francisco contemporary that in selecting holiday presents for East ern friends^—and th© trade in that line is exceeding large—the Californian should choose something of home pro duction or manufacture. Articles from the Orient or of European production are as common at the East as with us. Presents from among such possess, therefore, none of the elements of nov elty and represent nothing of local sentiment. But to send to Eastern friends articles peculiar to California invests the gift with an interest which gives higher value to the token of es teem and remembrance. It testifies to a thoughtful discrimination for the re cipient which the latter will at once perceive, and thus the relish of the gift will be greatly enhanced. AGUINALDO'S WHERABOUTS. It would not be at all surprising if Aguinaldo should turn up in his own stronghold, Cavite province. He could doff his military dress at any time, come out in "amigo" style, and, as ail Filipinos look alike to Americans, wander with slight disguise through our lines, take a siesta in Manila, and then drop down into Cavite at any time without being discovered. It will be all the better if the wily Malay aban dons his followers in the north and bobs up among the radicals of Cavite, because if it means concentration of. effort the best spot in all the island to meet it is in Cavite, a province more accessible to naval operation, more re stricted in area, and egress from which northward may be effectually closed with the present force we have in the island of Luzon. But this morning's dispatches show that Aguinaldo has not escaped from the north as yet. He is practically surrounded by Young, Hare, Batcheller and Wheaton, and the Amer ican force at Bayombong, so that his chances of escape lie only in abandon ment of the guard of 300 men he has with him, and taking to disguise, in which, as we have said, he can go where he pleases. It is certain, there fore, that to this date Aguinaldo and the whole army he had in central Lo zon are now in the north, and defeated at every step are driven to mountain retreats and hard pressed on ail sides. In fact, our troops are doing splendid work, and there is every reason for ac cording them high praise. When they get at the rebels in Cavite province we shall look for equally as effective a campaign as has been made in the north. 

CLEAR EXPOSITION OF TRUTHS. There are commended to the anti expansionist orators, two assumptions set out in the report of the Secretary of War. They are impregnable truths. They are statements of principle and law which are beyond the pale of suc cessful denial. They state two propo sitions so conciseiy, so forcibly, which it is essential that every well informed citizen should be clear upon, that we reproduce them In full, for they touch the core of the whole contention made by the anti-expansionists. Speaking of the treaty of peace and cession con cluded with Spain at Paris, the Secre tary says: I assume, for I do not think that it can be successfully disputed, that all acquisition of territory under this treaty was the exercise of a power which belonged to the United States, because it was a nation, and for that reason was endowed, with the powers essential to national life, and that the United States has all the powers In re spect of the territory which it has thus acquired, and the inhabitants of that territory', which any nation in the world has in respect of territory which it has acquired; that as between the people of the ceded islands and the United States the former are subject to the complete sovereignty of the latter, con trolled by no legal limitations except those which may be found in the treaty of cession; that the people of the isl ands have no right to have them treated as States, or to have them treated as the territories previously held by the Unit ed States have been treated, or to assert a legal right under the provisions of the Constitution which was established for the people of the United States them selves and to meet the conditions ex isting upon this continent, or to assert against the United States any legal right whatever not found in the treaty. I assume, also, that the obligations correlative to this great power are of the highest character, and that it is our unquestioned duty to make the interests of the people over whom we assert sovereignty the first and controlling consideration in all legislation and ad ministration which concerns them, and to give them, to the greatest possible extent, individual freedom, self-govern ment in accordance with their capacity, just and equal laws, and opportunity for education, for profitable industry, and for development in civilization. No one expected that the San Fran cisco "Examiner" would find any thing whatever to commend in the President's message. That expecta tion has been fulfilled. It is ths office of the Democratic organ to obstruct and find fault with the "ins." Even conspicuous merit can receive no rec ognition from a Democratic organ, if it is manifest in the life or work of an opposing political party. 111E 

BEUOBD-UJSIOJS, SAOBAMENTO; SATURDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1899. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL EXPRESSIONS. State and Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living News Interest. Stockton Mail: As long as timber thieves are dealt with as they usually are by our tender-hearted and consid erate Federal officers, timber stealing will continue on a large scale, to the ir retrievable loss of the people. "Were the theft of money and jewelry regard ed by the law officers in the same way as the theft of public timber is, burg larly would be one of the safest and most lucrative of the professions, though it might be overdone soon, in consequence of the number of persons who would enter upon it. If the burg lars had no reason to fear prison and were sure of being able, if caught, to secure immunity, by surrendering a quarter or less of their spoil, many of them would soon be as rich as Alger is, not to speak of others who have prospered greatly in the lumber busi ness. BERNARD AND CALIFORNIA. Stockton Record: Mons. Bernard, the Parisian architect whose plans for Mrs. Hearst's additions to the buildings of the State University have been accept ed, is in California. After a view of the surroundings he bubbled over with enthusiastic expressions of praise of the situation; the scenery, the atmos phere, the grounds, and, in fact, every thing in and about the university. The remarkable things about Berkeley and the university are always more re markable to people from abroad than to Californians. Beauty of scene and salubrity of climate are the rule in this region, and what is usual is not striking. While Berkeley deserves all M. Bernard's praises, it is by no means the only beautiful place around the bay or in the State. Mons. Bernard should have an extensive tour of the State while sojourning here. WIDE TIRE LAW. Nevada City Transcript: District Attorney Power was interviewed to-day relative to the story from Sacramento that the wide-tire law, passed by the Legislature two years ago to go into effect on the Ist day of next Janu ary, is a failure because of defects it contains. He thinks that perhaps the defects exist because of the jobbery of those opposed to the law, and that they are intended to defeat it. These defects relate to the descriptions of the axles in defining them for stated tire widths. For example, it speaks of a "steel cr thimble-skein axle," when It means a steel or iron thimble-skein axle, and a "tubular or iron axle," when it means a tubular steel or iron axle. In many counties of the State there will be no attempt made to enforce the law unless a test case is made and its constitutionality is affirmed. CAN WE DO IT? Pasadena Star: Newspaper men are I just now the victims of a great big trust which is booming the price of paper unmercifully and cinching us of millions of dollars yearly, without any other apparent cause than simply be cause they can. Within a few veeks paper has gone up 65 cents a hundred, and there is no apparent limit as to where it may go. What's the matter with publishers back-firing against this j by a combination of their own? They are rich enough to organize and oper ate a gigantic paper business that would leave all the present paper makers out in the cold. Let it be done, each taking stock in it according to his consumption of paper, and our word for it, the enemy can soon be smoked out. THE 

MORMON "COMPACT." San Jose Mercury: It is natural that Senator Rawlins of Utah should appear as an advocate in behalf of his State; in connection with the allegations in the Roberts case, and, being a lawyer, and having the floor to himself, it is natural that he should make out a good case. Utah, he declares, has kept th« compact by which she was admitted into the Union; and by way of proof he points out that both in her State Constitution and in her statutes Utah has outlawed polygamy and provided for its punishment. This calls to mind the method of demonstration employed by a famous reciter of adventures in the hunting field. "Do you question that I killed the bear as I say? Then, sir, I will give you proof. There, sir, there is a picture of the very tree in which I shot him." Of course, if Utah has made laws against polygamy, that ought to settle the matter; and no hard heart ought to ask more. But, seriously, there is a difference between enacting laws and enforcing them; and testimony brought out by the Roberts agitation has already given the country some interesting facts rel ative to the way Utah is keeping the compact. Perhaps the most important witness is Eugene Young, who, if we mistake not, is a ' son of Brigham Young, grown to hatred and bitter con tempt of the system in which he was born. In a recent number of the "North American Review," in a paper entitled "The Revival of the Mormon Problem," Mr. Young asserts, and with illustrations of a convincing kind, that the pledges made in behalf of the Mor mons at the time of Utah's admission were not intended to be kept, and that they have not been kept. THEY WILL NOT. Mail of Woodland: Now that Gen eral Otis is cleaning up the wreckage of the Filipino rebellion in such a sat isfactory manner, the newspapers which have assailed him so long should do the handsome thing by retracting their charges of incompetency. Pos sibly some other General would have pushed the war harder last summer, but there has been no lack of push during the last two months.—Oakland Enquirer. No danger of the yellow sheets apolo gizing to General Otis or doing what is fair by him. They attempted to make him a scapegoat for political rea sons, but he fooled them. Three cheers for the gritty General! CANADA'S ALASKA. Yreka Journal: The Canadians per sist in their demand that the United States give them some of the Alaskan territory belonging to this country, and whose title was never called in uuestion during all the Russian occupancy and during our own until the gold discover ies on the Yukon made them want a seaport in Alaskan waters. The Amer ican people will never consent to this. As well might this country demand Vancouver Island or any other portion of the Canadian territory upon which it might set covetous eyes. The United States would be very foolish to even think of submitting the question to ar bitration. A householder does not ar bitrate when a burglar gets some of his property and is caught while trying to get away. And that is about the posi tion occupied by Canada. She has not a foot to stand on in this controversy. CHARGES HIM WITH USURPATION. Los Angeles Herald: The taking over of unauthorized powers by the President of the United States is no new subject of discussion, and the dangers of such a step have been felt keenly by the people upon more than one oc casion. It is but a few years since Richard Olney, as Secretary of State, in a quasi-official statement given to the press, declared that the President had the exclusive control of the power to recognize or refuse to recognize a new or revolutionary Government, and no small alarm was felt over the set ting up of such a condition, which was regarded as taking away power that belonged to the people and which was delegated by them to Congress. It is the policy of President McKinley, apparently, to manipulate the Adminis tration and Congress, in connection with the Philippine question, so that the latter body will not be able to in terfere with his plans. The Pres'.dint is committed body and soul to the pol icy of imperialism, and he is dominated by capitalism, whose orders he daiea not disobey. It is not a little strange and inconsistent that many of the "business interests" that protested so strongly against the war with Spain on, the ground that the troubles and sufferings of the Cubans were "no con cern of ours" should now insist upon the prosecution of an unjust war against a people who are struggling for liberty and independence. THE 

BUTLER OF GUAM. Stockton Independent: The latest hero among- administrators is Governor Leary of Guam, who has abolished polygamy, expelled the friars and en acted ironclad industry and thrift, all by the ukase route. There is some thing decidedly attractive about a man of the Leary type. He is what Macau ley would have called a statesman, be cause he chooses his course and fol lows it ivithout those dilitory discus sions and waverings c,f the discerning man who sees doubt entrenched, on the other side of the trail. Civilization certainly demanded radical .{reforms in Guam. Effective reform demanded the figurative "man on horseback,"' but as Guam is in the middle of the Pacific instead of a meadow, Leary appeared on a warship instead of in the saddle. He is evidently a Ben Butler sort of a man who believes in acting promptly before the enemy has a chance to or ganize. As a rule, not more than one man of that type creeps to the front in a war. In truth it was the only op portunity for Leary. There was no chance for ordinary chivalry unless he played Don Quixote. But there was a grand field for administrative genius, and he took possession with a vim that out-Butlered Butler. The New York "Journal" does not circulate in Guam and Creelman is engaged elsewhere, consequently Leary will have the island in proper condition for Statehood or any other kind of hood, before the in grates of Luzon and Panay find out that they are part of Greater Ameri ca. But while we are on the subject, would it not have been a picnic to have had a couple of yellow correspondents in Guam to take issue with Leary? It would have been interesting to know whether he would have drowned them In the surf or strung them up in the fort. | SUPERIOR COURT. (Department One—Hughes, Judge.) Friday, Dec. bth.
