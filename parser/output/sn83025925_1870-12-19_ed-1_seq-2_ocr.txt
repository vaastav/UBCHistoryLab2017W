THE DAILY EVENING TELEGRAPH PHILADELPHIA, MONDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1870. or 1x1x2 or thu prbsd. Editorial Opinions ofthe Leading Journals uponCurrentTopioa Compiled Every Day for the Evening Telegraph A MATTER OF COURSE. From the X Tribune. The comio weekly whiob, nnAer the name of Punchinello, has for the ln-.t year boon struggling against its fate, has succumbed. We expect to hear the usnal chorus of unthinking citizens cf Bohemia, that America cannot Bup port a humorous paper. But we are not in clined to give so general an explanation to this pspecial case. We think, on toe ooatrary, that the autopsy of this dead weekly indicates a state of public sentiment altogether encour aging. The late hebdomadal had no reason to live. It was dull beyond description. The saga cious A. Ward once said he thought it rather improved a comie paper to print a joke now and then. Bnt when a paper is as dreary a? this was, it is even dangerous to admit a flash of facetiousness, which lights up to frightful distinctness the dead level of sur rounding inanity. There wai always some thing rather startling in a good joke printed by l'unchinello. It affeoted the reader with A sense of incongruity, like dance music at a funeral. But to say it died of dullness is not enough. The cause of its hopeless stupidity remains to be indicated. The publishers say, in their circular an nouncing the discontinuance of the journal: 'To every leading humorist in the country an engagement was tendered upon their (sic) own terms, but with one excep tion we failed to secure them, for reasons, no doubt, satisfactory to themselves." Satis factory, we add, to everybody. Punchinello was cursed from the beginning with the ill savor of Tammany. It fought under the pirate flag of that plub of vulgar thieves, thus making its only friends among those who have no capacity to appreciate any litera ture whatever. The wit and talent of the country are now, as always, mainly enlisted on the side of decency and justice. How could self-respecting journalists collaborate in a paper owned by men whoso cynical dis honesty has made our city a byword and a reproach to democratic government? The better classes would not read or write for Punchinello, and the class it catered for pre f erred the Police Gazette. It found, to use its own language again, "but two ways open First, to lower the tone of the paper, and especially the character of its illustrations: Beoond, to discontinue it. They have chosen wisely. We hope this lesson will carry with it the needed warning. The men who have carried this ill-fated experiment into the path of de strnotion are to a great extent the same who did to death, a few years ago, the most pro mising humorous paper we ever had. When the war broke out, Vanity Fair had a most precious opportunity for glory and long life. am it was twistea out ot its proper course into an organ of doubt and reaction; it maun dered about Mouiellan and abused the Trl bune and a horror of great dullness fell upon t, and it died. No humorous paper can ever live in this country whioh does not seek its audience among reading people, and its con tributors among the wholesome and honest men of thought and progress. The managers or tne uemooratio party in New lork suooeed indifferent well in stealing railroads, buying judges ana dancers, and stumng ballot-boxes Let them be satisfied with that, and not at tempt the impossible task of suborning wit. and breaking with burglary into the domain of letters. AMNESTY SCHUBZ AND BUTLEll. From the A'. 1'. World. The question of amnesty for political of fenses, whioh has been for the last few days the engrossing topic in Congress, 13 simple in primupio. nut uouipiex ana aim- cult as a subject of immediate legislation. The principle is presented with admirable conciseness and in fit language by Senator Sohurz in his resolution, which he supported by a speech or great ability and eloquence. Bat his resolution is a mere declaration of sentiment, not an act of legislation a vesti bule, and not the edifice, lie proposes that amnesty snau oe complete ana absolute, throwing a broad mantle of charity and ob livion over all offenses committed in the late civil war. But Mr. Schurz has framed no bill to carry out tnis wise and magnanimous policy; and, 11 ne naa dratted such a bill, there is not Che slightest probability that it could pass at this session. Of course, all , Democrats in both houses would gladly vote for an aot in the sense of Mr. Schurz's resolu tion; but he is just now regarded as a black sheep in the Republican flock, and is in ad- vanoe of the average sentim9nt of his party. His resolution and speech will have a cood effect in educating the public mind, bnt will bring no immediate reitei to tnose who are Buffering ander disabilities. a tne uouse mere is penaing a measure oi actual legislation, less oonipreuensive in its soope than Mr, bohurz s resolution, but quite as liberal in its intention as anything tnis uongress is nxeiy to pass, me fact that General Butler is its author should weigh 'nothing either for or against it. It ought to stand or fall by its merits, and its adaptation to present possibilities. General Butler is a man of very marked peculiarities pf individual charaoter; aud where nature has given a decided warp or twist to a man's mind, it is idle to quarrel with her decree, llitrLl.L 1 i i . - TTUiou oi you, uy luuiug luougut, can aaa a cubit to bis Btature 'i Among our notabili ties, Mr. Greeley, or Mr. lieecher, or Brig- nam xoung oouia not possibly be different from what God has made him; aad a catholic spirit will judge of life as it does of litera ture. Nobody would willingly part with Falstan, or Lear, or Hamlet, or even Call ban, although the character of none of them is defensible on sound ethical princi- plea. Nature delights in variety. Sooratea. ana uiogenes, ana uunyan, ana Joan Ran dolph, all of whom were great oddities, have their place in the universe an well as the . Washington s, the Wilberforces, the Sir Matthew Hales, the Fenelona, nd other models of moral symmetry. Mtlauctkou had a more regular character than Luther; but XiUiaer is more interesting and piquant as being an original. General Butler belongs among the originals; and it is idle to vex oui selves or vituperate him because he is not diner en t rrom wnat he is. He is one of those peouliar characters whioh Shakespeare delighted to paint; and future students of our annals will regard him with the curious interest we take la Harry Hot spur or Owen Glendower. Ecoentrio char, aettrs are piquant and suggestive: and as the tuistie cannot be transformed into a lilv etalk, cur wisest philosophy is to admire the infinite variety of nature, and gather what good we can from all her diverse produo- : Ttr t a s . . nuu9. r cannot expect uenerai Butler to epe the jndioious moderation and faultless taste of JSdward Hverett. lie pleases nennor Democrats nor Republicans, because it is a moral necessity that he should be himself. In intention and conception uenerai uut- ler's amnesty bill is wise, but it is badly drawn and requires muoh amendment. It aims to relieve participants in the Rebellion from all penalties and disabilities; but it excepts certain classes of persons from the operation oi tne aot. uemoorais oi course object to the exceptions; and if tnere was any chance of passing a more liberal measure than Butler s, it would be tood Democratic tactics to defeat his bill for the sake of a bet ter substitute. But a bill conceived in the same spirit as his is as good a one as has any chance of parsing at present; and the practical question is, whether relief shall be refused to some because it cannot yet be given to all. We believe it wise and judicious to re lieve as many as we can, as soon as we can, and trust to the growth ot liberal sentiments to complete the work. If complete ana uni versal amnesty cannot be carried through this ConeresH, that is no good reason why thousands of Southern citizens should be kept under the harrow if they could be promptly relieved by the aid of Democratic votes. We nave no cioudi tnat uenerai itiu ler is coirect in his belief that universal am nesty cannot be carried in this Congress; and despairing of anything better, we should be sincerely glad to see as mucn uone as ne pro poses. But General Butler's bill, though wise and riant in intention, and as comprehensive in scope as this Congress will bear, is crude and Imdlv drawn. He ought to consent to a thorough recast and simplification of its pbaseology and important modifications of its provisions, its language is cum brous, circuitous, overloaded with the pecu liarities of the antique and legislative style which confuses bj its redundant enumera tions and falls into obscurity by its attempts to -euard acainst possible cavil. The bill is thrice as long as it ought to be, and is fiamed in many respects without careful discrimination. It contains some pro visions which, under tho fourteenth amendment, can be passed only by two-thirds of Congress, and others may be passed by a simple majority. Some paits of it interfere with the proper jurisdiction of the courts, and among his exceptions there are things so crude and hasty that the courts oould not re spect them if tney were enacted, Uut we nevertheless think that an amended bill con ceived in the same spirit as General Butler's, free from its technical verbosity, and avoid ing its ill-considered provisions, would bring relief to large classes ot southern citizens, who must wait an indefinite period if the liberal members of Congress will vote for no thing short of universal amnesty. It does not become practioal legislators to act like chil dren who cry for the moon. 

FLOGGING AND SHOOTING. From the rail Mall Gazette. We regret to say that the newspapers just received from India appear to show that the large portion of the British army quartered there is in a very serious condition. Lord Napier of Magdala has issued a general order declaring that insubordination has beoome rife among the British forces, and that it must bo put down at any cost; and he has directed this order to be read at the head of all regiments. Tho commander-in-chief evi dently means that no severity of punishment must be spared in the case of military offenses; and accordingly extremely heavy sentences have been passed by a series of courts-martial of which tne findings are pub lished. There is no doubt of the cause of this new danger to the military efficiency of the country, nor any necessity for being mealy-mouthed in describing it. The lusuu ordination is the direct consequence of the abandonment of the praotioe of flogging. The prediction which used to be sneered at as coming from "old colonels (who, how ever, were the only persons who knew any thing about the matter) is coming true. In the absence of the power of flogging, the English military authorities are on tho point of having to resort to snooting. fFor reasons which we will briefly state be fore we conclude, we think that the punish ment of flogging should not . be hastily rein troduced into the British army. Having said this, we will give our opinion that a more foolish measure than the abandonment of this punishment, one more weakly advooated or more symptomatic of the popular silliness which threatens to be fatal to British military efficiency, was never ventured upon in the ex isting condition of our forces. The "lash, "j we were told, degrades the .British soldier. Who, then, is the British soldier as we have hiai now? He belongs to a class which is certainly not without good qualities of the rougher Bort, but of which it is flat absurdity to say that it is degraded by puysioal paiu The looser sort of agricultural loborer and the rough of the towns pretty much make up together the matt-rial out of whioh the mass of the British rank and file is composed. It is a class not choice in speech, not slow to anger; one which, if it understands anything, understands now to give and take a blow Amorg several continental populations there is really a reeling tnat physical pain, unless iDflioted with a weapon and according to rules of art, is unnatural and degrading; but the sentiment is utterly etrange to the lower classes of Englishmen. It is well known to those who have observed the flower of these classes, the skilled operatives of the large towns, that the amusements on whioh they spend their enormous wages are those of the coarsely athletic Bort, and that they are the great supporters of the sporting papers. Pi or is it aitogetneir their worse feel ings whioh are engaged in this way. The easiest, perhaps the only, way of touching a man's moral sense is to appeal to his notions of the penalty which ought to follow moral ofienseB. Now the British lower orders un questionably think that the acts which thev consider to be wrong should be followed by physical punishment. There is something inexpressibly ludicrous in the assumption that the man who would think himself a hero if he "punched" his neighbor's head for beating a woman deems himself degraded if one of his class is made to suffer physical pain for an acknowledged onense. YY e have several times said that the true source of the feeling against short and sharp punishment is an unconscious transfer of the idea of pain to ourselves, which has become commoner thin it was among a generation of keener susceptibilities. The feeliflflr. if sometimes innocently selfish, is sometimes cruelly so; for it causes the classes With which sympathy is affected to be punished ia a way which is quite inappropriate to their mental or moral condition. Among the re ports of courts-martial received from India is one from which we find that a British pri vate, Leing confined in a cell at Agra, struck the Garrison Provost-Sergeant with his clenched. fist. For this he is sentenoed and, in the existing state of the law, unavoidably and righteously sentenced to ten years' penal servitude. But let us reflect for a moment on the feature of the man and ou the character of his offense and of the punishment. He wns probably a British clod who, till he en listed, bad always expressed his angor by blows. His ideas of right and wrong were probably derived exclusively from the ten commandments, but the onense be committed wns an offense against a wholly artificial code. He was probably very sulky, for as tho act was done in India, on the 2d of Sep tember, he was oertainly very hot, and, as the soene was a garrison cell, he had perhaps just recovered from a fit of drunkenness For this he is sent and, we repeat, quite rightly sent to penal servitude for ten years. Row what does that mean i In the first place, as M. Victor Hugo wrote many pages to im press on us, it means ten years' cjmpul sory celibacy. Next, it means ten years' abstinence from all the rough amuse ments which are the delight of the British workiDg man. It means ten years of mono tonous labor, of good books imperfectly spelled tbroneh. and of lectures from the prison chaplain. Making the mau as you have him, tue contrast between the pain thus inflicted and the pain of a flagging is altogether ridiculous. And, after all, the punishment is wholly out of place. There is no reason for supposing that the private who sinned at Ajgra was a man who for his class was of an unusually low morality. It was an artificial though a very serious crime which he perpetrated. Whatever be the reasons for preaching to a London thief for ten years, there are none for putting through the same discipline a man who struck his sergeant in a passion. It would be curious to hear what tho chaplain says to this prisoner on the enormity of his particular-offense. Uut, it the results of the precipitate aban donment of flogging are mischievous, the mode in which it was accomplished is fuller still of tho promise of misohief. The cruelty of the "lash" is a tradition of a certain sec tion, which might be called the drapers' as sistant section, of the voters in British boroughs. But it is a more tradition, and it very probably had its origin in the interest which was taken in the great war at tho be ginning of the century, when Btories of the undoubtedly cruel floggings which were in flicted m the army and navy became com mon, alorjg with Dibdin's songs. Nothing, at the same time, could have been hollo wer than the fetliDg just at the moment when it took practice) effect whether in the populace or amotig the candidates who deferred to it. It is said that an excellent but not highly edu cated member of Parliament once pledged himself on tho hustings to vote for the aboli tion of the Decalogue, in the belief that it meant flogging in the army. The story has a point other than the obvious point, for it shows how completely a promise to vote against the "lash ' had become a pledge which a candidate of tke ordinary stamp swallowed as a matter of course. . It seems as if pledges against the Contagious Diseases acts wore likely in future to be taken by candidates with the same degree of readiness; and, if so, the demonstration of the meddlesome folly which the British public alternates with its military panics will be complete. Tho women and womenly men who make the British private their care will not allaw him to be exposed to the "lash," but out of his pleasant vices they make whips to scourge him with a vengeance. They will not allow him to bo flogged for what he knows most thoroughly to be a serious offense; but for indulgences which no law has as yet made penal they condemn him to the prolonged suffering of deadly disease, and render him incapable of further servioe. Our hesitation in saying that flogging ought to bo reintroduced as a military punishment arises entirely from our ignorance of the fu ture condition of the British army. If its rank and file are taken from a different class, the reasons for the reintrodnction may dis appear, for flogging is an inappropriate pun ishment in a civic army. Bat, if the army continues to be recruited as at present, some thing must assuredly be done. We take from en Indian paper the suggestion which it makes with all proper affectation of rluo tance and timidity that a military convic tion for insubordination shall, besides en tailing a short imprisonment with hard labor, cause the offender to be drafted into one of certain special regiments, in which the dis cipline shall be of the sternest and the "lash" shall be permitted. THE GOVERNMENT AtfD ITS CLERKS. Fom thtX Y. Time. The bill to assess the Government clerks, in order to provide for them a general relief fund, is another attempt to avoid doing the proper thing about the civil service. The idea which lies at the bottom of this measure, and all others like it, was, we were sorry to see, produced in Mr. Boutwell's report, in the shape of an avowal that the clerkships in the Treasury Department existed in part for the benefit of young men engaged in professional studies, and anxious to save a little money to help them on and that one of the reasons for changing them so frequently was the de sire to prevent their settling down in such 6mall places permanently. Now this whole theory of the relation of tie Government to its servants is false and mischievous, and we shall never have a re form in the civil service till we get rid of it, root and bracch. The Government must aud ought to go into the labor market, on the same principles and with the same ob jects as any other employer that is, on the principle of paying fair wages for fair work, and with the object of getting the best men it can for the lowest salaries consistent with efficient service. It has no business to make itself the wards or guardians of its servants, and lay up money for them, or decide how long the ought to Btay in its employ ment, or whether their welfare would not be better promoted by their doing some thing else. All this sort of thing is neither beneficial nor judicious. In the matter ot clerks' wages the Government has one duty, and one only, and that is to pay market rate for good labor not the lowest sum for whioh clerks can be got, bnt the lowest sum for which good clerks can be got. Having done this, it will have done all it is called upon to do. It is no more bound to see that the clerk saves a portion of his money for a relief fund than to see tbat any other citizen does it, or to Bee that he changes his occupation at the proper moment, any more than to direct other young men what they ought to turn to when they leave school or college. As we pointed out, a fow days ago, it is no part of the duty of Congress to proscribe punishments for persons who levy or attempt to levy assessments on clerks for political purposes. In proposing aujthiDg of the kind, Senator Wilson is on the wrong tack. Government clerks must be left to take care of their own salaries. If they are hired and discharged on ordinary business principles, they may be just as safely left to do so as any other citizens. No acts ara needed to protect the bankers or dry goods clerks of New York from assessments in aid of campaign expenses, although most of them doubtless take a strong interest in politics, and though any party may, if it pleases, send in agents to ask them for money. The reason why they need no such protec tion is very simple, and it is worth more than any aot of Congress namely, that they have nothing to fear as regards their personal interests, if . they do not con tribute towards election expenses, and no thing to hope if they do. Put the Govern ment Bervants in this position assure them that their future will in no way be affected by their giving or not giving, and we may feel assured tbat thev will look after their purses perfeotly well. If they like, and can afford it, Ihcy will give; if they do not, they will not give, just like any other citizens. The country looks, and justly looks, on all the class of measures to which those we are discussing belong, with great suspicion. Coming close on the excitement about civil service reform, created by recent occurrences at Washington, and by the strong indorse ment of it in the President's message, it is believed that they are simply points of a process by w hich Congressmen will try either to evade compliance with the recommenda tions of the President s message aud the public demands, or to make people believe they are complying with them when in reality they are doing nothing of the kind. The people want this matter "re formed altogether," without shirking, or dodging, or shilly-shallying. They do not want the Government clerks converted into a privileged, or petted, or exceptional class in any way; but they do want to see tho Government business pei formed on business principles and in accordance with business usages. They want to see all Government agents employed, aud retained, and dis charged under the influence of just the same considerations as a railroad company or bank ing home employs, retains, and discharges its agents, and they will not be content with anything less than this, and do not seek any thing more. It may be that, in the present state of party polities, and in the face of existing party usages, no sudden or complete change is pos sible. But the publio does not expect this. What it does expect is, that any legislation which is attempted on the subject Govern ment servioe at all shall be in the right direction; that if it does not do all that is needed it shall do something towards it. Theie is one step towards reform, for which, however, there is an immediate demand, and which Congressmen have absolutely no ex cuse for resisting, and that is, the abandon ment on their part of the business of dis tributing patronage. This belongs of right to the Executive. The. assumption of it by members cf Congress is a gross and scandal ous usurpation, and recognized as such by the best men of both houses. It takes away the greater part of members' time from the discharge of their legitimate business, and the country wants their time, and the whole of it, and will not be any longer cheated out of it, no matter what becomes of the Govern ment clerks. Whether tenure of office during cood behavior, or tenure for a fixed term, or selection by examination,' or appointment by competitive examination, be good things or bad things, one thing is certain, and that is tbat when the people of a district pay a man to co to Congress, it is for the purpose of attending to the business of legislation, and not for the purpose of opening an intelli gence office for the supply of plaoes to needy politicians.
