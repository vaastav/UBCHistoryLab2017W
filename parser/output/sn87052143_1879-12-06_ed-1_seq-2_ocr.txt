SALE OP THE NAEECW GAUGE. An article on the outside of this paper announces the sale of tho Narrow Gauge railroad to Jay Gould. After the pur chase of this road, which was negotia ted between Messrs. Gould and Holden, on the way from here to Kansas City, after the visit which wo announced last' week, the former named gentleman and his staff visited Atchison, Leavenworth and St. Joseph, all of which places he left in a ferment of excitement as to his intentions regarding their railroad con nections. On Wednesday Mr. Gould re turned to Independence, where a meet ing of persons interested in the Kansas City & Eastern railroad was held lor the purpose ot reorganization. The old board ot directors all resigned, except ing Messrs. Howard M. Holden and . H, Allen. A new board was then chos en, consisting ot Messrs. a. a. diuuu, W. Griffith, D. E. Cornell, H. C. Clements. J. O. Bnnkerhoff. alt ot the Kansas Pacific directory, and Messrs. Holden and A.len, as above stated. A meeting ot the new board was immedi- tely held, and the following named officers were elected: President, Ss 1. Smith; secretary. J. V. Griffith; treas urer, H. C. Clements. The president appointed Mr. H. Hale, division superin tendent of the Missouri Pacific railroad, as superintendent of the Narrow Gauge, with Mr. Iviuson, the former superin tendent, as assistant. It will be seen that the above is a radical change ot man agement. The assertion was made at Kansas City in connection with the sale, that Mr. Gould had also purchased a controlling interest in the Lexington coal fields. This is not true ; but it will be readily understood that the various changes which have recently been made in the ownership of the St. L., K. C. & N.. the K. P. and the Mo. P. R. R.'s, by which the ownership of these roads is concentrated in one person, makes the question ot fuel one of vast moment. Mr. Gould has secured control of the transportation ot Lexington coal because he knows that tho mines here yield the best quality ot steam, coal, and at less expense than any mines contiguous to his roads. He intends to coal his three reat trunk lines from this point, and for that purpose will lay a third rail on the Missouri Pacific and Kansas Pacific tracks in and about Kansas City, that he may run his Narrow Gauge trains to the various coaling places. Col. .Stephens stated, to a Sedalia Democrat reporter, that the Kansas City & Eastern wonld be extended to Boonville. This we should like to see done, as the northeas tern portion ot this county would be much benefited thereby. If it is done, however, it should be as a broad gauge, and we hope that in any event the gauge will be changed on tho road from this place west. In any event the one cer tain indication is that the mines at this point will be wqrked to an extent here tofore unprecedented. THE ELECTION Iff LOUISIANA. The political campaign ot 1879 closed in Louisiana, last Tuesday, when state officers were selected and a new consti tution was voted on. The state which was declared by the returning board in 1876 to be a republican state, when it is permitted to vote for the first time since 1S61 goes democratic by about 30,000 majority , All the dispatches, lrom whatever source, join in saying that the election was quiet, free from broils, fair and honest, and that a great many ne groes voted the democratic ticket. The democratic ticket was composed of Louis A. Wiltz, the present lieut.-gov ernor, for governor; S. D. McEnery tor lieut.-governor ; James C. Eagan, the present asttitant attorney-general, for attorney-general-; Win. A. Strong, the present incumbent, for secretary of state ; Allen Jumel, present incumbent, lor auditor, and Edwin H. Fay for su perintendent ol public instruction. The republican ticket was composed as fol low3: For governor, Taylor Beattie; for lieut.-governor, Jas. M. Gillespie; for attorney-general, Don. A. Pardie, for secretary of state, James D. Kennedy, colored; lor auditor, Claudius Mayo ; lor superintendent ot public instruction, M Uonzano. The new constitution is adopted by a heavy vote. Our good friends at Richmond haye testified, this week, how thoroughly they were convinced that the Burling ton & Southwestern railroad would be built by Lexington, in their great haste to go to work when they learn of the Gould purchase ol the Narrow Gauge, which they think kills the former pro ject. They have hold a public meeting and sent a delegation to confer with the business men of Kansas City, which was well received by the merchants' ex change. Our friends may be counting their chickens too soon. The Narrow Gauge does not occupy all the ground between Lexington and Kansas City, and we possess another coal vein fully as accesible and easily worked as the one on that line a coal vein above the level of the bottom, sloping toward the face, needing neither artificial drainage. hoisting, timbers or powder to work it. The B. & S. W. people know ali about these advantages, and they have not yet decided to abandon this route. 1 he moral torce 01 the general op position to human slavery all over the civilized world had much to do with the defeat ofthe southern armies and the suc cess ol the cause of the umou. So Eng land should know that the enlightened sentiment of the word is opposed to ar bitrary suppression of free speech and unjust discriminations against one par of a country by a stronger part. "Fair play is a jewel" is a popular motto everywhere nowadays, and it is gener ally thought that England does not give Ireland anything of the kind. The trouble with Ireland is that she is never united. If she would reject her ex trem ists as she loathes her traitors she would have a better chance to compel terms In the mean time the lact appears that she seems to have no redress but in em igration. The Associated Press says: ''Spe. cial dispatches to the New Orleans Democrat, from all the telegraphic sta tious in the state show heavy demo cratic gains. These reports, givin estimates of majories in eleven parishes claim democratic gains of 12,000 com pared with the democratic count 1870.

THE LEXINGTON XNTJEJL.JIGJBNCER BAJUimA.Y, DECEMBER 6, lHTg. The Jeannetto is reported to be frozen up in an ice floe, and in some danger therefrom. It is hardly likely that she is in a summer sea at 70 degrees north latitude. She is a noble ship, better built and provided than any of her pre decessors; she has a noble crew, and we expect to hear that she has carried the American flag as near the pole as Jules Verne's Capt. Hatterasgot, before she returns or gives up her task. Th eCleveland Voice says : 'Of the two, would not a republican king be bet ter than a bourbon president." Idiotic as the idea of a republican" king may seeai, the desire for an empire is very prevalent in the republican party. It is the insane hatred of the south which urges it with some ; with others, it is the pride of wealth; and with many others the snobbish desire to be ot an aristocracy. Capt. George E. Patton, representing the St. Louis Times, spent Saturday and Monday in this city: in the interest of his paper. Capt.

This is a sure sign that Mat. and his friends intend to do the thing themselves. Whenever they intend to do any devilment, they begin to charge the democrats with that particular wick ed purpose. In proof of this assertion we appeal to history. No American in modern days has been so much beloved and revered in his state as Horatio Seymour. A patriot and a statesman, he is respected by men of all parties, and wherever he appears in public, it is to receive a genuine ova tion at the hands of his fellow-citizens. Still there are people to fling dirty epi thets at him. The St. Louis grain market last Thursday, stood as follows: "Wheat No. 2 red, $1 33 1-4 to $1 33 3-8 cash ; $1 33 1-4 December; $1 36 to $1 36 3-8 January; No. 3 do, $1 25. Corn, high er; 37 l-8c December. Oats, higher; 38 l-2c cash ; 40 l-2c May. Rye better; 77c bid. Barley unchanged; choice 85c." There are many plausible arguments to offer in favor of the government op perating all the railroad and telegraph lines, but the practical meaning ot the thing is to increase the army ot office holders from 80,000 to 1,500,000, and to throw liberty to the dogs.

PRESIDENT HATES' ANNUAL MESSAGE. Continued from First Page. By laws enacted in 1S53 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in the revised statutes, the practice of arbilrury appointments to the several subordinate grades in the great depart ments was condemned, and examinations, as to cupiicity, to be conducted bv departmental boards or examiners, were provided lor and made conditions of admission to the public ser vice. These statutes are a decision by congress that examinations of some sort.as to aitaiumeuts and capacity, are essential to the well-being of the public service. The important questions Biuce the enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these examinaiions, and whether oflicial favor and partisan influence, or common right aud merit, were to control the access to the examinations. Ill practice, these examinations bave not always been open to worthy persons generally, who might wish to bo examined. official favorites and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go belore the examining boards, subjecting even the 1 xaniinera to a pressure from the friends ol the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examininers. with no common supervision or uniform method of pro cedure, should result in confusion, inconsisten cy, and inadequate tests ol capacity highly det rimental to the public interests. A runner aod more radical chauge was obviously required. In the annual message of December, 1S70. my predecessor declared that "there la ne duty which so much embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments; nor is tbereany such arduous and thankless la bor Imposed on senators and representatives as that ot finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and olten not even Ut men fur the public places. The elevation and purification of the civil service ot the government will bo hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States." Con gress accordingly passed the act, approved March 3, 1871, "to regulate the civil serviee of the United States anil promote the efficiency thereof " viDl.if ih. ,t A..u.aum .iith.ii'it v It: thft executive to inaugurate a civil service reform. Acting under this statute, which was inter preted as intended to secure a system or lust and effectual examinations under uniform supervis ion, anumeer el eminently competent persons were selected for the lmrnose. who entered with zeal upon the discbarge of their duties, prepar ed, with an inlnlligent appreciation ot the re quirements of Uie service, the regulations con templated, and took charge of the examina tions, and who. in their capacity as a board. have been known as the "civil Service Com mission." Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and for the x pense of carrying on the work of the com mission. It appears from the renort of Ihe commission. submitted to the president in April. 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of auuut iu,iw would ue requireu to meet tne an nua expenses, including salaries. Involved In discharging the duties of the commission. The report was transmitted to congress bv snecinl message of April IS, 1874, with the following lavorabla comment upon the labors of the com mission: "If sustained by congress, I have no aouut me rules can, alter the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still -mora materially benefit the public service and relieve the executive, members of congress, and the neaas 01 departments, lrom influences i.relu. dicml to good administration. The rules, as they unve uituerui oeeneniorcea, nave resulted Dene flcially, as is shown by the opinions ofthe mem bers of the cabinet and their subordinat. in thn departments, and in that opinion I concur." Aim in tne annual message or December or the same year similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing the work of the wiiuiuihiuu again auvised. ine appropriation was not mane. and. as a consequence, the active work of the commission was suspended, leaving the commission itself stiu in existence, without the means, there fore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner, or of securing lor the public service the advantages of competition upon any vAwuiive piait. 1 recommended in my annual message of December. 1877. the makinir of an appropriation for the resumption of Ihe work of tue commission. In the meantime, however.comnetltive exam inations under nianv embarrassments havn hnn conducted within limited spheres in the evt-cii. tive departments in Wasbmgton, and in a num ber of the custom bouses and post offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to .w. u.. ueiu, huu, 111 every instance, they bave been found to be as salutary as they are staled to bave been under the administration of my predecessor.

The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the gen eral application of similar rules cannot fail to be ol decided benefit to tbe service ine reports ol the government officers, in Ihe city of New York especially, bear decided testi. niuny to tbe utility ol open competitive exami- iu.iuuo 111 uicir respective unices, snowing mat "these examinations, and the excellent nualiil- oations of those admitted to the service through :""'. . - luuiaeu incidental euect upon licularlv unon those aanlrinir' to lirnmntlnn There bas been, on the part ot these latter, at increased interest in the work, and a desire to extend acquaintance with It beyond the particu lar desk occupied, and thus tbe morale of tbe entire torce has been raised. Tbe exami nations nave been attended by many citizens who have had an opportunity to thoroughly In vestigate tbe scope and character ol the testa and method of determining the lesulu.and those visitors have, without exception, approved ihe methods employed, and several of them have puuuciy attested weir favorable opinion." Upon sucb considerations. I deem it mv ilntv to renew-the recommendation contained In my annual message or uecember, 1877. requesting congress to make the necessary appropriation for tbe resumption of the work ot the civil ser vice commission, economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate comnanaatmn m nee. sons in tbe public service wbo may perform ex tra labor upon or under the commissiun, as the executive may diract. 1 am convinced that if a justandjadoauate test ui merit is eniorceu lor. admission to the publio service and iu making promotions, such abuses as removals wunotit good cause and partisan m wiubini luwiicicuw wau i tie proper exer cise 01 the appointing power will in large meas lire disappear. There are other administrative abuses lo which the attention of congress should be asked in Ibis connection. Mere partisan appointments, aud mio (.uudibiu tram ui removal wiinout cause very naturallv lead to an ahaorlitno' hh chievous political activity, on tbe part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with 1110 une uisouarge 01 omciat uuly, but is incom patible with the freedom or elections. Not with out warrant, in the views of several r mn ...... decessors in the presidential office, and dlreoily within the law of 1871, already cited, I endeav ored, by regulation, made on the !!2d day ot June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, aud it may never perhaps be necessary, to define with nrectxion the proper limit of political action on the part or f.ll.nil nm.un. T . . . 1 . .

BK'ATlOKs WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Our relations with ioreign countries have con tinued peaceltil. Willi Great Uritain there are still unsettled questions growing out of the local laws of the maritime provinces aud the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American llihei-men. The United States' minister in London lias been in. sirpcted to present a demand lor $!u.,305 02, in view pf the damage received by American citi zens at Fortune hay on the 0th day of January, 1878. TI.e subject lias beeu taken into considera tion iiy the Uritish goverpmeut, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion ef the necessary prelimi nary examinations, the subject of our partici pation iu tbe provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the atten tion ofthe ilriiisb government Willi a view to an early and permanent settlement ol the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted py Ihe treaty of Washington. Ktliirls have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exporta tion of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspoiidcue-e bas also occurred with ritsrJ to the rescue at d saving of life and prop erty upon the lakes, which has resulted in im portant modifications ol the previous regulations ol the dominion goverumtfit on the subject, ill the interest ol humanity and cu&merce. iu accordance with the Joint resolution cf the last sedsien of congress, commissioners were appointed to represent the Unitod States at the to international exhibitions in Australia, one 'of aicb is now in progress at Sydney, aud the other to be held next year at Melbourne.

It may reasonably be anticipated that the commissiou now sittmg in Washington, for tbe decision ol private caaes in this connection, will soon be able to bring its auurs to a conclusion. . . . , The lnn...i...iim, ...,t!on of East lorida claims has lately been renewed as a subject or correspondence, and may possibly require con gressional action lor its final disposition. A treaty with tbe Netherlands, with respect to consular rights and privileges, similar to those with other powers, bas been signed and ratified, and tbe ratifications were exchanged on tbe 31st of July last. Negotiations for extradition trea ties with tbe Netherlands and with Denmark are now in progress. Some questions with Switzerland, in regard to pauper and convict emigrants, bave arisen , but it is not uoiiutea tnat tnev win ue rr.ugcu uiwii a just and satisfactory basis. A question has also occurred with respect to an asserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage over persona and property ol Swiss citi zens naturalized in this country. It Is possible this may require adjustment by treaty. With the German empire frequent questions arise In connection with the subjects of natu ralization and expatriation; but the imperial government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to tbem. In consequence ot the omission of congress to provide for a diplomatic representative at Acnens, tne legation to ttreeoe has been w un drawn. There is now no cbannel of diplomatic communication between tbe two countries, and tne expediency ol providing tor one, in some form, is submitted to congress. Kelations with Austria, Kussla, Italy, Port ugal, Turkey and Belgium continue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial import ance. A change of Ihe nersonal head ol the govern ment of Kgypt has taken place. No change, however, bas occurred in tue relations between Kgypt and tbe United States. The action of the Egyptian government In presenting to the city of New York one of the ancient obelisks, wblch possess such historic interest, is hurhly appre ciated as a generous mark of international re gard. If prosperity should attend the enterprise ot iu transportation across the AUantic, Its erection in a conspicuous ussitlon la the chief commercial city of the nation will soon be ac complished. CHINA AXD LPAX. The treaty recently madi between Janan and the United Statea in regard to the revision of former oommerelal treaties, it is now believed will be followed by similar action on the part ot other treaty powers. The attention of congress is again invited to the subject ot the indemnity Innds received some years since from Japau and Cbina, which, with their accumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. II any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens, tuey suuuia receive it promptly, ana wnatever may have been received bv Una ffovernmeat in excess of strictly just demands, should in some form be returned to Ihe nations to wboin it equitably belongs. The government or China has signified its wil lingness to consider toe question of emigration of its subjects te the United States with a dis passionate fairness, and to oo-oiierale in such measures as may tend to prevent tniturious con sequences to the United States. The negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with uiiiKeuce. A question having arisen Between China and Japan about the Lew Chew island, the United States government has taken measures to inform those powers of its readiness to extend Its good ofllces for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mutually deem it desirable, and find It practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. MEXICO. It IS a aratifieatioa to be able fn announce that. through the judicious and energetic action ot the military commanders of the two nations on each side of the Klo Grande, under the instruc tions of their respective governments, raids and uepreuauons nave greatly ue-reased. and, in the localities where formerly most destructive. have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result 1 entertain a confident expectation that tne prevalence or quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of tbe present orders to our military command ers as to crossing the border, without encourag ing aucu uisturuances as would endanger tne peace of the two countries. The tbird installment of tbe award against meico uuuer uie claims commission oi uuiy e, lSttS. was dulv paid, and has tuten nut in e.ourfux of distribution in pursuance of the act of con gress proviutng lor toe same.

Diplomatic intercourse with Columbia ir ao-aln fully restored by the arrival ol a minister from tbat country to the United States.

It is not doubted tbat should the work be undertaken under the protective auspices of tue udiku states, ana upon satisiaciory conces sions lor the right of way, and its security, by oai AiimriiMa government,' tbe capital for its completion would be readily furnished iruiu tuts country anil Europe, which might, failing such guarantees, prove Inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chili have! Ill liMin strengthened by the reception of a minister from that country . ine war between t'eru. Bolivia and Chili still continues. The United States have not deemed it prober te interpose in the matter, inrthur ih.n to convey to all the governments coiictrn;d, tbe assurance that the triendlv ollir.ea ol ihe mmrr. mentof the United States for the restoration of peace upon an nonoraoie oasis will be extended in case the belligerents ah ill exhibit a readiness to accept tbem. Cordial rela.ions continue with Brazil anil the Argentine Republic, and trade witb those coun tries is improving. A provision tor regular and more frequent mall communication, in our own ships, between the ports of Ibis country and the uaiiousoi aoum America seems to me to deserve the attention of congress, as uu essential precur sor of an enlargement of our commerce with tneiu, auu tui extension oi our carrvlna- trade.

There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged witn common law offenses such as assault, robbery and murder, und no magistrate authorized to issue or execute pro cess in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character. not only among tne original In'iabilants, but among citizens of the United States and other countries, wno nave engaged in mining, fiahini and other business operations within the terri tory.

Ue also recommepds tbat' congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a' large number of abandoned military posts apd reser vations, which, though very valuable lo llieiu- selves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance aud settlement ol civil ization. He unites with tbe quartermaster-general In recommending tbat an appropriation be made for the construction ol a cheap anil perfectly fire proof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims and other valuable records now in the quartermaster-general's ollie.aml exposed to great risks of total destruction by fire. .... He also recommends, in conformity Willi the views ofthe ludge advocate general, some dila tory legislation in reference to the military stat ute or limitations as applied to Ihe crime of de sertion. , , In these several recommendations I concur.

JETTIES. Ti.. aenretarv of war further reports, that tbe work for the improvement of tbe south pass of the Mississippi river, unuer contract witu oi Jimu K Eudn. made in pursuance of an act congress, has been prosecuted during tbe past year, Wltn a greater measure ui ouia.w iu ... attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel through tbe south pass, which, at the beginning of operations in June, 1S7S. had a depth of only seven and one half feet of water, bad on the 8tb ol July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of thirty leet. Payments have been marie in accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in tbe aggregate to 4,2jO,000; and further payments will become due, as provided by the statute. In the event of success in main taining the channel now secured. The reports of the general of the army and ol his subordinates, present a full and detuiied ac count, of the military operations for the sup- Bression of bostiiities among the Indians of the te and Apache tribes, and praise is Justly awarded to tbe officers and troops engaged, lor promptness, skill, and courage displayed. Tbe past year has beeu one of almost unbroken peace and quiet ol ibe Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe tbat the eflbrta of this government and ol Mexico, to maintain order in mat region, win prove periuaueutiy suc cessful. This department was enabled during the past year to find temporary though crowded accom modations, and a safe depository for a portion ot its records, in the completed east wing of the uullding designeu lor tne stale, war, auu navv departments. The construction of the north wing of tne building, a part oi tne structure in tended for the use of the war department, is be ing carried forward with all possible dispatch, and tbe work should receive from congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy eomplelion. THE NAVT. The report of the secretary of tbe navy shows continued imurovement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and made ready for sea. Tbe total expenditures or tne year endeu June . 18i. inoiuuing si-ecllic appropriations not estimated tor by tne department, were au.uoa,- 710 09. The expenses cbaig able to the year, al tar deducting the amount of these specific ap propriations, were S13. 343.317 7: but this is sub ject to a reduction or i33,7i5 99, tbat amount having been drawn upon warrants, but net paid out during the year. Tbe umount of appropria tions applicable to the last fiscal year was SH,- 538.848 17. There was. therefore, a balance of 1,479,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to the credit ol the department, on June 30, 1870. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30.16S1, are S14.8o4.147 95. which exceeds the appropria tions lor tbe present fiscal year t3Ul,S97 2S. The reason lor this increase is explained in the sec retary's report The appropriations available tor tne present nscai year are si,a z.zou ei , which will, in Ihe opinion of tbe secretary, an swer all the ordinary demands of tbe service. The amount drawn from Uie treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879, was $5,770,404 13, of which 1,093.440 is nas been reiuuaed, leaving as the expenditure lor that neriod tU.B74.9sa 79. If the expenditures of tbe remaining two-thirds of the year do not exceed the proportion for those lour monws, mere win remain unexpended , at the end ofthe year,SI77,359 30 of tbe current ap probations. The report of tbe secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing of tne pay corps ot tne navy mere is not one wno Is a defaulter to the extent of a Bin&rle dollar. 1 unite with htm in recommending tbe removal of the observatory to a more healthful location. Tbat institution reflects credit unon tbe nation. and has obtained Ihe approbation of scientific men in all parts ol the world. Its removal from Its present location would not only be conducive to tbe health of its officers an-1 professors, but would greatly increase its useiuiness. The appropriation for Judicial expenses, whicb has heretofore been made for the department ol justice, in gross, was subdivided at the last ses sion ox congress, auu no appropriation wnatever waa made lor the payment of the fees of mar shals and their deputies, either in the service of process or lor the aiacnargeot other duties; and, since June 30, these officers bave continue I tbe performance ot their Unties witnout compensa tion from the government, taking upon them selves tbe necessary incidental outlays, as well as rendering their own Bcrvice. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the reouisite anbroori- allon. This course ol official conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the attorney-general. wno lnxormed tuem, nowever, mat tney would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon tbe Brospect ol future legislation by oon- gress. I therefore especially recommend that immeaiate appropriation oe made by congress for this purpose. Tne act making tbe principal annronriatlon ror tne department or justice at previous sessions has uniformly contained tbe following olause: And-for defraying the expenses wbicb may be Incurred in tbe entorcement of the act approved reoruary vs. icwu, enmieu 'An actio amend an act approved May SO. 1870. entitled 'An act to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in tbe several atates of the United States and for other purposes.' or any acts amendatory tnereox or supplementary taereto.' " No appropriation waa made lor this purpose lor the surrent year. As no general election for members ot congress occurred, tue omission was a matter ol little practical importance. Sueh election will, however, take place during ...... , ..

The business of the supreme court is. at Dres- ent, largely in arrears . It cannot be expected tbat more causes can be decided than are now disposed of in its annual session, or that by any assiduity tbe distinguished magistrates wbo compose tbe court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts el many of the cir cuits, also, the busim ss has increased to such an extent, tnat tne delay ot justice will call the at tention ox congress to an appropriate remedy It is believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, aa its causes are advancetl by the courts wueu tt is seen tuut tney involve tue discussion of questions of a public character. 1 ne remedy suggested uy tne attorney-general is the appointment of additional circuit judges. and the creation of an Intermediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the su preme court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger torce in also obtained for the perfor mance nt circuit duties. I commend tbls suggestion to the considera tion OI aoagress. 11 would seem to afford complete remedy, and would involve, 11 ten ad ditionai circuit judges are anuointed. an ex- penditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not mora than tGO.eOO a year, which wonld certain ly be small in comparison wiih the obiecta to be attained. 

POSTAL MATTERS. Tbe report of the postmaster-general bears tes timony to tne general revival oi uu-iness mrougll out tbe country. The receipts of the postolllct department for the fiscal year ended June So. 1879, were 30,041,982 SS, being 764,4C5 1 more man tne revenues oi tne preceding year. The amount realized lrom the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes and postal cards was S7s4.- 406 91 more than m tbe preceding year, and ., SS7.539 23 more than in 1877. The expenditures ofthe department were 933,449,809 45, or which the sum of 370,41 63 was paid on liabilities in corred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were $801. 09 77 less than in the preceding year. This re duction is to be attributed mainly to tbe opera tion or the law passed June 17, 1S7S, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commis sion on tbe value of stamps sold, to a commis sion on stamps cancelled. The amoaut drawn from the treasnrv an an proprlations in addition to the revenues or tiie department was 03,031 .454 96. being J,27S,HI7 80 less tban in the preceding year. Tbe expenditures for the fiscal year ending June M, 1S81, are estimated at $39,930,900, and tne receipts from all sources at S32.210.000 leav ing a deficiency to be appropriated for, out of tne treasury, oi v,tiu,auu. The relations of Ibe department with railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstand ing the general reduction by congress of their compensation, by the appropriation for special lacilities, ami tbe railway postoutce lines bave oeen greatly extended, especially in the south era states. The interests ol the railway mail service and oi tue pueuc wouiu be greatly pro moted, ana tne expenditures could be more readily controlled by tbe classification of tbe employes of the railway mail service as recom mended by the postmaster-general, the auuro- prlation lor salaries, with respect to which tbe maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be iukui to gross. 'ine postmaster - sreneral recommends an amendment of the law regulating the increase of compensation xor increased service and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to ad vertiae for proposals for such increased service ano speed tie also suggests tne advantages to the commerce of tbe country from tbe euact- ment ul a general law authorizing contracts with American built steamers, carrying the American Hag, lor transporting the mail be tween ports of tbe United Slates and ports of the west xnuies and aouui America, al a fixed max imum price per mile, the amount to be expend sd being regulated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid lor the domes uv star service. The arrangement made by the uostmaster- gepera! and the secretary of the treasury for the collection ol duty upon books received in tbe man irom ioreign countries, lias proved so sat ialoctory in its practical operation thai the rec ommendation Is now made tbat congress shall extend ine provisions ot tne act ox juarcn 3, 1879. under which this arrangement was made. so as to apply to all other dutiable articles re ceived in the mails lrom foreign countries. 

INDIAN AFFA111S. The report of the secretary of Hie interior and of tbe commissioner of Indian affairs, setting fortb th present state of our relations witb the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and pros perity, and tne progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary In terest. The general conduct ol our Indian pop ulation has been so satisiaciory that the occur ence of two disturbances, which resulted in biooiUluid and destruction of property, is all tbe more to be laii!eiUe. Tbe bia'iory 01" the outbreak on the Whjte River Uie reservation in Western Colorado hai beCo'ue so familiar by elaborate reports in tbe public press, tbal its remarkable iucidcnte need not be statea here in detail. It is expected that the set tlement or this difficulty will lend to such ar rangements'us will prevent further hostile cou tact between the Indians and the border settle ments ui Western Colorado. ' The otlieV disturbance occurred at the Mcaca lero agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small b ind of Ma'raudets. niter com ultting ninny atrocities, being vigorously f chased by a military force, made bis wav across ; tiie aiexican uomer and is now oil ioreign sou While these occurrences, in which acomuar- atively small number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, avast majority ol bur Indian population have fully Justified the ex- pectations of thoBe Who believe thai by humane and peaceful Influences the Indian can be led to abandon the babits of savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations. Wjt fiie have already accomplished ju the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, tbe remarkable succeaB which has attended the experiment of employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among ihe wildest and most intractable, and I he general and urgent de sire expressed uy them lor tne education ot their chlldien, may be taken as sufficient proof that tney win ue tounu capable oi tuiu.iiuiiisiit much more if they continue to be wisely and ..i..l..

I therefore earnestly recomnieuu ihe enactment of a law enabling ine government to give Indians a title in lee, inalienable lor twenty-live years, tothe friu lands assigned io tbem by allotment. I also repeat the recom mendation made in my lirst annual message, that a law bepasaeii admitting Indians who can f;lve satisiaciory proof of having, by their own abor, supported their families lor a number of years, and who are willing to detach themselves lrom their tribal relations, to the benefit of ihe honiesled act. anil to urant them paleii s cou tain'ng the anic provision of inalienability for a certitiu period . Ibe experiment of sending itniuuueroi inuian children, ol both sexes, tome liaiupton Normal and Agricultural Instmi'e.in Virginia. in receive an elementirvtCng'ish education and practical in struction in lariniiig and oiliet uai lul indiisii ins, bas led to resul.sso proinisiuti that it thouuhl exiiedient lo turn over the cavalry barruckn at Ivarllsle, in I'eliiiBVtvauia.lo tue itneiuu iie,in mentlor Ihe establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale.

These institutions will commend themselves to the liberality of congress, aud to the plulau throuic uiunillceuce ot the American people. Last spring lnloril.ation was received of the organization of an extensive movement in the western states, tueonjecioi wnicu me oc cupation by unauthorized persons oi certain lands in the Indian territory ceded by Ibe Cber okees to the government lor the purpose ol set- tieiuentcnt py otner inutan triuea. tin in 'Htn ni Aorti l issueu a itrociaiuutiuu warninir all tier.tnna strain 1 participation in such an attempt, and, uy tue co-ope ration oi a mm tarv force, the invasion was uromntlv checke-t It is toy purpose to protect the rights or the In dian inhabitants of that territory to the full ex tent ot tne executive power, uut it wouiu oe unwise to Ignore the fact that a territory so lara-e and so fertile, with a population so sparse. and with so great a wealth ol unused resources, will be round more exposed to the repetition or such attempts as happened this year, when tbe surrounding states are more densely settled, and the westward movement ot our population looks still more eagerly lor fresh lands to occu py. Under such circumstances the difficulty ol maintaining the Indian territory in its present state will greatly increase, auu tue inuian triors inhabiting it would do well to prepare for sucb a contingency. I. therefore, lully approve or the advice given to them by tbe secretary of tbe inte rior on a recent occasion , to divide among them selves in severalty as large a quantity of their lanus as xuey can cultivate, to acquire tuuivmu al title in fee. instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the balance ol their lanus may ue dis posed ot by the government for their benefit. By adopting sucb a policy, Ihey would more cer tainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions, und at tne same time promote tueir progress in civilization and Drosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state ot toings in tne territory. The nuestion whether a change in the control f the Indian service should be made was in tbe fortv-flftb conxrrcss relerred to a joint commit tee of both bouses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message 1 expressed the hope that tbe decision of that question, then in pros pect, "would arrest further agitation of tbls subject, such aaritalion beiear apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well us the Indians memseives." since men, tne com mittee havintr reported, tbe Question has been decided in the negative by a vole In the house of representatives. For the reasr.ns here stated, and in vtew of the fact that further uncertainty on this point vtlll be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation, to weaken tho discipline of the ser vice, and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress fcr tbe government and improvement of the Indians. I respectfully recommend that tbe decision arrived at by congress at its last session be permitted to stand. The efforts made bv the department of tne tn terisr to arrest the depredations on tbe timber tanos oi tne united states nave oeen continued. and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in tne courts or tne united states; others having been settled, the trespassers offer ing to make payment to the government for tbe value of the timber taken by them. Tbe proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the treasury, far exceed in amount thesams ap propriated uy congress tor tnis purpose, a more important result, however, consists in the fact tnat tne destruction ox our public loresxa uy depredation, aiuiouim suun cases still occur, has bean greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and sufficient provision to that end is made by congress, sucn trespass, at least tnose on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, ex cept in tbe territories where timber for the daily requirements ot the population cannot, unuer the present state ot tbe law, be otherwise ob tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten lion of congress to the recommendation made by the secretary of the interior, that a law be enacted enabling tbe government to sell timber from tbe public lands without conveying the tee, where such lands are principally valuable lor the timber thereon, sucn sales to be so rear uiuiett as to cotuorm to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the same time lrl,ll,,,,uJui1., umuninv H.i.,ti...i nttii. ulutett as to conform to domestic wants and jruarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment ol such a law appears to become a more pressing necessity every day. uy recommendations iu tormer messages are renewetl in layer of enlarging the lae-ililiea of tne department oi agricuuure. Agriculture is the leading interest and the permanent industry ot our people. It is to the abundance ol agri cultural production, as compared Willi our home consumpti n. anil the largely increased and nigiuy prumuoie mantel auro-vl wiucn we nave riijojeu tit recent years, tnat e are luantij in debted for our present prosperity as a people We must look for its continued maintenaace to the Bame substantial resource.
