PEACE TALK, Most peoplo can readily understand why Germany could not well expect to lio In a more favorable position than at present to gain desirable concessions ns terms of peace from the allies. This is not saying that Germany is weakened to tho point of ponce. In view of tho possession by the Germans of foreign territory on ovory battle front It is easy to see how the brunt of war has been made to fall heavily upon the regions forming the battlegrounds. Under all the circumstances, however, there might bo ground for the report that tho German Kaiser was responsible for the suggested interpellation of the Eovornmcnt regarding possible peaco in order to relieve tho government from initiating any discussion In this direc tion. Chancellor von Bethmanii-Hollwcg In reply to tho socialist Inquiry takes tho position that Germany In tho conscious ness of her success can decline respon Elblllty for tho continuation of tho war. Germany Is ready to consider peaco pro posals by the allies. Tho w'ar can ho terminated, however, only by a peace iwhlch will glvo tho certltudo that war will not return. Tho gist of tho matter seems to be that eo long as the allies continue to talk of annihilating Gorman power peace Is not probable. Tho chancellor of tho German empire thus seeks to throw upon tho entente allies all responsibility for further war. Germany has won success on every liattle front, nnd It is held to bo the duty of tho nlllos under all tho circum stances to proposo peace. Germany now Indicates her readiness to mako peaco on tho right conditions. It re mains to bo seen whether tho nllles can be brought to accept conditions which would b acccptnblo to Germnny. Tho allies, on tho other hand, have stipulated that they will not mako peace until Germany Is brought to their terms, Apparently tho war must continue until the two sides are brought much closer togothcr than they aro at present. mn cost of living and iietteh fahmi.vcs. fioroo of us aro making tho mlstnko of (seeking a remedy for tho high cost nf living In partisan politics.

TIME TO RESTRAIN THE SPIRIT OF PARTISANSHIP. He is a big man who makes no mistakes. He is a broad man who can be thoroughly and consistently non-partisan in a time of national need. President Wilson is a big man even though at times both mistaken and partisan. When the President championed the interests and rights of Americans in the face of foreign encroachment, the republi can leaders, including President Taft, forgot their partisan ship, and gave their fealty to the President of the United States. In this the republican leaders thoroughly reflected the sentiment of the great mass of tho American people regardless of political affiliation or race or creed. When President Wilson in his message to Congress championed national preparedness for the defence of our beloved country, he struck a responsive chord in the hearts of all true Americans. He sounded a lofty note of patriot ism in his closing paragraph in that document when he said : "Wo serve a great nation. We should serve it m the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men for self-government, justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play its part with en ergy, safety and assured success. In this we are no parti sans but heralds and prophets of a new age.'' How it jarred on sensitive ears to hear the President of the United States, who had thus appealed to American patriotism, quoted as saying: "The republicans have no issue in the next campaign except the tarifT and the democ racy is sure to win. Our constructive work has started an irresistible movement which cannot be stopped. Anyone who tells you otherwise is talking through his hat." To-morrow President Wilson confers with additional republican leaders concerning the carrying out of his policy of national defence. He expects them to lay aside partisan ship, although the next day he himself may again throw his partisan "talking hat" into the ring. Our columns bear witness to our frequent tribute to the good things done by Woodrow Wilson. We do not feel ca?. ed upon, therefore, to close our eyes or ears, when He for gets himself, when he asks republicans to turn the other cheek. We do not desire to discuss this incident from the per sonal point of view, but rather as an illustration of one of seri ous difficulties which under our political system ever faces this nation in time of great peril. A President of the United States cannot disassociate himself utterly from partisanship to-day, play the partisan to-morrow, and the day following appeal again effectively to a united American people. This is especially true on the eve of a great national campaign in volving the election of a chief executive. The need of leadership in non-partisanism in a great national crisis like that now confronting the American peo ple is all the more marked in view of the tendency of most people to carry their party with them at all times. Most of us are human enough to oppose any measure projected by a party or personal opponent. We have seen how the great Lincoln was constantly handicapped in his ef forts to lead in saving the nation, by the occasional extreme partisanship of both party friends and political enemies. A few rabid abolitionists who could not hold themselves while slavery survived, did not support Lincoln in his efforts to avert the great struggle which imperiled our nation. On the other hand, Douglas, Lincoln's former opponent on the stump in Illinois and his recent competitor for the presi dency, steadfastly and zealously supported him in that try ing hour, as did a host of other patriotic democrats. The immortal Lincoln was a statesman and not a mili tary genius. Under these circumstances his partisan ad visers occasionally handicapped his efforts to prosecute the war to a triumphant close. Jn these days when we are wit nessing the play of British partisan politics in connection with the European war, it is worth while for us to recall the chai'ge that partisan politics figured in our Civil War. General George II. McClellan, for example, had won some valuable victories in the early days of the conflict; he had organized, drilled and put in the field a magnificent army, which he had successfully led to within sight of the spires of Richmond, the Confederate capital. After seven days of furious fighting, McClellan's friends claim he was crippled and relieved from command because he was a demo crat. Then when Lee invaded the North and the authori ties were panic-stricken, McClellan was again called upon sincl at the bloody battle of Antietam he turned Lee back and forced the Confederates to cross tho Potomac. Whatever the merits of the case may have been, and whether the charge of partisanship was true or not, the mere charge of partisan politics evidently played havoc for a time with the military fortunes of the Union cause. That charge alone was calculated to generate a feeling of partisan bitterness that could not fail to interfere seriously with the efficient prosecution of the war. The American nation is not at war now. It is a time of tremendous peril, however. On the one hand we are told failure to provide means of national defence against armed Europe will invite foreign encroachment and precipitate war. On the other we are assured a great navy and a powerful military establishment, actual or within close reach, will tend to mako us aggressive and lead other na tions still further to seek to match our preparations for hos tilities, no matter what excuse may be advanced. We are at the parting of the ways as regards realiza tion of the American dream of promoting universal peace. We all want the same thing but we propose different means of attaining that end. Both propositions cannot be fully right ; both have good arguments to sustain them. If either one is right and we adopt the other, then peril will follow. In a crisis like this it is the duty of President Wilson him self as well as of republican leaders to forget party and par tisanship for the time-being and seek to pierce the veil of the future so far as possible! We all desire to avoid the mistakes of other nations that have led to war with all its manifold horrors and untold sacrifices and its indescribable sufferings. Most of us are ready to help hold up the arms of Presi dent Wilson in his efforts to solve the great problem of na tional preparedness aright. While republicans are adopting this patriotic course, it is hardly the part of wisdom to flaunt the flag of partisanship in the faces of those making this patriotic response to appeals to their Americanism. This is a time for straight thinking at Washington, as well as on the part of the American public. It is no time to stir up undue partisanship at home or indulge in sudden virtuous indignation expressed in terms of jingoism abroad. We cannot wisely try to punish Austria now for what we condoned in Great Britain or Germany. We cannot ef fectively solve the problem how to protect ourselves wisely from possible foreign aggression, if we allow the partisan taunt of "republican" or "democrat" to divert us from the paths of prudence and patriotism. lato In State and nation fur tho or ganization of agencies to promoto the purchaso and development of farms In many cases practically neglected or only a quaiter tilled, Better credit facilities to encourage the purchase of fauns are alieady on tho way, hut It Is a far cry to the gonoral adoption of those Improv ed methods of cultivation which would ensure each Individual farmer largely in creased revenue, whllo keeping food sup plies within reach of the average con sumer. Wo can not expect reasonable food sup plies unless wo can Incioaso the produc tivity of our farms, for tho farmer Is entitled to a fair profit for his labor tho same as other classes of people. Woj can not do hotter In emphasizing this point than to quote tho words of David l.ubln, American delegate to the Inter national Institute of Agriculture at Hume, Italy, used In his address before tho national conference on marketing and farm credits held In Chicago. Among other things ho said that hotter markoUng conditions and adequate credit facilities for ngrlcultui.il operations will come In this country only when tho American fnrmor acts for himself In ad vocating legislation to foster nnd pro vldo now economic machinery. Mr. I.u liln also said: "Clornuin fnrmets, originally, woro not brighter llinn tho American farmers; In fact, they woro not nearly as briut. It ls only now when thov nro operating under their effective economic systems that tho German farmers havo become rlghtcr than tho Amerlcnns. In fact, they havo become the brightest farmers In the world, lint It was not tho Oer innn farmers who Invented nnd devised these effective economic systems nnd ob- alned their legislative enactment. They were devised nnd given legislative enact ment by tho government." In other words, wo ran not depend on Individual effort and expect tho best re sults. To-day great business enterprises nro depending on a combination of In dividuals and resources to achieve re sults. So In agriculture, U'o general ndoptlon of right methods ran bo brought nbout only through co-operallvo effort. 1-ack of resources mokes It Impossible for our farmers to act together and It remains for legislative authority to act for tho promotion of this greatly to be desired consummation, Involving the wel fare of our entire population, consumers ns welt ns producers.

What stubborn creatures women ai She would not listen to It She'd never boiled a cook, sho said, and simply could not do It. And so ho went and told tho cook to heat a tub of water, "We hato to boll you, cook," said we, "but just simply gotter." But cooks, like children, oftentimes by kindness nre spoiled; In splto of all our nrguments that cook would not bo boiled.

Kenneth Johnson, tho 10-ycar-nld son of Mr. nnd Mrs. Oeorgo W. Johnson of Bprlngfleld, was drowned In the Connect icut river when tho rowboat In which ho nnd his father were crossing tho stream was crushed by floating Ice. This Is the second child In the family to die by drowning. When about In mid-stream a piece of co struck tho frail craft and crushed It, Mr. Johnson Jumped upon a section of Ice which boro his weight, but tho boy threw himself out of tho sinking boat upon Ico which gave way beneath him nnd he was swept under the Ice and carried down stream. Both father nnd son screamed ns they Jumped from tho boat and f'hnrles D. Cutler, who lives near tho river bank hurried to their aid. Ho was unable to do anything to save the hoy. The father was got ashore In Cut ler's boat, Persons who saw tho man nnd his son embark from the Vermont snore feared for their safety as the river was filled with floating Ice, much of It thick enough to crush even n heavier craft than that used by the Johnsons. At tho point whore tho Johnsons started to cross tho current Is strong and for sev eral days lee has been forming. A search mado for tho body of tho boy was ham pored by tho largo quantity of Ico and unless tho body has been caught beneath tho Ico It has probably been swept a Ions way down streum, Tho father's escapo Is little short of tho miraculous ns the Ico was Isirely thick enough to support hlni and had It given way he would have boon swept away.

'n Take Fingerprint of Heckles Ante Drivers Passing nf Fnmnun IlulTiiln Huge Profits nf Deni er. In Nnrcollos. (Longncro's Now York letter.) Shipbuilding and ship repair yards In New York harbor aro working under such a prossuro that orders for new harbor equipment, Including tugs, bar ges nnd lighters which some of the allroad companies aro seeking to place nro going begging. Contracts for the lollvery of steel tugs and carfloats aro also being refused unless delivery Is not required before tho close of 101(5. So heavy Is tho pressure on local re pair ship yards that they aro also de clining orders for early and badly need ed repairs on many ocean tramp steam ers, which have been working so In cessantly during recent months as to cause serious complaints of lenkago by receivers of Import freight. Tho situa tion ns regards ocean freight Is aggra vated by tho fact that tho great ship repair yards In England and other for eign countries aro so busy on naval re pair work that It Is only possible to have tho necessary overhauling dono In American ship yards. Ono reason given for tile declining of orders for harbor equipment for early delivery Is tho growing fear that tho yards will bo un able to securo tho necessary supplies of steel and other metals. An Indication of conditions In this trade Is furnlshod by the fact that when tho government called for bids on two new dreadnoughts during the past week, tho hlds received wero so high as to causo their rejection by tho navy department. The number of deaths resulting from the reckless driving of automobiles has reached such alarming proportions that stringent measures are to be adopted In tho future for the handling of this class of offenders. In tho boroughs of Manhattan nnd Brooklyn 117 children were killed during the 11 months from December 1, 1014 to October 31 of tho present year. The total deaths for tho entire city, due to reckless driving, amounted to 41T. It Is claimed that the existing laws governing operntlon of au tomobiles contain serious defects, which llrst of nil must be remedied beforo ef fective measures can bo pursued In deal ing with reckless drivers. At the pres ent time thero Is an absence of legal requirement providing that tho owner of an automobile shall procure a license to drive It. Most of tho prosecutions for speeding are of owners, and It Is not possible to control them by the cancell ing of a driver's license, the most effec tive method of handling similar cases of hired chauffeurs. The present method of recording previous convictions for speeding Is faulty, and It has been sug gested that tho finger prints of all of fenders bo taken In order that previous convictions for reckless driving may bo automatically disclosed. It Is also rec ommended that the most effective method of controlling the situation Is to give to the city of New York iho entire power over licensing all those who run motor vehicles, which at tho present tlmo is vested in tho State. Black Diamond who for over D) years has been the loader of the buffalo herd In the Bronx Park Zoo, ns well as tho fa ther of most of them, nnd of many othors that have been sold or exchanged, was put to death during tho past week. Black Diamond had reached an ago when he was unable to endure the cold of the winter months, His sufferings wcre such during the winter months of last year that It wns decided to spare him tho tortures of another slcgo. Last August ho was placed on tho auction block and knocked down to a butcher for J.T09. Permission was given to koep him at the Zoo until the coming of cool weather, and that having nrrlved, he was brought forth to his doom. Black Diamond was tho largest bison In cap tivity, and his likeness was known all over tho country, for he was tho model of the buffalo on the I'nited States treas ury ten dollar bills, nnd more recently on the new "buffalo nickels." During tl'.e past few weeks many offers were mado to prevent the killing of Black Diamond. One offer was to take him to a ranch In southern Colorado, but It wns decided that tho old leader could never stand tho trip. Many offered to buy him from tho butcher and give him back to the Zoo, but this was Impossible In view of the fact that it would only mean another winter of suffering for him. Drug users throughout tho city arc beginning to feel tho effects of the rigid measures which have been tnken by the police department In suppressing the Il licit sale of drugs. During the past week twenty-eight victims presented them selves at Bellovue hospital for treatment because of their inability to securo sup plies of heroin, cocalno or morphine to which they had boon addicted. Over ono hundred men nnd women engaged In tho Illegal drug trade havo been arrested dining the past six weeks. Tho chief difficulty encountered by tho pollco In stamping out the sale of these drugs is the enormous prollt mado by tho pod iers, io gnm wmch they will take a chnnco of getting caught and of rccclv ing a prison sentence. Ono ounce of heroin, cocalno or morphine contains about 1C0 "decks", as tho llttlo packets which the pedlers distribute nre called. Heroin costs 

JIO.M an ounce, cocalno $1 and morphine ss.75. In tho theatrical district a "deck" of heroin has been helling for J5, which would mean a pro. fit of over ISO on an Investment of $10.50. In the poorer districts of tho city, adul terated drugs are peddled for tl to 3 a 'deck", nnd It Is said that the pedlers often get thirty "decks" out of a dram of drug, or 240 "decks" to nn ounce. The mobilization of Now York's army of 43,000 snow shovelers in preparation for tho coming campaign ngnlnst snow storms this winter has been ordered by tho street cleaning department. Ono hundred nnd throe registration stations where prospective laborers may leavo their names and addresses so they may bo summoned nt the first attack of win ter havo been opened through tho city. It Is Intended to organize this army on tho same footing ns that of last year, It will consist of three divisions, each containing 15.W0 men. Klght hours will constitute a day's work, and tho wnges will be J2.40 per day. It l oxpected that some difficulty will be experienced In re cruiting tho nrmy to Us full strength be cause of the fnct that there Is less un employment In tho city for this tlmo of the year than Is usually to ho found, In the event of heavy storms nearby cities will have to be called upon to furnish import Stvanty largs plows Or I von by motor trucks will bo utcd in piling the snow, which will bn hauled and dumped by contractors. Tho great stoios of shovels, picks, and hand and motor ploughs have been given a through over hauling, and It Is believed that the In. vnslon of winter will find tho city In a thorough slnto of preparedness to handle whatever situation may arise. Tho hoboes coming to Now York this winter, Intending tu bo fed and lodged by tho charitable Institutions of tho city nro doomed to an unwelcome surprise There will bo no Hotel do (Sink to offer accommodations, such as was In oxls tenco last year when the number of men out of employment who came to this rlty from different parts of the country had reached such largo proportions that tho city authorities turned over a build ing to them for their use. Officials of various city departments upon whom Tails the burden of taking rare nf the Indigent havo mapped out a campaign which It Is believed will tend to keep away tho greater number of train in and j Vagrants who flock hero annually to j swell thp army of unemployed. It Is proposed to pick up every tramp on the streot and put him nt hard manual la bor, and to make every vagrant commit ted to nn Institution work for his food and shelter. Tho munlr'pal lodgln:! house has accommodations for S.iVn home less men whero they can get bed and board and a chance at employment. 1? a Job Is ohtalned and refused they will be put to work on streets, hocks nno , wood yards. Thero Is also need for man ual labor at tho Staten Island farm col- ony, and In cleaning ground nnd digging tho foundations for now buildings at Hikers Island. While no doubt thero aro many who will welcome those opportuni ties of existing during tho winter, should employment be scarce and the weather severe, It Is believed that they will act as K damper to tho professional tramp and vagrant. New York city Is to have a reserve po llco force of approximately 4.V'I0 men. This scheme Is the latest slop in the pro gram of efficiency undertaken by the pros- 4cnt pollco commissioner to anticipate tho occurrence In this city of catastrophes such as devastated San Franclsro, Johns town, or more recently cities along the Mississippi river by flood. This force will bo trained to tho last detail and will be known as the Citizens' Auxiliary of the existing force. At the name time every new member of the permanent pollco de partment Is undergoing a course In train ing that will mako him the equal nf the regular army private so far as physical competency nnd tactical Instructions nre concerned. In the auxiliary nrmy every employe of the city Is a potential polite man. nven the services of tho women workers will not bo overlooked, for It Is Intended that they shall bo enlisted to serve as nurses and, with the men, will receive Instruction In how to administer first aid. At tho present time tho pollen department has well under way a svstem of signaling by which every police station In the city may nt nil times be In com munication with police headquarters. Should earthquake or any calamity re sult In tho total destruction of the city's telegraph and other means of communica tion, tho pollco "wigwag" squad would be able to keep every policeman In direct communication with headqiintcrs.

GREATEST SEA DEPTHS. A piece of iron will sink to tho bot tom no matter how deep the water is, becnuso water Is only slightly compres sible. If water were highly compress ible, as air Is, the water at a great depth would be much denser, nnd therefore heavier, and an object would sink until It reached a point at which Its weight would be less than that of tho water which It displaced and there It would float, as clouds float In tho atmosphere. Hut a cubic foot of Iron weighs moio than a cubic foot of water at a depth of two miles Just as It does nt tho sur face, and therefore continues sinking until It reaches the bottom. The ocean has been sounded to a depth of li.'.nss feet, or over six miles. This Is Just off tho Philippine Island of Mindanao, Sev eral other points In the Pacltle show depths of over 39,000 feet. From the lowest soa depth to the highest moun tain peak Is 61,flP0 feet, which is about one-sovon-hundredth of the earth's di ameter. The Christian Herald. the AnoniniNEs of ei'iiope.
