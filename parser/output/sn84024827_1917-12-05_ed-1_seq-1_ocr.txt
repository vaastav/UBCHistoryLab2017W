Million Dollars Will Be Spent At Once On County Roads Asphalt Highway Bisbee to Douglas Assured. Cochise county is to have a million dollars worth of permanent highways In the near future. The voters of the county decreed it at the bond election held yesterday by a vote of five to cne. With six precincts (all email ones) not heard from, the total vote was 2,165 for and 581 against. If ev ery vote In the precincts was recorded against the issue, it could not change the result It was a splendid victory for prog ress and prosperity. Every precinct in the county reported, except Will- cox and Bowie, gave good majorities j for the bond issue. The Warren Dis trict voted yes on this vital improve ment 13 to one. Douglas gave only v two to one majority for the good roads bends. St. David was the ban-i 1. f , nt1no- K7 ' to Z for the bonds. ' Most of the rural I districts gave overwhelming majori ties for the bonds. a -Twenty-five Milea of Asphalt. The vote of yesterday means that the two largest cities of the county will soon be connected by a solid as phaltum highway 25 miles long and 18 feet wide. Today a steady stream ot travel jolts and bumps over the road j between Douglas and Bisbee. Summer j rains wash out large sections of this) road and winter windB blow a cloud ! of dust in the faces of travelers and 1 uncover rocks to hamper their way. The million dollars to be realized from the bonds will be used to build I , roads where they are needed the most, j Its distribution will be mont fair and j equitable and it will be handled by honest and competent men. I Surpasses Greatest Hopes. j The victory of yesterday for prog ress was greater than even the most ardent friends of the issue had hoped for. Two to one was the best that any good roads worker would predict and many feared the election would be close. But Cochise citizens rallied splendidly for this great improvement. : Their action will stand as a mounment j that will long be pointed to with pride f by the people of this section of the state.

General Dukhonin Is Murdered By Infuriated Mob (By Review Leased Wire) PETROGRAD, via London, Dec. 4. (British Admiralty, per Wirefess Press.) An official announcement was issued today signed by Ensign Krylenko. the Bolsheviki commander-in-chief, confirming the killing by in furiated members of the Bolshevik! of General Dukhonin, former commander-in-chief of the Russian armies, who recently was deposed because of his refusal to request German army offi cials to enter an armistice with Uie Bolsheviki. General Dukhonin was killed by be ing thrown from a train after the Bol sheviki forces had captured head quarters at Mohilev, where he had re mained after his deposition! General Komiloff, also a former Russian commander-in-chief and who some time ago started an unsuccessful revolt against the Kerensky government, fled from Mohilev before the arrival of the Bolsheviki forces. The text of the communication of Krylenko follows: "Today 1 entered into Mohilev at the bead of the revolutionary troops. The headquarters was entirely sur rounded without fighting. The last Obstacle to the cause of peace has fallen. "I cannot be silent on the sad act of lynch law practiced upon the for mer highest commander-in-chief. Gen eral Dukhonin. . Popular hatred sur passed the limits of reason, and in spite of all attempts to save him, he was thrown out of a railroad train at the Mohilev station and killed. The flight of General Konriloff the day be fore the fall of headquarters was the cause of this excess. "I cannot allow the banner of the revolution to be stained, and it is necessary strongly to condemn such acts. A revolutionary people are fear ful in a struggle but they must be soft after victory." General Dukhonin was dragged from a train In which it was intended to send him to Petrograd and beaten to death. Christmas Mail Is Arriving In France; Reported (By Review Leased Wire) WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IX FRANCE, Dec. 4. Christmas mail for the troops began to arrive in the Amer ican zone today.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW,. WEDNESDAY Western Metal Producers Will Protest Prices (By Review Leased Wire) SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 4. Whether on not western me ail pro duers will approve federal price fixing of silver or any other metals appears decidedly questionable in view of the prevailing sentiment expressed this afternoon at the opening session of the conference of western metal pro ducers at the commercial club. While no definite action was taken in the matter, the spirited debates in dicated a steadily growing sentiment in favor of launching. a vigorous pro test against government interference in the metal market especially with reference to silver. Oppose Profit Tax Violent opposition was also express ed to the excess profits tax law in its present form. While expressing a willingness to do their share towards helping in the war, even the confisca tion of their own property, if need be, the metal men insisted that the law in its present form was discriminatory and unjust to the metal piVducers. The proposition of the Idaho Mining association to the effect that the law 3hould be amedJ so as to.elimina:e all reference to capitalization and to provide for taxation on the basis on which individual int'jnies is based, met with strong support but action on this was deferred temporarily. Want Legislation Deferred In order that the various problems might be presented to conference in concrete form, committees were ap pointed to report tomorrow. One com mittee is to draft a resolution bearing on the excess profits tax. aho'Jier is to present data and reedtumendations re lating to the silver question and still another is to present data and recom mendations concerning lead and zinc. A telegram was sent tonight vo Sec action by the government on the sil ver question be deferred a general committee representing the confer ence can reach Washington. Seventy Producers Attend The conference was attendedxby 70 leading metal producers from Wash ton, Montana, Idaho, Nevada. Colorado and Utah, the largest delegation from outside states coining from Idaho. United States Senator Willim H. King deferred his departure for Wash ington in order to attend the meeting In order that he might be fully ac quainted with the desires of the west ern metal men. . Russians Have Right to Peace, Army Man Saysl (By Review Leased Wire) 

STOCKHOLM. Dec. 4. The pro German press in Sweden is greatly elated over the reoort that Lieut. Col. i William P. Jdson. chiefly of the Amer-I lean military mession to Russia, paid j a friendly visit to Leon Trotzkv. the' Bolsheviki foreign minister at Petro-j grad, and -assured hira that Russia had a right to start peace negotia tions" and that "the time for menaces againts the Bolsheviki had passed." The Dagbladet says: "This means, assuming that Lieu tenant Colonel Judson acted under in structions from Washington, that the entente may expect little help from! America m a war to the bitter end Even newspapers friendly to the allies see in Colonel Judson's report ed action idications that "America in clines to accept the conseqences of the Bolshevviki rule, and that France and England will be left to carry on the war alone." j The Russian minister to Sweden, j M. Goukevitch, is openly Incredulous1 concerning the report. He said he did not believe it and believed that It was either a direct falsehood or rad been improperly reported over the Et hevlki controlled telegraph wires. The Petrograd telegranh agency, which is controlled by the Bolsheviki, on Monday announced 1 that Lieutenant Colonel Judson had psld an "official visit to the Smolny Institute," the Bolshevik! l.eadquar ' ters, and that the visit had caused a sensation In entente allied diplo matic spheres." ' Associated Press Special Leased Wire HUNS TAKE MOKE CARE OF THEIR or (By Review Leased Wire) President Wilson, In a message to congress that Is regarded as. one of the most momentous declarations in American history, again has enunciat ed, but more strongly than before, America's purpose In the war. He also asked congress to declare war on Austria-Hungary, the chief al ly of Germany, but failed to include in his request Turkey . and Bulgaria. Germany's other allies, declaring that were "mere tools, and do not yet stand in the direct path of our neces sary action." The president re-asserted that Ger man power as now constituted must be crushed and that then, when the eGrman people have spokesmen whose word can be believer, "we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace and pay it ungrudgingly." "Let there be no misunderstanding," the president said. "Our present and immediate task is to win the war and nothing shall turn us aside from it un- till it is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of materials, is be ing devoted and will continue to be devoted, to that purpose until it is achieved." ' Germans Getting Cautious. The Germans apparently have ceas ed the reckless expenditure of lives of their troops in trying to blot out the Cambrai salient held by General Byngs forces. After four days of on slaughts that have been characterized as equalling any previously witnessed during the war, only the artillery now is engaged. Although the Germans claim the capture of more than 6,000 British prisoners and more than 100 guns( reports from the British war office and from correspondents indi cate that the German loss in men kill ed, wounded or made prisoner was a terrible price to pay for the very small recovery of lost terrain. While it is expected that further at tacks will be delivered on the Cambrai sector, which is a salient vitally men acing to the important railroad junc tion of Cambrai, the British troops are declared now to be in a better position to offer stronger resistance than here tofore.' Artillery Still Active. As yet the anticipated renewal by the Austro-Germans of their infantry attacks on a large scale against the Italians on the Venetian front has not materialized. The enemy artillery, however, continues active from the Asiago plateau eastward toward the headwaters of the Piave river. On the. Trentino front an enemy attack which was prepared for by a heavy bombardment met with repulse. Alang the Piave valley the Italians again have dispersed Austrian bodies con solidating for attacks. No Change at Palestine. In Palestine the battle between the Turks and the British fr the posses sion of Jerusalem has not begun. Taken all in all, there is no change in the situation in this region, al though General Allenby's forces have carried out small offensives in the na ture of raids and killed or captured the occupants of Turkish trenches. The Russian general staff head quarters on the northern front ha9 been captured by the Bolsheviki troops under Ensign Krylenko. The headquarters capitulated without fight ing, but General Dukhonin, the commander-in-chief, who declined recently to carry out the orders of the Bolshe viki to negotiate an armistice with the Germans, was thrown from a train by Bolsheviki troops and killed. 80 Lives Lost When Sub Sinks British Steamer (By Review Leased Wire)
