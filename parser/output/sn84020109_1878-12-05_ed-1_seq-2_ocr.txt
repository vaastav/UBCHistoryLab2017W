Jtobext McAplifTe, recently a police man of Omaha, had two jugs qnder the bed j ono contained whlsUy sjnd the other a sqlution of.cor,cenXrtcd lye. On Tuesday evening of last, week ho got Jiold of tho wrong jug: the two looking very much alike took a drink of lye and after four dayn of terrible agony, died. Had this man enlisted In Finch's army of Red IIbboners, ho would in all probabili ty not beeq wanting a drink out of any kind of jug, and been now alive. The papers say "Mr. McAuIifie was in the habit of drinking rsodcrately, but not to excess." But then it is not safe to bo fooling witii a jug at ajl, as hi3 sad case evidences. Little Rock, Aiik., November 30 L. S. Allard was shot in thq mouth and d ngerously wounded, at Hot Springs, last night, by hlp'son. Cad Allard. Family troubles were the cause. Both father and son formerly published a paper In Illinois, and at Hot Springs. L. S. Allard and the editor of this paper served in the Mexican war in the sarao company I, 4th Indiana infantry, Willis A. Gorman Colonel and were attached as the warmest of friends, although he was second Lieutenant and tho writer hereof a private soldier. We have not eeen Allard since a eljort time after the close of that war, thirty years ago, and have heard of hi,m but two or bree times since; but In those early days of our lives we jtnetv hjm to be a most honorable and generous man. Tbo above dispatch therefore gives us a shock of sorrow. The Chicago Times a few days sgp referred to womau suffrage in Wyom ing territory as follows: Woman suffrage is a failure in Wy oming, because, having acquired the right to exercise the elective franchise and having at the first election or two polled her ballot and fouud nothing exhilarating in the process, she no longer musters. Certain lewd women of the baser sort take a band in the glorious work of reform, but the wo men whose votes woud bo desirable if women are to vote, never go near tho polls. This sweeping assertion, does not ap pear to be in accordance with the facts. A gentleman citizens of- that Territory In a letter to the Infer Ocean. says : The better class of females are large ly represented at the polls here. They are accompanied by mule friends or relatiyes, end 1 have never seen elec tions conducted In any other Western city ae orderly as they are here. The influence of good and pure women at the polls has proven mnst salutary for good, and thus far I have failed to see any evidences of their degradation, inconsequence of their havinc been clothed with the elective franchise. My own observation and the ex pression of. opinion which I have hoard on the subject, lead me to assert tHat -oman suffrage is a complete success. And Gjen, Thayer, late Governor of that Territory., in on of his Messages said: Woman suffrage has. now been in practical operation in out; territory for six years, and hsB. during' the time, increased in popularity and a the confidence of the people. In my judgment, its results have been ben eficial, and Its Influence In favorable to the bet Interests of the community. A right or privileze. once eranted, Ir rjot easi'v surrendered. In this oaap it is difficult to perceive any good reason why St should be. The Chicago Times Is not good au thority on any subject. The forty-fifth Congress assembled last Monday, a.nd upon the fact being communicated to U)p President, his annual message was read by his pri vate Secretary. The message aB a whole, is very statesmanlike In character, and will be general' deem ed satisfactory. HIb referenoe to the outrages committed In some of (he southern states in the recent election for members of Congress la a Btrong indication that he at last realizes that he is the victim of misplaced confi dence. He says: "xx the 8'atea of Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and In some particular con gressional districts outbide of those states, the records of the election seem to compel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden, and their participa tion in tbo elections not permitted to be either general or free." The President then promises : In the meanwhile itbecomes the duty of the executive and judicial depart ments of the government, each in its province, to inquire intoaud punish all violations of the laws of the United StateB which have oc curred. I cau but repeat what I said in this connection in my last message, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to ferego a renewed appeal to the legislature, the courts, the executive authorities and the people of the states where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance towards bringing to justice these offendersand preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and. to seoure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty. Regarding the rights of citizenship and the puritj' of elections, his re marks are excellent. He says: It Is the right of every citizen, possessing the qualifications preecribed by law, to oa-t one unintimidated ballot, and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long.as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as well as formally, submission to results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and clieerful'y, and all the depart ments of the government will leel the true vigor of the popular will thus ex pressed. No tempornry or adminis trative interests of the government, however urgent or weight.?, will ever displace the zeal of our people in the defence of the primary rights of oltl zenphip. They understand that the protection of liberty requires the maintennnoe iu full vigor of the man ly methods of free speech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sustain the full authority of the government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights The material progress and Influence of tho states depend on the protec tion offered to their citizens. There can be no such protection, no pros perity without peace, and tho whole country is deeply interested In the grow.th and prosperity ofall its parts. While the country has not yet reaohed a complete unity of feeling and reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so Beri ously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with inoreainR force. The power of public opinion will override all political prejudioe, all sectional or state attachments, in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and charaoter "Citizen qf the United States" shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them unchallenged securi ty and respect.
