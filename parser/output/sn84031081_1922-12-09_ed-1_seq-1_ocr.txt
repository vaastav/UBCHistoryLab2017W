Albuquerque, New Mexico, Saturday, December 9, 1922 rmcK FIVE CENTS, MOBNING ABOLITION OF RAILROAD LABOR BOARD ADVOCATED BY HARDING IN MESSAGE Prohibition Enforcement and Farm Credits Are Also in the Forefront of the National 4 Problems Pressing for Solution, Congress Is Told by the President Washington, Dec. 8. President Harding, addressing congress in person today on the state of the union, placed transportation situation, prohibition enforcement and farm credits in the forefront of the national problems pressing for solution. Also he took occasion to reply directly to those whom he said had assumed that the United States had taken itself "aloof and apart, unmindful of world obligations." He declared these gave scant credit for the "helpful part" America had assumed in the arms conference. )f tlio urobilin Ion Munition. l!1S at this moment of the problenf the executive ussorU'd, tlii'ro were conditions of enforce ment "which savor of nation wide scandal." He made no recommendation on this score but announced his pur poses to call an early conference of the governors of the states and ter ritories with the federal authorities to formulate definite policies of national and state co-operation hi administering of the laws. Recent Kail htriUe , Turning to the recent railroad aMrike the president proposed that the federal tribunal dealing with disputes between the carriers and the workers be given ample au thority to enforce its decisions. He voiced a preference for abolition of the railroad labor board and the placing of its functions under an enlarged Interstate Commerce Com mission. Should the decision be to continue this In existence, how ever, he suggested that the parti san membership be abolished to the end that the tribunal be im partial and the headquarters be moved from Chicago to Waahi-ng-ton so that it might be in direct contact with the commission. Widened Farm Credits The only specific recommenda tion of the executive for enactment of legislation at this time, the short session of congress related to the permanent establishment of wid ened farm credits, lie urged both ample farm production credits and enlarged land credits through en largement of the powers of the farm loan board and reminded con gress that special provision must be made for livestock production credits. Other,, recommendations , Included: ' Other Recommendations Registration of aliens. More rigid examinations of eml grants at embarkation ports. Federal assistance in the educa tion of aliens. A constitutional amendment giv ing congress authority over child labor. A constitutional amendment re stricting the issue of tax-exempt securities bv tho federal govern ment, the states, municipalities and counties. A study by congress of the wide spread difference between produc tion costs an,i prices to consumers The survey of a plan to draw all the resources of tho tuition, human and material, for national defense. A fostering Interest by tho na tional government in constructive ship operating companies to thirty million dollars, Elimination of sections giving vessel owners income tax exemp tion on profits Invested In the building of new ships and on re ceipts from tlio sale of vessels, provided these receipts are used to build new ships. Adoption of a provision that no contract between the government and a ship owner for thP extension of government aid shall extend jnorc than fifteen years. Insertion of a provision that no applicant for a contract for gov ernment aid shall be refused until after public hearing. Addition of a provision that loans from the construction fund shall not be extended to corpora tions for the building of vessels to carry the products of the corpora tions. "Reduction from 73 to 50 per cent In tho amount of tonnage which a vessel owner must have under the American flag In order to receive government aid. General World Condition The president began hbi address by calling the attention of congress to general world conditions, which, he said, still were seriously dis turbed as a result of the war. lie asserted that "tho inevitable read justment of the .social and econ omic order is not more than barely begun," and continued: "There never again will be precisely tho old order; indeed, I know of no one who thinks it to be desirable. For out of the old order came the war Itself and the new order, es tablished and made secure, never will permit its recurrence. ,"It Is no figure of speech to say we have come to the test of our civilization. The world hns been passing Is today passing through a great crisis. The conduct of war Jtself is not more difficult than the solution of the problems which necessarily follow. I am not speak-

The ' reference is to our own social, financial and econ omic problems at home. These things are i.ot to be considered solely as problems apart from all international relationship, but ev ery nation must be able to carry on for Itself, else its international relationship will have scant impor tance. Coal and Rail Strikes "Doubtless our own people have emerged from the world war tu mult less impaired than most bel ligerent powers; probably We have mado larger progress toward . re construction Had we es caped tho coal and railway strikes, which had no excuse for their be ginning and less Justification for their delayed settlement, we should have done infinitely better. But labor was insistent in holding to the war heights and heedless forces of reaction sought the pro-war lev els and both were wrong. "The railway strike accentuated tho difficulty of the American farmer. The first distress of read justment came to tho farmer, and it will not be a readjustment fit to abide until he is relieved. The dis tress brought to the farmer does not affect him alone. Agricultural ill fortune is a national ill fortune. "This congress already has taken cognizance of the misfortune which precipitate deflation brought to American agriculture. Your meas ure of relief and the reduction of tho federal reserve discount rate undoubtedly saved the country from widespread disaster. The very proof of helpfulness already given U the strongest argument for the permanent establishment of widened credits, heretofore tempo rarily extended through tlio war finance corporation. Farm Loan Ituicau "Tho farm loan bureau, which already has proven its usefulness through the federal land bunks, may well have its powers enlarged to provide ample farm production credits as veil as enlarged land credits. It is entirely, practical to create a division in the federal land banks to deal with production credits, with the limitation of time so adjusted to the farm turnover as tho federal reserve system pro vides for the turnover in the man ufacturing and. mercantile world. Special provision must be made for livestock production credits and the limit of land loans may be safely enlarged. Various measure;, rtre pending before you, und the best judgment of congress ought to be expressed in a prompt enact ment at the present session. "But American agriculture needs more than added credit facilities. The credits will help to solve the pressing problems growing out of tho war inflated laud values and the drastic deflation of three years ago but permanent and deserved agricultural good fortune depends on beUer and cheaper transporta tion. Here is an outstanding prob lem demanding the-most rigorous consideration of the congress and the country Transportation I ailed "In the last half of the year now closing the railways, broken in car rying capacity because of motive power and rolling stock out of or der, though Insistently declaring, to the contrary, embargoed his ship ments or denied him when fortu nate markets were calling. Too frequently transportation failed while perishable products were turning from possible profit to losses counted in tens f millions. "I know of no problems exceed ing in importance this one of trans portation. We have built 40 per cent of the world's railroad mileage, and yet find it inadequate to , our present requirements. When we contemplate the inade quacy or tooay, it is easy to be lieve that the next few decades will witness the paralysis of our transportation-using social scheme or a complete reorganization on some new basis." "Manifestly we have need to be gin on plans to co-ordinate all transportation facilities. We should moro effectively connect up our rail lines with our carriers by sen. We ought to reap some benefit from tho hundreds of millions ex pended on inland waterways, prov ing our capacity to utilize as well as expend. We ought to turn the motor truck into a railway feeder and distributor Instead of a de stroying competitor. Cannot bo Waived As.dc "This transportation problem cannot be waived aside. Tho de mand for lowered costs on farm products and basic materials can not be ignored. Rates horizontally Increased to meet increased out lays during the war Inflation nre nut easily reduced. When some very moderate wage reductions were effected last summer there was a five per cent horizontal re duction lit rate. I sought at that time, in a very Informal way, to have the railway managers jgo be fore the Interstate Commerce com mission and agree to a heavier re duction on farm products and coal and other basin commodities, and leave unchanged tho freight tar iffs which ft very large proportion of the traffic was able to bear. Neither the managers nor tho com mission saw fit to adopt tho sug gestion, so we had the horizontal 1'ootiuiK'd on rage Tvut D

(ieorges Clemen ceau, closing his visit to Washing ton this afternoon with a "formal" address, expressed the hope that diplomacy would find the wav to 1 bring America hack into European altairs. "I was greatly comforted." said the war time premier of France, "when I read in tlio message Of your president the following lines. They are not very long but they ure very suggest h e.

"So, you see," continued the Ti ger, "that even those who are sup posed to disagree, really agree at tho very, bottom of their feeling and reasoning power. That is what I ask, and I hope this is something like an overture that some light would be coming andi will lie ,ery glad If it conies from America" and I hope that diplo macy will have something to say about it, and talks may be engaged in, which, I am sure, can bring nothing but-good for us all." When t 'loinencoau's reference to tho president's messago was called to the attention of tho White House, it was said that there was no comment to ho made and that there was no intention of elaborat ing on the president's statement to j congress. t'leinenceau's address, delivered before an audience which included many diplomats, government offi cials and members of both houses of congress, was in its essence, the "peace message'' he first delivered in Chicago, but, apparently sensing that official Washington would judge of him and his mission by this speech, he spoke deliberately and chose his words with great precision. lie recited the slory of the war. paying tribute to the part America i ployed in It, but declared the j United States bad quit too soon I leaving upon Kurope all the re sponsibility for enforcing the treaty of Versailles, which he said was largely the work of American minds at tho peace conference.

Chief Deputy fred Foruoft and Deputies Charley Uanghart and Moisu tluticrrez in vestigated tho case. After an investigation of the scene of the boy's death and of the wound the officers arrived at the conclusion that the buy had been shot at close range, while silting on tho guard rail of the bridge. Tho shock of the bullcr, they be lieve, caused him to topple from the bridge.
