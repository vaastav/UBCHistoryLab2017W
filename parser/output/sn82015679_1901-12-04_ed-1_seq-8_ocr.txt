I bespeak the most cordial support from the Cor.frr.'ss and the people for the St. Louis exposition to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the Louisiana purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of expansion In our history. It definitely decided that w e were to become a great continental Republic, by far the for most power In the western hemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in our history the great turning points in our development. it is eminently litting that all our people should Join with heart iest good will in commemorating it. and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all the adjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making the celebration a note worthy event in our annals. We earnestly hoi) that forei irn nutiorw will -a rnrri : f e th deep interest our country takes in this ! exposition and our vkw of its importance irom eviry standpoint, and that they will participate in securing its success. The rational government should be represented Ly a full and compute set of exhibits. Th- people of Charleston, with great en ergy and civic spint. are carrying on an exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of the Con-gre-.. i heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the Charleston expo sition have requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the government exhibits whlh hnvp been at liuffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken the responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to help h r In her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be required to pay all thes expenses. I earn estly r ( mm-n-l that the "ongres3 appro priate at once the small sum necussary for this purpose. The I'an-American Kxposltion at Huffalo has just cloed. r.oth from the industrial and the artistic standpoint this exposition lias been in a hit;h decree creditable and useful, not merely to Uuffalo, but to the 1'nited States. The terrible tragedy of the President's assassination interfered ma terially with its bing a financial success. The exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy, because It represented an effort to bring Into closer touch all the peoples of the western hemi sphere, and give them an increasing sense of unity. Such an effort was a genuine 6crico to the entire American public. Smith son I it it Iiiwtltutlou. The advancement of the highest interests of national science and learning and the custody of objects of art and of the val uable results of scientific expeditions con ducted by t liO United States have been committed to the Smithsonian Institution. In furtherance of its declared purpose for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge among men" the Congress has from time to time given it other important functions. Such trusts have been executed by the institution with notable fidelity. There should be no halt in the work of the in stitution, in accordance with the plans which its secretary has presented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North American animals in the Na tional Zoological Park. The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended to the 1; ble consideration of the Con gress. Tlir Library of lonrrM, Perhaps the mo.-t characteristic educa tional movement of the past fifty years is that which has created the modern public library and developed it into broad and active service. There are now over f.""0 public libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In addition to ac cumulating material, they are also striv ing by organization, by Improvement in method and by co-operation to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widely useful and by avoid ance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce trie cost of it administration. In these efforts they naturally look foi assistance to the federal library, which, though still the Library of Congress, and mi entitled, is the one national library of the United States. Already the largest sin gle collection of books on the western hem isphere, and certain to increase more rap idly than any other through purchase, ex change and the operation of the copyright law. this library has a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of this country to American scholarship service of the highest importance. It is housed in a building which is the lr.rgcst and most magnificent yet erected for library uses, tlesources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly, ejuip it with the apparatus and service necessary to its effective use, render its bibliographic work widely available, and enable it to be come not merely a center of research, but the chief factor in great co-operative ef forts for the diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of Naming.

After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers w'ere able to sign a final protocol with the Chi nese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the measures taken by China in compliance with the de mands of the Joint note, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before the Congress, with a report of the pIenljotenlary on behalf of the United States. Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praise is due for the tact, good judgment and energy he has displayed in performing an exceptionally difficult and delicate task. The agreement reached disposes In a man ner satisfactory to the powers of the various grounds of complaint, and will con tribute materially to better future rela tions between China and the powers. Repa ration has been made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and punishment has been Inflicted on the officials, however high in rank, recognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak. Official examinations have been forbidden for a period of Ave years In all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated, and edicts have been, issued making all officials di- rectly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of vio lence against them. Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign repre sentatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary maintain permanent military guards; by dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea; and by allowing the temperary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line. An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into China. China has agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states, societies, and individuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses of the military expeditions ?ent by the various powers to protect life and restore order. Under the provisions of the joint note of December, Vsm, China haa agreed to re vise the treaties of commerce and naviga tion and to Lake such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the toreign powers may decide to be needed. The Chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bet tering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tien-Tsin. tne centers of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy board, in which the Chinese government is largely represented, has tteen provided for the im provement of the Shanghai river and the control of its navigation. In the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad valorem duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain free of duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement. During these troubles our government has unswervingly advocated moderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the empire and the modern world; while in the critical peiiod of revolt and massacre we did our lull share In safeguarding life and prop erty, restoring order and vindicating the national interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths, doing what lies In our power to foster feeling of good will, and leaving no effort untrieei to work out the great policy of full and fair inter course between China and the nations, on a footing of equal rights an dadvantages to all. We advocate the "open door" with all that it implies; not merely the procure ment of enlarged commercial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by the waterways with which China has been so extraordinarib" favored. Only by bring ing the people of China into peaceful and fritnüly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition. In the attainment of this purpose we neces sarily claim parity of treatment, under the conventions, throughout the empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other powers. 1 A N - A 31 Hill CA X COX CS II ESS.

When President McKin ley died, our Nation in turn received from every quarter of the British empire ex pressions of grief and sympathy no less sin cere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially recipro cated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world we received at the time of the President's death, assurances ot such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people. ln the midst of our affliction we reverent ly thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and we firm ly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these International relations of mutual respect and good will.

What the Department of Agriculture In Endeavoring to Accomplish IrIie- Inning Cattle. CHICAGO. Dec. 3. The fifth annual con vention of the National Live Stock Associa tion began here at the Studebaker Theater to-day with 500 delegates present. The delegates were called to order by President Springer, who said he understood there were twenty Governors of States in the city and -he Invited them on the stage. Governor Yates, of Illinois, was the only Governor present, but Mr. Springer said the rest of the distinguished gentlemen would appear during the convention. Mr. Springer then delivered his annual address. The report of Secretary Charles F. Mar tin, which followed the president's address, was devoted to the work accomplished during the past year by the different com mittees and officers of the org-anlzation. The membership is increasing and the finances are more satisfactory than ever. The feature of the afternoon session was the address of Secretary of Agriculture Wilson. He said: "A well-arranged system of rotation con tributes greatly to the uniform utility of the soil, and is also one of the readiest means by which to get rid of insect pests. The Department of Agriculture is search ing the world over for plants that may be useful In the several States and Territories of the United States, to be used as features in systems of rotation. Where a locality becomts addicted to the habit of growing one crop year after year, the average soil deteriorates unless fertilizers are applied, whether the crop be cotton or wheat, or whatever is sold from the soil.' "It is found profitable in some parts of the United States to grow ruta baga tur nips and feed them to domestic animals. In other localities the mangel wurzel is most in favor. The cabbage, potato and other vegetables are useful along this line when their price is low. The sugar beet has been tried and gives a very sat isfactory tonnage. I do not think it needs demonstration to show the wisdom of growing something of this kind to feed to domestic animals ln winter. The growing of the sugar beet under a system of ro tation will obviate the necessity of buy ing the fertilizers that so heavily handicap the people who grow sugar in tropical countries. "The Department of Agriculture Is try ing to find markets for the products of the dairy and of many other things in foreign countries. Wherever we go. wheth er east, west or south, we meet represent atives of European countries as competi tcrs. who buy the grains of the North west and turn them Into dairy products uoon which they make a fine profit, in addition to maintaining the fertility of i their soils. It is a transfer of plant food from our country to theirs; it is an ac knowledgment that we lack either the skill or the enterprise to use our raw ma terial to the best advantage. The hasten ing poverty of many soils where grains are grown for sale admonishes us that we must stop selling plant food in the shape of grain that are raw material for other nations." Resolutions indorsing the reference to the President's message to the propriety of ir rigating the arid lands of the country and urging the appropriation of adequate funds to construct huge reservoirs, were present ed by G. W. Maxwell, of Illinois, to the resolutions committee. They were adopted and ordered telegraphed to both houses of Congress. Prlie-Wiiiiilng Cnttlr. 

CHICAGO, Dec. 3. A Hereford Is the grand champion of all breeds in the fat cattle division of the International Live Stock Exposition this year. Chief interest for breeders centered to-day in the winner of the grand championship for steers or spayed heifer of the show. There were three competing breeds, Hereford. Short horn and Angus, but in the final judging the Shorthorns were eliminated. The win ning animal is Wood's Principal, a pure bred yearling shown by George P. Henry, of Goodenow, 111. This animal weighed 1,645 pounds. The Aberdeen-Angus repre sentatives were Empress Damask, calved in April. lsW, and weighing 1.430 pounds, be ing the property of Collin Dysart, of Nachusa, 111., and the yearling steer Tip top, weighing 925 pounds, the property of S. IJradfute & Son. of Cedarville, O. The re sult of the contest ln the first class for Hereford bulls, three years old or over, was a surprise to those who had expected Pro tector, F. A. Nave's entry from Attica. Ind., which had won the championship of England, to be. a elangerous rival for native entries. But Mr. Nave's fine animal won no better than fourth place. Choice Goods, a Shorthorn bull, shown by J. T. Robbins & Sons, .ttlca. Ind.. won the first prize in Its class. First prize for the best Berkshire sow, six months old and un der one year, went to James Itlley & Sons, Thorntown, Ind. About 20,000 persons visited the show to day. Canndlan Cnttle Quarantined. SALEM, O., Dec. 3. E. V. Vogleman, of the Buffalo United States Bureau of Ani mal Industry, has arrived here and placed In quarantine a herd of twenty-eiqht thoroughbred shorthorn cattle imported from Canada. The whole herd, the in spector says. Is subject to confiscation, and he is awaiting instructions from the Treasury Department. IN SPAULDING'S FAVOR. 'ew Hampshire Decision Acnlnst the University of Illinoi. CONCORD. X. H., Dec. 3.-The Supreme Court of New Hampshire in proceedings In which the University of Illinois was plain tiff and Solomon Spaulding, a wealthy banker of Nassau, the respondent gave a decision to-day in favor of Spaulding. The case had been trieel before with the same result. The suit grew out of the failure of the Globe Savings Dank, of Chicago, a few years acjo. Chafles Spaulding, son of the respondent, was treasurer of the bank and of the Uni versity of Illinois. The funds of the uni versity were swallowed up in the crash and the suit was brought against the elder Spaulding as one of the signers of the treas urer's bond. At the trial evidence was in troduced to show that erasures had been made on the face of the bond - after Mr. Spaulding signed It, and he was given a verdict. The appeal of the University of Illinois to the Supreme Court by to-day'a decision is denied. CROKER OLD AND WORN. Snj lie Cannot He n Field Home for Anybody Any More. NEW YORK. Dec. 3. In an interview with Richard Croker the Evening Post to day quotes the Tammany leader as saying: ,You won't see much more leading on my part in the future. I am getting old and worn out and I can't be a fteld horse for everybody any longer. I admit that the leader of Tammany should stay in New York all the year round, and I can't stay here for more than a part of the year. If I trfed to stay here all the time I could do no work at all. All this talk about my being State leader and trying to dictate in na tional politics Is nonsense. I am in no con dition to do any kind of leading, but. of course, I will always take deep interest in Tammany." When asked if he was training anybody to succeed him as leader he replied: "Oh, I have not come to that yet and I have not planned my future, except that I will go to England in January or February. The Tammany executive committee will meet next month, and you may hear more of the matter then." "Wn nt n Slice of the OH Field. BEAUMONT. Tex.. Dec. 3. Federal Judge D. I.

SHE IS NOW TOR REPORH. Empress of China linn Ileen Converted . -fw Heir Xot Yet Chosen. PEKING, Dec. 3. Chinese officials say that the appointment of a new heir ap parent to the throne will be delayed until the Emperor Kwang Su can discuss the question with leading men. The imperial edict deposing the former heir apparent, ,Pu Chun, son of Prince Tuan, the author of the Boxer troubles. Is generally considered as the strongest proof yet given of the sincerity of the Empress leaning towards reform. Considered with previous edicts, this last one appears to corroborate the belief among Chinese of ficials that the Empress sees the error of her anti-foreign policy of recent years. Yuen Shi Kal. the new viceroy of Chi-LI, arrived at Peking to-day. The chltf pur pose of his visit is to consult with the min isters of the foreign powers regarding the present situation. Prince Chinjr has not seen Paul Lessar, the Russian minister to China, since the former returned to Peking. Conversing with representatives of two of the foreign powers. Prince Ching said China would op pose Russian control of Manchuria if any of the powers would support her in so do ing. 

LONG OVERDUE SHIP. Arrival of the Roanoke at Ilonolnln Tlth Coal Cargro Afire. HONOLULU, Nov. 26. via San Francisco, Dec. 3. The American ship Roanoke, which was thought to have been lost at sea, be ing 162 days out from Norfolk, Va., bound for San Francisco, arrived here to-day in distress with her cargo of coal on fire. She left Norfolk last June. The Roanoke had an adventurous passage from the other side. Sept. 20 she was thought to be leaking. She was then off the Horn and found some hard weather. The crew were set to work at the pumps, and a windmill was rigged to help to keep water out of the hold. Nov. 25 the second danger appeared, when the vessel was said to be on Are. After that the water was allowed to rise over four feet in the hold and remain at that level to assist in fight ing the fire. First Officer Moxon made a daring trip into the hold among the cargo of coal and amid the gas to locate the fire, and he succeeded ln doing so. It was decided to head for Honolulu, and the vessel was accordingly directed this way, this being the port which could be most quickly reached. She is thought to be badly damaged. AYRES HAD A REVOLVER THREE "WITNESSES TESTIFY TO 1IAVIXG SEE IT IX HIS ROOM. AH Were Intimate Friends of Mr. Hotline Alleged Victim Trlnl Drawlns to a Close. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The case of Mrs. Iola Ida Bonlne, on trial for the murder of James Seymour Ayres, jr., Is expected to go to the jury the latter part of this week. Three witnesses, Intimate friends of Ayres, were put on the stand to-day and swore they had seen a revolver in Ayres's room. Two of them Duncan Ti. Hubbard and Thomas Ford hael come from Michigan to testify. They said the revolver greatly resembled the one in evidence. The wrap per worn by Mrs. Bonine on the night of the tragedy was again the subject of dis cussion, the defense putting on the stand witnesses whose evidence was intended to discredit that given by Dr. Shaeffer, the government expert, who had testified that a careful examination of the wrapper had failed to disclose the presence of any blood spots thereon. When Duncan Ti. Hubbard, of Mount Clemens, Mich., who formerly lived at the Kenmore, took the stand he testified . that he had seen .a pistol in a bureau drawer In Ayres's room and Identified the weapon in evidence as being very similar to it. Thomas Ford, of Sanalac county, Michi gan, testified that while on a visit here last January Ayres had loaned him a revolver. The witness described th weapon in detail and said that the one with which the killing was done closely resembled it, even to cer tain marks on the handle. He also testi fied that when Ayres loaned him the pistol it was loaded. J. P. Stevens also testified to having seen a pistol in Ayres's room and partially identified the one ln evidence. A. E. Berkel yn, a dyer and scourer, was called to refute the testimony of Dr. Schaeffer, the expert who testified for the prosecution. He said it was a simple opera tion to remove blood spots from garments and that he had frequently done so In a manner to leave no trace of the spots. Witnesses also testified during the morn ing session of the court to the dances' fre quently given at the hotel, at which Ayres and Mrs. Bonlne were present, and to the bloody finger marks on the window curtains in Ayres's room. Fred C. Butter testified that he had par ticularly noticed Ayres and his companions about midnight of the night of the tragedy and it was his impression that they were under the influence of liquor. Carl E. Flather. a detective, testified re garding the rents and tears in the wrapper worn by Mrs. Bonine on the night of the tragedy, and Dr. Sterling Ruffln detailed the various tests commonly employed ln determining the existence of blood spots. He said he had given special study in refer ence to blood stains. He had examined sev eral specimens from the wrapper ln the presence of Dr. Schaeffer and Dr. Carroll, and he had found distinct evidences of blood on the wrapper. The wrapper also was torn. The witness was still on the stand when court adjourned. ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE. Dr. Ramiell Says AnarehlMtn Hatch Their t'onnplraele In GroKnhopn. WASHINGTON, Dec. C. About three hundred advocates of total abstinence at tended the Initial session to-day of the sixth annual convention of the American Anti-saloon League. The meetings will continue until Thursday night and will pro vide a programme of co-operation of tem perance advocates throughout the United States during the coming year. The con vention, after organization to-day, consid ered numerous reports of state superin tendents and field workers. Rev. Dr. H. W. Russell, general super intendent of the league, made a report, in which he pointed out the connection of sa loons with anarchistic movements. "The Anarchists of Chicago." he said, "hitched their consplracv of 1SG in the saloons. President McKinley's assassin learned his first lesson in anarchy In a saloon and was toasted and praised for his act by Anarchists In saloons at Paterson and Newark." He recommended a complete unification of all agencies devoted to the temperance cause. The afternoon session was occupied with memorial services commemorative of the late Hiram Price, formerly a representa tive in Congress and the last president of the league. Among those attending the convention are the Rev. H. N. Spear, secretary of the Anti-saloon League of Indiana, the Rev. Dr. Kapp and the Rev. E. O. Ellis, of Rich mond; also S. E. Nicholson, of Baltimore, formerly of Kokomo. and the father of the famous Nicholson bill. Insurance Cae Reversed. 

CINCINNATI. Dec. 3. The United States Court of Appeals to-day reversed the judg ment of a United States judge of the Dis trict Court in the case of J. S. Phelps and others against the Mutual Reserve Fund life Association. Judge Evans, of the Kentucky district, had granted an injunc tion against the receiver appointed by the state court, holding that the state court had no jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed this Judgment and dissolved the Injunction. COLOMBIA ALMOST QUIET A FEW INSURGENT HANDS WAGING GUERRILLA "WARFARE. Generally, However, the Country la Peaceful Liberal Leader Ex pected to Surrender. COLON, Colombia. Dec. 3. According to news just received here the Interior of the country is almost entirely quiet. Only a few scattered and insignificant Insurgent bands are here and there waging guerrilla warfare. This causes the government no anxiety. The triumph of the Colombian Conserva tive government on the Isthmus will doubt less incalculably strengthen the govern ment's hands. A peace commission com posed of Florencia Arosemena, represent ing prominent Liberals of Panama, Man uel Amador, representing the Colombian government, and General De La Rosa, sec retary to the insurgent General Domingo Diaz, who will act as guide, has already started for the interior to obtain an inter view with Generals Diaz and Lugo and to Induce them to give up the struggle and return to Panama. Senor Amador Is em powered to grant reasonable terms to Gen. Diaz in the name of the government. The peace commissioners are expected to return to Panama to-day. It Is already rumored, however, that Generals Diaz and Lugo are about to surrender. Pananome, in the de partment of Panama, and the port of Tu- maco, in the department of Cuacave, are now the only points under Liberal control. Considering the present strength of the government on the Isthmus, owing to the reinforcements landed here by the Colom bian gunboat General Plnzon and the fa cility with which this ship can bring In additional forces from Barranquilla and other coast points, and owing to the com parative quiet in the interior, it Is not un reasonable to conclude that the govern ment will soon be victorious at Pananome and Tumaco. There is a possibility of fur ther bloodshed at these places, but Gen. Alban's recent successes seem to make cer tain their capture. The best element of the Liberal party ln Panama say they would prefer the pres ent Conservative government than a Lib eral government if the latter is brought about by Liberal General Porras, for, they assert, Porras fluhts not for true Liberal ism, but for purely selfish ends. The guard of American marines, which up to to-day has been stationed in front of the offices of the railroad company here, has been withdrawn. A small detail of marines still accompanies the passenger trains across the isthmus. Both ends of the Isthmus are quiet and orderly. News from Boca del Toro is expected upon the return here of the British cruiser Tribune. Among the prominent persons killed on the government side during the recent en gagements on the isthmus were Colonel Manuel Pachon, Capt. Danlan Esplnosa, Lieut. Julio Ramos, Major Molinares and Kverado Paredes. Capt. Ferro and Lieut. Chevalier Ramos were gravely wounded. Gen. Francisco Castro, Lieut. Col. Cobls and Major Huertas were slightly wounded. Just prior to the capture of Colon the Liberal Generals Patino, Cortisoz and Triana were, all three drowned in an im prudent attempt in a small boat and through a rough and high sea, to reach, surprise and seize the Colombian gunboat Gen. Plnzon. On the side of the Liberals, Gen. San S. Zuniga was killed in Culebra engagements, while Senors Bunevasta, Moihos, De La Rosa and Amado Agueilar were wounded. Col. Barrera was also wounded in this engagement. He was shot In the leg Thursday morning and was only found Friday afternoon in a helpless con dition. He is now doing well at Colon, where he has made many friends. MAY

NEGKO IN THE SOUTH. Tfce Kind of Encouragement the Illaek Man 'eedn There. J. M. F. Erwin, in the Outlook. Most Northern men who have invested in Southern plantations have lost money. A few years ago Mr. Austin Corbln, of New York, and his associates bought Sunnyside, a plantation on the Mississippi river, in Arkansas. They determined to have the finest cotton plantation in the United States, and probably did have before they got through. But their cotton was like Horace Greeley's potatoes. Mr. Greeley said he raised mighty fine pota toes on his farm, but they cost about a dollar apiece, Mr. Corbln's people built a plantation railroad fourteen miles long, at a cost of $5.00) per mile, equipped . it with two locomotives, and then discovered that one mule on a cheap tram could pull everything they had to haul. They thought Italians would be better than negroes to raise cotton, so they imported about 1,100 Italians, and got rid of a good set of negroes to make room for the Italians. Most of the Italians had never seen a cotton plant or a mule. There was trouble with the mule. They got rid of the negro, but kept the mule tor the Italian to manage. In two or three years most of the Italians were sent home to Italy at the expense of tne company, and they tried to get the negroes back. Millions of acres of fertile wild alluvial lands can now be bought in the South for a few dollars an acre. When ln cultiva tion, government statistics show that the" money yield per acre from these lands is greater than that from any other lands in the United States on a staple crop. The negro can put these lands into cul tivation at less cost than any one ele. His health is good where the white man would die or be unfit for work most of the time. If necessary, he can live without dis comfort on four pounds of. bacon and one peck of corn meal per week. In clearing land he is an evolutionist. He cuts down and burns the growth under six inches in diameter, cuts a ring around the larger trees with his ax, and lets them die, rot and fall. The first year he plants his crop in practically a forest. Every year after harvest, in his leisure time, he plies and burns the fallen trees, and sets fire to the stumps; the decayed part will burn. In a few years his land is In a high state of cultivation, and nature has done a large share of the work. This looks shiftless to the Northern white man. He is a revolutionist. He cuts down and rolls off those big green trees, yanks out the stumps, spends about four times as much money as is necessary, gets malaria, and moves back North, convinced that Southern lands are a poor investment. The negro knows he can raise just as much cotton as his Northern white neighbor by letting the stumps alone and using a little more land: where land is so cheap this is a small item. Legislation has not supplied, cannot sup ply, the great need of the mass or negroes. Legislation made the negro . a citizen in law. but did It make him a citizen in fact? Legislation gave him a legal right to vote, but did it make him a voter in fact? "En force the law,", you say. How? There was a time when troops and United States mar shals were all over the South for this pur pose. I can tell you of an Instance where United States troops were at the door, a United States marshal was in the room, and the ballot box was stuffed. The man who did the stuffing was engaged most of the tlm ln pleasant conversation with the marshal. The marshal was conscientiously striving to do his whole duty. Again Quoting Uncle Zeke.

The man who stuffed the ballot box was not a very bad man. He was not a candidate for office. He had no hope for personal reward of any kind. He took a serious risk of being sent to prison, lie did what he be lieved to be a righteous act under the cir cumstances. He is dead now. and would not object to my telling this; he was my father. Don't judge him. my Northern friends, by the standards of your own peaceful white communities, where in character and intelligence there is some thing like equality between opposing can didates.

Give him a chance to substitute for himself industrial self-government in place of the Industrial imperialism that prevails on the large plantation. Put him on forty acres of land on a decent basis, and go away and let him alone. He will do the rest, and in doing it he will learn something that no school can teach. MR. HATS SPEECH An AffectinRT Hie United State, Central America and Europe. New York Herald.- "Wc no more want their territory than we covet the mountains of the moon." Sec retary Hay. Some of our foreign contemporaries se,em to be unduly exercising their minds about the part the United States is taking or may take in the Panama troubles. The London Dally Telegraph, for example, says that though the government at Wash ington is acting in strict accordance with its diplomatic rights It "may find It ex tremely difficult to adhere to its ideal pro gramme," while the Daily News declares "all this plays straight inx the hands of the United States, and that energetic power has not been slow to take advantage of It by forceful acts which may at any mo ment develop Into an occupation of the isthmus." The Morning Post thinks "it Is the manifest destiny of the United States to control the Isthmus," and expresses the opinion that no single European power is likely to oppose the Monroe doctrine. "If It ever cornea to a Question It will be between the United States of Europe ani the United States of America." The best answer to all this is to be found in the South and Central American policy of the United States, as officially pro claimed by no less an authority than Secre tary Hay and as recently as a week ago, when manifestly speaking with the ap proval of President Roosevelt, he said: "I think I may say that our sister re publics to the south of us are perfectly convinced of the slncerety of our attitude. They know we desire the prosperity of each of them and peace and harmony amun? them. "We no more want their territory than we covet the mountains of the moon. We are grieved and distressed when there are differences among them, but even then v.c should never think of trying to compo.-e any of those differences unless by the re quest of both parties to it. "Not even our earnest desire for peace among them will lead us to any action which might offend their-national dignity or their just sense of independence. We owe them all the consideration which we claim for ourselves." The fact is the government is now doing In Panama simply what it did in ls-5 and what it is treaty bound to do see that "the free transit of the isthmus from the one sea to the other may not be interrupted or embarrassed." This Is primarily the duty of the Colombian government, but when that government is unable to perform it. as it now is and was sixteen years ago, then the task devolves upon the United States. It Is its business to take whatever action may be necessary or advisable fur the accomplishment of that end. whether the landing of armed forces, the prevention of bombardment or dealing with military operations that Interrupt or menace free transit. This does not Imply any purpose or de?lre to take sides either with the Colombian forces or the insurgents. They are left to fight their own battles. The United States has nothing to do with an Internal insurrec tion or revolution. It simply exercises its treaty right and fulfills Its treaty obliga tion to see that transit across the isthmus is kept open and free. If, however, the situation shouM develop into one revealing designs upon the sov ereignty of Colombia from without Vene zuela, for example and menacing its na tional existence, then would come into play that clause of the treaty by which the United States "positively and efficaciously ' guarantees Colombian sovereignty over the Isthmus. rnld 2.V).0O0 for Fn 11 tire.
