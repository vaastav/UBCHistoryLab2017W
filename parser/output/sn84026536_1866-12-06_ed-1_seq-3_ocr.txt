of MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT t' t m1 gi.im to UieTwo Houses UI iu - Congrew at the Commencement of the Sec ond Session. FeUoic-CMzais of the Senate x ani Jowse o F.eiresentatites: After a brief interval the Congress of the Uni ted States resumes its annual legislative labor. n all-wise and merciful Providence lias abated the pestilence which visited our shores, leaving its cilvnUous traces upoa some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquility, and civil au thority have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United fetates. In all of the States.civil authority has superse de dthe cerciou of arms, and the people, ly their voluntary action, are maintaining their govern ments in tuli activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer "ob structed in any State by combiuations too power ful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial peoceedings and the animosities engen dered bv the war are rapidly yielding to the benelicient influences of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish ol eve ry patriotic heart ; and we will have accomplished our grandest national achievement when forget ting the sad events ol the past, and remembering onlv their instructive lessons, we resume our on ward career as a free, prosperous, and united peo ple. In my message of the 4th of December, 18G5, Coqtoss was informed of the measures which had becif instituted by the Executive with a view to the gradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the General Government. Provisional Governors hail been appointed, Conventions called. Govern ors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of the l iiised -States. Courts had been opened for the enforcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had been removed, custom-houses re-e.-tablished, and the internal revenue laws put in force, in order that the people might contribute t. the national income. I'ostal operations had been renewed, and efforts were being made to re store them to their former condition of tttick-ney. The States themselves had boen asked to take part in the high function of amending the Consti tution, and ol thus sanctioning the extinction ol African slavery as one of the legitimate lOMilts of ur internecine struggle. Having progressed thus far, the Executive I)o p.irlmont found that it had accomplished nearly all tint w as within the scope of its constitutional :t-ii!ioiilv. One thing, however, yet remained to ! Ik done i. -ft .re the work of restoration coiilu be euinpleled, and that was the admission to Con av ss of loyal Seuators and Representative from the States'wliose people had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General Government.--This question devolved upon the respective Hou ses, uhieh, by the Constitution, are made the judges of the elections, returns and qualifications i.f their own members; audits consideration :it once engaged the attention of Congress. In the meantime, the Executive Department -no oth'-r plan having been proposed by Congress eoi-.tiitued its efforts to perfect, as tar as was just ground for apprehenson that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legisla tion ; for this could not happen wnen the Constitu tion and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is made the "judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members," and may, "with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member. When I Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, he may at once be admitted or rejected , or, should there be any question as to his eligibility, his ere deutials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member, that he pos sesses the requisite constitutional and legal qual ifications. If refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to tho Government, and returned to his coustiuents, they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice in the legislative councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question, so vi tally "affec ting the restoration of te Uuion and the permanency of our present form of govern ment, my convictions, heretofore expressed, have undergone no change ; but, on the contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission of loval members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expe dient now. If this anomalous condition is right now if, in the exact condition of these States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them from representation, I do not tee that tbc question will be changed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation wiJl be nojstronger the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress " such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient." 1 know of no measure more imperatively demanded by eve ry consideration of national interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now unrepresented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary influence in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and fraternal feel ing. It would tend greatly to renew tho confidence of the American people in tho vigor and stability' of their institutions. It would bind u.s more close ly togethe r as a natioii, and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a Government founded upon the will of the peo ple, and established upon tho principles of liber ty, justice, and intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrcfraga b!y demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government. Tho admission of loyal members from the States now excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for invest ment, into the channels of tiade and industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of those St-ites, ami, by iuducing emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile rcgious now uncultivated, and lead to an increased production of those sta ples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and ti e commerce of the world. Isew fields of t nterprise would be opened to our pro gressive people, and soon the devastations of war would be repaired, and all traces ot our domestic ! differences effaced from the minds of our count ry ! men. i In our efforts to preserve "the uuityof Govern iment which constitutes' us one people, " by restor ing the Mate to the condition which thev lie-id practicable, the restoration of the prop. r relations ! prior to the reb Lion, we should be cautious, lest Ix-twivu the citizens ot the respective states. t!i Mni-'s, and the Federal Government, extending. Ii'iii! time to time, as the public interests seemed to require, the judicial, revenue, and postal sys tems" of the country. With the advice and con sent ot the Senate, the necessary officers were ap pointed, and appropriations made by Congress fur tin payment of their salaries. The proposi tion to amend the Federal Constitution, m as to prevent the existence of slavery within the Uni ted States or any place subject to their jurisdic tion, was ratified by tin requisite number of States: and on the lSth day of December, lo, it was ol ticially declared to have become valid as a part of the Constitution of the United States. All of the States in which the insirrcct'on had existed promptly amended their Constitutions, so as lo make them conform to th great change thus ofiVct ul in .he organic law of the laud ; ileclaivd null ami void alt ordinances and laws o!" s-'cessiou ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations cxeatfil ft s the revolutionary purposes of the in surrection and proceeded, in good faith, to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation ; and it was not un til towards the close of (he eighth month of the session that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators and -Representative. 1 dec in it a subject of profound regret that Con-jcre.-s has thus far failed to admit to stats loyal Seuators and Reptesentatives from the other States who.-e inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten States more than one-fourth of the whole number remain w ithout representation : the seats of fifty members in the House of Representatives and of twenty members in the Senate are yet vacant not by their own consent, n -t by a failure of election, bat by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admi-sion, it is believed, would have accom plished much towards the renewal and strength ening of our relations as one people, and removed serious causes lor discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those States. It would have ac corded with the great principle enunciated in the Heel n ation of American Independence, that no people' ought to bear t he burden of taxation, and yet be denied the right of representation. It would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the Coii-titution, that " each State shall ha-e at least on? Representative." and "that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate." These provis ions were intcnd.nl to secure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of repre sentation in each House of Congress ; and so im portant was it deemed by the framers of the Con stitution that the equality of the States in the Seii.-ite should be preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution can any State, without i:s consent, be denied a voice in that branch of the national Legislature. having resc ued our nation from perils of threaten ed disintegration, we resort to consolidation, and in the cud absolute despotism, as a remedy for the recurrenc e of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the exer cise of powers of doubtful constitutionality, we should hasten t bring legislation within the boundaries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to the ancient landmarks established by our fathers for The guidance of succeeding gener ations. "The Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of th whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." "If in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be cor rected by an eniencinie.nt in the way in which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change byiusurpation ; for"' ' it is the customary weapon by which free Governments are destroyed." Washington spoke these words to his country men, when, followed by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the- caiea of public life. "To keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, and cherish the Federal Union as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jeff ekson as rules of action to endear to his "countrymen the true principles of their Constitu tion, and promote a union of sentiment and ac tion equaily auspicious to their happiness and safety." Jackson held that the action of tho General Government should always be strictly cod fined to the sphere of its appropiate duties, and justly and forcibly u-ged that our Government is not to be maintained nor our Union preserved 'by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States. In thus attempting to make our General Govern ment strong, we make it weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible t themselves ; in making itself felt, not in its power, but in its btneficience ; not in its eontiol, but in its protection ; not in binding the States more closely to the centre, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitu tional orbit." These are the teachings of men whose deeds aud services have made them illus trious, and who, long since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have left to their country the rich legacy of their example, their wisdom, and their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us emulate them in love of country ami respect for the Constitution and the laws. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury af fords much information rcspection the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon the currency; and with reference to a proper ad justment of "our revenue system, internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful considera tion of Congress. In my last annual message I expressed my gene ral views upon these subjects. I need now only call attention to tho necessity of carrying into every department of the Govern ment a sy stem of rigid accountability, thorough re treiicbnic nt, and wise economy. With no excep tional nor unusual expenditures, the oppressive burdens of taxation can be lessened by such a mollification of our revenue laws as will be con sistent with the public faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report" presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the lisieal year ending the ".nth of June, 18(55, the last vear of the war, the public debt was increased ?-lil."'.KrJ,5:J7, and on the ;Ust of October, 1SG5, it amounted to f 2,7b", 854,750. On tho 31st day of October, IS;.;",, it had been reduced to $2,551,319, 001, the diminution, during a period of fourteen months, commencing September 1, 1805, and ending October 31, loV, having been $206,370,565. In the list annual report on the state of the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters' of tie- fiscal year ending the 3(Jth of June last, the debt would be increased $112,191, 917. During that period, however, it was reduced .531 r,!;,3s7. ibe receipts of the year having been $9,95,9U."' more, and the expenditures $200,529, 235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability of the national resources, and the rapidity and safety with which, under our form of government, great military and naval cstahlish nit nts can be disbanded, and "expenses reduced It is true. it. has been assumed that the, exist ence of the States was terminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, aud that the insurrection having been surpressed. they were thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered teirito tories. The Legislative. Exacutive, and Judicial Departments of the Government have, hovwver. with gr-at distinctness and uniform consistency, refused to sanction an assumption so incompati ble with the nature of our republican system, and with the professed objects of the war. Througout t!ie recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that these ten politi cal communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the very commencement of the rebellion, each House declared, with a unanimity as remarkable as it was si-'uitlcant. that the war was not "waged, upon our part, iu any spirit of! from a war to a peace, looting. oi.mvsMon. nor for an v tmrnos nfi'..i,i..i..4. n Dming the fiscal year ending the 30th of subjugation, nor purpose ot overthrowing or iute r- leiii'.j- with the lh'hls nr established 'ii.tiiiili.ee; I ol those States, but to defend and maintain the! suprem acy of the Cn-.; initio in pursuance i .lereoi. ami to lueseve tne i n with all the dignity.- equality, arid rights of the several States unimpaired : aud that as .o;i as these objects" were -accomplished the war nu'il to cease." In some iu.-tam-cs, S'-,ia;o were per mit fed to continue their legislative (mictions, while in tlier instances Hptvse-ii!;uivcs were elect ed and admitted to seats atl r tie ir States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, arid were eudeav oiin g to main tain that right by force of arm--. All of the States whose people were in insurrection, as Slates, were in .dud -d in the apportionment of the direct tax f twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon the It is stated in the reiorfc of the Secretary of the Kav7 that tho naval force at this time consists of two fcundrecl and seventy-eight vessels, armed with two thousand thrae hundred and fifty-on 3 guns. Of these, one hundred and fifteen vessels, carrying one thousand and twenty-nine guns, are in commission, distributed chiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great activity and vigilance have been disDlaved bv II Die squadrons, and their movements have been judi- ..nnl. 1 .A. I 1 1 I , MiuMaxj uiu eincieuuy arraogeu m uucu manner as would best promote American commerce, and protect the rights and interests of our country men abroad. The vessels unemployed are under going repairs, or are laid up until their services may be required. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, a Elace which, unt'l decisive action should be taken y Congress, was selected bv the Secretary of th Ivavy a3 the most eligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that a suitable public station should be provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition for any emergency, and it is desirable that the bill accepting League Island for naval purposes, which passed the House of Represen tatives at its last session, should receive final action at an early period, in order that there may be a suitable public station for tbis class of ves sels, as well as a navy-yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the Delaware river. The Naval Tension fund amounts to $11,750,000, having been increased $2,750,000 during the year. The expenditures of the Devartment for the fiscal year ending 30th June last were $43,321,520, and the estimates for the coming year amount to $23,503,436. Attention ii invited to the condition of our seamen, and the importance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement. Tne suggestions in behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens are earnestly recommended to the favorable attention of Congress. The report of the Postmaster General presents a most satisfactory condition of the postal service, and submits recommendations which deserve the consideration of Congres.', The revenues of the Department for the year ending June 30, lSijO, were $14,3Se,93e, and the expenditures $15,352,079, showing an excess of tho latter of $9(55,093. In anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropriation was made by Congress iu the act approved July 23, 180(5. Including the standing appropriation of $700,000 for free mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remain ing unexpended, the actual deficiency 'for the past year is only $205,093 a bum within $51,141 oi the amount estimated in the annual report of 1-501. The decrease of revenue compared with the pre vious year was one and one-fifth per cent., and tne increase of expenditures, owing principally to the enlargement of the mail service in tho South, was twelve per cent. On the 30th of June last there were in operation six thousand nine hundred and thirty mail routes, with an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, an aggregate annual trans portation of seventy-one million eight hundred reviews the operations of his Department during ths past year, and asks the aid'of Congress in its efforts to encourage these States which, scourged by war, are now earnestly engaged in the reor ganization of domestic industry. It as a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety, or our legitimate influence among the na tions, have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty, and patriot ism have increased at home, a more just consid eration of our national character and rights lus been manifested by foreign nations. Tho entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph between the coast of Ireland and the Province of Newfoundland, is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in both hemisphere a3 fhe open- ing or an era in me progress en "uizion There is reason to expect that equal succi -s will attend, and even greater results follow, the enter prise for connecting the two Continents through the Pacific Ocean by the projected Hdc of tele graph between Kamschatka and the Itussian pos sessions in America. The resolution of Congress protesting aeainat pardons by foreign Governments of persons con victed of infamous offences, on condition of emi gration to our country, has been communicated to the States with which we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of complaint on oar part, has not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Empe ror of Kussia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, have been presented to that humane and enlightened ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish-American adventurers to induce the "emigra tion of freedmen of tho United States to a foreign country, protested agaiust the project as one which," if consummated, would reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received from the Government of the State iu which the plan was matured, that the proceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy of your consideration, whether our laws upon this sub ject are adequate to the prevention or punish ment of the crime thus meditated. In the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. This withdrawal wai to be effected in three eletacb ments, the f.j- d of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico in November, now past, tin: second in March next, and tho thud and last in Novem ber, 1807. Immediately iij on the completion of the evacuation, the French Government was fo assume the same attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mexico, as is held by the Government of the United States. Pepeated assurances have been given by the F.niperor, since that agreement, that ho would complete the promised evacuation within the period mentioned, or soonei. it was reasou iiiiy expecteii that ttse proceedings thus and thirty-seven thousand mnei unrtred and lour- ' coiiiciu-jii.cu wwum iny.ni.-c uei.sisoi Kreai pouucai teen miles, and an aggregate annual cost, includ- I interest in the Iiepu hc of Mexico.

The mail service is rapidly increasing throughout tho whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern State indicates their constantly im proving eoinhtion. The growing imr c rtauce of the foreign service also merits attention. The Po.d Of fice Department of Great liritain and our own have agreed upon a prelimn ary basis for a new Postal Convention, which it is believed will prove emi nently beneficial to the eaunmercia! interests of the United Stites, inasmuch as it contemplates a re duction of the international letter postage to one half the existing rates ; a reduction of postage with ail other countries to and from which corres pondence is transmitted in the Ilritish mail, or in closed mails through the United Kingdom ; the establishment of uniform and reasonable c barge i for the sea and territorial transit of correspon dence in closed mails ; and an allowance- to each Post Ohiee Department of the riht to use" all mail communications established under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence, either iu open or closed mails, on the same terms as those applicable to the inhabitants ot the coun try providing the means of transmission. The report of the Secretary of the Interior ex hibits the condition of thoo branches of the pubiic service winch are eoninnUed to hn During the last fiscal year, four million six hun dred and twenty-nine thousand three huudred and twelve acres of public land were disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninety -two thousand five hundred and sixteen acres of which were en tered under the homestead act.

Preparations have been made for tle, pay inert of the additional bounties authorized during the recent session of Congress, under Mich regulations as will protect the Gov ernment from fraud, and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than six thous and maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus; aud forty-one na tional cemeteries, containing the remains of 10-1,-526 Union soldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military appropriations is $25,205,669. nallv adopted relative to the publio lauds has undeigoi.e- essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rapid settlement, was tha cardinal feature' of our land system. Long expe rience and earnest discussieni have resulted in the conviction thar the early development of our agri cultural resources, and the diiluHon of an ener getic population over our vast tcri.tory, arc objects of far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity than the pro -eecls of the sale of fhe land fo the higesl bidder in open market. The pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer who com- j plies with the terms they impose the privilege ef j purchasing a limited portion of " unoffered lands at the minimum price. The homestead nactments j relieve the settler from the payment of purchase j money, and secure him a permanent home, upon i the condition of residence for a term of yea :s. j This liberal policy invites emigration fro the old, and from the more crowded portions of the new i world. Its propitious results are undoubted, ami will be more signally manT'ested w hen time shall have given toit a wider development. Congress has made liberal grants of public land to corporations, in aid of the construction of rail roads and other internal improvements. Should this policicy hereafter prevail, more stringent pro visions will be required to secure a faithf ul appli cation of the fund. The titla to the lands shomd not pass, by patent, or otherwise, but remain in the Government, and subject to its control until some portion of the road has been actually built. Por tions of them alight then, from time to time, be conveyed to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole quality embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire length ed' the projected improvement. This restriction would not operate to the prejudice of any under taking conceived in good faith and executed with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw from market the lands falling within tho operation of such grants, and thus to exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse right. A breech of the conditions which Congress mav deem proper to impose should work a forfeiture of claim to tho lands so withdrawn Lut uuconveyed, and of title to the lands conveyed which remain unsold. Onera tions on the several fines ot tne l'aciiie. Railroad have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and success. Should no unfoi e ecu causes ol delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughrare will he completed oeiore the expiration of the period designated ty con gress. During the las' fiscal year fhe amount, paid to pensioners, including t he expenses oi uisDurse ment, was thirtee n uellion four hundred and fifty nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-six dol lars; and fifty thousand one hundred and seventy seven na nes were added to the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners, June 30, lofab, was one hundred and twenty-six thousand seven hun dred and twentv-two. This fact furnishes melan- e holv and striking proof of tho sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the led eral Government, and to maintain inviolate the in tegrity oi the Union. They impose upon us ce)r rcsnonding obligations. It is estimated that thir ty-three millions of dollars will be required to meet the exigencies of this brain h of tho service during the next fiscal year. Treaties fiave been concluded with the Indians who, enticed into armed opposition to our Govern ment at the outbreak of the rebellion, have uncon ditionally submitted to our authority, and mani fested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations. During the year ending September 30, 1800, eu ht thousand se ven huudred and sixteen patents for useful invent ioi k and design wt re issued, and at that date the balance in the Treasury to e credit of the Patent fund was two hunch eel and twenty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety seveu dollars. As a subject upon whie h dope, ds an immense amount of the production am! commerce of the country, I recommend to Congress such legisla tion as' may be necessary for the preservation of ibe levees of the Mississippi river. It is a matter of national importance thai "early steps should be taken not only to add to the offioi. m y of these barriers against destructive inn datum, but for the removal of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. The District o? Columbia, under existing laws, is not entitled that representation in the Na tional Councils which, fro!n our earliest history, has been uniformly accorded toea-h Territory es tablished from ttnifl to time within our limits. It maintains pei-ulidr relations fo Congress, to whom the. Constitution has granted the power of exer cising exclusive legislation over the eat of gov ernment. Our fellow-citizens residing in fhe Dis trict whoso interests are thus c mfided to the special guardianship of Congress, exceed in num ber the population ot several of our Territories, and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of the ir cheic eh uld not be admitted to a sat in the House of Representatives No mode hotir so np- proi riate and effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar condition and wants, ami of securing the ...al legislaf'on adapted to them. I therefore recommend the' passage of a law au thorizing the electors of the District f Co'nnibia to chrose adelei ate, to bo allowed the same rights snd privileges ns a delegate representing a 'lrri tory. The increasing enterprise and rapid pro gress of improvement in the Pistfict are highly gratifying, and I trust that the eifor'a of the mu nicipal authorities to promote the prosperity of the national metropolis will rwiie Ibe efficient and generous co-operation of Congress.

On the 0t li of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military expedition and enterprise against the British North American Colonies was projected and at tempted to tie ca-. ried on within the te rritory and juris diction of the L't.ited States. In obedience to the obli gation imposed upon the Kxecutive by the Constitution, to see that the ! ivs are I'a.tiil'ully executed, all citizens were warned, by proclamation, against taking pait in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, ami the proper civil, military and naval officers were directed to take all necessary- measures for the enforcement of the laws. The1 expedition failed, but it has not been without its painful consequences. Some of our citizens wlio, it. was alleelged, were engaged in the expedition, were captured, and have been brought to trial, as for a capi tal oiienee.inJfhe Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence ol death have been pronounced against some, while others have been acquitted. Fully believing in the inc.viiu of government, that severity of civil pun ishment for misguided persons who have engaged in revolutionary attempts which have disastrously failed, is unsound and unwise, such representations have been made to the British eioveriimerit, in behalf ol' the con victed persons, as, being sustained by an enlightened and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induee in their cases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty to all who were engaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the Government to defend citi zens of the 1'nited Slates on trial for capital offences iu Canada; and a disetontinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted in the courts of the I nited states against those who took part in the expedition, has been directed.. I have regarded the expedition as not only political in its nature, but as ulso in a great measure foreign from the 1'nited States in its causes, character and ob jects. The attempt was understood to be made iu sym pathy with an insurgent party in Ire-land, and, by stri king at u British Province on this Comment, was de signed to aid in obtaining redress for political grievan ces which, it was assumed, the peopie of Ireland had suiiered at die hands of the British (iovcriiuient during a pe rioil of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were ehieilv native's of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become citizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization. Com plaints of luisgove-rnnient in Ireland continually engage the attention of the British nation, and so great an agi tation is now prevailing in Ireland that the British (!ov eriiment have deemed it necessary to suspend thc writ of hnlteax corinu in that cvuntry. These circumstan ces must necessarily niod.fy the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained in regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute books, they should bo faithfully executed, and if they operate harshly, un justly, or oppressively, Congress alone c;iii apply ihe reined. by their luo hiicadou or repeal. political itnd commercial interests of the TJuiled S ates are not unlikely to be affe ted in some de gree by vvnts which aic transpiring in the east ern regions of Europe, and th time Seems to liav ceiiic whe n our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in Greece. This Government has claimed f jt all persons not convicted, or a eused, or suspected of crime, an absolute political right of belf-ext atrial ion, and a choice of new national allegiance.

Much ex citement followed. The father of the fus tigated child brought, or threatened, ac tions at law and criminal complaints against tho teacher, with this result, at least, that the public took sides, the school committee was divided in opinion, and there was a good deal of local excitement. Now, when a new committee is to be elected, the mat ter comes up afresh in the caucus, and is discussed by such men as Prof. Agassiz, Prof. Washburn, of the Law School, and Prof. Wyman. The opinions of such men are worthy of attention. Prof. Agassiz was plainly and unequivo cally against all corporal punishment, whether of boys or girls. He had been a teacher some forty years, and hael never struck a blow. Prof. Washburn, who is an excellent lawyer, was sure that at least girls should not be whipped. Dr. Wyman was of the same opinion, and mentioned the tact that long ago Hogging had been abol ished iu all the Prussian schools. After further debate, the caucus resolved that "corporal punishment should be abolish ed in each aud every school in the city," and nominated a ticket for a school com mittee favorable to this opinion.
