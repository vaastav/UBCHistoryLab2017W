2 DEATH COMES SUDDENLY TO HARRY GLAZIER TALENTED ACTOR EXPIRES IN ROOM AT HOTEL COLLAPSE ATTRIBUTED TO OVER. WORK ON STAGE Brilliant Career of Balasco Favorite Ended—Considered One of the Most Talented Men In the West Harry Glazier of the Belasco stock company, !»7id accounted one of the most talented actors in the west, died hoiiip time Wednesday nißht in his room at the Maryland hotel, Pasadena. His death, according to the autopsy surgeon, was caused by fatty degen eration of the heart, resulting in a rupture of the right ventricle. It is considered a remarkable coinci dence that Mr. Glasiar 1! death from heart disease should have followed his •appearance in "The Parisian Romance," in which at nine performances he sim ulated death brought on by an affec tion of the heart. Whether this ag gravated his own malady is a question that probably will never be answered. Mr. Glazier's friends attribute his sudden collapse to the great nervous strain and hard work of the last few months at the Belasco theater. of which, since the departure of Lewis Stone, he been considered the most promi nent, and on that account the hard working actor. Owing to his indisposition he had de cided to rest this week, and was not in the cast of "Mice and Men," which nted at the Belasco. Mr. (Hazier went to Pasadena Wednesday and engaged apartments s.t the Hotel Maryland. He hud com plained of pains in his chest and ex perienced a difficulty In breathing. Be fcre Koliig to his room, shortly before 11 o'clock Wednesday, he chatted sev eral minutes with one of the clerk*. He larked that he was not feeling well was worn nut. Earlier in the evening he had called on Miss Muraine Williams. 144 North Eluclid avenue, a Christian Science in letictioncr. Mr. Glassier having bc c one interested in Mrs. Eddy's teach ings. Finds Door Locked At 11 o'clock yesterday the house keeper, Mrs. Prince, attempted to en ter Mr. Glazier's room, but the door was lorkerl. A pass key was used, but the door appeared to be bolted on the inside, and she reported it to the clerk on duty. Entrance was obtained from :m adjoining apartment and Mr. Glu /.ler was found lying on the bed, dead. The electric lights in the room were burning and all Indication! pointed to peaci ful death from natural causes. i m the bed near the body lay a copy of Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy's book. "Science and Health." It was open and indications are that he was reading when he fell asleep. "Disease Necessarily Fatal" Dr. '■ F. E. Newcomb, who was sum moned immediately after the body Wll found, said Mr. Glazier had been dead several hours. Prominent physicians in Los AngeleH last night said that Mr. Glazier's affection of the heart was necessarily fatal and that medical treatment could not have saved his life. The body was removed to.the under taking establishment of Adams, Turner & Stevens, and Coroner Hartwell was notified. Later an autopsy was held by Dr. R. V. McCoy and examination showed that death was due to fatty degeneration of the heart, causing a rupture of the right ventricle. A cer tificate of death was issued accordingly. . Mr. Glazier came to Los Angeles four years ago. For several seasons priror to his arrival here he played at Detroit and Toledo, where he was well known and popular. He was. slightly past 40 . and apparently at the best of his stage career. His first engagement in Los Angeles was at the Burbank theater. October, 1906, he joined the Belasco stock com pany as the successor of Tom Oberle. The malady with which he was af flicted troubled him considerably the last several weeks. While playing in "Brown of Harvard" he complained of being ill, and recently while playing in "A Parisian Romance" he gaid he ex perienced a difficulty in breathing. Many Express Regret There was a general expression of re gret, when it became known yesterday that Harry Glazier was dead. Among theatrical folk his ability was recog nized and respected, and from manager to call boy all spoke in sorrow of his death and mourned the loss of a good comrade. At the Belasco last night there was sorrow on the stage and ac tors and employes went about their tasks with heavy hearts. Mr. Glazier is survived by Mrs. Gla zier and one young son, Jose, who oc casionally has been seen In juvenile parts at local theaters. The family re cently moved to Glendale, where only a short time ago Mr. Glazier's mother died His stepfather, Col. Charles Len one, and two half-brothers, Jose and Louis Lenone, also are living ill Glen dale, and a sister, Mrs. James Parker, resides in Chicago. ' Funeral arrangements had not been made last night, but announcement of the services will be made today. •—* ' Architects Conclude Convention WASHINGTON.

Colombia: "In view of the blockade established and the capture by the blockaders of a Venezuelan vessel, the head of the gov ernment of Venezuela, after assuming extraordinary powers of the defense of the country, has declared a state of war." PRESIDENT CASTRO DENIES REVOLUTION IN VENEZUELA BERLIN, Dec. 17.—President Castro of Venezuela did not leave his hotel all day. being busy with correspondence, lie tecetved a number of dispatches from Caracas, but nothing confirma tory of the reports with reference to the. revolutionary movement in \ zuela, which both he and the members of the suite persist in denying. One of his aides declared tonight he was convinced the reports emanated from revolutionary agents in Curacao. There is no truth in tire report that Germany has been asked to undertake negotiations with Holland for the purpose of bringing about a settlement of the difficulty in Venezuela. The president, who appears to be in extremely good humor and who seem ingly is not suffering very much from his malady, received with his wife three or four personal friends, with whom he lunched in his apartments. Dr. Israel, who made a physical ex amination of Senor Castro a day or two aso. has had the president under Observation daily. He has not decided whether an operation will be neces sary. The physician seems convinced, however, that Castro's kidneys are not affected. The members of the entourage of President Castro still maintain an at titude of skepticism of the outbreak at Caracas against the president. They declare Castro is in receipt daily of reports from the government, but no reports have come In corresponding to the events described by the press dis patches. Castro's aides ignore the circum stances that press communications originated at Caracas itself, and they : rylng to foster the erroneous idea that they came from Willemstad and are based upon highly colored reports from the revolutionists and plotters against the president. 

UNITED STATES OFFICIALS SURPRISED AT REVOLUTION WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—The riot ous demonstrations in Caracas are a surprise to officials in Washington, who had generally expected any manifesta tion of hostile acts by a foreign power against Venezuela would have the re sult of solidifying the people and ral lying them to President Castro and his government. It had been the common belief here that had the United States taken any forceful steps tgainst Venezuela in the effort to have its claims against that country arbitrated, Castro would have become a veritable hero in the eyes of the people there. It is possible even, that anticipating such an attitude, the administration has been indifferent to pushing a de mand for settlement. Reports that CaOtro might seek an alltanos With Germany lack any sub stantiation so far as any state de partment advices go. The department has felt the situa tion in Venezuela would gradually work itself out. For this reason there haa lie. ii a persistent determination to ig nore President Castro and to look with equanimity upon the doings of foreign governments In their efforts to get sat isfaction from him for alleged wrongs, so long as there is no interference with American Interests and no violation of the Monroe doctrine.

ALLEGES AUTHOR ASKED fOR ANNIS (Conllnurd from Page One) him and that the real estate inquiry at the yacht clv\b was a blind. Other important testimony was given by Charles Blrchfield, a friend of Annis, who declared that Thornton Hains drove him back with a drawn revolver when he sought to stop the shooting. Thornton Hains also drove Mrs. Annis from th-e float with his revolver, according to Birehfleld. Mis. William E. Annis, widow of the slain man, testified to establish the death of her husband. She will take the stand again. Will Examine Witness Closely Counsel for Thornton Hains de clared today that the state's witness called to prove the charge that the author was a principal with his broth er, Captain Peter C. Hains, jr., in the killing of William E. Annis as he sat in his boat at the Bayside Yacht club last summer, will be subjected to a long and exhaustive examination. His lawyers assert the prosecution's witnesses were all close friends of An nis, and that there is little doubt they have rehearsed the tragedy with the design of presenting an unvarying story. A new light on the case was shed this morning when Hains' counsel ad mitted that Thornton J. Hains had had some trouble with Annls over the pub lication of a magazine article last June. It is said the author submitted a manu script to Mr. Kipley, owner of the magazine upon which Annis was em ployed, in July, and that Annis induced Ripley to return it. Counsel for Hains state the defendant then wrote a let ter to Ripley saying he knew why the manuscript was rejected, and conclud ed with the works, "1 will gel even with him yet." This Is the threatening letter referred to by Special Prosecutor White In his opening address, according to counsel for Hains, who further states he will show there was no threat fn the de fendant's communication and that the episode simply Indicated Annis' feel ing toward the author. The lawyers state they will prove that H.iins some time previous to this affair had Annls discharged from a position with a publishing company. It will be asserted when the defense presents Its case that Thornton Hains and his brother went to Bayside to locate a home where the former's young daughter. Molly, a sufferer from a throat afeetion, might have the benefit of the country air.

ANTOINE SIMON PRESIDENT OF HAYTI Great Crowd in Front of Building Cheers Wildly When New Head of Government Is An nounced 

PORT AU PRINCE, Dec. 17.—Gen^ era) Antoine Simon, the loader of the last revolution in Hayti, that resulted in the flight of President Nord Alexis from the capital, and who made his triumphal entry Into Port au Prince ten days ago, was today unanimously elected president of the republic by the Haytien congress. As soon as the result of the selection became known the great crowd that had assembled outside the building broke into cheers and salutes were fired from forte and gunboats in the harbor. The other aspirants to the presi dency did not "come forward actively. The reason for this course was the fear that another outbreak of disorder would result in American intervention.
