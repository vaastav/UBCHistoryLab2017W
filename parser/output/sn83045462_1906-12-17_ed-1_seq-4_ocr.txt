The Canal Message. No good citizen can read President Roose. velt's special message oit the Panama canal without being deeply impressed by his earnestness, his intense interest in the enterprise and his unwavering confidence In Its success. lie writes with even more than his usual enthusiasm. The report is an interesting narrative of a precedent-breaking journey and should be read by every American. One noteworthy feature of the message is the evidence it affords that the President did not waste a minute of his time or overlook a single detail. He had eyes for everything. He investigated the sanitary conditions, the housing equipment, the hotel service, the entertainment facilities, the labor situation, the railroad equipment, be. sides taking in the engineering projects under way with a comprehensive survey of .the entire canal zone. There is in cnnseniienro much infnrmatiA? for the people In this message. The writer could not have written a more valuable or entertaining article on the subject if he had been a special correspondent. And on that point of special correspondents the President indulges in some plain language which will probably be applauded. He properly denounces the disseminators of "reckless 6lander." for whom he feels "the heartiest contempt and Indignation because, in a spirit of wanton dishonesty and malice, they are trying to interfere with and hamper the execution of. the greatest work of the kind ever attempted, and are seeking to bring to naught the efTorts of their countrymen to put to the credit of America one of the srand feats of the ages." Such vigorous writing will inevitably challenge universal attention. The President treats the canal fakirs none too sharply. They have earned the rebuke he administers. Perhaps this trip will have proved of service mainly in evoking this message as an inspiration to the people. The canal work will be the better and more quickly done for being heartily believed in at home, and nothing could be more certain to inspire confidence in its success and appreciation of its importance than this clearcut exposition of President Roosevelt's own faith. rpv. ? X a? ** - xiic isnmptiigu in uerraany. Why should the kaiser make a direct appeal to the electorate on the matter of the new reichstag? Is not his position sufficiently understood? The new elections were ordered on his motion, and for reasons officially given. Everybody knows what he dosires. and what it will be asked to do if the majority of the new reichstag Is in sympathy with Mm. The issue would appear to be as plain as a pikestaff. If the German people approve of the kaiser's African program they will give him a legislatllPO ir\ V>?* 4 T* "* ' * v" ncif> iznia %.aii y n uui. li not inpy will indorse the action of the late reichstag by electing a new one. to continue the policy of its predecessor. A special deliverance by the kaiser would add of course to the interest of the situation. What is now keen would then become keener. Both sides would work with greater zeal. The supporters of the government would, under the kaiser's personal call. bend every energy in his behalf. But as vigorously would the opposition bestir itself. The eword being two-edged, the question Is which edge In such employment would be the sharper? Again we find a sort of likeness between the kaiser and Mr. Roosevelt. Some of the latter's supporters were bitterly opposed to his course in the recent New York contest. Wh*?n fhpv hoapfl t* ? - *-*? *?* ??* ? ,.Eu.u umL u was ma intention to mak>- his influence felt there they opposed it on the ground that it might do more harm than good. They feared that the people might resent so unusual a proceeding. Rut. all unpersuaded and undeterred, Mr. Roosevelt sailed in, and. Indirectly, through Mr. Root, asked for a republican victory. That the deliverance counted in the defeat of Mr. Hearst Is certain. In the case of Mr. Roosevelt, however, it was to be considered that he was a citizen of New York, interested a.? everv nthur citizen in good government there, and a.s It was his opinion that the election of Mr. Hearst would work injury to the state, it was within his province. If It was not. Indeed, his duty, to make his feelings conspicuously known. He took that view of the matter, and the people did not resent It. Could the kaiser present as good a reason for intervening at home? Some of his advisers tell him it would be dangerous to his own cause: that the people might resent It at the polls as being unusual and improper. But, like Mr. Roosevelt, he Is an unusual man, and prefers his own way. He considers that this Is his flght. and if he decides to lead It in person, regardless of the traditions, we shall see Germany stirred as never before.

This is the week when the dilatory shopper realizes with a shock that Christmas Is only a few days hence. Smoke Law Extension. One argument advanced against the extension i?f the anti-smoke law in this District to the railroad locomotives is that the 1 terminal, Having Deen constructed for use by steam engines, can not be transformed to an electric basis. In other words, if this argument holds good the sta'ion must permanently remain on a smoke-emission basis because it was so planned originally. In this connection it must be remembered that all the Commissioners ask is that the smoke law be extended. The enactment of the legislation they propose, already approved by the House, would leave to the railroad companies the choice of means to comply with the statute. If In truth the make-up yards and terminal tracks can not be safely electrified," as claimed, there is nothing In the oermanent eouinment tn 1 possible the use of a smokeless fuel. And in any case the requirement to abate the nuisance must be written Into law if results are to be gained reasonably soon. That is what the Commissioners are asking Congress to do. In his letter to Commissioner Macfarland President Cassatt of the Pennsylvania expressed the belief that the use of a "semibitumlnous" coal would serve largely to diminish the volume of smoke. If there is such a coal in existence there will be no harm in writing a law to compel its use. If anthracite or coke is a possible locomotive fu?l th? Inw will encourage its use. In any rase the extension of the statute will stimulate the experiments In smokeless fuels and hasten the day of emancipation from the evil that now afflicts the capital and will shortly be greatly Increased In extent and effect. Thus the case stands before Congress. It Is not asked to specify the means to be employed to render the railroads smokeless. Its original prohibition of smoke In the District, with railroad locomotives exempted. did not prescribe methods. It merely stipulated a condition and a penalty for violation. There Is no reason why the railroads should exempt themselves from sharing In this responsibility by declaring: in advance of the possible extension of the law that they cannot abate the smoke nuisance. They should be put to the proof. Finally, If "semi-bituminous" coal does not prove to be smokeless. If coke is Impracticable, if anthracite cannot be used, electricity alone remains. If that contingency arises the "act that the terminal tracks are, according to present plans, unsuitable for such a system should not forever prevent the adoption of the electric motor. Terminal tracks can be changed. They should be. If necessary. One of the stock reasons advanced in the past against the abolition of the grade crossings was that the construction of sub ways and viaducts would cost too much. It caused a postponement of the great relief from the deadly nuisance for many years. Yet the change finally came, and on a scale never before considered possible. To give heed now to the pie* that a smokeless terminal will cost heavily wiH simply mean the Jong postponement of a necessary work. That some day electric traction will* be einpioyed on long-distance lines and In all terminals is not to be questioned. The Commissioners believe, with good reason, that the passage now of the smoke-law extension bill will merely advance the day of Washington's emancipation and hasten the evolution of the model railroad station. It should be the desire of the railroads to contribute to this end. Charles E. Hughes. Gov.-elcct Hughes announces that upon taking office he will institute an investigation of his own into all the departments of the New York state government, with a view of ascertaining just what their condition Is. With regard to some of them damaging rumors have for some time been busy. But with regard to all of them the head of the state Just beginning a term ui sfiviw fiiiuuia ut course possess me fullest information. What steps will follow in case the governor finds abuses demanding correction Is not announced. It may be assumed, however, from the character of the man and the circumstances of his election to office, that Mr. Hughes will not be slow to move as he thinks best befits the occasion. Will this satisfy the people of New York who participated in the success of Mr. Hughes at the polls? Not all of them, we may ??^sure. Nothing is more certain than that some of them are expecting, and will demand, a course both spectacular and extreme on the part of the new executive. So far as they are concerned their minds are made up. As they view the matter, everybody under open charges, or even suspicion, is guilty, and all that remains is his punishment. To meet this sentiment It would be necessary for Mr. Hughes to send a ripping message to the legislature advising a public drag-net Investigation of everything and everybody by special committees of that body, and a stir-up all around. Such men want what may be called quick action on their contributions to tne campaign, and have in view principally the mere continuation of agitation. It Is In this way that District Attorney Jerome has suffered since his last election^ Many of those who supported him assumed that all,men under charges wera guilty, that the proof existed and that the law applied, and that all Mr. Jerome in office would have to do -would be to call the cases In court and send the accused persons to prison. When Mr. Jerome failed them in this, although he explained matters fully, he was denounced as freely and severely as though he himself had been euiltv of a crime: and in some nnart?r? where once he was strong, he is today without credit or prestige. In our reform campaigns there is too much thundering in the index. Evils are exaggerated. Promises of reform are too proruse. this has Deen shown In both national and state campaigns, and even city contests have come to nothing by reason of it. Sometimes candidates are at fault. Sometimes campaign managers, taking their cue from the theatrical world, make the "wall paper" too strong?stronger than the show warrants. Mr. Hughes did not err In this way In his campaign, for he pitched it In a high and clear key, but some of his eupporters, acting as press agents for the cause, cut the press agents' capers, and it will not be their fault if the cause in some way does not suffer by reason of It. A Sixty-Day Session. As usual. Congress will not get down to real knitting until after the holidays. The time before Christmas Is taken up with sparring and a little discussion, and business comes later. This custom clips a montli from the short session, making It about sixty instead of ninety days' long. So little time therefore Is at command we may have only the appropriation bills as the fruits of the session. Some of those bills contain matter which will provoke much debate, and if anybody Is Interested In defeating this measure or that he will Improve his opportunity by drawing out debate as much as possible. There are measures besides the supply bills which should be passed, but as the latter have the right of way the advantage Is all with those who may try to use them as logs for the creation of a 1am. Perhaps the members of Congress who were so bashful' about Increasing th^ir own salaries feared future annoyances because of an income tax. ' The Japanese have demonstrated that they are neither as bluntly comic as portrayed by W. 8. Gilbert nor as impracticably poetic as portrayed by John Luther Long. Mr. Carnegie has not gone to the extreme of insisting on reformed spelling as a condition in connection with library donations. Vf o unr FVimno ia nrvt nfpaM thaf clwise of the street railways will be criticised as a kind of merger. The Long Bridge. The old Long: bridge Is passing. In a short time it will have been entirely removed from Its place across the Potomac and will be but a memory. It has served thia community for many years, and served It well despite Its Inadequacy. The sole connection between the District and Virginia for a long time, It has been the scene of many historic movements between the sections. It was tired by the British when they attacked the c&tx*&l In 1814. It was the chief means of connection during the war of the 60 s, and figures conspicuously in the annals of the civil war. When the federal troops in 1861 set out to Invade Virginia they crossed the Potomac by means of this structure, and after the battle of Bull Run they recrossed it In ntmlc. The iiu.uk- ui uikt ijujig unujjc uwanie nuuonany familiar in connection with that disaster. During recent years Long: bridge has been occasionally a menace to the city, Its reinforced piers choking the channel in times of high water and its low-lying superstructure checking the outflow of Ice and debris It became known to the threatened residents of the lower portions of 'Washington as the Long bridge dam, and many a time have prayers been voiced that the freshets might carry it away and so force action by Congress In its replacement. Once the center portion was in fact swept down stream a short distance, but repairs were made and the bridge was restored to service. This bridge has served as an example of the neglect with which Congress treated J the federal District for many yearn Its 4 shameful state of disrepair, its dangerous position and character as a river obstruction and its recent Inadequacy as a conveyor of both railroad and ordinary traffic have been repeatedly brought to the attention of the houses, but until a few years ago without avail. No peculiar difficulties presented themselves. The ground on both sides of the river afforded a favorable opportunity for its replacement, but owing In part to the stubborn obstructive policy of the railroad corporation enjoying Its use, and under legal obligation to keep it in repair as a public highway, it remained untouched by legislation throughout the period of Washington's development In other directions. For several months the bridge has been out of service, having been finally sup planted by a pair of new bridges, one lor the railroads and the other for ordinary traffic. The delay in Its demolition is typical of its entire history. Now at last It is passing, and soon It will be gone. A landmark Is thus doomed, but unlike many other sacrifices to the march of progress, this historic relic will not be mourned. ? . Tir . i The manner in which Mark Twain, W. D. ?
