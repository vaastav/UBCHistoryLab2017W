Today all Brussels mourns. Flags on public buildings are at half mast and private houses are draped with crepe. The body of the king, cloth ed in the uniform of a lieutenant general, remains in the chamber of the palace where death entered last night. It is surrounded only by those who in life won and retained the king's close friendship. The ex pression on the dead monarch's face is peaceful, as though the end was painless. The body will be placed in a casket this evening and then the period of mourning will officially be gin. Dr. Thierar said today: " I knew the king was suffering from a malady of the heart. This was our chief anxiety when operating, but we de cided to resort to surgery in order to save his majesty from terrible suffering. A sa matter of fact, he died without suffering at all." . Immediately following Leopold's death, two nuns laid out the body and preparations for conveying the corpse to the city proper were be gun. The obsequies take place at the church of Saint Gudula. This morning early Premier Schol laert proceeded to the palace and under his direction, the Official Moniteur published a special number announcing the formation of a re gency council of ministers which will nominally hold the reins of govern ment until the heir to the throne, Prince Albert, lias taken the oatn of ascension.

A dispatch from Rome says the Vatican confirms the marriage of King Leopold and Bar oness Vaughn at San Rome, Italy, last year. The King leaves to his daughters, it is said, personal property worth about $300,000, which he inherited from his father. His will is expected to reveal large legacies for public interests. Sensational rumors that Baroness Vaughan has fled from Belgium are believed to be unfounded. If she re fuses to leave the country it is said she will be expelled. Leopold II of Belgium was the son of Leopold I, who owed his tenure of the throne to an election by the national congress of Belgium. He was born in 1S35, and ascended to the throne upon his father's death in 18G5. The man who laid down the scep ter of Belgium last night and en. tered the realm where his deeds are judged as those of a man and not of a king, has had a varied career. As king of the Belgians, he made a fair success. As a business man he achieved greatness. His exploits in the rubber trade brought him enormous wealth, and for long he has been known as the Rockefeller of rulers.
