PRIMARY AS A PARTY MEASURE. Thru the Vinton Eagle B. Murphy has voiced the cry o^ his tribe that -the primary election bill be made a caucus measure this session.' The, trouble be fore, according to this knowing brave, was that being an individual's bill no one waa bound to support it. Then, too, both factions were "kow-towtog" to the democrats too much, says Murphy, for the success, of any movement. Nobody will deny that "kow-towing" to democrats ^111 endanger republican success. Mr. Murphy's friends have proved that. For further evidence re fer to Major Lacey. Whether or mot a primary bill should be made distinct ly a party measure is a question. If primary electiows are to be state-wide and compulsory upon all parties the democrats might think It unfair to be disfranchised entirely, in the framing of it, especially since their party organ ization has indicated that all good dem ocrats will favor a primary law. Of vastly more importance than this suggestion of Mr. Murphy's to make the primary bill a party measure is the determination, of what kind of a primary Mr. Murphy and his friends will support The republican party platform declared for a primary elec tion law "which will provide for the nomination by direct vote of all can didates for office" and' "an expression of party preference in the selection of United States senators." Mr. Murphy as member of a committee uporn reso lutions in the convention passed upon this plank, accepted it and stood upon a chair loudly exhorting his tribe to abide by it. Will he now favor nom inations of "all candidates" by "direct vote" or will he advise his friends that the primaries, shall elect delegates and the delegates do the -nominating? If Mr. Murphy and his friends would line up with the progressives for a state wide primary by "direct vote" with majority nominations and delegate in directions omitted, if the party plat form be permitted to bind all repub licans there will be little necessity of a party caucus. The bill could be dis cussed in the regular way in commit tee and in open debate upon, the floor. Where do Mr. Murphy's friends Stan a on the real Issue? A LITTLE INCIDENT IN TRADE. A MarshalKown merchant relates a little incident of his extended trade which points a moral both for the seller and the purchased of goods. A few days ago, since "the roads got b&d," a farmer living, ten or twelve miles from the city wrote the merchant ask ing him to make prices o#i a bill of footwear for winter, which waa en closed with the communication. The bill more the^tagmarks to show that it had been* compiled from a mail or der catalog. Figuring catalog house goods and qualities the merchant sent back an estimate of $9.75 for the bill. Two days after the farmer came into the store. "I believe I'll buy.my stuff here," he said, "your bill ds 75 cents under the prices Of any of the cata logs." He bought his goods, but not the articles listed. He was shown both kinds, the goods that could be sold at a proflltable percentage for $9.75 and other grades that cost more money, but afforded no better profit to the -seller. With his eye on the articles he refused •the cheap onee and bought the best. His bill was considerably more than the first figures for he selected (he best in the store. When the cheap goods and the real thing were side by aide before him he had no difficulty in see ing the difference. He was more anx ious about the value than about the price. What he wanted to know was •that the home merchant could and would compete with the catalog house. The merchant had his chance to show that he could do It and to offer an object lesson. In values. There Isn't much difference between the home merchant and the consumer when they ii: get together and take counsel over the difference between buying a picture in a catalog and the actual goods over •the counter. If every buyer would see his home merchants' stock and prices before he sends his money away the catalog houses would not boast of a $15,000, 000 business from Iowa. If every mer chant would give the mail order cata log a place on his counters and the mail orders, qualities a spot in his stock bringing the catalog prices and catalog qualities" together with his own goods and prices for comparison, buy ers would soon loam the difference be tween. pictures and the real thing, be tween circus poster descriptions and plain eyesigtt. The merchant and the farmer are not far apart. A step to ward each other would bring them to gether. A BANKER ON CREDIT CURRENCY. A. B. Hepburn, president of the Chase National Bank, New York, is out in a printed article in support of the plan for a credit currency recently rec ommended by the commission of the American Bankers' Association, as the most desirable one in order to relieve the money stringency that keeps recur ring in this country. The change of the existing bank-note system ia the principal part of this recommendation. The operation of the plan, in Mr. Hep burn's words, is a» follows: "During crop-moving periods, the banks outside of reserve cities would first utilize their power to Issue notes in order to satisfy the demand made upon them, instead of calling, as now, upon reserve cities for currency.. Their power in that respect utilized, the re serve cities might, in turn, elrcsuus serye cities might, in turn, Issue cur rency and, if the demand Increased, a point might be reached where central reserve cities would issue currency and keep the tame in circulation until the crop-moving period had passed, or oth er demand, whatever Its occasion, had •been satisfied. The benefit which would accrue to New York, Chicago, St. Lou is and other money centers would be indirect, in removing or relieving the demand upon their reserve money, which every fall brings around. This fact cannot be too strongly empha sized, that ample redemption facilities, with thg general redemption which would follow, is a complete answer to the charge that the proposed currency would amount to inflation, and that In terior banks would keep the maximum out at all times. They could not keep it out unless the business demand for currency was pronounced and extreme, and then it should be kept out in the interest of the general welfare. When ever the money rates relax and the currency demand lessens, it would flow in for redemption. This is proven by experience Where credit currency has been and is being used. Topics of the Times The president was a long time learn ing that it doesn't pay to write letters to' another man's wife. r..'11' That rasping noise you hear is Mr. Pierce filing protests against the inter urban. If it were anyone but the president these successive imbroglios over mis statements might engender a suspicion of forgetfulness. The Kansas newspapers are conduct ing a Jiot discussion over the exist ence of hell. The heat of the argumen tation is the harder to understand from the generally accepted impression that persons who have lived In southwest ern Kansas needn't kick over a pros pective climate in many ways more agreeable than the one 'to which they •had been accustomed and acclimated. A writer on the manufacture of printed currency saye a ten dollar bill lasas about three years. If he will tell where he lives and how he does it Mr. Roosevelt would immediately be come the second most popular man in the United States. a Busse's reprieve until January 11 will bring acute disappointment to many In. Butler county, the scene of his abominable crime, who had set their hearts on his hanging.

Winston Churchill, the movelist, de scribed at a dinner in New York the difference between realism and ro manticism in fiction: "To make my meaning clearer," Mr. Churchill end ed, "I will take the case of a young man and a girl—sweethearts. The young man, a romanticist, said pas sionately to hie girl: 'Darling, it shall be my life's one purpose to surround you with every comfort and to antici pate and gratify your every wish.' The girl, a realist, smiled faintly as she an swered. 'Oh, Jack, how good of you, •and all on $9 a week, too.' Tama county's representative im the Iowa legislature has tound eminent corroboration of his opinion of supreme eourts. John Wesley 'Gaine3 of Ten nessee agrees with the idea elaborat ed in the president's message that the courts are not above criticism and does not heskate to carry out his lews. In the course of the debate in the house the legal status of a game was In question and in a colloquy with Mr. Mondell of Wyoming, Mr. Gaines gave his opinion. "The only difficulty about that proposition is that the gentleman and the supreme court do not agree," observed the geiitleman from Wyom ing. "Oh, well, that is the case fre quently, because the supreme court is^ wrong," retorted Mr. GaineS airily. :V-7?V, 1 SBiiPiSSi' 

IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES. "But there Is another side to the question," points out the Waterloo Courier. "Generally the belated Christ mas shopper is about as tired as the tired clerk." The Council Bluffs Nonpareil thinks "if the interstate commerce commission could be authorized to cut in on the postoffice department and report on tfce abnuses that prevail there in the transportation of stuff that never was in-ended be sent thru the mails, the oostmaster general would not suffer the humiliation of reporting a $10,000,000 deficit in his branch of Uncle Sam's big business concern." "To the Wyoming Journal "a 2-cent passenger raffe seems inevitable In Iowa." 'v-? The Mason City Times-Herald pre dicts that "the legislature will take up the matter of a 2-cent fare this winter, and a long drawn-out debate upon that subject may certainly be expected, for the railroads are not expected to tame ly submit to a reduction in the present classification, which is 3 ,3% and 4 cents, to 2, 2% and 3 cents. There seemes to be a sentiment among the members to vote for such a bill, and it will take convincing showings on the part of the Iowa lines to convince them that the time is not ripe in Iowa for such a reduction. "The biennial election has come to stAy, arid we mlgh6 Just as well get accustomed to the circleless ballot,- for It Is not likely that it will ever be re stored," says the Mason City Times Herald. The Waterloo Reporter notes the pro posal of a Sioux City clergyman that the worklngmen be paid in cash rather than by check, as a means of removing temptation from their pathway, and says: "Human nature is much the same, whether the wages come in checks or in cash. The thirst and the appetite will be unchanged by a sim ple substitution in the system by which the means to gratify the desire are ac quired. The matter Is with the man, and not with the medium in which he Is paid for his work." ,,, In a commendatory vein, the |Pu buque Telegraph-Herald says: "In op posing ship subsidies Congressman Birdsall Is more and more proving him self a representative of whom his dis trict may be proud." "Iowa will never be as beautiful as it should be, and rural life will never have the attractions It might have un til there are. permanent good roads," insists the Des Moines Register and Leader. "Good roads are thel begin ning if there Is to be greater interest in the country life of the west, and thtf horticulturists and forestry enthusi asts and cattlemen might better recog nize it now than later." The Cedar Rapids Gazette, noting that "Marshalltown is excited over Its proposed interurban, which seems a sure £0," says: "Marshalltowlf is sit uated so she can use about three inter urbani to good advantage. And they will come in time. The interurbans are going to be important factors In building up several Iowa towns. The roads cannot be built too soon." "The Idea grows that Iowa city gov ernments are not all that one might imagine in the way of perfection," re marks the Davenport Democrat. "And the remedy prescribed for them is ev erywhere the same—strike out politics and get down to business. The non partisan police and fire departments are a good beginning, but all city em ployes should be taken out of the rea.lm of patronage. The despisable little pic auyne politics that has featured Iowa city governments has marked them with anything but credit, and is as far from business as can be imagined." The Charter Oak Times "doubts if the passage of a primary law In Iowa would affect the politics of the state so much as to cause a ripple in the smooth surface of our governmental affairs." In Praise of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. There is no other medicine manufac tured that has received so much praise and so many expressions of gratitude as Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
