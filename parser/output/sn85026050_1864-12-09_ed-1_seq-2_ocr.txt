HOGS AND GEESE COERCED. Last week the Marshal commenced en forcing the ordinance against hogs and geese running at large in the streets of Fre mont His pen filled up rapidly, and the Marshal was soon beset by exasperated cit zens whose hogs and geese had been so summarily restrained of the "freedom of the city" streets and alleys. So many rep resenting themselves ignorant of the pas sage of the ordinance, the Mayor ordered the discharge of all the captives. Marshal Burdick is this week enforcing the law, and some of the prisoners were found to be of the first lot. The ordinance should be en forced or repealed. RAIL ROAD TIME CHANGE. The cars on the F.

City Point,' December 1. General Gregg's cavalry was sent tuiuth this morning onarccon noisance, more jiarticularly to discover if the en emy were moving troops south. The following dispatch is just received in relation to it: Headquarters Army Potomac December I. P. M. Lieut. Gen. Ormit: I have just re ceived a dispatch, dated 3:45 P. M. He reports having captured Stony Creek Station, which was defended by infantry and cavalry, in works with artillery. Three guns were found in the works two of which were thrown into the creek and the other being too heavy to handle was spiked. Had the bridge been in good condition they would all have been brought away. All the buildings at the station were then fired and burned to the round, besides the following supplies: 1,200 Infield rifles, a large Quantity of ammunition, 5,000 sacks of grain, 500 biles of hay, some corn and oats, 400 bushels of sweet potatoes, 50 bar rels of coal oil, a quantity of bacon, camp and garrison equipage, and a railroad bridge about 150 feet long. Among the captured is Major Fitz Hugh Lee, who it will be remembered was the leader of the raid in Maryland last summer, and who captur ed a captain and took away his boots, making him walk about twenty miles barefooted. To remind him of ao doing tho captain who captur ed him made him perform the same trick, The Second Brigade, General Gregg command ing, had the advance, and is reported to have most gallantly carried the enemy's position. General Gregg is now returning to camp. No information could be obtained of any troops passing southward, either cavalry or infantry. The bed of branch road from Stony Creek was seen to be graded, but no rails were laid. At Duval's Station, south of Stony Creek, much property was destroyed, and a large amount of railroa d iron was found. Ah effort was being made to destroy it by fire, when the staff officer, who brought the despatch, left. The enemy showed signs of having concentrated, and were following, but the officer thinks Gen. Gregg will be in camp by the night GEO. G. MEADE, Major General. A young damsel in Canada, twelve years of age, became united in wedlock to a youth of fourteen summers, with a salary of four dollars per month.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS. ' The condition of oor Foreign affairs is reason ably satisiactory. , Mexico continues mo he i theatre ol civil war. While ow political rela Hons with that -Country -: have . undergone no change, we have at the same time strictly main tamed neutrality between the belligerent. At the request of the Stales of Costa Jiica and N ic srauga, a competent engineer has been author ised to make a survey ol tbe Kiver Kan Juan aud the Port of San Juan. -It is source ef much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political: kpprehensibns and caused acloeirtfrot tOc Inter -Ocean K Trans it Koute, have been, amicably -adjugted-aod that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be re-opened, with si increase of capacity and adaptation.' We could -not exaggerate"' either the commercial or piUeal-itnportarree- of that great improvement. - It would be doing iujustice to as important South American State nut to acknowledge the directness, iranknessand cordiality with which the United States of Columbia have entered in to intimate relations with this Government. A Claim Convention has been constituted to com plete the unfinished .work of the one which closed its session in J861. . The new Liberal Constitution of V enezuela havinir crone into ef fect with the universal acquiescence of the peo ple, the uovernment under it nas been recog' nized and diplomatic intercourse, with it lias been opened in a cordial and friendly spirit. The Jong deterred avis island ciaim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged. Mutual pav ments have been made of . the claims swarded by the late joint commission tor the settlement of claims between the United states aud Peru. An earnest au cordial friendship continues to exisit between the two countries, and such efforts as were in my power to remove misunderstand ing and avert a threatened war, between Peru and Spain. .Our relations are of tbe. most friendly nature with Chili, the Argetine Re public, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Sal vador and HaytL t' During the past year . no . differences of fin v kind have arisen with any of these Republics and on the other hand their sympathies with the united tstaiea are constantly . expressed. - Tbe claim arising from the seizure of the car go of the brig Macedonian, in 1821, has been paid in Jtiu by the Government ol Chili. Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without prospect of an eany close. , . i . Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of tbe social and political progress in that Kepub lie It may be expected to derive new vigor trom American influence, improved by tbe rapid disappearance of slavery in tho-47nked States. I solicit your authority to furnish tbe Republic a gunboat, at a moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by installments. Soch a vessel is needed for, the safety : of -, that State against the native African races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave trade than : a sqadrou in our nanas. i . The possession if, the . least organized naval tnrce would stimulate a, generous ambition in the Republic and . the .confidence. ..which we should manifest by furnishing it wonld win for bearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations. ,'- . . i The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe by way of Beh ring's Straits ana Asiatic ttussia, wnicn was. sanctioned by Congress at its last session, has been undertak en under very favorable circumstances, by an association of Amertcen citizens, with the cord ial good will and support as well of this gov ernnieutas those of Great Britain and Russia.-' Assurances have been received from! he west of tbe South American States of their high ap preciation of the enterprise and their readiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling communication, 1 learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the Kastern Uoast ol America and Great Britain bas been renewed with 'full expectation of its early accomplishment. Thus it is hoped that with the return ol domestic peace the country wiu be able to resume with energy and advant age her former high career of commerce and civilisation.

The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the Consulate, and our relations with Egypt as well as our re lations with the Barbery Powers are entirely satisfactory. "' '"'" '..... The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China, has at last been suppressed with the co-operating good offices of this Government, and of the other Western commercial States. The judicial consular establishment has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need leg- i . ......... . uuauve intervention to adapt it to tbe extension of our commerce and to the more intimate in tercourse which has been instituted with Gov ernment and people of that vast empire. Chi na seems to be accepting with hearty good will the conventional laws, which regulate commerce and social intercourse among . the Western na tions. . Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its Government, the ac tion of that ivmpire in performing treaty stipu lations is inconstant and capricious.. - Neverthe less, good progress has . been effected by the Western Powers moving with enlightened con cert. Our own pecuniary claims have been al lowed orput in course of settlement, and the in land sea has been reopened to commerce. . ; There is reason also to believe that these pro ceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards . tbe United States. . .-. ..,, ...i ,, The ports of .Norfolk,. Fernandinia and Pens- acola have been opeDed by Proclamation.. : It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not saler and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States to resort to those and other open ports than it is to pursue, through many hazards: and at a vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military ope rations, at letst by a lawful and effective block ade. . .. ,:,.. . , For myself, I haave no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive tinder the law of na tions to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States. .. If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further re pudiated by it, 1 recommend that provisions be made effectually preventing foreign slave trad ers from acquiring domicle and facilities for their criminal occupations in this country. It is possible that if it were, a new and open ques tion the maritime powers, with the, light they now enjoy, wonld not concede the'privilege of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute as they are, and always have been, equally of ships and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither has as sidious or more successful during the last year man tney were oeior that tune in their efforts, nnder favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars. ' mk- l be desire aod determination of tbe maritime Stales to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere, and cannot be more-earnest than Eu rope. , Nevertheless unforeseen political diffi culties have arisen, and partially in Brazillian and British ports and on the northern bounda ary of the United States, which have required, and are likely to continue to require, the prac tice of constant vigilance and a just and concil iatory spirit on tbe part of the United States as well as the nations concerned and their govern ments.. ... ', V ;-', Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with great Britain en the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies iu Orogon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them. ' Iu view of the insecurity of life in the region adjacent to the Canadian border by recent as saults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notico that sifter the expiration of six months (the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrange ments with Great Britain), the.. United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the Lakes, if they shall find that proceeding necessary. , ; ,, : .,. BORDER TROUBLES. The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada to the United States, bat on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that with the approval of the Imperial Govern ment they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border.' ,: EMIGRATION. The act passed at tbe last session for the en couragement of emmigration, has as far as was possible, been put into operation. . It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds against tbe emigrants while on their way, and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition towards this great national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be recip rocated on our part by giving the emigrants ef fective national protection. I regard our emi grants as one of tbe principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its waste of national strength and health. All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream In its present fullness, and to that end the -Govern mentmust in every way make it manifest that it, does not design Ja-iuiix-e iovulu1r Juill-lary-service upon Um wW" -come from other lauds to cast their lot in our country. - OUR

Probably should the war continue lor auouier year that amount may oe increased oy cot lar Iroru hve hundred mill ions. Held as tt is, for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch ol national, though private, property.- For obvious reasons, tbe more nearly this property can be distributed among all the peo ple the better. ' To favor such general distribu tion, great inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and withoutinjury.be presented to-persons of limited means.'; With this view I suggest whother it, might not be both expedient and competent for Congress-- to provide that a limited amount ol some future issue of public securities might beheld by any bona fidu.purchaser, exempt from .taxation and from seizure for debt, under auch restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse or so importaota privilege. This would enable prudent persons to set aside a small annuity -against a iiossible day of want. Privileges like these would render the pos sessiou ol such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means, who, might be able to save enonjrh for the pur pose. -The great advantage of citizens being creditors as wen as debtors with relation to the public debt, is obvious. ? Men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they- owe to themselves. The public debt on the first of July last, although Somewhat exceeding the estimate- of the -Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commence ment of last session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the Jireceeding December, as to its probable amount at the beginning of wis year, oy tne sum oi J,aaa,U3 JJ. j This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition aud conduct ol inc operations ol the Treasury ' J NATIONAL BANKS. 7-The National Banking system is proving to be acceptable to eapitalistsiuid to the people. On the 25th of November' 584 National Banks had been organized, 'a considerable number of which were conversions from State Banks. Changes from the State system to the National system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States nd Bank of issue not authorized; by Congress. and no Bank note circulation net secured .by the Government.' ;' . . 'J That the Government and the people will de rive general benefit from this change in the banking system of the country. . can hardly be questioned. The. national system will create a reliable and peruianent influence in support of me national credit, ' ana protect the people against losses in the use of paper money. n ucLjier ot uu, any luruier legislation IS advis able lor the suppression of State liauk issues, it will be for Congress to determine.

Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad, and min eral discoveries are contained in the Report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is here with transmitted and which report also embra ces the subjects of Patents, Pensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to his De partment. The quantity of public land dis posed of during the five quarters ending oa the $0th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614 seres .were entered under the Horqfestead Law The remainder was located with military land warranto, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads, and isold for cash. . .J'hejrash received for sales and location fees was $1,019,446.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. PACIFIC RAILROAD AND TELEGRAPH. The.-reat enterprise of connecting the At lantic -with -the Pacific State by. railway and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwith standing the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles west ward from the initial point at Omaha City, Ne braska, and a preliminary location of the Pa cific Railroad of California, has been made from SacrametaW-eastward to-" the great Bend of Mucker River, in Nevada. MINERALS-INDIANS, &C. Numerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cineban -mines have- been added to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, and the subordinate ranges now teems with enter prisi ng labor which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the product of the mines of precious metals in-that region has, during the past year, reached, if not exceeded $100,000,000 in value. . It waa recommended in my last an nual message that our Indian system be remod elled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation did provide for reorgani sing the system in California, and it is believed that under the present organization the man agement of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success. , Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts oi the country, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to prov ide for the welfare - of tbe Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations and to them the attention of Congress is invited. 

PENSION LIST. The liberal provisions to invalid soldiers and sailors of-the Republic, and to the widows, or phans! and .dependent 'mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of diseases con tracted, or of wound received in the service of their country have been diligently administered. There have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last, the names of 16,770 invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seaman, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767, and of navy invalid pensioners 712. Of widows, orphans and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army pension rolls, and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25,433, and of the navy 793. At the beginning ef the year the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1,430; only 12 of inem were soldiers, oi wnom seven nave since died. The remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers. During the year end ing the 30th of June, 1864, $4,504,616 92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes. - I cheerfully commend to your continued pat ronage the benevolent institutions of the Dis trict of Columbia, which have hitherto been es tablished or fostered by Congress, and respect fully refer for information concerning these and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct, the Capitol and other matters of local interest, to the report of the Secretary."

AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. The Agricultural Department tinder the su- Eer vision of its -present energetic and faithful ead, is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance. It Is peculiarly the people's department "in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other. I commend h to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. THE WAR. The war continues since the last annual mes sage.,, ..All the important lines and positions then occupied by our: forces have been main tained, and oar armies have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in the rear, so that Missouri, - Kentucky and Tennessee and parts of other States have again produced rea sonably lair crops. - The most remarkable feature in the military operations of the vear is Gen' Mhsrmiui'a nt. tempted march of 300 miles directly through the insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy. and yet detatch a well appointed army to move on sucn an expedition. The result not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged. - Important movements have also occurred during the year to me enucy oi mouuuuK society ior durability in the Union. Although short of complete suc cess it is so much in the right direction, that 12,lHHj citizens in each ot the states of Arkan sas, and Louisiana have organized loyal State governments with free' constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and adminis ter them. The movement in the same direc tion, more extensive, though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, should not be overlooked. . Uut .Maryland presents the ex ample oi complete success. - Maryland is se cure to Liberty and Union for all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. J Like another foul spirit being driv en out, it may seek to tear her,, but it will woo her no more.- ' - - . CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the constitution abolishing sla very throughout the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for lack of the requisite two- thirds vote in the House ot .Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the same members, without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the re consideration and passage of the' measure at the present session. . Of course the abstract question is not chang ed, but an intervening election Bhows almost certainly that the nextjuongress will pass the measure, n this does not.- - Hence there is only a question- of time as to wheu the proposed amendment will go to the States for their ac tion, aud as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better. It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views, or their votes. any further than an additional element to be considered, their judgment may be effected by iW - Tt is ; the voice of the people now for the nrst time neara npon tne question. ' 

LESSON OF THE ELECTION. In a great national crisis like on ra unanimity of actiou among those seeking a common end is very-desirable, almost indispensable, and yet no approach te such unanimity is attainable, un less some defference shall be paid to tbe will of the majority simply because it is the will of the niaiority- .In this case the common end is the uiainwauJiug tafvuo vuiou, wm aiuuug urc menu - ; . c .i i - - i .i to secure that end, such a will, through the elec tion, is most clearly declared in lavor of such Constitutional amendment. - The most reliable indication of public purposes in this country is derived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its results, the ! purpose- f the. ' people within the loyal elates to maintain uie integrity oi tne u oion was never more firm nor more nearly unani mous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of vo ters met and mingled at tbe polls gave strong assurance of this. Not only all those who sup ported the Union ticket, (so called) but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fair ly claimed to entertain aud to be actuated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argu ment to this ertcct, that no candidate lor any ol fice, whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on tbe avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as to tbe proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause; bat in the distinct issue ot Union or no Union, the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no di versity among the peopla. - - ' "-In awarding the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the word this firmness and unanimity ot purpose, the election has been of vast value to the National cause. The election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known, the fact that we do not ap proach exhaustion in the most important branch of thd national resources; that of living men. W hue it is melancholy to retiect t hat tbe war has filled no many graves, and caused mourning in so many homes, it is some relief to know that compared with the surviving the fallen have been so few. Whole corps and divisions, and brigades and regiments, have formed and fought, and dwindled and gone out of existence. " A freat maioritv of the men who comnrianl them are still living. The same is trneof the naval service. The election returns prove this. So many voters could not else be found. The States reguarly holding elections, both now and four yeas ago, to wit: Cellifornia, Conneticnt, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Keutncky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min nesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast 3,982,011 votes bow. again 3,870522 cast then; shows an aggregate now of 3,398,211, to which is to be added 33,762 cant now in the new States of Kansas, ami Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860; thus swelling the aggregate to 5,075,673, and thf net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145,751. A table is appended showing particular. To this, again, should be added the numlwr of all soldiers in the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Iudiana, Illinois, and Califor nio, who, by the law of those States, could hot vote away from their homes, and which number cannot be less than 90.000. Nor yet is thia all. The number in organized territories in tripple now what it was four years ago, while thousands of white and black join us at the national arms and press back the insur gent lines. So much is shown affirmatively and negatively by the election. It is not mate rial to enquire bow the increase has been pro duced, or show that it would have beeu greater but for the war which is probably true. ': The important fact remains demonstrated, that we have more men now than we had when the war began, that we are not exhausted, nor in process of exhaustion, that we are gaining strength, and may if need be, maintain the con test indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever. The national resources then are un exhausted, and as we believe inexhanstiable. The public purpose tore-establish and main tain the National authority is unchanged, and as we believe unchangeable. The manner ot con tinuing the effort remains to choose. On care ful consideration of all the evidence accessible, it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accept nothing short of the severance of the Union. . His declarations to that effect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. We cannot voluntarily yield it betweeen him and us. The issue is distinct simple and inflex ible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If we yield we are beaten. If the Southern people fail him he is beaten. Either way it would oe the victory and defeat following war. What is true how ever of him who heads the Insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow. Al though he cannot reaccept the Union they can. Some of them we know already - desire peace andre-nnion. The number of such may increase. They can any moment have peace simply by lying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. After so doing the government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it- If ques tions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislations, conference, courts, and voting, operating only in Constitu tional and lawful channels. Some certain and other possible questions are and would be be yond the Executive power to adjust; for instance, the admission of members into Congress, aud whatever might require the appropriation of money. The executive power itself would be greatly diminished by tbe cessation of actual war. Pardons anal remissions of forfeiture, however, would still be within executive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be ex ercised can be fairly judged by the past. A year ago, general pardon and amnesty upon specified terms were offered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the expected classes were still within contemplations of special clemency. , During the year many availed themselves of the general provisions, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some' led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time, also, special pardons have been granted to individuals of excepted classes, and no voluntary application on has been denied. Thus, practically, the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in con dition to make a free choice; that is, such as were in custody or nnder restraint. It is still open to alL but the time may come probably will come, when public duty shall de mand that it be closed, and then in lieu more vorous measures than heretofore shall be adop- THE SLAVERY QUESTION. of armed re sistance of the National authority on the part of At - .1 , ' f. , , un inBurgeuu), ttuu n tne oniy indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government,! retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. - . 1 I repeat tne declaration made a year ago, and that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retractor modify the Eman cipation Proclamation, nor shall I return to sla very any person who is free by the terms of that Proclamation, or by any of the acts of Con gress.

The New Orleans Era contains details of General Lee's great cavalry expedition, fully confirming previous reports as to its success. CoL Fonda, 118th Illinois, was in command of one column and proceeded to fort Hudson, and thence to Jackson, he. sur Erised a rebel camp, dispersed it and captured i prisoners, 200 stands of arms, 100 horses. 25 army wagons, aud a large amount of military stores. He then moved forward and joined the main column under ueneral .bee, who, thus re inforced, marched upon Liberty. - ' Another column had been started from Baton Rouge' for Liberty, nnder Colonel Marsh, of the 2d Illinois cavalry : This column reached Lib erty and surprised the rebel General Hodge in command there, who barely escaped capture by jumping irora a baca winnow, uut au tne members ot Die Stan were laaen, including Lieutenant Davis, (a nephew of Jeff.) i -. Colonel Marsh remained here until the arri val of General Lee, when two expeditions ' were dispatched still further into the enemy's lines: one going to Brook Haven, under Colonel Fon da, and the other to Summit, nnder Colonel Bassford of the 14th New York Cavalry. At Brook Haven a train of cars, loaded with all kinds of military stores, waa captured and destroyed, as also the buildings containing Quar termaster stores. Fifty prisoners were taken, a section of artillery and 40 wagons loaded with stores. - , - ; Colonel Bassford found a large quantity of stores at Summit, and as the place was sur prised, he secured the whole and destroyed it. He then returned to Liberty with 25 prisoners and some valuable trophies of this successful raid. - ' - '':" . ' While these expeditions were absent, Gener al Lee was attacked at liberty by Colonel Scott, and the most vigorous fight was kept up for two hours, and, although Lee's forces were outnum bered by Scott's, the rebels were finally obliged to retire. The result of the fight was the cap ture of 28 prisoners, one 12-pound howitzer and 30 dead on tbe field. The expedition then re turned to Baton Rouge. Our loss was not over 20. In for It. The Indianapolis Journal states that the se curities of CoL John C. Walker are becoming very solicitous to learn that gentleman s exact whereabouts.

Officers who witness ed the fight at Franklin, yesterday, describe the battle as one of the most sanguinary of the war. The determined bravery of the Confederates ex ceeded anything before seen. A Ithotigh slaugh tered by hundreds, they still advanced against our batteries. Within five hours, eleven distinct assaults were made against our works each be ing a failure. Our forces, tbe battle being end ed, quietly withdrew from the town. Among the casualties is Major General Stanley wound ed by a shot in the neck. The rebel General Cheatham is reported wounded. Killed Capt Bissell, 128th Ind.; CapC Staley, 124th Ind.; Major of 128th Ind.; Hiutone,124th Ind. Mortally Wounded Col. Lowry, 107th 111; killed, Capt. Carrington, of Gen. Cox's staff; Capt. Dowling, 111th O., Wouuded; Colonel Waters, 3d brigade, 1st division, wounded. Rebel Casualties. Brig. Gen. Adams killed; Brig. Gen. Scott wounded. The total loss of the enemy's killed, wounded and prisoners is estimated at 4,000; 3,000 being killed or Wounded . The Federal loss in killed and wounded is 700; our loss in prisoners is trifl ing. Our loss in regimential and field officers are very heavy. Gen. Bradfield is also wound ed in the city. In addition to the Federal wounded is CoL Stockton and Maj. James of the 72d Illinois. . : One hundred and seven Confederate officers, including one Brigadier-General, several Colo nels and 1,000 prisoners, arrived in tbe city thia morning, captured in the fight of last night near Franklin, TenDv ; A great battle is momentarily expected. Nashville, Dec. 4. Nothing of special inter est has transpired to-day along tbe lines. Our artillery waa used at different points against the rebels who are engaged in erecting breastworks within half a mile of ours. Prisoners brought in to-day say that Brig. Gens. Gist, Stabl, Gramberry and Brown, of the rebel array, were killed at Franklin. General Gheatham lost ev ery Brigadier in his Corps. Bridgeport and Chattanooga are sate. Nashville aud the sur rounding country for miles has been converted into a huge fort. The destruction of rebel prop erty in the defenses and city is immense. Al most all the rich property-holders hereabouts are rebel sympathizers, and the advance of the rebel army necessitated the destruction of their property. The Federal position is perfectly satisfactory. LATER. The rebel loss of men and officers in the bat tle of Franklin proves to have been very iyer. The loss in men reaches 6,000 without doubt, and ten Generals in killed, wounded and captur ed, including Major General Cleburne, whose death is confirmed. The loss of rebel officers is without a parallel. - . -.. - Our brave Ohio officers stood foremost in the fight. Of the ten brigades engagod at Franklin, six were commanded by Ohio officers, viz: Riley, Lane, Opdycke, Strickland, Casement, and Lew Kirby. ..' .... It is now stated that our loss in killed, wound ed and captured, will not fall short of 2,000. Nashville Decemer, o. 1 esterday a body of rebels attacked the block house six and seven near Murfreesboro'. They were gallantly fought by the garrisons, and soon a body of troops, sent by Milroy from Morfreeslioro', arrived, who at tacked the rebels with such effect that they were soon driven off in confusion, losing six pieces of artillery and a number of prisoners. SHERMAN'S EXPEDITION. WashingtoivDecember 5. Tbe Republican of this city in an extra publishes the following: "By the arrival of Government transports at Fortress Monroe, Government has received ad vices from Sherman to the 2d. When the steam er left information had reached Savannah that Sherman 'sad Vance cavalry was within six miles of that city. This dees not conflict with news brought by the steamer Belle, which arrived Saturday night that Savannah papers announced Sherman within forty miles from that city. These papers do not state at what date he was that distance from the city. ' , A gentleman recently from Savannah informs us there is no important defences on the west side ot Savannah. Baltimore Dec, 5. The American has tbe fol lowing special correspondence: Advices from Fort Monroe, last evening, report the arrival there oi the steamer lien. .Lyon, with iM releas ed prisoners. At the time the Gen. Lyon left Savannah, last Thursday night, the latest news received there was to tbe effect that Sherman occupied Millen, Ga., and that his cavalry were scouting seven mues one trom tbe town, -with but little resistance. . Every effort was' being made for the defence of Savannah. Our priso ners report boys 13 years old, and even women, assisting in the trenches and earthworks. Sher man was slowly, but surely, advancing to the coast, and no doubt oi his success need be enter tained, : f . : , , ; A letter in the Augusta Chronicle 'from a member of the Georgia Legislature, giving his experience in escaping from Sherman's army, he and others having been taken across the coun try, shows the extent of the devastation inflict ed on the country.
