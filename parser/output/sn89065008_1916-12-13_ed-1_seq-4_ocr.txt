From 1 present indications it would appear to be the policy of the country to bring defensive prepared ness to the point where we feel secure should the j unforseen occur. This policy is resulting in the| of building of large and more modern battleships,! more efficient coast defenses, the strengthening[ a' 0 f the army of such like precautions, he i This is good as a present precautionary policy, on but something more than these measures are needed if we are to be a thoroughly prepared nation, is I : Every corporation, partnership, individual, [ our- <dt '" during 1910. pays salary, interest, ren , Europe is ; war mad.

If we remember that, it is the easier to under stand why there is no serious movement for peace; 00 in Berlin or Vienna, in London or Paris or Petro giad or Rome. Neither the military nor the eco-|°ff 5.00 in rnie resources of either side have been ex academic peace can be contsructed. There is now statesmanship in Europe equal to the*task. Germany is ready to discuss peace, but not to < discuss a possible peace, nor is there good faith | b ck of the German suggestions. They are in-! sixltended for home consumption more than for lor-iTins jeign consumption. i be j 1 or reasons of domestic politics, it was neces-jthe ! si.ry at the outset for the Imperial Government to ] justify itself to the German people by proclamiug i the war tobe a defensive war undertaken only to * protect the Fatherland from jealous and unscru to pulous enemies. For dynastic reasons, that fiction of .must he maintained to the end. In accordance j with it, oflidal Germany has professed a willing un-, no-ss to discuss peace ever since the Battle of the j A.arne shattered the dream of Teutonic domi fcr [nation. But the only kind of peace that Ger first. u any is prepared to consider is one based on the s atus quo ante, and that is a peace which the hsusted, and this is not a war out of which ani . the: allies will not accept. Nor can they -be blamed. However obscure the original sources of this loss, war and in whatever manner history may appor to'tion the blame, one essential fact remains. Ger macy w r ere exhaused. trial they have been compelled _to make, neither tnc French nor the British people could permit their Government to,accept at this time any terms that Germany would accept, re- n.acy were exhausted. In view of the sacrifices In view'of the sacrifices I ! Nobody can foresee the end of this war, but it. is has plainly passed out -of the hands of Govern meats and into the hands of peoples. To that ex- ^ ex-i tent it is a popular war, and it must continue , U nul there is a dominating popular sentiment on ^ in one side or the other in favor of peace on the most 1 merciful terms that can be obtained. There is no filed:guch sentiment today anywhere in Europe, and C1 j t my Government outside of Russia which pro FOR,posed a peace unacceptable to public opinion would lace revolution,at home. European Governments are no lpnger masters of the situation. Third-rate statesmanship and third-rate diplomacy can involve the world in a war that even first-class statesmanship and first class diplomacy cannot terminate. Our Civil War ended when the South, driven £ by hunger and destitution and death was pre pared to accept peace on any basis consistent with j civilization. The European war will end when I one side or the other is ready to accept similar terms, or, as an alternative, when'all the belliger*^° en ts are so exhausted that they can no longer edn tinue the struggle and must accept mediation.— New York W orld, In that they are : right.

Editor Daily Commonwealth: I enclose an editorial clipped from the "New York World" of Nov. 28th which I should tee glad ; to have you publish. The majority of our people I appreciate what our beloved South endured in her struggle for Constitutional liberty, into!though, occasionally, from very young men, flip-] Ipant, disparaging references to the "hardships! and sufferings" of our people in those trying days, i "privations and sacrifices" which this Northern | I writer thinks harder to endure than the terrible! |conditions in Belgium, Poland and Servia. In this 1 troops'connection I beg to refer to the lamentable imbifevI i en ce of our young people as to the history of that! epoch, I hear The ignorance as to the actual occurances I of the four years of bloody strife and to the i 'causes leading to it are truly surprising when one thinks of the apparent eagerness for information generally, Yours truly, P. W. SHEARER. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Daily Commonwealth gave its readers yes terday afternoon President Wilson's complete message to Congress, which was delivered at one ! o'clock on that day. The Memphis News-Scimi tar only gave its readers a half column news item about the message, and the Commercial Appeal published the address this morning. That's the difference between a real live afternoon paper and j the less progressive ones 1 —and the difference, from a news service standpoint, between the up to- date afternoon newspaper and the morning publication, is so largely in favor of the former that comparison is ridiculous.
