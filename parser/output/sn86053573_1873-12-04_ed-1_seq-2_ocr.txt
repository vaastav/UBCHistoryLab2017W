The tnfmWrM Loth linn?, have ljnin workliw'ttionl tfwy really lnttntlM to Ao tdinrlhlofirr ih4 rt..f ot the distresses ot tlio pensile. jqaMtpiJt LUI1 hare been Intro- unccti looking w mo restoration ot mo pnoiic concacDco la tne enrroncy ana banking busi ness ot the country All tho titrable now rompltlnodof are traceable to the recent panics and that panic was simply the demon s tratlon of a want of confidence In the banks and bankers of the country. Thli panic was precipitated by a temporary scarcity of money just about tho time that tho most currency was needed for tho tramfer of the crops from tho Interior to market, from tho producer to tho consumer. The people took the alarm at tho failure of a single prlrate banking lionse and one national bank, withdrew their roufldcnco momentarily from nil moneyed Institutions and hoarded their funds at home. But, our national banking system hating withstood Ml test, reason Is now rctnmtng, ana lueso inmls are urala eccklmr clrcnli tlon In tho community, and it U funnel that lucre u quite as mocu currency la the coun try now a thirt was before tho panic 00 Mirrcd. . Tula experience has shown Congress that money Is scarce or plenty according as there mb disposition to hoard it. Iteaily. a clrcn- litlng medium Is good for nothing to hoard. It earns nothing. It Is only when passing from band to hand, In the liquidation of claims or Mils, that It becomes beneficial. Therefore the exact amount of tho circulating medium necessary for the proper transaction of the t.nlnes of the country depends en tirely upon the rapidity w 1th which tt tpoeds on Its way In the liquidation of debts and the length of time that It Is detained In the hands of receivers, whether they be Individuals, bankers, banks or tho Government before It I again started on Its natursl mission. It should also bo recollected. In legislating upon this subject, that remittances are made In these latter days by railway and telegraph about tcS times as rapidly as they were thirty jears ago, when the malls were carried by slago coaches, and were the most speedy means of communication. Consequently the amount of circulation per capita necessary to Uc proper transaction of the business of the country, la these days ot cash payments, ond with a currency equally good In all parti ot the nation, sarin discounts and exchange amounting to some millions annually. Is not nearly as great as formerly. Hut at the saute tlmo the largo accession of four mil lions of population In the persons of emanci pated slates, who as freed men became re sponsible users of currency on their own ac count, added considerably to the collective necessity. If our forty millions of popula tion ghe eight millions of families, each of m hlch requires on an avcrago ono hundred dollars of tho medium for the purpose of rffmlnff exchanges tetwcrn tho product of lolor aud means of subsistence. It Is found that In round numbers we require elgl t hun dred millions of currency a tho whole vol ume. Tholabsrcr it ho rcrchc" ten dollars per week nAkcs that amount cflrit Ids ex ilianges, while tho shtcvu hundred dollar 1 Icrfc requires thirty dollar, and so on ao lording to the amount of huslnes transacted ly different Individual. From this It will be M-en that It Is the credit system that lrgets I he supposed necessity of a large volume of the irrigating medium. Cosh trade Umore lit rly, and keeps money moving from hand lo hand In snnll sums n necessities arise. When the consumer pays rash for Ms goods he cnnMes the merchant to constantly ro Un1hhItoik The result Is that the rr t tiler for ea.h only suffer no loss from I.! di'M, and can turn over hi llitlo tapl- Ul threo hundred limes annually. If he nets nnly lire ptr cent, upon enrh turn Mi capital tt ill yield him fifteen hundred per cent, rer anuum, whereas tho rapltillsl who ghes one month' credit and siiffem oeeaslouol loupes from bad debts only turns his capital ncrtwrltc times a jear, andshouIJ net one liundred and twenty-fito percent, at eah turning to equal the fifteen hundred per rent, per annum secured by the small trader re ferred to al)tc. Tho transaction of busi ness on the credit system, therefore, nqutresainueh larger toluinoot currency than on tho cash basis, because It Is necessa rily Idle a good portion of tho tlmo reqnlrcd to accumulate In sulllclent sums to meet the large payments resulting from largo orders. Mhllo tho accumulation Is going on the temptation Is strong to Invest In some out sldo speculation, m Ith the hope of a safe re turn with large elns before tho bills of pur ihoo become dne. Bnch expectations are ranly reatlzetl, Iho capital thus diverted f 1 om legilsmate business produces embarrass ment, perhaps failure. A reilnndancy of IrredecmaMo currency stimulates prices, In duces spenulatlon and Imparts a general de sire on behalf of a largo portion of tho com munity to make haste to bo rich l.y their ttltsorlwk, nnd without toll. Industryte omes paralyzed with neglect. AILprlncIples that apply to ludlvldual Hoanee and personal economy are e pially applicable to lueonomles ana finances of a nation. It need no wiseacre or sophist to devise ways and means out of our national dilemma. Their plans all tend only to mystery and de lusion. Tho man who has Hooded his torn munlty with due-bllh payablo at conve nience 1 an only maintain that circulation by u fixed sj stem of redemption. Ills extrav agance ( an I corrected only by a rigid econ omy. On tho quceiloiof finance It is Indisputa ble that the I'tcsUcot Is pursuing In a spirit of honttt, earnest, Inquiry tho right direc tion, lie would avuld ruinous commercial revulsions by gradual approaches to the Ieclo basis. It hit kffoiU ami example are seconded by Congress In a like spirit, tho re mit t will bo to develop our system of national hanking Into the 1 illicit ensoof freedom 4 0inpatllloulth the safety of the matcrhl Intel est of the country.

The carefnlly-prrpared speech delivered in Iho Senate yesterday by Mr. Morrill, of Ver mont, was fall of Interesting facts, and will well repay atarfut rerncsL Tho present condition of on? currency was f alt bf allde pleted, together with the evils bywhlh wo are surrounded, and they were contrasted with the nnmerons lcnfiu to no iiertred fromjtretnrn to rpecle payment and Its accompanying actual values. Onr present financial sltnatlon was attributed by the speaker to a redundancy ol Irredeemable pa ner railed money, and that we persist In making It the standard of Raines. Mr. Mor rlllrriargesthat there lino proper effort of legislation made to remedy this stato of affairs. And no lnilststbat congress snoum fix a time not more remote than January 1, 18. for the resumption of specie rayments. Benator Morrill arpean to have forgotten that our paper currency readied Its present vol time during a period of fire Tears, and by a cradunl process. Our present appreciated valoes may to flclltlon, but they are no less arbitrary. Contracts for real and other prop erty made during the last eight years upon arbitrary, appreciated price call for a spcel Ced number ot dollars in lawful money. An Immediate return to a gold standard would hare the effect to drpreclato values of and personal property fully thlrtylhree and one third per cent. Tho President does not think It fair that all thl loss should fall upon the present holders and Involve Ihcm In a common ruin. It la an easy miller to dilute alcohol by the sudden Infmdon of wateri but Its resto ration to Its orlclnal proof by the process of redistillation Is more stow and tedious. So It Is with a diluted currency. If a disturb ance of commercial and Industrial lalues Is toboaoldedby tho process of restoration to tho specie hasl It must bo accomplished by gradual and easy approaches. In eight years there has been a gradual reduction In too market price of gold of about one nun' dred and fifty, and yet Mr. Morrill says that we hare made no effort to return to a gold standard. The gradual reduction of the pub lic debt, and economy of expenditures by the administration of President Grant, has ef fected this with but slight disturbance of commercial affairs, and If the wise sugges tions contained In tho President's message re lating to the currency are followed by Con gress, and an Interest-bearing postal or other currency be gradually substituted for tho legal-tender, non-I nlcrcst bearing Irredeem able notes, there Is little, doubt that gold and paper currency will be on a par with each other much sooner than that event can be bronght about by any arbitrary enactment prescribing a Died date. Toe latter course would open up nn admlrablo field for gold gamblers In which to make corners, and would doubtless enable them to depreciate paper currency and Government bonds far below their Intrintle value. Legislation can no more by an arbitrary enactment forco people to pay In tho gold they cannot obtain than It can make paper equal to gold In ratne by the same process. 

NEEDED UEFOUIIIH. ' Among tho reforms suggested by tho Presi dent In his message Is a constitutional amend ment anthorulng "tho Executive to approve of so much ot any measure passing the two houses ot Congress as his Judgment may dic tate, without approving tho whole, the dis approved portion or portions to be subjected to the same rules as now, to wltt to be re-' ferrcd back to the house In which the meas- uie, or measures, originate!, and If passed by a two-third vote ot the two houses, then to become a law without tho approval of the President." " I would add to this, says the President, "a provision that there should be no legislation by Congress during the lost twenty-four honrs of its sitting except upon vetoes, In order to gho tho Executive an op portunity to cxamlno and approvo or disap prove bills undcrstaudlngly." It Is almost too much to expect lmmcdiato action upon either of these propositions) but there can be no doubt that ultimately they will ie em bodied In tho organic law. The closing hours ot a session ot Congress arc fruitful In all manner of Jobs. It Is the hanest tlmeot the lobbyist. In. the hurry and haste and excitement, the era of good feeling that generally prevails all manner ot corrupt measures slip throngh without dne Investigation and Inquiry. Tho desire to save Important LIU compels honest memlers to consent to the passage of "riders to bills whli ti they kmrt to le wrong, and Intended solely to tnke money In one shape or an other out of the Trcnsurj, The Exemilre is phuvd In somewhat the same position. 80 grett I the necessity or legislation lu this dlrci tlon that tho constitutional con vention of Pennsylvania adopted a clause almo.it Identical w tin. that suggested by the President, vlr., empowering the Clov error to veto any portion of a 1111 and ep- proie of the balance. There Is Tery little il anger that power of this character would be abused, that It would be exercised except In the Interest of the public. Tbe last forty- eight hours oi a legislative session, National or State, Is generally rooro dangeronsto tho people, and fraught with more evil than the preceding weeks and month put together, aud too many checks cannot I1 imposed upon both tho legislative and executive power. The passage of some such law as that sug gested by the President would bean cxet I- lent step In the direction of reform, and It Is tol hoped tint the coming Judiciary Com mittee of the Senate or House will at least report upon tho subject.

NAI.AUV ItEIM CTJON II I Li It has been dct Ided by a caucus of tho Re publican mcmlicrs of the House ot repre sentatives to rrport a bill going back to tbe old compensation of the thousand dollars a year for Congressmen. Tho sooner this h dono tho letter. In Increasing Us compen sation Congress mado a great and grave mis take. The whole conn try Is against It, and It It Idle lo throw the responsibility for the clamor that has been rl.l In regard to It npon tho newspapers, ttn political con ventions that bate Ucn held dnrlng the lat t or eight months took eten more decided grjtind than the Journal of cither parly, and in their plat form, speeches and resolution were more outspoken In Us denunciation. Predictions are already made that this action upon the part of tho "cauens" Is merely Intended for effect a seeming deference to tho popular demand, that It will l sent through the House Immediately and killed or lost In the Senate. It thl Is the Intention, 1-rttrr let the whole thing rest where It Is. The country Ja In earnest In this matter, and It w III not do to trifle with It. Tho mechanic, tho farmer and the merchant have mado up their minds that flu thousand iloliars per onnnm Is enough to pay for upon an average flte months' work. Values are shrinking every dayj wagea nro being re duced, real estate Is tumbling from lu fancy prices, railroad stocks uro selling only for what they aro really worth, the pay of Con gressmen nlono Is upon the advance. There l no reason In tho w orld why, lu tho general shrinkage of values, the salaries of legis lators alone should expand. The expenses of living arc being reduced. Trices arc lower now than they wero a year ago, as a glance at tho mirkU report will (ominsivcly show. i;ui however an thl may be, tiuro is one thing ftloluttl 4crta1n, that the umntry lommimNn retum to the old rate of eom- pcmnllon to members of Congress, and the party In Congresa that 1 dire tly respon--il lo to the tH 111 try U etpectt d to obey that 1 ommaiul Iftiik omiobition ot the House Com mittee on Flections announced by Speaker Itlalne yesterday I unt indication of his general policy In regard to tho preference of old members of commftees according to se niority In tho construction oX-tha commit tees ot the present Congress, there will be many disappointed members In the House to day There are but three members ot the old committee placed upou tho new The chairman, Mr. 11.
