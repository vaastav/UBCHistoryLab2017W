The Hoy Mayor's Latest Awakening- Major McCaskrin came out of his .-paMn. a last night's session of the common council, long enough to make sin:e admirable suggestions to the aUlermanie assembly, which, had he heretofore deiorted himself in a man lier worthy of the respect of the 1 g-i-liitive branch of the city government, "onld have been apt to receive the at tention they really deserve. While hardly compatible with the major's avowed policy of putting the town to t lie bad and growing moss iu i he streets, the recommendations are for the inot part in line with what The Ar gus hiis been urging for years. These are i lie things that the mayor recommend ed, in the form of a message in lit ll of the expected document treating of his Sunda closing crusade: An adequate tire alarm system; a safe, up-to-date hook and ladder wagon: a tire engine; action relative to Koek Island arsenal; a building commission: a stone pile; the establishment of police and lire commissions beyond the reach uf pol itics, and declaring the counsel for the city had blundered in the storm drain case in taking advantage of the exemption law in the premises. In all the legitimate recommenda tions of the major as to the fire alarm, lnx'k and ladder wagon, lire engine, i he building, police and fire commis sions, the major covers ground that should have been included in his in augural message, and in each of the named propositions he is correct to the lett r. Had he at the very outset of his ca reer set forth public needs and stood by them witli an intelligence and con sistency that would have won the r siet and cooperation of the council, instead of Hying about from one thing 10 another, he would have been nearer the ideal that he promised the people in the event of his election. Tlie mayor's recomniendat ion which t he council adopted looking to cooperative action in view of the situation at Kock Island arsenal, and sustaining the atti tude of the Tri-City Press club, is of course timely. The stone pile sugges tion is hardly so important as any of the others, while the declaration per taming to the storm drain involves a juestiou of prudence entirely. The city employed counsel to defend the city's interests in the long pending lit igation, and their acts are a matter of law and expediency. The lawyer is as a rule eugaged iu much the same spirit as the physician, is. for his expen knowledge aud his caiability to cope with such exigencies as may arise. anil exhaustive manner in which the president treats of every topic and de tail, and there is evidence of the vigor characteristic of the man. he is per haps more conservative in some re spects than he has been heretofore. At the very outset he takes up the subjects that are paramount in the public mind the trusts and railway rate legislation. As a curative expedi ent, as far as rtie former is concerned. he suggests federal supervision. The question of railway rate legislation foe handles with extreme caution, but pro poses an administrative body with lower to regulate evil charges. Hia stand on federal supervision of trusts is commendatory in the highest sense, but whether or not his plan of railway rate legislation is not simply in line with the interstate commerce commis sion, is to be developed. Various other topics of which the pres ident treats are labor, the revision of revenues. The Hague conference. San to Domingo, naval training, pensions, immigration, the Philippines, which he feels need help from congress, the Panama canal, etc. The president advocates an increase iu coast artillery and defenses, more seamen rather than more ships at pres ent, deprecates class spirit as fatal to all communities in which it has been dominant, and again pledges his adher ence to the principle of a square deal to all. The President's Me stage. President Roosevelt's message to the Gyth tougress. his first great state pa per since iluctiou into the executive office by his own right, as read to the congress today, appears in complete form in this issue of The Argus. The document is a voluminous one. of 27 column, and. apart from the thorough Shall a Woman Die on the Scaffold? The supreme court of the United States has decided that it has no juris diction over the case of Mary Rogers, the Vermont woman accused of the murder of her husband to secure his life insurance and marry another man. Nothing stands between this woman and death on the scaffold but the gov ernor of the state, and that official has declared he will not interfere. The crime committed by this woman was an atrocious one. but none the les. there is a strong sentiment throughout the country against hanging a woman. There may have been no excuse for this crime and nothing can palliate the offense. It was fiendish. I5ut Mary Rogers is a woman, and sentiment re volts against the execution of a wo man. Hanging, while brutalizing, is sup jMised to deter others. In this case the awful lesson will be lost, as Mary Rog ers committed the crime over a year ago. Had she been tried, convicted and executed within reasonable time after the crime was committed, it might have had a deterrent eff"ct. So long a time has elapsed that the crime has been forgotten and sympathy has been aroused for the miserable woman. And Mary Rogers is a miserable wo man. She is weak morally and men tally. She is more of an imbecile than a degenerate. To put this moral and mental weakling to death would be an inhuman act. It would have no ex ample. The justice that requires it is mistaken if not brutal. We ought to be too far advanced in the scale of mercy, refinement and humanity now to gibbet a weak woman. Mary Rogers should be saved this awful death. The place for her is a prison, where she should spend h?r natural life. Such a disposition of this friendless wretch would do credit to the state of Vermont. Her execution would forever disgrace that commonwealth. The ChaugA la Inauguration Day. The national committee on the pro posed change uf inauguration day has decided to recommend to congress an amendment to the constitution making the date of the presidential inaugura tion the last Thursday of April. It would be difficult lo say ju.-t wheu the agitation for a change iu the date of the inauguration of American presi dents began, but it has been in pro gress quite steadily for almost a cen tury. The cases of illness and death that follow nearly every inauguration give impetus and force to the agitation for a time, but while practically every body is agreed that the date should be changed, there has been until now no systematized movement to bring it about. After this year's inauguration a formal movement was set on foot to unite the whole country in an effort to have the constitution amended so that a less Inclement date might be fixed. The list of casualties last March, al though the day was an exceptionally pleasant one for the season, gave spe cial impetus to the movtment. Sena tor Hate of Tennessee. Judge Weldon of the court of claims, and the Mexican ambassador died because of exposure during the exercises. It is not an easy matter to procure the adoption of an amendment to the federal constitution. Amendments may be proposed by two-thirds of both houses of congress, or on the applica tion of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states calling a convention for promising amendments. Amendments so proposed will be valid when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states or by conventions in three fourths of the states, as preferred by congress. In regard to the proposed change of inauguration day. :i is be lieved that there will be no great diffi culty in inducing congress to propose the necissary amendment. The senate has already on two occasions adopted the required joint resolution by a unanimous vote. Itis failed in the house either t hronXltlack of interest or because of the pressure of other business. The. mission of "iiarly Risers" is to clear the way and give nature full sway.
