PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S FIRST MESSAGE A~r the War Department must be made solely ' : ' d 'regard to the- good of the servlce and to the tl ' arit , and merit of the man himself. No pressure. iticsl social or personal, of any kind will be p0 " it rd ;o exercise the least effect in any ques- P* r ' of promotion or detail; and if there Is reason Iio " ]ieve , that such pressure is exercised at the in lo. at j or of the oiScer concerned, it will be held to [t , e against him. In our army we cannot afford 01 have rewards or duties distributed save on the 10 ale jrround that Those -who by their own merits ** ,titled to the rewards get them, and that *iose who arc Peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them. Ever}' effort should be made to bring- the army to • ronstantly increasing state of efficiency. When * aetua! service no work save that directly in the C-_(C -_( of such sen-ice should be required. The paper ''or* in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly 0PP (j. What is needed is proved power of cor ned *nd capacity to work well in the field. Con cast <* re fs necessary to prevent dry rot in the Importation and commissary departments. 

MANOEUVRES IN MASS. * (jurErmy la so small and so much scattered that jtrery difficult to give the higher officers (as well *JJK ltwr.r officers and the enlisted men* a chance 3 practise manoeuvres in mass and on a compara bly large scale. In time of need no amount of ggSlCaal excellence -would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole, under skilful and daring leader ship. The Congress should provide means whereby •: will be possible to have field exercise by at least i aiviEicn of regulars, and, if possible, also a divis ion of National Guardsmen, once a year. These exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres; ■C. If on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic seaboard, or in the region of the Great Lakes, the army corps when assembled could be marched from some inland point to some point on the water, there embarked, disembarked after a couple of days' Journey at some other point, and again marched inland. Only by actual handling and providing for nen in masses while they are marching, camping, embarking find disembarking- -will it be possible to train the officers to perform their duties well gr.is smoothly. A great debt Is owing- from the public to the men cf th* army and navy. They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may be able to respond in stantly to any demand made upon, them to sustain • the interests of the nation and the honor of the flap. The individual American enlisted man is probably on the -whole a more formidable lighting nan than the regular of any other army. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the highest standard of usefulness should be ex acted from him. It Is well worth -while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon seoond and subsequent enlistments should rot be increased to correspond with the in creased value of the veteran soldier. Much good has already come from the act re organizing 1 the army, passed early In. the present year. The three prims reforms, all of them of lltarally inestimable value, are, first, the substitu tion of four year details from the. line for perma nent appointments In the so-called staff divisions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head: third, the establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the army. It -would be difficult to overestimate the improve ment in the efficiency of our army which these three reforms are making, and have in part already effected. The reorganization provided for by the, act has been substantially accomplished. The improved conditions in the Philippines have enabled the War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the num ber of soldiers so as to bring this number much rearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law. There is. however, need of supplementary legislation. Thorough military edu cation must be provided, and in addition to the regulars the advantages of this education should be given to the officers of the National Guard and others in civil life who desire Intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given the chance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this art. At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good in actual field service; too much etrees should not be laid a mathematics, nor ehould proficiency therein be Me to establish the right of entry to a corps mite. The typical American officer of the best Bad need not be a rood mathematician: bnt he must be able to master himself, to control others asd to show boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency. 

MILITIA AND VETERANS. Action should be taken in reference to the militia «nd to the raising of volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and ■worthless. The organization and armament of the National Guard of the several States, which are treated as militia in the appro priations by the Congress, should be made identical Kith those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the guard in time of war should be carefully defined, and a system estab lished by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance. It is utterly Impossible in the excitement and haste of impending war to do this satis factorily If the arrangements have not been made lons beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called Ml the training of those citizens -who have already had experience under arms, and especially for the selection la advance of the officers of any force ■which may be raised: for careful selection of the toai necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war. That the armr is not at all a m«>ro instrument <£ destruction has been shown during the last three yezrs. In the Philippines. Cuba and Porto Rico it has proved itfcelf a great constructive force, a aost potent implement for the upbuilding of & Peaceful civilization. Xo other citizens deserve s>o wHI of the republic •s the vett-ranE. the «urvivor= of those who saved the T*r.icm. They did the one deed which if !<*ft todosc- would have meant that all <»lse in our &*tory w-.t for nothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all rcr annals wnuid be meaningless, and our great txperlment ir. popular freedom and self-government & flooay failure. Moreover, they not only left us * waited nation, but they left us also as a heritage ft* cemory of the mighty deo3s by which the o^ion was kept united. We are now Indeed one astioc, one in fact ac well as in name: we are in our devotion to the flag which is the **■ of national greatness and unity; and the eomrieteneßß of our union enables us all, in T part of the country, to glory in the valor * a *B ailkc by the eons of the North and the sons c-'thec -'the South in the times that tried men's souls. men who in the last three years have done 10 *eH in the East and the West Indies and on the — tiling of Asia have- shown that this remem fcranc* is not lost. In any serious crisis the United Sutes nuj rt rply for the great mass of its lighting snsn upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a Permtnent profession of the military career; and ■"'beriever eu"h a crisis arises the deathless memo rt?!l of the Civil War will sdve to Americans the llft <* lofty purpose which comes to those whose -athers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle. CIVIL SERVICE. Tbe merit system of making appointments is in 't* esser.ee as democratic and American as the waifflon school system itself. It Pimply means that & clerical and other positions where the duties *!"• entirely non-political all applicants should have a fair field and no favor, each standing on his ffi wits as he 1c able to show them by practical test. Written competitive examinations offer the °niy available means in many cases for applying *!« system. In other capes, as where laborers are <mploy*d, a system of registration undoubtedly can ** »i~.fcly extended. There are. of course, places ►here the written competitive examination cannot •* applied, and others where it offers by no means *0 ideal solution, but where under existing political Seditions it Is, though an imperfect means, yet *c best present means of getting satisfactory Wherever the conditions have permitted the ap- P&eatlon of the merit system In its fullest and ■Meet sense tie gain to the government has been •ttnior.v,. The navy yards and postal service Illue &M« probably better than any other branches of the Sovf-mmeni the great gain in economy, efficiency *nfl honesty due to the enforcement of this prin «He. . I recommend the passage of a law which will ***«-r,<l <;,,. classified service to the District of **"***«ibia. or will at least enable the President thua to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the Civil Service law. It Is important to have this system obtain at home, but it Is even more Important to have it applied rigidly In our insular possessions. Not an office should be filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to the man's eartisan affilia tions or services, with any regard to the political. social, or personal influence which he may have at his command; In short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man's own character and capacity and the needs of the service. The administration of these islands should be as wholly fr^e from the suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy. All ihat we ask from, the public servant in the Philip pines or Porto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that coun try's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under it. This is all that we should ask, and we cai not afford to be content with less. The merit system is simply one method of secur ing honest and efficient administration of the gov ernment, and in the long: run the sole justification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both honest and efficient. The consular service is now urbanized under the provisions of a law passed in is.v>. which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions. The Interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your attention. Several bills providing for a new consular service* have in recent yean been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon the just principle that appointments to the service should be made only after a prac tical test of the applicant's titness. that promotions should be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability and zeal in the performance of duty, and that the tenure of office should bo unaffected by partisan considerations. The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pursuit ot their affairs, and thp maintenance of the dignity of the nation abroad, combine to make it essential that our consuls should be men of character, knowledge and enterprise. It is true that the service is now in the main efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently main tained until the principles sot forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress on this sub ject are enacted into law. THE 

INDIAN. In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe. The General Allotment act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the individual. Under Its provisions some slxtv thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States. "We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands; that i?. they should be divided into individual holdings. There will be a transition period during which the funds will In many cases hay* to be held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A atop should be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the. Indian work Ilk© any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should be made the same as those of the whites. In the eohools the education should be elementary and largely industrial. The need of higher educa tion among the Indians is very, very limited. On the reservations care should be taken to try to suit the teaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no us>e in attempting to induce agriculture In a country suited only for cattle rais ing where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The ration system, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, is highly detri mental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, per petuates pauperism and stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must continue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are. herded on reservations and have everything in common. The Indian should be treated as an individual— like the white' man. During the change o: treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every effort should be made to minimize, these hardships: hut we should not because of them heßitale to make the change. There should be a continuous reduction In the num ber of agencies. In deaJins with the aboriginal races few thir.es are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation, result ing from the liquor traffic. "We are doing all we can to pave our own Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about. EXPOSITIONS. I bespeak the most cnrdlal support from the Con gress and the people for the 6t. Louis Exposition to Commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our history. It definitely decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by far the foremost power in the Western Hemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in our history— the great turning points in out development. It is eminently fitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in commemorating it. and the. citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri, of all the adiacent region, are j entitled to every aid in making the celebration a , noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope i that foreign nations will appreciate the deep in terest our country takes in this exposition, and our view of its Importance from every standpoint, and that they will participate in securing its success, j The national government should be represented by j a full and complete set of exhibits. The people of Charleston, with great energy and ! civic spirit, are carrying on an exposition which i will continue throughout most of the present session j of the Congress. I heartily commend this exposition j ♦r> the goodwill of the people. It deserves all the i encouragement that can ho. given it. The managers | of the Charleston Exposition have requested, the Cabinet officers to place thereat the> government ex hibits which have been at Buffalo, promising to pay j the necessary expenses. I have taken the respensi- I ■bllity of directing that this be done, for I feel that it j is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose. The Pan-American Kxposition at Buffalo has | iust closed. Both from the Industrial and the artistic standpoint thie exposition has been in a high degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo, but to the United States. The terrible tragedy of the President's assassination interfered j materially with its being a financial success. The exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy, because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere, and give them an in creasing sense of unity. Such an effort was a genuine service to the entire American public. The advancement of the highest interest of na- | tional science and learning and the custody of obiects of art and of the valuable results of scien tific expeditions conducted by the United States have been committed to the Smithsonian Institu tion In furtherance of its declared purpose- for the ••increase and diffusion of knowledge among men" the Congress has from time to time given it other important functions. Such trusts have been cxc- I cured *V the institution with notab.e fidelity. There should "be no halt in the work of the institution, in accordance with the plans which its secretary has presented for the preservation oi the vanishing races of 'great North American animals in the National Zoological Park. The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended to the favora ble consideration of the Congress. 

PUBLIC LIBRARIES. perhaps the most characteristic educational move- I ment of the last fifty years is that which has | created the modern public library and developed it into broad and active service. There are now over ; five thousand public libraries in the United States. ] the product of this period. In addition to accumu- | lating material, they are also striving by organiza tlon by Improvement in method and by co-opera tion' to give greater efficiency to the material they hold to make It more widely useful, and by avold ar.c* of unnecessary duplication In process to re duce the cost of its administration. In these effort! they naturally look for assistance to the Federal library, which, though still the Library of Coiifc-reHS. and so entitled, is the one Ds> NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER *. ISWI. tional library of the United States. Already the largest single collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain to increase more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange and the operation of the Copyright law. this library has a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of this country— to American scholarship — service of the highest importance. It is housed in a building which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for library uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service necessary to its effective use. render its bibliographic work widely available, and enable it to become not mere ly a o-ntre of ri search, hut the chief factor in great co-operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of learning. CENSUS OFFICE. For the sake of gix.d administration, sound economy and the advancement of science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work, in the Interest not only of our business but of statistic, economic and social science. POSTAL SERVICE. The remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within twelve years. Its progressive development compels constantly increasing outlay, but in this period of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than Its expenses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 In 1537 to $3,1*23,727 ln 1901. Among recent postal ad vances the success of tural free delivery wherever established has been so marked and actual experi ence has m;ide its benefits, so plain that the de mand for its extension is general and urgent. It is just that the great agricultural population should share in the improvement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there aro 6.000 applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 5.600. The mail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5.700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service. The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well understood abuses which have grown up in connection with second class mail matter. The extent of this burden ap pears when it is stated that while the second class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only $4,204,445 of the aggregate postal revenue of $111, €31,193. If the pound rate of postage, which pro duces the large lO6S thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose of en couraging the dissemination of public information. were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the reropnized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matter which enjoys the privilege rate is wholly outside of the intent 'if the law, and has secured admission only through an evasion of its requirements or through lax con struction. The proportion of such wrongly in cluded maUer is estimated by the postal expert! 10 be one-half of the whole volume of second class mail. If it he only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Post office Department has now undertak.'-n to remove thft abuses so far as is possible by a stricter ap plication of tha law, and it should be sustained in its effort. CHINA Owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the Pacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest national concern to us. The general terms of the settlement of the ques tions growing out of the anti-foreign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated in a Joint note addressed to China by th>> representatives of the injured powers in December last, were prompt ly accepted by the Chinese Government. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of tho several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on September 7 last, setting forth the measures taken by China In compliance with the demands of the Joint not", and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States. William WoodviUe Rockhill. to whom high praise is due for the tact, good Judgment and energy he has displayed in performing an exceptionally diffi cult and delicate task. The agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to th* powers of the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to better future relations between China and the pow ers. Reparation has been made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and pun ishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in rank, recognized as responsible for or hav ing participated In the outbreak. Official exami nations have been forbidden for a period of five years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated, and edicts have been Issued making all officials directly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the sup pression of violence against them. Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign representatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can, if necessary, maintain perma nent military guards: by dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea. and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line. An edict has been Issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition Into China. China has agreed to pay adequate In demnities to the States, societies and Individuals for the losses sustained by them, and for the ex penses of the military expeditions sent by the vari ous powers to protect life and restore order. Under the provisions of the Joint note of Decem ber, 1900. China has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed. The Chinese Government lias agreed to partici pate financially in the, work of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tlen-Tsln. the centres of foreign trade in Central and Northern China, and an international conservancy board, in which the Chinese Government is largely rep resented, has been provided for the Improvement | of the Shanghai Kiver and the control of its navi- I gation. In the same line of commercial advantages ; a revision of the present tariff on imports has j been assented to for the purpose of substituting j specific for ad valorem duties, and an expert has ! been sent abroad on the part of the United States j to assist in this work. A list of articles to re- ; main free of duty, including flour, cereals and rice, j gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been , agreed upon In the settlement. During these troubles our government has un- : swervingly advocated moderation, and has ma- i terially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the. empire and the modern world, while in the ; critical period of revolt and massacre we did our j full share In safeguarding life and property, re- j storing order and vindicating the national Interest ; and honor. It behooves us to continue in these j paths, doing what lies In our power to foster feel- j ings of goodwill, and leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair inter course between China and the nations, on a foot- | ing of equal rights and advantages to all. We ad- j vocate the "open door" with all that it implies, ! not merely the procurement of enlarged commer- j cial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the j interior by the waterways with which China has , been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly j community of trade with all the peoples of the , earth can the work now auspiciously begun be car ried to fruition. In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment, under the , conventions, throughout the empire for our trade . and our citizens with those of all other powers. 

MEXICO. We view with lively Interest and keen hopes or , beneficial results the proceedings of the Pan- : American Congress, convoked at the invitation of Mexico, and now sitting at th. Mexican capital. The delegates of the United States are under the most liberal instructions to co-operate with their colleagues in. all matters promising advantage to the gTeat family of American Commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the world at large. My predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil nw\ La Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts of our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants, and that in accordance with th<- acts of the Congress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of Stale on these awards has been returned to Mexico, a considerable portion of the money re ft Ived from Mexico on these awards had been paid by this t<> the claimants before the decision of the courts w.is rendered. My Judg ment is that the Congress should return to Mexico an amount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants. PEACE AND HOOD WILL. The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and heartfelt sorrow, to w-hich the government gave full expression. When President McKinley died our nation in turn re ceived from every quarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world we received, at the time of the President's death, assurances of such grief and re gard as to touch the hearts of our people. In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind: anj we firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these inter national relations of mutual respect and goodwill.
