GOOD ROADS IN Sl'uTS. I.VAMA The failure of tin* proposition t.? have the county vot?- "ti a bond issue for **a*ood read.-" by one ' tiv?; vote in the Board ofSiij. ?rvisors fchould cause no tUacoaragemeDt to the advocate? of road improvement, because the postponeni?-tit is only a temporary one. The law requires that a majority of tin* entire board shall vote in the affiraative before the judg** of the Circuit Court can order an election. Then- were two affirmative vot-s, one negative and one absent and not votitijr. The ab? sent memls-r was ill. but would have voted aye had he been promt. It is somewhat of a pity that the rote wasn't postponed until every mem? ber could have been in attendance, but favorable action i- aaaorod later on, an?! when the rot- |g taken we firmly lielieve that progrese will ecore a victory in spite ol Hon. Warren Keift-r will no doubt add a touch of humor to the proeent session by introducing that p.-r.-nuial bill of big to decrease Southern repre? sentation in Coiij. ?b-n.

Japan may take this as a belligerent note in the mea eage. CONGRESSIONAL The Senate adjourned until M : The Bou-w* -lastw-d a bill anthorii ng national banks to make loans on real estate.
