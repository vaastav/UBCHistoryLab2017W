[From tbs IfontconMiy Appeal, Mev. 9.) There is no political maxim fuller of truth and warning than that "power is al waya etetling from thdbnsny to the few." More particularly la this the case it) times like (he present, when the oountry is in volved in war and the people, wrapped up in the idea of achieving their liberty aua independence, are apt to sleep upon their rights, until thev are effectually under* mined or usurped by the governing few. It tbfe telegraph has done juatice to Pres ident Davis and Secretary Seddoo, it is plain that the sutyect of wholeeale conscrip tion is t»4ie revived at the prssent session of Congress* by which not only tbe servi ces ana persons of the people of all classes but the conduct Of their trades, profits* •Ions, pursuits and occupations are to be placed ander tbe sole and exclusive con trol of tbe military power. It la assumed that the system of exemption by Congress is unwise that every man in the Confeder acy capable of military duty should be en rolled. and that tbe civil pursuits of life ahould be carried on by detailed men from the army. Our pulpit* must be filled by detailed preachers, our schools by detailed teachers, our plantations by detailed farm* ers% our workshops by detailed mechanics, and our, newspapers must be carried on by, detailed editors and printers. It will-be perceived at a glance tbst apolie&flrj&eaat the root o/ civil liber ty, and phides Ull power in tbe hands of the military. If any minister of the Gospel .should be so iodiacreet as to emlxfcly in any of bis sermons doctrines distasteful to the powers that be, or if any editor should become too outspoken in theexercise of bis constitutional rights in vindication of the freedom of tbe press, a revocation of their details would very soon silence tbem or if the editor himself should not be subject to military duty, it would benn easy matter u stop his paper by revoking tbe details of his employees.

A Already the alarm has been sounded that nowise men are on the battlements of our Confederate halls of legislation. They threaten to destroy not only the rights and libertfes of the citizens, but privileges of the soldier. We have been tbe sport of military domination so long that legisla tors anticipate success and the plaudits of the army ro their attacks upqn civil liber ty. They.preaume that, by injuring the public wind to constant encroachments, email hi themselves, but immense and in calculably d^oge^pu# in the aggregate, the people will become familiarized to the despotism they hope to establish in tbe tempi© we are erecting-. Already the in discretion of souie of the more sanghine has intimated the course they have deter mined upon. Some, by insinuation, and others in unmistakable sentences, have aaid that a dictator it needed for the*coun try and that the centralisation of power under such head is a foregone oondu aion. in­ terests of the Confederacy are n^t in the hands of feafe men and wi& senators, when such treason to the oivil liberties of tbe republic to perpetrated therefore it is a matter of serious'-Interest to the people that this question of despotic government es pecially shall not be agitated in secret ses sions, where men dare to perpetrate deeds tbe preliminary discussion of which they ft* -before the people. We beseech our authorities at Richmond not tq be too grasping in their demands for power and dominion, and we warn oui* Congressmen not to be too hasty in thus surrendering the rights and liberties of their '-eonstltuents into the bands of the military power. If there be any who real* ly favor such a policy, they certain lv have not weighed well the consequences of it for if eudi a policy shall prove successful, it will not require tbe pen of a prophet to predict that in the event of McClellana election, tbe Chicago platform will very soon muster a very strong, if not predomi nant party in these Confederate States.— Much disaffection has already been pro duced.by the extra-constitutional legisla tion of Uongress and the harsh manner in which its laws have been executed bv mil itary officials, and we can assure tbe Presi dent and his Secretary that ibev are but playing into tbe bands of Mr. Boyce and Die followers by their continued grasping after despotic power. The germs of dissen sion are already too painfully visible, and we but deprecate the adoption of any aj| "Efcf'ilfiU! "W i -i-awuaw. rial ooridnct, yet conducted in cqasiant se cret sessions, "is a monstrous anomaly aud perversion. Protected from public scru tiny, suWected to the allurements of polit ical preferment on tbe one band, and threat ened with unerring proscription on the Other—without popular support—indepen dent exertions for the country, and often weighed down bv tbe press are of Execu tive odium—Representative* stand in a po sition of great weakness and great tempta tion.

Opinions cannot be formed in ig norance. Without precise facts for data, conclusions cannot be arrived at. Public opinion is kept in an uncertain, sbiftitig, negative and impotent condition, touobing the causes of our troubles, their necessity, aud tbe best remedies to be applie j. The people are shorn of their legitimate power of discriminating and in makiug their judgment felt. The press is shorn of its proper power, because upon facts supposed to be partial tbe people caunot make up their minds without reservation about measures or about men. Hence we drift along in faith and in charity, vtnder the auspioes of men who have assumed to be wise beyond any authority given them by tbe intent of tbe Constitution. It is high time for the people and press of the Confed erate States to lilt a voice of earnest con demnation of this new system of smother ing public opinion. We invoke the aid ot our cotemporaries against a further contin uance of daily secret sessions, which even tbe Yankees do not practice, and which spread weakness iu our counsels. KO EXCCSE FOR SECRET SKSSlOJTS. [From Die Macon Telegraph. Jr Last year much dissatisfaction was ex pressed by tbe people and tbe press at the "secret sessions" of Congress. We trust there will be no cause I or these complaints at the present session. There is no excuse /or them, except pending discussions on 'military affairs, when facts brought out in delate might prove beneficial to the ene my. The peoplo have a right to know the position aud bearing of their representa tives upon questions atfwting the interests and, it may be, the liberties oftbe country. We fear that tome of tbe servants of the people have got tbe idea into their noddles tbtft they are the masters, and would fain play the part of grand seigniors. Let there bean end to this insolent presumption else we warn these gentry that the bubble of their greatness will collapso suddenly and disgracefully. Soiae shallow brains in the land have lately grown so blataut as to hint that the curtailing of the liberty ot the press would be a benefit to tbe cause of. independence. Tbey affect to despise the means by which tbey were brought into notice and elevated to power, and would fain crush out the 'fourth estate,* that their littleness and corruption might not be op posed. It such an attempt is made, as it is vroiopered there will be, tbese "illustrious Obscure" will attempt to bide their assaults upon the iiberty of the press and the peo ple under the cover of secret sessions. Let the press look to it. If the fourth estate will but assert its rights and vindicate its prerogatives, which are but tbe rights and prerogatives of the people, it will soon crush the vipers it baa warmed to life.— Let tbe discussion of public matters in Congress be had with open doors. Ziu stabs in tbs dark no secret sessions. The Carolinian has weakened somewhat the effect of its protest by its attempt to screen the President from the r« sponslbili ty of this unconstitutional recommenda tion. It was never before suspected nor intimated that the President was not tbe author of hie own messages or that any thing found ite way into them which was not either originated or sanctioned by him. He, and he alone, is responsible for ev ery recommendation offered to Congress in pursuance of bis constitutional duty. He will not attempt to evadethat responsibili ty, nor thank any one for attempting to evade it for him. He would scorn tbe sug gestion that he is or could be a tool in the Lands of others. We heartily second the proposition ol tbe ConstUutlondiUi for a convention of the press, to defend its freedom and rights againet this threatened assault of Execu tive tyranny. We very much fear that un less active measures be taken to prevent it a subservient Congress, which has hereto fore manifested a disposition to register every edict of Executive will, may in se cret session strike this deadly blow at the freedom of the press, so insidiously recom mended iu tbe President's message.

[From the Augasta Chronicle and Sentinel Nov. 19,7 We are glad to see that the press of the South is very generally speaking out against the unconstitutional propositions of the President to abridge its freedom by subjecting it to his own arbitrary control. Evmi the press of the Administration are loud in their denunciation of the Execu tive. They are forced to admit that it eviuoes an alarming disposition on the part of the President to usurp despotic power in tttter disregard of tbe guaranties of«tbe constitution. They are startled and alarm ed by tbe exhibition of executive intoler- ai"» a.nd desire to crush those journals which have had the independence to criti cise his acts and policy.
