"We in London," says London Opin ion, "have two music halls crowded nightly by the exhibition of shapely women clad In nothing but white paint and classical atmosphere."

Herkimer, X. Y. The Jury In the trial of Chester E. Gillette for the murder of his sweetheart, Grace Drown, at Big Moose lake on July 11, returned a verdict of guilty lu the first degree. Former Senator Mills, Gillette's counsel, before adjournment, an nounced that when court re-convened he would move to have the verdict set aside. The Jury, which had deliberated for five hours, sent word that a verdict had been reached. A moment later they hied Into the court room and au officer, who had been sent for Gillette, returned with the prisoner. Gillette Showed No Emotion. Pale and a trifle nervous, Gillette faced the Jury and when Marsnal Hatch, the foreman, declared that a verdict .of guilty in the first degree had been found, the youthful prisoner gave no sign of emotion. A few mo ment later, when his counsel bad an nounced his purpose of making a Tor mat motion that the verdict bo set aside, and the Judge was dismissing the Jurors, Gillette bout over a nearby table, ami picking up a pencil, wrote something c?i a sheet of paper. Ilu then folded the paper carefully nud placed it iu his pock a. Immediately ufterwards he was jaken from the court room back O his cell in the Jail. It was learned that the Jury had tsome difficulty In reaching an agree ment, and that six ballots were taken before the twelve men agreed. L'p ,r that time the Jury had stood 11 for conviction anil 1 for acquittal. The following is what Glllclts wrote: "Father I am convicted Ches ter." It was a message to his father who Is in Denver. "If the reporters want to see me,'1 he said to Sheriff Richards, "tell them I have nothing to say, only that 1 did not expect that verdict." SEC, TAFT TELLS WHY TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

Fort Mcllcnry is no lonser neces sary for the defense of Baltimore, and Is to be abandoned, but it will always be remembered because over It waves the "Star Spancled Manner" of Key's vision and sons.

Folk who live alone the rural free delivery routes and have seen the car rier trudge over heavy roads through had weather will approve the recent gift of an automobile to a New Jer sey carrier. It will help the postman and at the same time speed the de livery of mall. Nevertheless, one can not help asking whether a carrier's modest salary will pay the running expenses of a gasoline gig. Liquor Traffic and Church and State In Oklahoma. Guthrie. Okla. President Murray ol the constitutional convention, has ap pointed two more important commit tees, namely, those on the regulation of the liquor traffic and on countv boundaries. That on liquor regulation Is headed by Luke Roberts, of Olus tee, as chairman. The general be lief is that two-thirds of the members of the latter committee, which will pass on the prohibition provision of the new constitution, favor state-wide prohibition. A resolution was presented by an Oklahoma delegate calling on the con vention to draft a law maintaining the individuality of church and state. The resolution was a practical embodiment of a memorial from Seventh Day Ad ventists. The memorial is signed by 3.000 and asks that no reference be made in the constitution to any day to be set aside for public worship. 

DETAILS IN ANNUAL REPORT THE BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR. NEGRO TROOPS WERE FIRED Says It Wat Only Mean of Ridding Service of Would-le and Actual Murderer. Washington In his annual report Secretary Taft devotes considerable space to a defense and explanation of the course of the war department In connection with the discharge without honor from the military service of the battalion of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, which was stationed at Brownsville, Tex., last summer. The secretary de tails the events of the night of Aug. 12, Involving the "shooting up of the town" of Brownsville by anywhere from nine to twenty members of this battal ion. He Is very ssverc in his con demnation of the non-commissioned of ficers of the battalion for falling to discover and report the perpetrators of tho outrage, aud of the enlisted men of the battalion who, by maintain ing silence when, as he says, they must have known the guilty parties connived at the crime. For Good of the Service. "It may be that In the battalion are a number of men wholly Innocent, who know neither who the guilty men are nor any circumstances which will nld in their detection, though this cannot bo true of many," says the secretary. "Because there may be Innocent men In tho battalion, must the government continue to use it to guard communi ties of men, women and children when It contains so aangerous an element Impossible of detection? Certainly not. When a man enlists in the army ho knows that, for tho very purpose of protecting itself, the government re serves to luelt tho absolute right of discharge, not as a punishment, but for the public safety or Interest. It goes without saying that If the guilty could be ascertained they should and would be punished, but the guilty can not be ascertained, and the very Im possibility of determining who are the guilty makes the whole battalion use less to the government as an Instru ment for maintaining law and order. The only means of ridding the military service of a band of would-be murder ers of women and children, and actual murderers of one man, is the discharge of the entire battalion."

One of the Philadelphia papers has given considerable space to correspon dence upon th.o problem of domestic economy and the cost of living. Writers whose resources vary widely have giv en their experience and offered their advice. One woman whose husband gives her $3,000 a year for her family of four is unable to get along comfort ably on that sum. She wants a sample bill of fare for a week, and also infor mation as to where she can "get a hat for less than $13." Another woman with a family of three has less than $500 a year, yet says they "have the best of everything and plenty of It." A young college graduate has been learning something about "practical" politics. He attempted to wrest the control of a New York assembly dis trict from Tammany.

Her mind, like her Vfe, was so singularly crystalline that she could not understand mere vice.

The bankers In tne house urged the passage of the bill, while the op ponents of the measure insisted that real estate was not a proper security for national banks. They contended that the system had proved a failure wherever tried. Mr. Hepburn, of Iowa, and Mr. Wil liams, of Mississippi, the minority leader, were enthusiastically iu favor of the moas-ure, urging that the bill would aid the farmers very greatly and have a tendency to reduce stock speculation.

THE SHIP SUBSIDY BILL Proposal That This Measure Be Sa Amende as to Limit Subsidies to South American and Oriental Trade. Washington During the debate la the senate on the Penrose and Fora ker resolutions in reference to the discharge of negro troops, the report was current among senators that the president felt it would be a matter ot courtesy If the resolution should ba addressed to himself, and so strong, it was Bald, was this feeling on his part, that he had intimated that un less this course was taken, thero would be no response. Both Resolutions Adopted. Washington Tho senate adopted the Penrose resolution, asking the president for information regarding the discharge of the negro troops ot the Twenty-fifth infantry; also the Foraker resolution, directing the sec retary of war to transmit information on the same subject. Both resolu tions carried au identical amendment by Mr. Culberson, asking specifically for the order to Ma J. Penrose com manding the troops, which directed him not to turn over to the Texas authorities certain ot the troops de manded. This action followed two hours' de bate on the propriety of asking the president for the Information, or of directing the secretary of war to fur nish it. Mr. Spooner urged that in matters where congress had an absolute right tn information In the possession of the executive, It had always been cus tomary to direct a cabinet officer to furnish it. In matters where it had not this right, and in which thero was some doubt about the advisability ot publicity, congress usually made a request on the president If It de sired the Information with the under standing that it should be furnishes! "if not Incompatible with the public interest." This view was supported also by Mr. Foraker, while Mr. Lodge quoted precedents to the contrary. The Ship Subsidy Bill. Washington Compromise on the ship subsidy bill seems to be in sight. At the meeting of the house commit tee on merchant marine and fisheries, Chairman Grosvenor suggested an amendment to the Gallinger bill, which will limit subsidies to the SouL'i American and oriental trade. Thn amended bill will bo In harmony with Secretary Root's policy for trade ex tensions as outlined In recent speeches In the west.

PRESIDENT SAYS HE FAVORS IN CREASED APPROPRIATIONS. Ptels That tha Government Should Concern Itself with the Better ment of tho Rivers. Washington President Roosevelt told the delegates to the national riv ers and harbors convention, who called on him at the White House, that ho would consult with the leaders In con gress, and expressed the hope that something definite and effective could be done In the wuy ot Increased ap propriations for the Improvement ot the nation's waterways. Tho presi dent, after expressing his pleasure at meeting of tho members of the delega tion, said: The President's Views. "I have come to feel a growing sense of the Importance to establish ing a far-reaching coherent plan for tho general Improvement of the water ways of the country. 1 was first led to consideration of that plan by con sidering another plan for the use of water, not in connection with prepar ing the land at the head of the river to produce the harvests that later In part should be carried on the rivers lower down that is, In connection with the Irrigation policy, In which 1 so strongly believe as vital to the welfare of the Rocky mountain and adjacent states. Just as I feel that the national government should con cern itself with utilization of the wa ter ot rivers In their sources where the country Is dry, so I feel the na tional government should concern Itself with the proper control nnd utili zation of the water lower down In the river, where' they are fitted to be the great arteries of communication. I have had It brought strikingly to my attention, but recently, how much we suffer at present because of tho Inade quate transportation facilities of the railways for moving the great grain crops nnd cattle crop of this country. Wo need and must have further facili ties for transportation, and as has been well pointed out. one of the effctlve methods of effecting railway rates Is to provide for a proper sys tem of water transportation. It would not be possible for me to enter Into any discussion of the details of your plan until I have spoken with some of the leaders of the two houses of congress. I shall consult with them at once, and trust that somewhat defi nite and effective can be done along the lines that you mention. You un derstand, gentlemen, I could not off hand commit myself to the details of any policy without taking into con sideration what the feeling of the co ordinate branch would be, and I must be guided largely by their views. I am sure that you will find there the genuine, patriotic purpose to do what is best for the Interest of our common country." Former Governor David R. Francis, of Missouri, presented to tho presi dent a large gold medal of the Louisi ana Purchase Exposition Co., similar to those given the heads of the dif. forent government of Kuropo which participated In the exposition. Oppose Citizenship for Porto Rlcans. Washington The democrats in the bouse opposed the consideration of the bill conferring United States citizen ship on the Inhabitants of Porto Rico. Chairman Cooper, of Wisconsin, tin der the call of committees, palled the attention of the house to the erroneous position of tho bill on the union cal endar, Insisting that its proper place was on the house calendar. Mr. Clark, of Missouri leading the minor ity, objected to its transfer, but Speaker Cannon decided with Mr. Cooper that It properly belongs on tho house calendar.
