fcH SITTER AT ROOSEVELT CALIFORNIANS RESENT HIS DE- NUNCIATION OF THEIR ANTI- JAPANESE ATTITUDE. DECLARE THEY WILL NOT WEAKEN IF FORCED TO YIELD WHITES WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS. San Francisco, Dec. 6President 'Roosevelt's denunciation of Califor nia's anti-Japanese attitude has aroused bitter resentment here. The president is excoriated for his threat to use troops and he openly is charged with deliberately misstating the position taken by the authorities of this city and the state. Should force be used the Califor nians declare they will not weaken and while they may have to bow for the time being to federal dictation they will withdraw all the white chil dren from the public schools and leave them in sole possession of the Japa nese Open threats are made that Califor nia will be turned to the Democratic column in the next election, the cam paign slogan to be, "The Democratic party la a white man's party." There also has arisen another fea turebitter, open resentment against Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the University of California. In Pres ident Roosevelt's message Californians declare they recognize the words and sentiments of the head of the state university and against him, rather than against either Roosevelt or the federal government, is directed the greater part of the wrath of San Fran 

CISCO. Angry men declared Wheeler had taken upon himself to dictate the pol icy of California and from his stand point to tell the rest of the nation how California stands. Threats are open ly made to cut the appropriation of the university one-half in the next legis lature to teach its head h cannot run California. TEST SUIT ORDERED BEGUN. Federal Officials Will Have Courts Pass on California Statute. San Francisco, Dec. 6.Under direct orders from Washington the represen tatives of the department of justice California have been instructed to be gin an action in the courts to test the legality of the state statute which provides that children of Mongolian descent shall attend a separate school. President Allman of the board of education has received a communica tion from United States Attorney Dev lin requesting a conference that ar rangements might be made to insti tute a suit. When the attention of President All man was called to that portion of the president's message referring to sep arate schools he said that the utter ance of the president on the Japanese question would have no effect on the action of the board. "We have simply put into effect a law passed Dy the lawmaking body of this state," he said "Individually and collectively each and every mem ber of the board believes that it is a good law. We will not recede from the position which we have taken and believe that our action will be sus tained by public sentiment throughout the state even if the courts should de clare it to be unconstitutional or a violation of treaty rights 

BRITONS HAVE RACE TROUBLES. Especially Interested in That Portion of Roosevelt's Message. London, Dec. 6.President Roose velt's declaration in his message to congress on the treatment accorded to Japanese in the San Francisco schools specially appeals to the British at the piesent time because both in South Africa and Australia a similar anti Asiatic feeling has created embarrass ment for the imperial authorities. Dur ing the present week the home gov ernment vetoed a Transvaal ordinance further restricting the privileges of British Indians, even those long resi dent in the country, while quite re cently the government refused to ac cept an Australian proffer of a prefer ential tariff "provided the goods were shipped in vessels not employing yel low seamen." The newspapers here point out that the Western states of America have no monopoly in this anti-Asiaticism, saying that the president's remarks "convey a lesson which might well be laid to heart in other quarters than that to which it is directly addressed." 

OBJECTED TO NEGRO'S "AIRS." Two Texas Cowboys Attempt Lynch ing on Train. Topeka, Kan., Dec. 6.Two Texas cowboys tried to hang John E.

Kan., Dec. 6.Speculators and ranchmen have committed fraud ulent practices in entering school lands In Western Kansas, according to records filed here with the land com missioner. The alleged fraud has, It is said, been in the exorbitant ap praisement of lessees' improvements. It appears that speculators and ranch ers have leased lands, built small shanties or dugouts on them and then fenced the property. When it came time to sell the land appraisers rec ommended by the lessee would then bid and get the land. No outside bid der would try to make an offer since he would have to pay for the im provements which were not on the land. It has been found that the fences around a 10,000-acre tract of ranch land was charged as improve ments on one forty-acre tract of school land which had been leased. Fate of Her Crew Unknown. Vineyard Haven, Mass., Dec. 6. The barkentine which for over twenty four hours new signals of distress off the Nantucket shoals finally struck on Great Round shoals and has broken in two.

SEEKS INCREASE OF POWER PRESIDENT WOULD DISMISS ANY OFFICER WHOM HE THINKS IS UNWORTHY. Washington, Dec. 6.The president has sent a special message to congress urging legislation giving the executive authority upon his own initiative and responsibility to dismiss any officer whom he thinks unworthy to remain in the service. The law at present provides that in time of peace no offi cer shall be dismissed except in pur suance of a courtmartial or in mitiga tion thereof. This provision the pres ident wants repealed. Illustrating the necessity for the legislation desired the president cites the case of a naval officer whose name is not given, but who was accused of "indecent and disgusting behavior." He was convicted, but the court, to his surprise, the president says, did not sentence him to dismissal.

Rumors Circulated Regarding Numer ous Deaths in Her Family. Chicago, Dec. 6.Mrs. Rose Vzral of 1536 West Fifteenth street has committed suicide because, it is be lieved, of rumors circulated regarding the numerous deaths in her immediate family within the last ten months.

URGES 6ENERAL REPUBLICAN CAUCUS WOULD GIVE NOTICE TO COUN- TRY THAT EARLY ACTION IS DESIRABLE. Washington, Dec. 6.Congressman Butler Ames of Massachusetts has be gun a propaganda for an immediate movement in the interest of tariff re vision. He says he is not undertak ing to secure action at the present session of congress, but is urging upon Republican members the advisability of a general caucus to "give concrete expression of their determination to immediately revise the inequalities present in our tariff laws so that all possible notice to the country at large may be given as to the time of re vision." He thinks that the subject should be taken up immediately after March 4 and would have the caucus determine the best method of proce dure and whether the whole tariff laws should be revised or only particular schedules amended 

WITH DISCLAIMER ATTACHED. Senate Committee Will Favorably Re port Algeciras Treaty. Washington, Dec. 6.Whether Dem ocratic senators shall support the Al geciras treaty in relation to Moroccan affairs, when it is voted upon in the senate on Dec. 12, will depend upon the fate of a resolution to be present ed disclaiming the responsibility of the United States for the convention and declaring that the participation of this government is only in furtherance of its general policy of promoting peace and in the interest of its commercial relations with Morocco. The senate committee on foreign re lations considered the treaty and or dered that it be favorably reported to the senate. This action was taken, however, after a committee consisting of Senators Spooner, Lodge and Bacon had been named to prepare a resolu tion which would declare that the United States had no intention of in terfering in the regulation of Euio pean internal affairs. The contest in the senate over the treaty will be close in the event that a disclaimer of the character outlined is not adopted. The United States is exempted from the responsibility of enforcing the treaty through a reser vation made by Ambassador White, the American delegate, in signing the act.

London, Dec. 6.Karl Hau, the Washington professor who has been under arrest here since Nov. 7 charged with the murder of Frau Mo littor, his mother-in-law, at Baden Baden, again appeared on remand in the Bow street police court. The prisoner, who has fully recovered his health, was remanded for another week in order to enable the German representatives to obtain further evi dence.

STORY ABSURD AND IMPOSSIBLE AMERICANS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST FRIENDS OF THE ISLAND EMPIRE. Washington, Dec. 5.Viscount Sluzo Aoki, ambassador of Japan, was asked for an expression of his views con cerning the sensational dispatches and articles that are now being printed about the probability of war between Japan and the United States. His excellency, the ambassador, laughed heartily at the idea of war and said that it was absolute non sense. "We have perfect confidence in the president and in Secretary Root in their friendly disposition, in their sense of justice and in their wisdom," he declared. "We have perfect confi dence in the goodness, the sense of justice and in the wisdom of the peo ple of the United States. We know" confidently that they are our friends and that they know that we are their friends. Japan has no enemies in the United States outside of San Fran .cisco. It gives me pleasure to tell you {also that the United States has no enemies In Japan. We regard your people as our best friends. You have always been our best friends and we are confident that you will continue to be so. That the Japanese can make war upon their best friends is absurd and impossible. "The other night at a dinner party a lady said to me, 'You must be very angry with us.' 'Why so?' I asked. 'Because of the way the people are acting in San Francisco,' she replied. 'Not at all/ I said. 'That is only a local incident, a matter which your government will take care of and therefore it does not give us any con cern. We understand it and our peo ple will not be misled by the sensa tional articles that are being pub lished in your newspapers and in Eu- rope.' 

IGNORE PRESIDENT'S ORDER. California Determined to Keep Japs in Their Own Schools. San Francisco, Dec. 5.California Is rebellious*, if not in a state of rebel lion. Standing on its new problem, or rather on the new phase of an old problem, the Golden State has raised the banner of state rights and has de clared more strongly on the color Question than ever the South declared since the recent unpleasantness. "The school board of San Francisco never will change its attitude on the school question," declared the super intendent of schools as he came from the board meeting which had been discussing the question. "President Roosevelt's requests or orders will be ignored by us. The Japanese must stay in their own school. We are acting under a state law passed in 1872, before there ever wa3 any idea of this situation. If Pres ident Roosevelt or the federal con gress has any requests to make they must make them of the California leg islature. The legislature can change the laws in a moment, but we cannot. If the legislature of California refuses to change the law we want and hope for final decision of the case in the supreme court of the United States." "If California is to remain one of the United States," declared the commis sioner of labor for California, "then it must stop this invasion and settle the question. If we do not settle the Japa nese question soon our children will settle it, or try to settle it, from the other side of the Sierras. The Japa nese are swarming into California at the rate of over 1,000 a monthmore arrogant, more chesty than any other people. They do not demand equality. They demand an acknowledgment of their superiority."
