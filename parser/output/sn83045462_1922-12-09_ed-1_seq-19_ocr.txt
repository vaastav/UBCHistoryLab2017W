The latter sold at 1043i to 1047s. with none offered under 105 at the close. Bond issues figured in the day's . iecord more or less conspicuously with sales at 07 for Capital Traction 73% for Railway 4s, 95*4 for Washington Gas 5s. and 100 for Potomac Electric General The only stock sale other than in Capital Traction shares was a sale of American Security and Trust Com pany siock at Adds to Directory.

VuPMiiVfc anil AT A?*lia T5 i."?c \'a fional Bank held its formal "opening" in its new building on the northeast corner of Wisconsin avenue and M street yesterday, all day. After spending more than a century at the old location, one block east of its new home, it was but natural hat moving day should be made much of. Moreover, it was a source of great satisfaction to the men who planned arffi made the wonderful r.ev hank buildng a possibility, to exhibit to a surprised and satisfied clienteel: to the good people of Georgetown, who were duly impressed, and to the bankers of Washington, who called in large lumbers, for not in all Washington is there a bank building Itke it. Spaciousness is at once evidenced on entering the fo>er. one of the largest in the city. Tellers* cages, numerous and large, offices for the cashier and assistants, in direct contact with the foyer, also the office of the president and the ladies* waiting and rest rooms, with large accommodations for the working force, while the consultation and private office of Mr. Haines, the president, all beautifully finished, give no suggestion of being pressed for room. The great vault, with its lobby, thirty-two feet long and eight feet wide, entirely separate from the banking department, but still on the main floor, with coupon rooms readily available, ample safety deposit boxes for years to come, and wonderfully protected by latest devices against anipertng from within or without, attracted much attention. Moreover, the devices are such 'hat it even checks up the officer whose duty it is to close and lock he vault doors, and will recall him quickly should lie by chance neglect, it. A great alarm bell on the outside Of the building will maintain a persistent clanging in the event of tampering with the vault or in response to the touch of the foot of any offipinl nr A commodious gallery surrounds fhe entire banking room. There are numerous consultation rooms and a magnificent room for the directors over the vault, thirty-two feet long, with a wonderful big mahogany tablo. Then. too. there is space that may be needed as the years pass on and rhe old bank in its new home passes >n down the years of f%s second century. And all day and far into the night he officers and directors were at home, receiving congratulations from ? ustomers. friends and well wishers mid a bower of 'mums and other gorgeous flowers, in every direction, while the crowd resembled nothing more than an all-day jam, happy, good-natured?Georgetown at its best. There has not been such a gathering of bankers, their families and friends, such as greeted Harry V. Haynes and his associates since the convention last June at Hot Springs. 

HUSBAND DEATH PLOT . SUSPECT STILL IN JAIL Mrs. Ford's Defense Expected to Be Temporary Insanity or Lapse of Memory. Br the Associated Press. DETROIT, December 9.?Friends of Mrs. May h. f ora, cnargea witn plotting: to slay her estranged husband. N>y J. Ford., a wealthy farmer, renewed their efforts today to obtain freedom for the prisoner. Mrs. Ford spent last night in jail, unable to raise the $25,000 bond required by the recorder's court, before which she pleaded not guilty yesterday. No date had been set early today for the examination demanded by Mrs. Ford's attorneys. The defense of Mrs. Ford, should she be brought to trial, is expected to be based on her statement to the prosecutor that she was subject to intermittent loss of memory, or temporary insanity. She did not remember, she declared, that she ever sought 'o engage a gunman to slay her wealthy husband that she might gain possession of the estate, as charged, ff she did reveal such a plot to a detective who posed as a gunman, she said, it was during one of these mental lapses.

New buying also made its appearance in several industrials. Although prices in the last hour slid off somewhat from their best, most i stocks closed higher on the day. Stats Motor Advances.

Ju a letter to Senator Wads worth, support of the Federal Bar Association of the Stcrling-Lehlbaclf reclas; sification bill is pointed out by William R. Vallance of the State Department, president of the association. Mr. Vallance declared that the matter of taking: appropriate steps to emphasize the importance of this legislation and the desirability of passing it at the present session of Congress has been considered by the executive committee of the association. He then instanced provisions of the 1920 republican party platform and resolution adopted by the Federal Bar Association, June 5, 1922, The latter stated that "the immediate reclassification of the civil service is imperative." and that to accomplish this "approval should at once be given the Sterllng-L>ehlbach bill in its present form without amendment at this time." Mr. Vallance, in his letter, declared that the replies received to this resolution "were favorable with the ex ceptlon of a communication rcceivea from Senator Smoot. in which the senator indicated that he desired to have the legislation materially changed, and under the bill which appears to have his approval the supervision of reclassification would be placed under the Jurisdiction of the bureau of efficiency Instead of under the Jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission." "As the extensive work that has already been done at this session of Congress will not serve any useful purpose in case the legislation is not enacted at this 8688100," the letter continued, "I venture to express the hope that you will not only give the legislation your support,-but will urge other senators to carry out the pledge contained in the party platform." The first zinc made in the United States was from the red oxide of New Jersey, at the arsenal in Washington. D. C, in 1838. 

HARDING MESSAGE PIEASESTRADERS Week in Stock Market Shows Very Irregular Trend in Prices. ?? By tli* Associated Press. NEW YORK, December 9.?The struggle for control between opposing speculative forces imparted a decidedly irregular trend to prices in this j week's stock market.

SECRETARY MEL IS INSPIRJ Views on Credit an Over Country Ca: Weekly Finan BY STL'ART P. WEST. Special Dispatch to The Star. NEW YORK, December 9.?Wall street is still divided in opinion as to whether the rise i* the stock market during: the past week is merely a recovery from the severe break in October and November, or whether it is a fresh advance. One tiling is certain, and that is that the rebound is logical and justified by reason of the' fact that the preceding decline was unwarranted by general business and financial conditions. Railroad Stocks Las Behind. Railway securities have not felt anything like the impulse toward improvement that other sections of the market have experienced. The reason lies readily at hand. The investing public is constantly being reminded that there is a serious state of affairs in ^ie railway world. There is no question of bankruptcy or even a reduction in dividends. But the roads, as shown in the October figures. have been called upon to spend a lot more money than usual of maintenance of Dlant and eauinment. The suggestion that these expenditures vill eorvtinue fox* an indefinite length of time is strengthened by the statement frequently made before and repeated this week by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual message that the transportation facilities of the country have not kept up to the needs of business and that this is the main reason why prices are low on the farms and high at the distributing centers. Remedial Legislation Remote. President Harding in his message, recommended encouragement of railway combinations and the pooling of freight cars as partial solutions of the problem. Unfortunately there is little or no chance of any remedial legislation at the present session of Congress, and at the next session the balance of power, if not the actual control, will rest in the hands of the radical bloc, which is committed to a program of rate reduction, regardless of what this would entail for the financial position of the railroads. In the end any downward revision of freight rates which threatened to bring earnings below a fair return on capital invested probably would not stand in the courts. But the average investor, seeing all this agitation ahead and recognizing that operating expenses for months to come will be under the influence of abnormally high maintenance charges, is not inclined to increase, even though he is not reducing, his holdings of rail securities. Wellon's Report Bull Factor. Secretary Mellon's reference to business conditions was an inspiring contribution to the markets of the week. While there was nothing in his summary of the changes of the last twelve months .which was not already familiar 10 business men. corning from the Treasury head, it carried much weight. The Secretary did not hesitate to say that while credit and trade conoitlons had proved so deciidedly at home, progress had aiso been made along the line of reconstruction in Europe. This is not in accord with the prediction^ of some so-called economists who have been telling the world for the past two years that Europe is oji the verge of ruin. But it is the common sense view of a sound thinking business man in the best possible position to know the facts. British and Italian Finances. The two most striking incidents of the week bearing upon foreign affaire were the continued advance in sterling exchange, and the rise in Italian lira. The pound sterling is slow back over four-lift hs of the ground lost during the war and postwar periods, and within less than 30 cents of the normal parity with the aout&r. The recovery in Italian finances is nowhere near as far advanced. Still the lira within less than a month ar.d a half has gono from a valuation of 33* cents to where it i? now worth over 5 cents, and there is no doubt that this is a fair measure of the optimism in Italian commercial circles regarding the new government, and the outlook for successful carrying out of its fiscal program. This program calls for a scaling down of government expenditures, a more equitable distribution of taxes Safe Deposit Vaults i ! We have several large private vaults. 24T/<x39 x21J"S for rent.

Another striking feature in the foreign situation is the way the German mark for nearly a month has been virtually stationary, despite the further prodigious increase of nearly 300 billions In the outstanding paper issue and the prospect by the first of the year the trillion level will have been reached. It is hard to .account for this by any of the known facts, but It is clear that for some reason?whether it Is confidence in the new ministry and the belief that It will succeed in ; working out Germany's desperate | financial problems, or whether it is 1 ! that some positive measures have " been secretly inaugurated to stabilize the mark?the German public has got over its panic and has ceased to throw over its holding of the paper currency in exchange for securities and foreign moneys. It is quite possible that in the end it will be found that plana for dealing with the financial crisis are much further along than people have beeh led to believe by anything that has been allowed to escape into the news dispatches.
