The Senate held a short session on the 10th, during which an agreement was reached for taking up the omnibus claims bill Monday with the understanding that it (shall not Interfere with the consideration Of the postal savings hill or any other measure in which senators are especially in terested. Senator Lodge gave notice that he Would on Wednesday speak on the Browns ville affair. After a short executive session the Senate at 1:08 o’clock adjourned until llonday in respect to the memory of the late Representative Charles T. Dunwell of New York. The Senate was not in session on the 11th. The Heart.** was not In session on the 12th. The Brownsville affair consumed nearly the entire session. Senator Foraker ob tained the floor early and read letters from a former soldier of the Twenty-fifth regi ment telling of the procedure of govern ment detectives In attempts to get a con fession from him. Mr. Foraker introduced an amendment to his original bill for the re-enlistment of these soldiers providing that a commission of three retired army officers be created to determine whether discharged soldiers are Innocent of com plicity in the shooting up of Brownsville as a prerequisite fur their re-enlistment In stead of leaving that duty with the Presi dent, as provided by the Warner bill. The President's message giving the results of the war department’s Investigation of the Brownsville affair was read and Mr. For aker again took the floor to comment upon the message. Senator Carter announced that on the 15th he would speak upon the postal savings bank bill and would ask that It be made the unfinished business of the Benate. The President’s Panama canal message was read on the 15th and Its reading was received with loud laughter by some of the senators. Senator Foraker endeavored to have adopted a resolution calling on the sec retary of war for detailed Information con cerning the men employed. Instructions giv en and expenses incurred in the investiga tion by detectives Into the Brownsville af fair, referred to by the President in his mes fiage of the 14th. Senator Warren objected to Immediate consideration. The postal sav ings bank bill was the subject of speeches by Senators Carter and Depew, both of whom advocated the measure. The bill was made the unfinished bnslnesec, displacing the Joint resolution for the repeal of the commodity clause of the interstate com merce law. On motion of Senator Fulton the omnibus claims bill will bo taken up on January •>. Brief memorial services were held for flic late Representative George W. Smith of Illinois, and at 3:30 the Senate ad journed. Considerable time was devoted on the Kith to a discussion of the President’s course In placing strictures on Congress in the matter of the secret service, and a searching resolution, proposed by Mr. Aid rich ami amended upon the suggestion of Mr. Culberson, providing for a thorough investigation by the committee on appro priations of the President’s charges, both in respect to the acts and the course that, should be taken by Congress to resent the Imputations believed to have been east upon that body, was adopted. Mr. Aldrich, in In troducing his resolution, made no comment upon it, but Senators Bailey, Bacon, Till man. Culberson and others declared that the President’s words should be resented by the Senate as highly insulting. Senator For aker’e resolution calling on the secretary of war for informal in concerning the work of defectives in the Brownsville affair also was adopted. Senator Lodge spoke In support of the Warner hill permitting the President to re-enllst the discharged soldiers of the Twenty-fifth regiment at his discretion. The Senate at 3:30 adjourned. House. At no time was there a quorum in the House. The legislative appropriation bill was presented and several hills passed, among them being one authorizing the re moval of the imposition of loss of citizen ship upon deserters in the military and naval services. The rest of the day was taken up iu discussing the bill to provide for the arbitrary Investigation of difficulties between employers and employes. Its con sideration had not been concluded when the House at 4:59 p. in. adjourned until Friday. The legislative, executive and judicial ap propriation bill, which usually excites con siderable discussion. lasting' for several days, was passed with little debate and practically in the shape in which it came from committee. An unusual feature was that no member asked for time to indulge in general talk. The bill carries an appropria tion of $31,6(15,320. The House, immediately after convening, unanimously and without debate adopted a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee of five to consider the reference to the secret service In the President’s message and to suggest, what action, if any. should lie taken in the matter. At 5:11 p. m. the House adjourned. No particular programme had been mapped out for the 12th, hut under a call of com mittees several measures in which the members were especially interested were considered. With few exceptions they eu gendred the- liveliest sort of debate. " Par liamentary tactics were freely resorted to, with the result that five times the roll was called. The first wrangle occurred on a resolution fixing the boundary line between the states of Colorado. Oklahoma and New Mexico, which was adopted by a good ma jority. but not without two roil calls. The House then by a decisive vote refused further to consider the bill providing for arbitrary settlement of disputes between employers and employes. Next the bill pro viding for the protection of aliens in the United States was thrashed out at length. The measure had rough sailing, and it was passed by a slim majority after the roll had been called twice. At 5:27 p. m. the House adjourned. While considering bills dealing with af fairs in the District of Columbia the House on the 14th passed a measure for 85-ceut gas In Washington. The hill now goes to the Senate, as well as another bill abolish ing "bucket shops” in the district. A hill providing for free lectures in the public schools was voted down. An attempt by Representative Henry of Texas to obtain a change lu the reference of a bill pro hibiting the making of future contracts on agricultural products brought forth the promise from Chairman Scott of the agri cultural committee that his committee would soon grant hearings to farmers’ unions and others on this subject. The House voted to adjourn Saturday, Decem ber 19, to Monday. January 4, and ad journed for the day at 5 p. in. The hopes of the so-called insurgents for a revision of the rules of that body were dissipated, for the time being at least, when Mr. Gardner of Massachusetts failed to ob tain the adoption of an amended resolution calling for the appointment of a committee of eight members to consider the subject and report the changes deemed necessary. By a substantial majority the House voted to take away from the committee on for eign affairs consideration of the resolution, ■which In Its original form, simply called for information from the secretary of state regarding what the British House of Com mons had done in that regard. A ruling by the speaker that the amendment of Mr. Gardner changed the character of the reso lution iu such a way as to make it not pri vileged was sustained and the resolution then was laid on the table. After passing some bills relating to the District of Co lumbia the remainder of the day was taken up with the bill to revise the peua! laws of the United States. At 5:30 p. m. the House adjourned. Except for n few moments speht in the transaction of routine business and the passage of two bridge bills, the House on the 16th devoted its entire time to the further consideration of the bill to revise the penal laws of the United States. The Oarrett amendment, which came over from last night and which prohibited the sending: through the mails of information bearing on transactions in futures, was defeated by a decided vote. \Vlthout opposition an amend ment by Mr. Houston (Tennessee) was adopted making It an offense to deposit in or ship through the mails intoxicating liquors. There was sti',l pending when th > Mil was laid aside an amendment by Mr. Humphreys of Mississippi providing for the Identification of Intoxicating liquors trans ported by interstate carriers. This propo sition evolved extended debate. At 4;57 p. m. the House adjourned. —One of the large electrical firms in (Jermany gives yearsly from £4 to $7 to employes who have served for more than a year. The sum thus expended exceeds

BONIRENOUNCES PLEA FOR MONEY; ■WANTS CHILDREN :OUNT FEELS INDIGNANT AT PRIN CESS DE SAGAN FOR SAYING HE NEEDS CASH. HIS FEELINGS ARE OUTRAGED. Declares George Gould Believes His Golden Authority Can Guild Sis ter’s Marriage to Prince. HOLD WILL NOT COVER BASENESS. PARIS, Dec. 16.—The hearing of the suit brov.ght by Count Boni de Castel lane against the Princess de Sagan, in which he petitions that the custody of his three children be given to his moth er, the Marquise de Castellaae, was con tinued in this city today. M. Bonnet was heard iu rejoinder for the count. He read a letter from the count renouncing the petition for $60,- 000 annually for the maintenance of the children, but insisting more emphatically thau ever that the children be confided to the care of his mother. The relin quishment of the financial demand came as a surprise in spite of the fact that such a course was indicated at the close of the first hearing of the case. “Indignant at Lies.” The letter of the count was addressed to M. Bonnet and it is couched in an eloquent phraseology of outraged man hood. It begins: “indignant at the per fidious and lying insinuations of the princess and her family representing that my only desire is to obtain a big allow ance, 1 now ask for myself and my moth er only the custody of the children; I renounce with pleasure the request for an allowance.” Continuing, the count calls M. Bonnet to witness with what outraged feelings he rejected the pecuniary offers of the Prince and Princess de Sagan and George Gould, the princess’ brother. “The new and unexpected attitude of George Gould,” de Castellaue writes, “who regards this suit simply as a vulgar affair of money and who believes that his golden authority can gild the mar riage of his sister with a tarnished man compels me more strongly than ever to i..sist on the withdrawal of the children from the house of which the prince is the ornament and from surroundings where they will learn only one thing— that honor is nothing and money ev erything, that money covers ev< ry base ness and that it will buy every con science. Disagrees with Goulds. “The decision 1 have taken wdll show the court the sole purpose which inspires me, my parents and my relatives. We are without fortunes and upon the ques tion of money we do not hold the same theories as do the Goulds. Concerning the education of French youths, we have oilier ideas thau those of the De Sagans. My parents will aid me to bring up these three innocent victims.” Hints at Divorce. After asking the court to take notice of the modification of the petition of his client, M. Bonnet launched into a vigor ous denunciation of his adversaries. He charged that on many points the defend ants did not dare to meet the allega tions of the count, citing particularly the allegation that the Princess de Sagan was ready to leave her present husband. “They did not dare challenge this state ment.” the lawyer said, “because they know that the proposed separation has been formally communicated to De Cas tellane’s attorneys.” Continuing. M. Bonnet said that all of the offers of settlement made by the Princess de Sagan were conditioned upon the count’s renunciation of his children, hut the count refused to sell either himself or his children. The princess had told Judge Ditte that if the children were taken from her sla* would disinherit them, thus proving that in her eyes everything was a ques tion of money. Calls Princess Extravagant. Referring to the charges that De Cas tellane had dissipated his wife’s fortune, M. Bonnet insisted that the countess was just as much responsible as her husband for the “royal extravagances” such as the Malukoff palace, the Chateau Ma rais, and the Charity bazar, which alone cost $300,000. The lawyer particularly resented George Gould's share in the de fense, saying that now the question of money had been eliminated, Mr. Gould was playing the mysterious role of Craw ford in the Humbert affair. Asa matter of fact, Mr. Gould alway-s had opposed the marriage of his sister to the Prince de Sagan, and he only finally consented on condition that there should be a sep aration of property. “Does Mr. Gould fear that his sister will get another divorce and made a more unfortunate third marriage?” asked M. Bonnet. “No, I can reassure him; the princess can find nobody worse than De Sagan.” The lawyer then asked the court to or der the taking of testimony on certain points which the defense had declined to meet. In conclusion, he appealed to the court to withdraw the three children from the custody of their mother, who had married a man renounced by one of the greatest families of France, and “who has spent a month in prison,” and place them in the care of the mother of the count, whose only purpose was to direct her grandchildren in the right path. At the conclusion of M. Bonnet’s re marks. M. Clemenceau replied for the princess. The case was then adjourned for a week, when the public prosecutor will present his conclusions. A decision is expected in a fortnight, unless the court decides to hear testimony. As at previous sessions of the court when this case was hoard, the courtroom was crowded with Parisians anxious to hear this famous scandal bared. In the the suit for the custody of the chidren, tire doors are thrown open to the public, but were closed when Princess de Sagan secured her divorce from Count Boni.

PULITZER REPLIES TO THE PRESIDENT EDITOR OF NEW YORK WORLD DE CLARES HIS PAPER WILL NOT BE MUZZLED. CALLS MESSAGE LESE MAJESTE Bulldozing of Judges and Slander of Pri vate Citizens Is Another Declara tion in Editorial. IS NOT AFRAID TO GO TO JAIL. NEW YORK, Dec. IG. Under the caption "Lese Majeste” The World prints the following editorial on Presi dent Roosevelt's Panama message; Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He cannot muzzle the World. While no amount ol billingsgate on his part can alter our de termination to treat him with judicial im partiality and scrupulous fairness, we re peat what we have already said—that the Congress of tnc United States should make a thorough investigation of the whole Pa nama tnusictiou that the full truth may be known to the American people. It is a must extraordinary circumstance that Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand such an inquiry. All his protestations ol outrag' and virtue, ail his torrents of impre cation and denunciation, end with the amazing assertion that "there is nothing whatever in which this government Is inter ested to investigate about this transaction.” World Returns Thanks. The World fi liy appreciates the compli ment paid to it by Mr. Roosevelt iu mak ing it the subject of a special message tc the Congress of the. United States, lu the whole history of American government no other President has ever paid such a tribute to the power and influence of a fearless, in dependent newspaper. The World likewise appreciates the im portance and significance of Mr. Roosevelt’s statement when he declares to Congress that the proprietor of the World "should be prosecuted for libel by the governmental authorities,” and that "the attorney gen eral has under consideration the form under which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought.” This is the first time a President ever asserted the doctrine of lese majesty or proposed iu the absence of specific legisla tion the criminal prosecution by the gov ernment of citizens who criticised the con duct of the government or the conduct ol individuals who may have had business dealings with the government. Neither the King of Great Britain nor the German Em peror would venture to arrogate such pow er to himself. John Adams’ attempt to en force the sedition law destroyed the Fed eralist party in America. Yet Mr. Roose velt in the absence of law officially pro poses to use all the power of the greatest government on earth to cripple the free dom of the press on the pretext that the government itself has been libeled—and he Is the government. Last Straw on His Back. We are aware that for many years Mr. Roosevelt has been savagely displeased with the editorial conduct of the World. It Is true that we have criticised him sharply and frankly whenever we believed the pub lic interest required, just as we have heartily commended and supported him whenever we believed the putilic interest would thereby be advanced. Mr. Roose velt’s attack on the World can be explained only on the theory that he believes he can muzzle the paper, and our recent impeach ment of his veracity seems to have been the last straw that broke his automatic back. It is true that the World printed the pub lic reports concerning the Panama canal affair, which resulted from William Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney’s office during the recent campaign to pre vent the publication of a story which was said to be in the hands of the Democratic national committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's own action which raised the issue iu the campaign. “If This Be Treason, Etc.” Jt is true also that when Mr. Roosevelt made his attack upon Delavan Smith the World called attention to certain state ments which Mr. Roosevelt must have known to have been false or misleading, and appealed to Congress to end all scan dal by a full and impartial investigation. If this be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the most of it. Mr. Roosevelt’s lamentable habit of in accurate statement makes it impossible tc accept either his judgments or his conclu sions. In his message he does not state correctly even so simple a matter as the pretended causes of his grievance. Ho says, for example, that the World asserted that there was “corruption by oi on tiehulf of the government of the United States.” No such charge was made by this newspaper. He says it was asserted that there were “improper dealings of some kind between agents of the government and outside per sons.” No such charge was made. Denies Taft Charge. lie says.that “among those persons who, it was alleged, made 'huge prollts’ were Charles P. Taft, a brother of William 11. Taft, then candidate for the presidency, and Douglas Robinson, my brother-in-law. No such charge was made. The World has never said that Charles I’. Taft or Douglas Robinson made any profits whatever. Mr. Taft denied that he was concerned in the transaction in any way, which denial the World published and accepted. It would have been equally glad to print Mr. Robinson’s denial could it have succeeded in obtaining one from him, as it frequently attempted. The World has no evidence that he was associated with Mr. Cromwell and would accept his word tc that effect, for Mr. Robinson is an estim able gentleman of high character whose reputation for veracity is infinitely- better than that of his distinguished brother-iu law. “Not to Be Intimidated.” If the World has libeled anybody- we hope it will be punished, but we do not intend to be intimidated by Mr. Roosevelt’s threats or by Mr. Roosevelt’s denunciation, or by Mr. Roosevelt's power. Mr. Roosevelt’s seething indignation about the World’s “libel upon the United States government” Is an exquisite indict ment, indeed, coming as it does from a President who, less than a week ago of ficially insinuated in his message that the Congress of the United States was com posed of scoundrels who amended an ap propriation bill because “congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret service men.” No living man ever so grossly lilteled toe United States as does this President who besmirches Congress, bulldozes judges, as sails the integrity of courts, slanders pri vate citizens and who has shown himsell the most reckless, unscrupulous demagogue whom the American people ever trusted with great power and authority. We say this not in auger, but iu sincere sorrow. The World has Immeasurably moit respect for the office of President of the United States than Theodore Roosevelt hue ever shown during the years iu which he has maintained a reign of terror and villi tied the honor and honesty of both public officials and private citizens who opposed his policies or thwarted him iu his pur poses. So far as the World is concerned, Its pro prietor may go to jail If Mr. Roosevelt sue ceeds. as he threatens; but even in jail the World will not cease to he a fearless cham pion of free speech, a free press and a free people. It cannot be muzzled. 15

Ohio society in New Y’ork, but arouuu the 100 tables placed in the grand ball room in Astor gallery of the Waldorf- Astoria borel were men gathered from ever} - section of the country and lead ers in many walks of life. Mr. Taft took advantage of the occa sion, in a speech iilled with more ear nestness, perhaps, than any he has de livered since his election, to pledge his administration and his party, so far as he can control it, to a loyal adherence to the Chicago platform, lie dwelt al most wholly upon the revision of the tariff, which he singled out as the most important declaration made at the last annual convention, and, after having previously referred to the veto power of the chief executive, said, with all the emphasis of which he was capable: "Better no revision at all, better that the new bill should fail, unless we have an honest and thorough revision on the basis laid down and the principle out lined in the party platform.” Approves Sherman Law. Mr. Taft also referred again to the Sherman anti-trust law and declared for its enforcement as one of the Roosevelt policies that the party had pledged itself to carry forward. Seated at the "President’s table,” with Mr. Taft, were the vice president-elect, Mr. Sherman: Gov. Hughes of New York, who paid a glowing tribute to Mr. Taft during the course of the evening; Henry W. Taft, president of the society and toastmaster; Charles P. Taft of Cin cinnati. Horace D.

Ga.. where he will have his last period of rest and recreation before assuming the duties of the chief executive. His sons, Robert A. Taft and Charles P.

SEES BLOCK TO FREE SPEECH. Investigation Is Best Way to Bear Out Facts and Learn Whether or Not Charges Are False. HITS AT FEDERAL PROSECUTION LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 17.—William J. Bryan takes radical issv.es with Presi dent Roosevelt in the latter's declaration that it is the duty of the government to prosecute an individual or newspaper which attacks the government or govern ment officials. In an editorial which will appear in next week's issue of his Com moner. Mr. Bryan attacks the Presi dent’s message and comes to the rescue of the press. He says: President Roosevelt has sent to Congress a message which announces anew and dan gerous doctrine. It is the duty of every publisher and every believer in free speech and press to resent the President’s attempi to use the government to terrorize those who would criticise the action of public of ficials. No official can claim exemption from criticism merely because ho Is an of ficial, and no act of the government is so sacred that the humblest citizen may not express an adverse opinion upon it. It is a matter of little consequence wheth er the charges made by the World are true or false—that can he determined by suit at law in the ordinary way—but it is a matter of great importance that every editor and every other individual shall lie free to ex press his opinion on any subject connected with public affairs. The World demands an investigation of the Panama purchase, and It is for Congress to determine whether the Investigation shall lie made. The fact that the President thinks no investigation is necessary Is immaterial. Bryan Scores President. An investigation is the best method of bringing out the facts, and if there has been misrepresentation the President ought to urge investigation rather than to oppose it. But this proposition that the government ran Institute libel proceedings against an individual or a paper for criticism of the government's action is not only anew doc trine, but an extremely objectionable one. if any individual has been libeled he has his action at law. If the individual con cerned does not see fit to prosecute his remedy the government cannot become bis champion. The President says that the execution of the purchase act was in the hands of Attor ney General Knox and that he, the Presi dent. approved of everything that Mr. Knox did. If either the President or Mr. Knox is charged with ’’mproper conduct, the courts nre open to them, but the Presi dent cannot use the attorney general to punish those who criticise him. Senator Knox, or any other official. Whatever of fense the World has committed —if It has committed an offense—is not against the government but against Individuals who are accused of bringing improper influence to bear upon officials. Pulitzer on Solid Ground. Mr. Pulitzer is on solid ground when he resists the. President's attempt to convert newspaper 'criticism of officials into a criti cism against the government itself. The President’s message is indefensible in so far as it asserts the right of the government to prosecute the World, or Mr. Pulitzer, and he will find that he lias overstepped the limits of his authority if he attempts to use the attorney general’s office in the way that he has proposed. The President is not the government: a criticism of him is not a criticism of the government.
