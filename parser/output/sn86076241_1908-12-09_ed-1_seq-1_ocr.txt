BLUE FRONT STORE ANNUAL MESSAGE Of President Roosevelt Submitted to Congress on Yesterday President Roosevelt's annual mes sage which was read in the Senate and House yesterday attracted great attention and drew a throng to the galeries. It had been awaited with much Interest, especially since it was the executive's last chance to put before the people the Rooseveltian doctrines that have come to be known as "my policies." By far the greater space in the doc ument is devoted to labor and ques tions arising from the demand for a modification of the injunction law. The position of the judiciary as re gards good and bad laws is must clearly stated and the President takes to bring home to the people -that .the responsibility for the repeal of bad laws rests with the Legislature and that judges must not be expected to correct errors and construe bad laws Into good ones. The President calls attention to the stand of laboring men against an al leged effort to array them as a class against all the rest of the country and says that union men by their votes have shown that the welfare of the country is in safe hands. The message touches directly, or in directly upon every topic In the pub lic service. He makes a strong plea for the National forests as being an asset which with proper usage, we can transmit to our children in better condition and productive of greater revenue than when the Government took them under its control. Let every citizen learn to use a rlflle so that in time of war an army of millions may be ready to take to the field, is a recommendation which he extends also to the younger gener ation. The potential army, he as serts, will be the Nation's best bul wark since it will deter other uationt from interfering with the peace o the world Just as well as huge stand ing armies such as those which eat out the heart of European Nations in taxation. o-o The semi-annual clean-up was fin ished at the Keane-Wonder mine yes terday, and a brick worth in the neighborhood of $10,000 was the re sult. The ore body at the Keane Wonder is holding its own in both quality and quantity, and it would be an easy matter to keep triple the number of stamps working on goo'l ore. o-n Geore L. Sanford, who has been attending to business interests in Reno, has returned to this city.

"Snowshoe Bill" Bennett made his way into Uardnerville Sunday, having crossed the Sierra Nevada range from Placerville to that place on snow shoes. He followed the course of the water lines of the Standard Electric Company, saving the dams of that big corporation from being carried away by drifting ice and snowslides and in suring the company's patrons on both sides of the mountains a power and water supply. This is no new work to Bennett. He has been employed by the company for the past eleven years. His time for work begins when the first fall of snow in the mountains comes and from that time until long after spring opcrs he is always on duty, ready at all times to risk his life that the res er.oirs and the ditches of the power ccmpan y might be kept open. In all these years, however, his last experience was the most trying. ' ; - Practically the entire journey from Placerville was made on snowshoes. Nearly every step of the journey was made in the face of a terrible bliz zard, the snow in places forming huge drifts in which he would have perished had long practice not made him an expert on snowshoes.

The leaser has started out to find the extent of his ledge and will rush development work as rapidly as po i sible. to ascertain the value of his find. The ore is free milling and with the values that he has received from the assays he can afford to start shipments as soon as the ore can be mined and sacked. The property has always shown good assays and considerable devel opment work has been done by the owners but some time ago other par ties took a lease on the ground but vben the excitement in the Trapper district was at its height they forsook this part of the county and went int h new district. If they had con tinued with the work then unde" pro gress for another couple of weeks they would have struck the ledge and by the present time there would have been enough work done on the prop erty to determine its worth.

ANNUAL WORK The season for completing annual assessment work is at hand, and any who have thus far neglected this nec essary compliance with the law had better make haste to attend to it. There are those who think relocation will answer all purposes, but if an other party locates the claim, and can prove that assessment work has been neglected, the relocator will be able to make his claim good. In other words, to locate a claim in which you already have an interest, and upon which the annual work has not been performed, gives no additional rights, o-o -HERE FROM COAST . Chas.

B. Cush man, a member of the firm of Lang ley and Cushman, brokers of Reno, and formerly cashier of the Tonopah branch : of the State Bank & Trust Company, has returned from Tonopah where he appeared before Judge O' Brien and answered the indictment against him. He asked for the speed iest possible trial on the indictment and did not even offer a demurrer to the charge. In speaking of the affair Cushman said: "The transaction for which I was indicted was perfectly legitimate and I cannot understand why I was not called before the Grand Jury and given an opportunity to explain the case before an indictment was re turned, as others accused of charges were given the privilege. The in dictment is the result of a transac tion in Manhattan with the Manhattan branch of the State Bank & Trust Company. I had gone to Manhattan on a business matter and there a mining man wanted to buy some min ing stock. I at first refused, stattng that I had no money witti me. The cashier of the Manhattan branch of the State Bank & Trust Company offered to let me have $1000, the amount needed, with some mining claims I had there and the stock 1 intended to buy as security. I took the money and gave the security he wanted." o-o HE OBJECTS Abe Cohn has registered a kick as to his "ad" in the Appeal which states that he has Navajo rubber tops. It isn't because he is not sell ing any but he has too many inquiries for "rubber tops." The correction has been made so call on Abe and get your "rubber toys." o-o TO ARRIVE TO-MORROW James A.

A tele gram was sent to J. H. Hutchinson yesterday to use his best efforts to bring the next meeting of the Ameri can Mining Gongrers to G- i ilivld. M. Hutchinson has already wired that he believes this city stands the best show, but that systametic efforts must be made to that end, especially with regard to hotel accommodations Charles S. Sprague, president of the chamber of commerce, yesterday sent a lengthy telegram to Mr. Hutchin son in Pittsburg, saying that by for mal resolution of. the chamber's di rectors a bearty and inotl" ur.nt in itrlion was extended to the con gress to assemble here in 1909. " In addition to this the Goldfleld chamber guarantees a most profitable sojourn for the members and also guarantees thf- entire expenses ot the gathering, except, of course, the hotel bills. Th expectation is that fully 2000 aeierates will come here, Inc udiug many prominent mining experts and rr.e -sllurgists. Every possible, pressure will be brought to bear upon the director?, who seem to have the deciding voice as to the meeting place, to have the decision in favor of Goldfleld. The contest, it appears, now lies between Goldfleld and Seattle, but the former city is admittedly better from a mln in point of view than the latter. .; . Hutchinson is known to be exerting every fiber to swing the session for Goldfleld and there is litle doubt but that he will succeed. All Lie dtle ga.s wish to know is that t here will be accommodations here for them. o-o FEW
