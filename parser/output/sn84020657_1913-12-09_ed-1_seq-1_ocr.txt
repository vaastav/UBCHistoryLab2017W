Dec. 9. As far as the eye could reach today, stretched over the desert ill the distance oppo site Presidio, is the straggling line of the retreating Federal army and the civilians who tied with them from Chi huahua Included in the exodus 'are 4.000 troops, and many thousands of men. women and children. The latter are crossing the American border into Texas. The Federal troops are fortifying Ojinaga. This with the fact that Gen. Sala/.ar immediately communicated with Mexico City is taken to indicate that it is intended to make a defense on the border at least until Gen. Hu erta can be consulted with and give his orders to his officers. Federalists Defeat Was Complete. PRESIDIO. Tex.. Dec. 9? The com plete rout of Gen. Huerta's army of Northern Mexico at Chihuahua, the frantic efforts put forth by his gener als to reach safety on the border and the demoralized condition of the unpaid troops that made the stand at that place was established today when the advance of the retreating men reached Ojingaga, just across the Mexican bor der from this place. In the remark able hegira of soldiers and civilians who deserted Chihuahua are (Jen. Sal vador Mercado. commander of the Fed eral troops of the North, General Pas cual Orozco, Rojas.

Hunter today. "The inauguration of the parcels post system will increase the vast traffic in Christmas presents that the Postoffice Department has had to cope with each year," continued Mr. Hunt er, "and if those of Juneau desire to get their shipments in the mail ahead of the flood that will sweep into the various postoffices just before Christ mas Day, they have no time to lose. The next mails out of Juneau should carry the bulk of the holiday gifts." Merchants say that the people of Juneau have been slower this year in catching the holiday spirit than usual, and that Christmas purchasing has not yet begun in earnest, though this week has shown a marked im provement ovtr last. The slowness is regarded more as an evidence of the good times that are prevailing than anything else. "The people have been too busy," a merchant said yester day. "to get down to the detail of se lecting Christmas presents. However, there is every reason to believe that the present season will exceed any of its predecessors in that respect, and shopping will doubtless continue at a rapid rate from now on to the end." o ? o ? o

Dick inson have bought the large and sea worthy fishing boat "Grubstake TI" and will convert the same into hand some cruising yacht for the purpose ? of catering to wealthy, big game hunt ers who desire to cruise about the wa ters of the Southeast coast of Alaska and off to the Westward.

There will be state rooms fitted up with baths, electric lights and other modern equipment.

BIG PORECLOSURE SUIT SATURDAY The big foreclosure sale of the Al- j >a?ka Treasure Gold Mining company's property, better known as the Neva- j ila Creek mines, takes place Saturday of this week. This will wipe out an , 1 indebtedness of $300,000 and place the preliminary movement toward a re organization of the forces behind the enterprise well on its way toward ful- j filment. It is not expected, however, that the re-organization can be com- j pleted before next spring. Today the abstract of title to the ? properties was forwarded to San Fran- j cisco for the purpose of facilitating matters looking toward the re-organi- ; zation as soon as the present burden 1 has been cleared up. Before definite 1 action can be taken in the re-organiza tion plan it will probably be necessary to have the property examined and passed upon by engineers for the un- 1 derwriter if those who are handling1 the proposition follow the usual line. This will require some time but the 1 1 parties at interest feel satisfied with th" progress that is being made and are looking forward to a successful j consummation of the tentative plans. And in the meantime a small crew is . kept employed prosecuting the devel- ] opment work. o ? o ? o

Marshall asked for an order of judgment against Em ery Valentine for delinquent taxes on the property belonging to himself, and as the agent or administrator for oth ers. J. H.
