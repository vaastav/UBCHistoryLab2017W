EL PASO HERALD EDITORIAL and MAGAZINE PAGE s TRADING WITH MEXICO WILL BE' under there . .- : . . . . . : . ByBriggswhat fo at in War Jime AFFECTED BY TARIFF REVISION THE United States tariff commission is getting under way with a task which will be of great importance to Zl Fan when the results are made known; and not a. one to El Paso bnt to every town along the border where mports from Mexico and exports to Mexico are handled. This task is the drafting of a revision of the administrative iiws relating to the customs in order to remove the existing duplications, contradictions and antiquated provisions. It is not possible to speak of this more specifically, because he commission has been in existence only since April 1, 1917, and what it will attempt to do has been outlined only -a general terms, as indicated in its first report to congress, iust submitted. The commission has invited from business men on the border, treasury officials, and others, suggestions as to im provements in the customs service administration, customs duties and the handling of exports and imports. The com mission hopes to present to congress a.revision of law which, if approved and enacted into law, will result in clear ness and simplification in the form and substance of the customs administrative law, increased efficiency and greater -onvenience for the public and a substantial saving of gov ernment expenditure. In this connection the commission also is investigating ' he establishment of free zones at ports as a means of ex pediting export trade and, as for seaboards, overcoming demurrage in ocean commerce. Exporters and importers at 1 Paso and Juarez will have, an time, a means of securing almost any information they require about their business or any other in which they may be interested, in relation to trade between the United States and Mexico or any other foreign country. The tariff com mission has undertaken to establish a catalog of tariff information, somewhat in the nature of an encyclopedia, which shall contain, as far as possible, data for each import ant article affected by the tariff. This will include statis tics on imports, exports, production, prices and cost of pro duction, prices of manufacture and competitive conditions. Tt will be kept up to date continuously. A part of the gen eral plan will be the establishment of a tariff library in which will he kept books, pamphlets, letters from producers and importer:, classified and arranged for ready consulta tion. Inasmuch as border business men have been prohibited 'ram. trading with enemy alien firms in Mexico and have been furnished with a Kst of 1600 names of blacklisted in dividuals and firms, many of whom are in business in Mex ico, the work of the tariff commission in this relation will be of far reaching importance in the future. The commis sion is sow studying commercial warfare, commercial neu trality and commercial alliances. It may be said that bodies in all the belligerent countries are considering the same subjects. Germany and her allies are considering the arrangement oi an economic union for central Europe. Imperial prefer ence has been discussed in England and her self governing colonies. Far reaching possibilities of this have been suggested, i especially since the Paris Economic conference of allied rep resentatives in June, 1916, when differential treatment was discussed for aBied, neutral and enemy countries. There was then made public the threat of an after-war commer cial warfare against Germany and the others of the central alliance. Let it be stated parenthetically that preferential treat ment is now in effect, as to trade and tariff, among the allied countries. Furthermore, Gen. Carranra, president of Mexico, is taking up the idea. In a message to congress last week. Gen. Carrania asked authority to apply differential tariffs to countries which imposed no trade restrictions with respect to Mexico and those which did. In other words, (BY H. S. H.) an advantage would be accorded merchants of those coun tries placing no export or import restrictions with respect to Mexico. It must be noted here that the United States, because of the war conditions, has imposed numerous re strictions along this border, such as the trading with the enemy act, above noted, the embargo on exports of gold, and the requirements of licenses for trading in a long list of commodities. In the act creating the tariff commission, congress specifically empowered the commission to investigate the Paris Economy Pact and similar organizations and arrange ments in Europe. The commission is preparing an extensive report on bargaining tariffs, commercial treaties and eco nomic alliances. The United States has never had a con sistent policy with respect to bargaining tariffs. The com mission will provide the facts upon which congress may louna a method of bargaining with other countries for de sired goods and adjusting tariffs accordingly, and also a method upon which American commercial treaties may be adjusted to meet the conditions of the modem world. So much for the prospects as they apply to border trad ing. As for internal revenue, that is, taxes collected from business conducted altogether within the United States and not including extraordinary war taxation, the tariff com mission has submitted to the ways and means committee of the house of representatives a report recommending that congress take steps analogous to those which other coun tries have taken, and which are known as "padlock laws" whereby proposed increases in duties and taxes should go into effect before the enactment of new revenue laws, but subysct to their finally being passed. Thus the effect of' the law would be observed before the law was passed. In other words, the law would be tested out like any other' invention and either ratified or rejected as its effect was found to be good or bad. How the proposed revisions of laws will affect trading with Mexico remains to be seen when the commission makes public the changes proposed to be made. That some changes will be made, and that it will affect either the duties at the border or the administration of the customs service, is cer tain. It would be advisable for merchants and others doing an ejLpui uug ana unpuiun uunuEss iu wine mc commis sion any changes they think conditions demand for the bene fit of business and of the government. Charity begins at home but it ought to extend as far as Belgium. If the nan essential industries are to be put out of busi ness, where is the treasury department to get its revenue from corporation income and excess profits taxes? If the country needs 12 billion dollars or 13 billions, it's all the same. Our viewpoint has so changed that a billion dollars more or less makes no great difference. Only the war supplies it will buy are important. Belgium's misery is well understood in the United States, thus showing what advertising will do. The people of Poland, Servia, Montenegro and occupied Rumania are suffering as much or more than are the Belgians, but their tragedy hasn't received as much publicity. Close observers have noted that all the ''breajts" m this war are in Germany's favor. Germany has more luck than a beginner at poker. Every circumstance, weather in cluded, favors Germany. But while Germans call this the assistance of their own private God, we prefer to call it just plain good fortune and while Germany may get the luck, we shall get the victory.

SPENCER (Written far The EI Paso Herald and Approved by the United States Food 1 Administration.) BEFORE your prospective food reaches the retailer It has passed through a sartes of transactions and shipment which are always un der the eye of the constitutional of ficials to safeguard the health of the public. Generally these officials are able to keep a good check on the de cency of the handling and refriger ating of the food, while It Is the pos session of wholesalers, and generally the food reaches your retailer la a very near perfect condition or he, ef coarse, would refuse to accept it, look ing out for his own Interests. But once in the possession of the retailer there are many vicissitudes through which the food may pass which may or may not leave It fit for human consumption. If, in the ; retailers' hands, the food Becomes i contaminated, dirty, rancid, putrid or 1 unwholesome, then the consumer, and the consumer only, can exercise the censoring influence that will remedy conditions.

"In other words, the railroads claim they are operating and buying on a war basis and being paid on a peace basis."
