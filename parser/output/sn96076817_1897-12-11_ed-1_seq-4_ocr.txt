The annual message of tin President of the United States is u document that is always look ed forward to with a ;ieat ileal of anxiety as it ,renorally forms the nucleus of legislation for the session of congress following it. The message just sent to con gress hy President McKinley lias none of the sensationalism about it that some such docu ments hhve had in the past, sucl for instance as the message of President (.'li-veland when he d voted all (ft his time on one sub ject. yet it is a very important and a creditable paper.

His reference to tho financial plan proposed by Se rotary ( Ia;,rt is indicative of the fact that, he considers reforms in the curren cy necessary. The next important subject discussed is the Cuban question and in the handiinir of the pies tioii he has shown the wisdom of u conservative position. His Utterances may be disappointit: to many of the sympathetic friends of ('aha hut the president evidently bolioVes that the piv eminent cannot be run on a sym atUetic basis any mn'v than can a'private business.
