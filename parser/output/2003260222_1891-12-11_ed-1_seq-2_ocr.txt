The dispatches iuform ns that Senator Dolph wiil introduce a nunibor.-ef bills during the present session of congress, for the improvement ol the Columbia river. This was to be expected as a matter of course, but it reminds us that the last appropriation for the works at the Cascades will soon be exhausted and that we owe to our posterity, if not to ourselves to give the senator and bis colleagues all the moral support we can in their efforts to obtain another appro priation. If The Dalles has practically solved the question of an open river for herself we do not forget that the major part of the Inland Empire is still at the mercv of the railroads and unable to avail itself of the advantages we poeeess, It is little.' Derhans. that we can do es- naeiallv with a coneress from which iittle is to le expected for public im provemeBts, but what we can do ought to lie done freely. The benefits that this section has derived from a portage at the Cascades ought to make us all the more anxious for the completion of work that will one day beneht every producer from Idaho to the mouth of the Columbia. Would it not therefore be well for ou board of trade to get to gether at an early date and take such steps as may be proper to supplement the work of the Oregon delegation Every" town iu Eastern Oregjn and Washington ought to organize for the same purpose and such a siege be kept up as will at least cSnvince congress that we are in earnest. So the Oregon delegation has re com mended Joe Simon for the federal judge ship and the recommendation is seconded by the Governor Pennoyer and Jim Lotan and many prominent republicans of this state. . We dont care if it is. The appointment would be as much of an in sult in its way to every clean republican in the state, pjtoatd-tttS" nomination of Tri'-urrmf the presidency, to every clean democrat in the nation. The only conceivable reason why Pennoyer and Lotan should recommend Simon for the position ' is that if Simon is ap pointed, the dispatches say, he will re move to California and Oregon will . get rid of him. No, wo, the country does not want federal iudeee whose chief qualification is that they are smart and unscrupulous political .bosses, bnt Ore gon would be perfectly reconciled if Simon should go to California or Can ada. Hpn. W. Lair Hill is in Washington and reports from there indicate that he has the lead for the federal judgeship. Senator Allen appears to have dropped out of the fight and it is not considered likely that President Harrim would be guilty of the blunder, for blunder it would be, of appointing Joseph Simon. Simon is smart beyond question but his smartness lies in the direction of tricky and unscrupulous political bossism and that is poor material to make a judge out of. 1 The appointment of Simon would be met with a howl -of righteous indignation while that of Hill would meet with general approval by everyone who is acquainted with his eminent fit ness for the position. It is a safe prediction that the west wont get much from the present con gress in the way of appropriations. The alleged extravagance of the "billion dollar congress" will have the tendency to drive legislation to the opposite ex treme of penurionsness and to put off the necessities of the newer states with potato peelings and cheese parings. Besides, these newer states, whose necessities are greatest, are of little con sequence in . the matter of president making, wbcli will be the grand object of every important movement on the congressional checker-board. 1). 1. Thompson of Portland who at tended a large gathering of bankers that met at New Orleans a short time ago is reported to have said on his return, that although no vote was taken on the silver question, the majority of the bankers present were in favor of free coinage of silver. ThiB ought to prove that the "plutocrats" are not all anti-silver men as is frequently alleged. In good sooth the "plutocrats" are the very men who would gain by free coinage and the bankers and brokers and mine owners know it. Another meeting to raise funds for the Oregon exhibit at the world's fair was held in Portland-last Monday, but be yond the fact that it was-"unanimous" and had "considerable enthusiasm" no no great progress was in aue. ure iuuil-v 1 1 1 .. 1 1. tww.ltTan filtrUL HUB

The New - York Papers Predict as Usual. DEMOCRATIC FORCES MEET. Preparation Made for a Democratic Convention The Late Storm Was General. Washixgton, Dec. 8. When the house convened there was a large crowd present. At noon Clerk McPherson called that body to order and on motion of Holman the election of speaker was proceeded with. Holman placed in nomination Crisp, of Georgia. Henderson, of Illi nois, nominated Thomas B. Reed, which was followed by applause on the repub lican side. - Simpson, of Kansas, nomi nated Thomas U. Watson, of Georgia. A roll call i esul ted as follows: Crisp, 228; Reed, 83; Watson, 8. Mills and Springer were heartily applauded when they recorded their votes for Crisp; Crisp was declared duly elected speaker amid a storm of applause. The clerk then appointed Mills and Reed as a committee to escort the newly-elected speaker to the chair, an appointment that was received with applause, not un mixed with laughter. In a few mo ments Crisp entered with Mills and Reed supporting him on either side, and his march down the aisle was a perfect ovation, the democrats rising in a mass and giv'ng him cheer after cheer, and the republican members also rising. When quiet was again restored Crisp addressed the' house. The resolutions for appointment are as follows: Kerr for clerk, Yoderfor sergeant" tit "at'w'fcT"" burner IuT" door keeper, Dal ton as postmaster, and W. H. Milburn for chaplain. These resolu tions were agreed to and the officers were sworn in. Press Comments. New Yoek, Dec. 8. The following is the editorial comment of the morning papers on the choice of Crisp as speaker : Herald "The object of the contest ants has not been to elect a fitting and well eouinped Chairman Simple, but to push the claims of Cleveland or Hill, in the coming presidential campaign." World "The "Choice is significant of the doninenco of the prudent spirit in a great democratic majority." Times "The election of Crisp by a coalition of demagogy of Hill spoils the mongerizing of Tammany protectionism of Gorman tad Brice, half corrupt, half fanatical, free silver movement and the old south must inevetably give a pause to the men who believed the democratic party to be a fit instrumatelite for the accomplishment of a tariff reform, and for a clean and honest administration of government. Sun: "This result is a triumph for the conservative forces in the demo cratic party aud a kick at mugwumps. It mahes brighter prospects for electing a democratic president.

Want Congress to Close tbe Exposition on Sunday A Verdict for 811. OOO i)amRg-e. London. Dec. 10. The St. James Gazette in conmenting today on Presi dent Harrison's message says: "The most important point in the document is that, part which has reference to the result of the McKinley tariff. The figures presented," the Gazette declares, "compare significantly with British figures, which remain stationary. The calculations of the supporters of tiie Mc Kinley bill are working out much bet ter than any one in England exacted." 1 ne iitooe sarcastically comments uu the message, which it says was adroitly traced to catch the voter. The Globe disputes the statement made in themes sage that the prosperity of the United States is entirely due to the McKinley bill. On the contrary it says the pros perity of this country is the exceptional harvest there at the time when Europe is short of grain. A Few Kills Introduced. Washington, Dec. 10. Among the bills introduced into the senate today was one by Stewart to provide for the free coinage of gold and silver bullion. This bill was laid on the table, Stewart can call it up at any time. A bill to authorize the sale of mineral lands to aliens, to authorize the construction of a railroad in Alaska, and to amend the Chinese exclnsion act, to transfer tha revenue cutter service to the navy de partment, to punish officers for sum moning jurors with refereTlce to their political or religious affairs. A bill was introduced by Cullom to suspend the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States, also to reduce letter postage to one cent. And also providing for an income tax to pay pensions and to prevent the summary cancellation of pension certificates and to establish postal saving banks. By Wolcott to provide for the coinage at the branch mint of Denver, and to appoint a commission to devise a patent law and to amend the constitution so as to provide for the election of senators by the people. The Laying; of the Cable is Practicable. HosoLi'Li", Dec. 10. The United States steamer Albatross arrived here on the 21st inst. and is expected to re main in port about two weeks, when she will make a second survey on her return trip to San Francisco. Lieutenant Tanner states that there is no reason why, in his opinion, a cable could not be laid. There would be sev eral difficulties to overcome, but only such as are usual in laying deep sea cables. . The greatest depth reached was 3,100 fathoms, the ayerage depth being about 2,500. Want the Fair Closed Sunday. Washington, Dec. 10. Among the documents laid before the "senate and referred were the annual reports of the secietary of the treasury and many memorials asking legislation for closing the world's fair on Sunday.

A Serious Calamity. San Francisco, Dec. 10. The latest advices repert the loss of life by the late earthquake in Gifukeu, Japan, as 5,173 killed, 6,527 wounded, and over 45,000 houses demolished. Killed By an Explosion. Pittbhcrg, Dec. 10. By an explosion of hot metal at Lucy furnace this morn ing two men were . killed and three others seriously burned. The folly of banking too much on what politicians will do is well illustrated in the case of those tariff reform papers that "went their whole pile" on Mills for speaker and contended that his de feat would indicate an abandonment of thp true democratic position on the tariff question. What will these gentle men say now? The San Francisco Examiner prints a glaring lottery advertisement once or twice a month and to evade the postal law that prohibits lottery matter being carried through the maiia, distributes its paper by express on the days that it does so. ' v The Chronicle is the only paper in town that had sufficient enterprise to get the president's message by telegraph and give it out to the people from four teen to twenty hqurs before they could pee it through any other pourcn, ' The present session of congress will be a game of points and the party that mates the least number of mistakes will be the gainer. VAsin.GTOSta-bc. '.). The resident j today transmitted to congress bis annual I message. He begins by calling atten- I tion to the comprehensive reports of the j heads of the several executive depart- jments of the government, and continu ! ing on the same subject he says "Every branch of the state department accompanied by a request to be ad during the last vear has been character- ! viseil by ? ther or qualifying acts, in pos- . j , , , , , . session of the Chilian government that lzed by an unusual large number of im- misrht rPIWn thi- frZ rtV" " . portant negotiations, and by diplomatic ! results of a notable and highly beneficial ! character. Among these are the rscin j rocal trade arrangements which have been concluded with the republic of Brazil, with Spain for its AVcst Indian possession, and with San Domingo. Like negotiations with other coun tries have been much advanced and it is to he hoped that before the close of the year further definitive trade arrange ments of great value will be concluded. In view of the report which had been received as to the diminution of the seal herds in the Behring sea, 1 deemed it wise to propose to her majesty's govern ment i:i February last that an agree ment for a closed season should be made pending the negotiations for arbitration which then seemed to be approaching favorable conclusions after much cor respondence and many delays for whicl t his government woe not responsible, an agreement was reached 011 the 15th of June, by which Great Britain undertook from that date and until May 1, 1S92, to prohibit the killing of the seal by her majesty's subjects. The United States during tbe same period to enforce its existing prohibition against pelagic sealing and to limit the catch by the fur seal company upon the islands to 7,500 skins. The terms were satisfactory to this government, for the adjustment of the Behring sea controversy have been agreed upon and that agreement as to the arbitrators is all that is necessary to the completion of the convention. Concerning the question of boundary lines between the United States and foreign territory the president says : "I should have been glad to announce some favorable disposition of the boundary dispute between Great Britain and Ven ezuela, touching the western frontier of British Guiana, but the friendly efforts of the United States in that direction have thus far been unavailing. This government will continue to ex press its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachment on territory long under the administrative control of American states. The determination of a disputed boundary is easily attainable by amiable arbitration where the right of the respective parties rests, as here, on histrionic facts readily ascertainable. It is gratifying to be allowed to state that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria and France have opened thci'r ports to inspected American pork products. The removal of these restrictions in every instance was asked for and given solely on the ground that we had now Drovided a meat inspection that should be accepted as adequate to a complete removal of the dangers, real or fancied, which had been previously urged. The outlines of an agreement have been reached with Germany, looking to eauitable trade concessions in con sideration of the continued free trans portation of her sugars. The recent political disturbances in the republic of Brazil have excited our solicitude. This government did not fail to offer advice that- creat moder ation should be observed in the class of parties. The lynching at New Orleans in March last of eleven men of Italian na tivity bv a mob of citizens waa a most deplorable and discreditable incident, A demand was made bv the Italian min ister for the uunishment of the partici nanta bv indemnity to the families of those who were killed. It is to be re gretted that the manner in which these claims were presented was not such as to promote a calm aiscussion 01 tne question involved, and the temporary absence of a minister plenipotentiary at this camtal has retarded the further cor respondence : but it is not doubted that a friendly conclusion is attainable. Some suireestions growing out of this unhappy incident are worthy of the at tention "of congress. It would. I believe, be entirely compe tent for congress to make offenses against the treaty 'rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States, cogniz able in the federal courts. The president treats of the civil war in Chili at great length. "After the defeat of Balmaceda," says the message, "our minister was Directed to put him self in communication with the provi sional government so soon as it should have established a defacto character, which was done. During the pen dency of this civil contest frequent mdi rect a r Deal s were made to this govern ment to extend to the belligerents the right of insureents. This was declined, and that policy was pursued throughout which the government wnen wrencnea bv civil war so strenuously insisted UDon. after the part of the European nations. The Itata, on insurgent fleet, was seized under process of the United States court at San Diego, Calif., for a violation our neutrality laws, aud while in the custody of an officer of the court the vessel was forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It would have been inconsistent with the dignity and self-respect of this government not to have insisted that the Itata should be returned to San Digo to abide the judg ment of the court. A trial in the dis trict courts of the states for the southern district of California has recently re suited in a decision, holding among other things, that in as much as the congressional party had not been re organized as belligerent, the acts done in its interest could not be a violation of our neutrality laws. From this judg ment the United States has appealed. Ths Instructions to our naval officers and to our minister at Santiago from the first to the last of this struggle, enjoined upon them the most impartial treat uientand absolutenon-interfcrence. Iam satisfied that these instructions were ob served. No official complaint of the condition of our naval officers during the struggle has been presented to our government and it is a matter of regret that so many ot our people snouia have given ear to unofficial charges and complaints that manifestly had their origin in rival countries and a wish to pervert the relations of the United States with Chili. With the overthrow of the Balmaceda government he and many of his coun selors and officers became fugitives for their lives and appealed to the com manding officers of the foreign naval vessels in the harbor of Valparaiso and to the resident foreign ministers at San tiago for an asylum. This asylum was freely given to "the American minis- well as to his colleagues, acting under the impulse of humanity extended an asylum to the refugees whose lives were In peril. The treatment of our minister for a time was such as to call for a de cided protest and It was very gratifying to observe, that unfriendly measures, which were uudonbtedly "the result of the prevailing excitement, were at once rescinded or suitably relaxed. -On the 10th ol October a considerable niirq? her of the. snilora of the United States ottinmSli i i Halt4mkWt w& ro n can ), 1 rwl Iu' ! armei men nearly simultaneously in different . localities' in tha olty.

It is to be regretted that the reply of the secretary for foreign affairs of the provisional government was couched in an offensive tone. To this no response has been made. inis government is now awaiting the result of an investigation which has been coiiauctea iy tne criminal court at Val paraiso. It is reported unofficially that tne investigation is about completed, and the result will be soon communicated to this government together with some adequate and satisfactory response. If tne just expectations should be disap- jjuimcu ur mmier neeuiess aeiay inter v-ne. 1 will by special message bring this matter again to the attention of congress for such action as mav be necessary. Speaking of the refusal of the Chinese I government 10 receive Mr. uiair as j minister of the United States, the presi- I ! V, .,' YL 1 ecll0,n18ee'n8 torest legislation as on that of th r,irBnn j chosen, und which if admitted, would j practically bear the selection of any rep resentative as long as tne existing laws remain in force. Congress will lie called upon to consider the expediency of mak ing a special provision by law for the .temporary admission of some Chinese artisans and laborers in connection with the exhibit of Chinese industries at the1 approaching Columbian exposition. I regard as desirable that the Chinese ex hibit be facilitated in every proper way." The president favors closer relation with the Hawaiian government and says the surveys for the much needed sub marine cable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu arc in progress, and this enterprise should have the suitable promotion of the two governments. The surveys for the connecting links 01 the project of an inter-continental railway are in progress. Three surveying parties "are now in the field, and nearly one thousand miles of the proposed railways have been sur veyed. The reports bf the engineers are very satisfactory and show that no in surmountable obstacles have been met with. ' This government has found occasion to express in a friendly spirit but with much earnestness, to the government of the czar, its serious concern because of the harsh measures now being enforced against the Hebrews of Russia. The emigration of these people to the United States is largely increasing and is likely to assume proportions which may make it difficult to find homes and employment for them here, and to seri ously affect the labor market. It is es timated that over 1,000,000 will be forced from Russia within a few years. The Hebrew is never a beggar. It is also true that no race, sect or class has more fully cared for its own than the Hebrew race ; but the sudden transfer of such a multitude, under conditions that tend to strip them of their small accumulation, is neither good for them, nor for us. Of the Nicaragua canal the president says : "I deem it to be a matter of the highest concern to the United States that this canal connecting the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and giv ing us a short water communication be tween our ports upon these two great seas, should be speedily constructed and at the most practiabie limit ot cash. The gain of freights to the people, and bv this direct saving to the government of the United .States in the use of naval vessels, would pay tbe co9t of this work within a short series ot years, the sen ator from Alabama (Mr. Morgan? in his argument on this subject before the senate at the last session did not under estimate the importance of this work when he said: "The canal is the most important subject now connected with the commercial growth and progress of the United States. lo recommend the government promotion in the prosecu tion of a work, if other means offered for securing its completion, is of such trans cendent interest, that the government should in my opinion secure by direct appropriation trom its treasury, a guaranty of the bonds of the canal com pany to an amount necessary to the completion of the canal, which could, I think, be so given as not to involve any serious risk of ultimate loss. I am Etill of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing condi tions would disastrously affect our busi ness interests at home and abroad. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our own markets and in foreign trade the stamp gives no added value to the bullion contamsd in coins. Producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, cut thev should not tor- get that tbe government is now buying and pntting out of its market what is the equivalent ot the entire product of our silver mines, This is more than they themselves thought of asking a few years ago. I believe it is the earnest de sire of a great majority of the people, as it is mine, thata full' "coin use shall be made of silver just as soon as the co-op eration of other nations can be secured and a ratio fixed that will give circula tion equally to gold and silver. The business of the world divides the use of both metals but I do not see any prospect of gain, but much of loss, by giving up the present system in which a full use is made of gold, and a large use of silver, for one iu which silver alone will circulate, buch an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver agreement ; bi-metalism is the desired end -and the true friend of silver will be careful not to overrun the gold, and bring in silver monometalism with its necessary attendants.
