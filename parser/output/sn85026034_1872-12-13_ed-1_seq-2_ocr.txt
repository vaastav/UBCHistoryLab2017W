Tbe report of the Postmaster Gen eral U t Tery interesting document, m showing, by tbe increase of tbe business of tbe department, a cor responding increase in tbe mental condition ol tbe people. It seems from the report that there is a deficit of tome 12,000,000 ; or Ibat the De pattment falls by that amonnt to be elf snpportinff. Tbe re-exteneion of the postal system over tbe Southern States, where tbe cost of carrying tbe mails greatly exceeds the revenues received from the comparatively sparse population, is assigned as the cause of a large increase of expendi tures over receipts. The increase ot revenue for tbe year as compared with the" previous . yesr is 9.37 per cent., while tbe in crease in expenditures was 9.29 per cent Iff. Oeswell estimates that the postal matter sent out during the ear under the franks of members of .Congress, if paid for at the ordinary rates, would have yielded a revenue of three And a half millions of dollars, or a sum large enough to have made the Denartment self-supporting. lie m - - observes, in addition, that "great in convenience was experienced from derangement and delays in tbe reg nlar an J prompt transmission of tbe mails, caused by the immense amount of free matter thrown suddenly, and without notice or system, upon the postal routes of the country." The increase in the business of the Department for tbe year, as shown by tbe issue of postage stamps, newspa per wrappers, and so on, is worthy of note. The increase in postage stamps amounts to more than twelve bun dred thousand dollars' worth; in stamped envelopes to two hundred and thirty thousand dollars' worth-, and in newspaper wrappers to forty two thousand dollars' worth. The increase during tbe year in length ot routes was thirteen thousand miles of which eight thousand miles were in transportation! of mails by rail road. Tbe average cost of carriage by rail was about ten cents per mile and by other means of transportation about eleven cents per mile. Some curious figures are given as to the cost of mail bags, locks and keys. The total number of new bags put into use during the year was 77, 650, costing nearly one hundred thousand dollars. Five thousand locks were procured a cost of twenty-eight hundred collars, and tint thousand keys at a cost of eight hundred do'iars. The cost of repair ing mail-locks amounted to twelve hundnd dollars. Tbe total number of persons em ployed by the department is 44,056, being an increase of 701 over last year. If the telegraphs of the conn try be put under control of the de partment; as is now being agitated, the force will be increased to more than 100,000. Of this force tbe let ter carriers, numbering: about 1.40 0 and tbe aggregate of whose salaries does not exceed $32,003, perform very important work. During the year they delivered nearly fourteen and a half million mail letters, be sides six million local letters, and about four million of newspapers. They also collected two million cf letters. The figures of the Dead-Letter Of fice and of the Money-Order offices are very interesting ; the total num ber of letters received at the former office being four and a quarter mil ions, and the number of domestic money orders alone sent during tbe yesr amounting to forty eight and a half millions of dollars. O f the dead letters, more than forty five hundred and so addresses whatever. Dir. Creswell strongly supports the scheme of putting the telegraphs of the country under the control of tbe department. If at all practicable we should be glad to see accomplished. We hope, however, that it will re ceive tbe careful attention of Con gress before definite action is taken upon it Fkrdixasd's French Cleansing Powder cures the Herse Disease. Get it at W. L. Miller & Co's., Find Uy, O. - - Thk New York Tribune of last Thursday says: "President Grant did a graceful thing last night in declining to at tend a reception even In honor of his best friend alter the mournful rites of the day. After tbe luneral procession he took tbe evening train back to Washington. " We rejoice to record this confess ion of a disinterested motive on the part of the President by one of the journals which was most bitter in assailing him during the recent can. vass. Those journals who represented him to their readers as lacking the ordinary sensibilities of humanity, and as caring more for bull pups" than tbe conventionalities of life, will please make a note of this, and if a single truth among the torrent of falshoods, which they have bevped upon tbe President will not injure their reputation, we hope to see them give it a place in their columns, HuBEBs' the best place in town to buy your Christmas presents.

LETTER FROM MASSACHUSETTS. Correspondence Jeffersonian. ANDOVER, Mass., Dec. 3, 1873. Editor JiTF. Dear Sir: It occurs to me that perhaps a short letter from "Yankeedom" might be read with in terest by some of the friends of your paper. For the benefit of those fco can find interest in them, I will Fend you a few lines. I am now just twenty two miles from the "hub" of the Universe. I'll tell you confidentially that I've been there ; I've seen the "hub,'' and 1 know just how it works. I used to think, when people called Boston the "hub of the Universe," that they were joking. But I've learned better. I know now that it is the "hub," and everything turns around it. Of course a person can't realize this until he is in it. But once here and he sees it immediately. He will notice that when he is on one side of the city, the sun U in one direction, and when he goes to tho other side, it is in exactly the reverse direction, proving at once that Boston must be the "hub,'' aud that it goes round. You go down one street expecting to come outateomecf rtain place, and you generally do como out ; but it is very apt to be the same place you started in at. You see the thing goes round. Everything goes round. In tact, streets don't seem to any oth er way than round. I know its The Hub Setting aside tho "hub," I will say that Boston is the crooked est city I ever saw. There isn't anything straight in it. The streets wind around among each other like sheep paths in a wood. I shouldn't wonder it the late fire wouldn't have succeeded better, if it hadn't been for the crooked streets. It became confused in tho windings. If Boston is crooked, it still is a grand old city. What massive build ing. How beautiful, and really sub lime ! Her brown granite and white marble might well elicit the admira tion ot her citizens and visitors. I vis ited the ruins last Saturday. The fire is still burning in many places, and in somejocalities it will continue for some time yet. At one place a pile of leath er was burning, and burns with all the vigor of the richest coal. I think there was still enough leather there to furnish fuel to continue the burning for the next three or four weeks. The ruins are really an imposing sight. Fragmentary wails aud great high chimneys stand among the ruins like so many monuments ot departed grandeur. All that stands is brick, The granite and tbe marble were ground to powder in th jaws of the fire-fiend, and now lie upon the streets like heaps of sand. Among the ruins may now be 6cen a number of little board shanties that have been built for commerce, and in these trade is now carried on. Dig ging and hauling is going on pretty lively. Quite a cumber are preparing to build, and next Summer will doubt less be a busy time among the ruins. For a time the Boston calamity was the only theme of converse. But just now it is laid aside, and the death of Greeley takes its piece. All here mourn his loss. The only expressions are those of sorrow. Everybody now calls him a great and good man, and they wonder that we did not appre ciate him more. 1 believe that his political opponents are the loudest in their demonstrations of sorrow. But the philosopher is dead. Tho greatest American editor is no more. Slay he rest in peace. The question now is What will the electors do ? How will they vote ? This is tbe theme of speculation in all circles. Before this reaches you the subject will be settled. But what a grand thing it would be, if they would all vote for Grant. What could more shqw the nobility of the America Jco ple than this ? Thanksgiving, the gieatest of all New England's holidays, has just pass ed. The day ot baked beans, choc- late ana turkey, is gone, aud we are thrust back again to the old routine. Whilst the day lasted all was gay and festive. Everybody wore a holiday smile. And those with whom I had the pleasure of feasting had also holiday appetite, l took dinner at our Club. We had two fine large American bird served up. After we had served them, a voice from the dif ferent States was called tor. There were twelve at the table ; these rep resented nine States. Ohio alone had more than one representative, as four of our number hailed from the Back- eye State. In the Seminary here,Ohio stand second in representation, Mass achusselts alone being ahead of her. I guess that'll do to close on. Greet J. A. K. LETTER FROM MINNESOTA. Correspondence Jeffersonian. LAKE CARTER, MINN., Nov. 6, '72. Eds. Jeff: When I wrote to you last I bad no time to give you any de:ails concerning this Northwestern section of our country. Since in this State I have been radiating from St. Paul as a cor ter, and have visited various s actions, of this region. Went up tbe Minnesota Valley nearly as far West as the State line was North to Duloth, and visited the copper mines on Lake Superior, and was cut on the Northern Pacific RR., as far as the road is completed. Returned to Sl Peul the third time, went across the country to Stillwater, and escended tbe valley cl tbe St. Croix Returning again to the capital I came through the pineries of the North to Lake Itaska, with a party of engineers, whese object was to I ascertain tbe exact lauiuae aiiu longituds cf the head waters of the i-s:ssippi. We ntxt cam from the niMirce ri tue iuuBistu.jpi, West to Lake Carter, on a survey, and as soon as the work of the party will bo completed (eight or ten days) will return to St. Paul. This place is iu that section ot the State known as Pembina, , and iv has a rich soil. Nothing but oaU, wheat and potatoes raised.on account of tbe climate. The Norwegian element almost entirely prevails here, and bat for these hardy "cuwes,'' this section would be for ever the abode of tbe wild beasts of. the forest. A large portion of this State can never be brought under cultivation, f ully one-half can never be tilled on account of lakes, marshes nd severity of climate ; but a small proportion of the State is timbered, Except along tbe tributaries of tbe Mississippi, above the great falls, and scattering tracts of woodland of var ious sizes, there is no timber. Prob ably one-twentieth of the State is J timber land. Immense pineries are found in the regions cf the Upper Mississippi. The pine trees are cut down during the Winter, hauled on the ice of the river, and when Spring comes they are floated down to St Anthony Falls an 1 are then cut into all the different shaped pieces of wo al iiiil faw mills can imagine. I have not Leinl cf tbe result of the pre&idenial content. No news by mail have reacted us tince wsi Ief St. PauL I a a ignorant as to the contest between Foster and Sione. We have ha 1 an unususlly warm Fall here It is severely cold at present, but till within a fe days ago the most plraiant Indian Sum mcr baa prevailed. The air is so pure and healthful. It is entirely free from ciiaema, and we never have that cold chilly, damp atmosphere so frequent in Northern Oiiio. Water docs not stagnate. It remains pure in the lake all Summer. Of t'jese there are a vast number in this State. It is said that 10,000 beautiful t-hining lakes dot this State. Their shores are gencraly pebbly and surrounded with beautiful groves of shady trei s. They abound in fhh cf great variety which can be caught the year round. Tbe scenery is grand. The atmos phere so pure, reflective and brilliant, will allow individual objects to be seen at a great distance. It would astonish the gaze of any one to be transplanted from Ohio here. I spent part cf 'C6, '67 and '68 here, aud was well posted concerning matters before I came this tifp. CLIMATE. The climate is severe, but ore will suffer less with cold here tl.i'a in Ohio. Winter is six montus in length. Summer is of but a few months duration: but very Lot. My health is good. I hae im proved wonderfully. We livrs on deer meat, elk, b.ar and fhii, as but little else is to be had, save a chunk of bread, now end then. We arc 200 miles from the outskirts of civiliza tion, Lut as they buil.l railroads to carry a way the agricultural produc tions of generations nnborn, we csn ride a great part of this 200 miles on the cats. I hope this ill find you well and enjoying the good will, respect and esteem of the citizens ol 11 uncock county. J. O. K. NEW YORK TRIBUNE. 1873. Now, aa heretofore, The Tribune strives to be first cf all and preemi nently a news paper. France a Republic England and Germany gradually permeated with Republican ideas Spain swaying in the nerveless grasp of a ruler too good for a King and too weak for a Republican, who is unable to govern the great island that blocks the en trance to our Gulf of Mexico, and equally unable to give it up the German speaking peoples agitated by a new Protestanism, separating from the See of Rome on the dogma of Papal Infallibility and assuming to recognize the "Old Catholics" the whole Continent pervaded by tbe in tellectual ferment that comes ot the conflict between old ideas, philoso phical, theological, material, and the advances of Physical Science Rus sia and Great Britain running a race for the final gains that shall deter mine Asiatic supremacy China seem ing ready to abandon her advances and reclose her half-opened gates Japan abolishing feudalism and in viting Western civilization to irradi ate Western commerce to enrich her long-hidden empire such are phases ct the news from abroad which the mtila over all Continents and the wires under all Seus are daily bear ing to us.

At home the struggle for Freedom seems over. The Ian slave baa Ion bet n a citizen ; the last coposition to emancipation, enfranchisement, cq'ial civil rights, has been formally aban d )iied No party, Ncrtb or South longer disputes the result ct tLe War lor ihe Ution; all declare that these results must never be undone ; and with a whole people thus united on tbe grand platform of All Rights for All, where to cur bloody struggle, and tbe prolonged civil contests that followed, have led us, the Republic closes the records or the lutter, bate ful Past, and turns peacefully, hope I ully, to the less alarming because less vital proM ms of the Future.

But as to its own political punci pies, Tub Tribune is, of course, hereafter as heretofore, the-cbampiu of Equal Rights, irrespective cf Race, N ativity, or Coier. It stands mnexi bly by the Amendments for the per manent security of those Rights. which have been solemnly incorncrat ed by tbe people in tbe Constitution ot the United States. Independent of all political parlies, it endeavors to treat them all with judicial fair ness. It labors to purify the a 1 ministration of tbe Government, Na tional, State, and Municipal, srnl whenever those in authority, whelhe in National, Stale, or Municipal at lairs, tase tne lead in this woik ill therein give tbrm its conlia support. But it ctn never be the servitor of any political party ; nor will it surrender or even waive its right to criticise and conaemn hat is wrong, and commend what is right in the action ot any parties or oi any puouc men.

It devotes a large ehare of its col umns to Agriculture as the most es sential and general of human pur suits It employs the ablest and most succe&slul cultivators to set forth in brief, clear essays their prac tical views of the Farmer's work. It reports public discussions which elucidate that work; gathers from every source agricultural news, the reports of the latest experiments, the dp He not stories of the latest successes and failures, and whatever may tend at once to better Agriculture, and tj commend it as the first and most im portant of progressive Arts, based on natural science . There are hundreds of thousands engaged in diverse pursuits who own or rent a "place," and give some portion of their time to its culture and improvement. Tub WsextT Tkibune shows them how to makj the most of their roods and their hoars, both by direction and exsm pie. No information equal in quality or quantity can be elsewhere obtained for the price of this journal. The Wskkxy Tribuxk appeals si so to Teachers, Students, and per sons of inquiring minds, by tLe characters ot its Literary contests, which include reviews of all tbe works proceeding from tbe master minus of the Old or of the New World, with liberal extracts fron those of especial interest. Imaginative Literature al so claims attention, but in a subor dinate degree. "Home IntsresU" are discussed weekly by a lady specially qualified to instruct and interest her own sex, and tbe younger portion of the other. No column ii more eagerly sought or perused with greater average profit than heis.
