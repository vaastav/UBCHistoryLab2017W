Construction of Certain Provisions of Hay-Panncefote Pact Debated in Senate Mr. Bacon of Georgia Holds That the Construction of Fortifications by the United States Along the Proposed Xic- araguan Canal .Would Be Tantamount to an Act of War. AGREE TO CONSIDER AND VOTE Washington. Dec 12. The Senate agreed to-day to take a vote before adjournment on "Monday on the new Hay-Panncefote treaty for the abrogation of the Clayton Bulwer treaty, and opening the way for the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama by the United States. This agreement was reached after four hours of debate sufficiently Interesting to Insure the constant attendance of most of the Senators. Senator Spooner. who was' one of the principal speakers of the day. had Just con- ,-ii.,i v..n c .. t. .

Will Reach m Tote oa Monday. The agreement provides for an adjourn ment of the Senate from to-day until Mon day, and for a meeting at 11 o'clock on that day, one hour In advance of the usual time. The understanding is that as soon as prac ticable after the Senate convenes. Senator Lodge shall move an executive session, and that the treaty shall have the entire at tention of the Senate until a final vote is reached, before the adjournment for that day. The principal speakers to-day, besides Sen ator Spooner, were Senator Money and Sen ator Foraker. Mr. Money, while finding much In the treaty to criticise, said that as he found the fortunes of the proposed canal across the Isthmus inextricably in tertwined with the treaty, he could not see his way clear to do anything that would prevent, or even delay, ratification. The particular features of the new treaty with which he found fault were those retaining the neutrality provision of the Clayton-Bulwer convention, and speci fying police control of the canal when built. He argued that the effect of these provis ions inevitably must be to' limit and pre scribe the power of the United States to control its own property in case of war. Every Objection Had Beea Met. Senator Foraker maintained that provis ions of the new treaty meet every objec tion made to the original Hay-Pauncefote treaty, and cover every essential thing that was Included in the amendments made by the Senate to that document. He regarded It as of the utmost importance that tho Clayton-Bubxer treaty should be wiped out. This result was effected by the convention under consideration. He asserted that ail rights of the United States were amply pro tected under this treaty, and that our ab solute and complete control of the canal could not be questioned by Great Britain or any other Power. Mr. Fbraker's speech dealt largely with the legal construction and the general ef fect of the treaty. He said that, after a careful study of Its provision", he was firmly convinced that it could be honestly supported by every patriotic citizen. Senator Foraker was frequently interrupt ed by Senator Bacon. In tne course of one of these Interruptions Mr. Bacon asked if it was not true that under the terms of the treaty the construction of fortifications by the United States would be an act of war. Mr. Foraker replied In the negative, de claring that not only would such an act not be an act of hostility, but that to build fortifications in case of necessity was one of the Inherent rights of the Government. Bacon aaa Foraker Clash. To. this Mr. Bacon responded that he, for one, could never bring himself to vote for the ratification of the treaty with the un derstanding that his Government was to violate it. Mr. Foraker retorted sharply to the effect that his friend from Georgia could be no more virtuous along the line of main taining the 'country's honor in the matter of keeping its agreements with other nations than were otner senators, sir. Bacon re plied that he bad not meant to assume a virtue that he did not possess, nor to im ply that other Senators were not as Jealous of th country's good name as he himself. Mr. Foraker then declared that he had not meant to charge Mr. Bacon with an unfair BITTER ATTACK ON CANAL COMPANY'S AGENT Senator Morgan Accuses President; Hutin of Writing a Letter Con taining Perversions of Facts in Order to Delay Canal Bill. Washington. Dec 12. The Senate Com mittee on Isthmian Canal to-day author ized a favorable report upon Senator Mor gan's bill providing for the acquisition from Nicaragua and Costa Rica of the right-of-way via the Nicaragua route. Senator Morgan's report deal, with many questions connected with the con struction of the canal, including a thorough inquiry into the attitude of Great Britain upon the subject, and the different canal routes. He also discusses the relationship of the Fan-American Canal Company to the construction by the United States of a waterway across the Isthmus, and while he makes reference to a letter written by President Hutin of the Panama company to Secretary of State Hay. he does not give the text of the communication. Mr. Morgan say. that the letter to Sec retary Hay was dated November S last, and that It was written after Admiral Wal ker, as president of the commission, had closed his correspondence with M. Hutin relaUng to the sale of the Panama Canal. He then adds: Perversion f Fads. The letter to Mr. Hay. with the ap pendices thereto, and the memoranda that accompany it. Is an attack on the presi dent of the commission, replete with false assumptions and perversions of fact, and is evlaenUy intended to create a slfle issue, the -debate upon which It ts hoped by M.

CONVENTION NEXT MONDAY. assumption, but simply to say that, like all other Senators sirpportlng the treaty, he felt he was giving his name to a transaction which would be honorably carried out be tween nations. Rlaht to Fortify the Canal. Senator Spooner. who followed, also was frequently interrupted by Senatora on the Democratic side. One of the first Inter ruptions came from Senator Bacon, and nerfulned In the rlht tn fortifv the Canal. Replying to this Inquiry, Mr. Spooner said that It was a well-known principle of inter national law that all treaties, like all stat iit must b tmiI together, and he con tended In this connection that the Clayton- corsldered as one series. The Clayton-Bulwer agreement had pro vided that there should be no fortifications of the canal, and the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of the Fifty-sixth Congress had car ried a similar provision, but the new treaty struck out the entire fortifications provision, .clearly showing that England, after con tending for a half century against fortifica tions, had waived that provision, thus prac tically conceding our right to fortify tha proposed canal. Tillman and Bailey Want to Know. Questions were asked by Senators Till man and Bailey concerning the riht of the United StatM to liincki'le the canal, and In reply Senator Spocne.- ifflfted that tho Government of the Unite 1 State, could not be bound by a treaty a?r-janent which would prevent this country's defending Its own property, n .is own v.iy. in time of war. Senator Tillman pressed thy inquiry somewhat, and he and Mr. Spooner en gaged in a somewhat spirited colloquy, which, as usual with them, ended good-naturedly. A very Important question was raised by a number of Senators on the Democratic side as to the right of the United States to give differential rates to vessels engaged in our coastwise trade. This matter brought other Senators from the Republican side of the chamber into the controversy. Sena tors Perkins and Nelson were among those who contributed to this feature of the con troversy. Senator Nelson Insisted that under exist ing law the United States would have a per fect right to give to the coastwise trade of this country any benefit it might see prop er In the use of the canal. It was perfectly well understood, he said, that the shlpa of a foreign nation could not do a coastwise business, and Great Britain had made the treaty with the full knowledge of this fact. Would Acqnlre Certain Rights. Senator Perkins made the assertion that by the acquisition or control of a strip of territory through which the canal would pass the United States would acquire rights wnlcn woum suoject mat territory to our coastwise laws, ahd said foreign bottoms could not trade between ports of the Uni ted '- and any portion of the terrltory through which the canal was built. This view was combated to a certain extent by Senators Tillman and Bacon, the former In timating that If that were true relative to the United Stat Great Britain, on ac count of her Canadian possessions and Mexico, both extending from ocean to ocea- also could contend for similar privi leges. This, he thought, also Would be true of ar South American country whose ter ritory extends from ocean to ocean. Senator Spooner was decidedly of a con trary opinion, and insisted that these coun tries did not acqre any rights of a coastwise-trade character along the route of the proposed canal, which territory was unier the control nf or which might be ceded to the United States. The mere fact that Ca nadian or Mexican territory cxtpns from ocean to ocean would not give them the light to make demands for tha generosity or business foresight of the United Staces. Senator Spooner also contended that the United States would have a rigUt to con trol the caial after their o.wi in.inner" din ing any war to which this couiurv might be a party. Senator Mason interjected that treaty agreements never bind a nation to the ex unction of its military rights and duties. Senator Spoorcr assented to this, anil said that no matter what might be the priu slons of the treaty, the nation could not 1)5 accused of dishonor or Immorality If Its terms were broken In defense of Its own ex istence. REPUBLICANS TO TAKE CARE OF TWO OUTCAST SENATORS. Washington, Dec 12. The Demo- cratic leaders cf the Senate have no- tilled the Republicans that the mi- ncrity does not feel called upon to provide committee places for either Senator McLaurln or Wellington. It is understood that the Republican n "hers of the committee will as- sign those members to committee places. precedented misconduct must be either that this canal company Is desperate in Its pur pose to unload its property upon the Uni ted States because the French stockholders have lost faith In its success, or that it is endeavoring to prevent the competition of any canal with Its Panama Railroad, the shares of which they value at 1500, the face value being $100 per share, on account of Its enormous earnings." Contending for the importance of the en terprise. Senator Morgan urges that no nation nor any combination of private in terests can have any right to prevent its consummation. There remains," he said, "but one bar rier to the union or the Atlantic and Pa cific oceans, and no one nation has the right to declare that it never shall be re moved, except with its consent." He attributes the failure to construct the canal in the past to the attitude of other nations, saying: Great Britain- Coarse. "For the past fifty years the power and irfluence of the British Government, aided by combinations tn the United States and France, have defeated all efforts to open an Isthmian canal." He contends that Great Britain's policy from the beginning was, simply a policy of delay, and that when both .Powers have abandoned the policy of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, of which, he declares, nothing re mains "but an empty diplomatic technical ity, that must yield to the reasonable de mands of the United States. Nicaragua and Costa Rica, for their own safety and pros perity, and to the demands of the world for a gateway In Nicaragua to correspond with that opened at Sues." He declares that if diplomatic effort to rid the world of the baneful domination of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty falls. Congress should abrogate It. COSFIRMATIOSS BT THE SENATE. Cnarles H.

The President made the statement to a delegation of New Mexico people who called upon him In the Interest of Garrett. This delegation included Sclomon Luna, National Commltteemanv for New Mexico; Delegate Rodey, Frank A. Hubbell, Thomas S. Hubbell and Judge A. B. Fall. As Sheriff of Dona Ana County, N. M., Garrett had to build a reputation. He did and became one of the quickest men with a "gun" In that section. "Billy the Kid" was only one of many bandits that fell to Garrett's aim and in nearly every Instance it was a case or getting the drop first. The Sheriff discounted even that when he put. a bullet Into the heart of a bad man and hone thief named Greenfeldt who had a pis tol aimed at him. Manuel Sanchez, a Mexican murderer, and four of his band. Barfoot. the "scourge of the Seven Rivers." and the Lemon brothers were among those whose wicked careers were abruptly terminated by Garrett.

GALL LOANS TOUCH TWELVE PER GENT. Highest Money Rate of the Year Causes Holders of Stocks on Margins to Sell Freely. JtEPTJBLJC SPECIAL New York, Dec. 12. Interest in Wall street to-day converged upon the money market. Call loans touched 12 per cent and large loans were made at 10 per cent. The prevailing rate, however, was 9 per cent. After the urgent demands were supplied the rate declined to 3 per cent, but ran up again to 6 per cent at the close. With the money rate at 12 per cent to day, tho highest of the year, holders of stocks on margin saw wisdom in selling them, which they did on such a large scale and with such evident desire to get rid of them that the entire market was upset for a time. Prices for active shares declined from 2 to 4 per cent. The weakest period was In the morning. There were rallies from the first slump, but tho closing prices indicate some heavy losses for the day. The trouble grew out of the fact that the bnnk3 to-day refused to loan money at the rates which they have been demanding recently. After yesterday's experience with a 10 per cent rate, it was found ad visable to contract some of their loans. This is a process that Wall street always stands in fear of. and which generally re sults in a stock-market slump. The fact that $500,000 was engaged for ex port to Brazil aided the alarm over money rates. Pools Let Go, Canslns: Slnxap. Recently there have been several pools formed in certain stocks, such as New Tork Central and Manhattan.
