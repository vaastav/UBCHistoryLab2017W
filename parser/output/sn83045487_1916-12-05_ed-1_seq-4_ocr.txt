I PRESIDENT ASKS IMMEDIATE ACTION TO SETTLE RAIL TROUBLES Washington, Dec. 5. Declaring the country "cannot and shoyld not consent to remain any lodger expos ed to profound industrial disturb ances," President Wilson appeared before a joint session of congress to day and appealed for immediate action on his program of "settlement and regulation of. difficulties" be tween the railroads and their train men. Statement of the need of such leg islation occupied the bulk of his an nual message, the shortest one he has delivered. It recommended pas sage of the provisions included, but not acted upon in his last special ap peal last August The thrill and dramatic tension so noticeable in the president's three previous visits to the 64th congress were lacking today. Although both branches of con gress are seething over the high cost of living problem and interest in this has overshadowed all other proposed action, the president made no refer ence to it today. He is receiving re ports from different executive.depart ments, however, in an effort to devise the best possible plan for the curbing of soaring prices. It is believed the president will either deliver a special message on the question later or take it up per sonally with the House and Senate leaders when a plan he deems feas ible has been found. o o 

HIGH SPOTS OF PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE "Consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the public dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then exist ed, and whjch still unhappily con tinue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors and train men." "I recommend" immediate enlarge ment and administrative reorganiza tion of the interstate commef ce com mission." "I recommend explicit approval by congress of the consideration by the interstate commerce commission of fj an increase of freight rates to meet 1 J such additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day. should the facts disclosed justify the increase." Executive 'power to control and; operate the railways "when neces sary in time of war or other public" necessity" is asked.' v "The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer ex- t posed to profound industrial disturb ances for lack 'of additional means of arbitration and conciliation which congress 'can easily and promptly supply." ' "I would hesitate to recommend that any man in any occu pation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he desired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before . receiving the approval of society in doing scr would be to adopt a new principle into our jurisprudence , which I take it for granted-we are. not prepared to introduce." "But the proposal that the opera tion of tne railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted action of organized bodies of men until a public investi gation shall - have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of L the opinion of the" nation is not to nropose any such principle. It is , based upon the very different prin- x ciple that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men' shall not be permitted to stop the industrial pro-' cesses of the nation, at any rate be i J.
