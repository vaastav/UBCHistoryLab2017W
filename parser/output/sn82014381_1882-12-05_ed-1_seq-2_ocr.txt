ARABI'S SENTENCE. Arabi Pasha haa escaped with a sentence of banishment, which, under the circum stances, is almost equivalent to a free pardon. This termination at his trial appears to have been largely caused by the embarrassment into which the English Government had been forced by its anomalous position in regard to the prisoner. It is, however, very ques tionable whether the Khedive's method V ould not have been the best. The Egypt ians will not understand the clemency ex hibited, or else they will understand it too well. The truth appears to be that the trial could not have been carried on pub licly without producing developments which would have injured the Sultan and X hedive. It is true that no consideration of this kind ought to have interfered, be cauße the Sultan and the Khedive are both distinguished humbugs, who are quite incapable of doing anything which is not inherently discreditable. Bat Eng land has for a long time thought it neces sary for the protection of her interests to make-believe that these Asiatic im postors were respectable rulers, and she is not willing to have the "seamy side" of her foreign policy exposed to all the world. So it was found necessary to let Arabi off lightly, and be, who is as big a blackguard as either the Sultan or Khedive, and would cat either of their throats cheerfully if he saw any profit to himself in the operation, will now go to Europe, and probably be lionieed for a eeason, and then proceed to intrigue and cabal against the Egyptian Government. It would have been much better to let the Khedivo deal with him. Wk knew it would come, as soon as the announce ment was made that Mrs. Langtry was to visit America — a Langtry costume, or hat, or jacket, or collar, or glove, perhaps all, would be in (union.

The President's Message, which we pub lish this morning, is a basinets-like docu ment, md crammed with references, sugges tions, and more positive recommendationi, in regard to a great number of subjects. It | illuatrateß, as inueed every document of I the kind must do more and more, the rap illy increasing Ecnpe and complexity of the Government of the United States. In fact, Presidential messages in these days are becoming recapitulations of the reports of the heads of departments more than anything else, aod they are cumbrous because of the extent of the ground they have to cover. A mere glance at the sub jects treated of in this message will indi cate its heterogeneous contents. It begins with the assnrance that cur foreign rela tions are on a satisfactory basis. It refers to the Nicaragua canal question and the Clayton-Bulwer treaty ; states that remon strances addressed to the liuseian Govern ment regarding the persecution of the Jews have been received courteously ; suggests that more power be given the Executive to deal with propositions for International Conferences on various matters ; speaks of trouble with Spain about consular fees ; states that Germany hes invited the United States to take part in an Exhibition next year, and refers the matter to Congress ; pays a pasting tribute to the late United States Minister, G. P. Marsh ; Btates that the Swiss Government has taken steps to prevent the emigration to this country of pauperß and criminals ; gives Congre.s a mild reminder tbat it is time the Japanese Indemnity matter was settled : refers to the Chinese claim for transit through the country under the new law, and indicates a belief that they ahould not be excluded ; briefly discusses the Hawaiian Treaty, with hints looking towards ita modification ; commends the Mexican Boundary question to Congress, and proposes a Commission to deal with it ; reviews the Chile-Peruvian war, and expresses the opinion that owing to the obstinacy of the Chilean Govern ment it is useless for the United States to attempt any further intercession ; politely pooh-poohß Mr. Blame's Peace Congress ; suggests legislation to harmonize the United States with other nations in regard to rules for collisions at sea, and for an agreement upon eomo general method de termining the latitude and longitude, and regulating time ; approves the proposition for putting all diplomatic officers upon salaries and covering fees into the treasury; and so forth, almost ad infinitum. Of the more weighty and interesting matters which are topics of general die cussion the President has also something to say. He agrees with the Secretary of the Treasary in recommending a considera ble reduction of revenues. He is in favor of abolishing all internal revenue taxes ex cept those oa distilled spirits, malt liquors and tobacco, which would cut off about 5J0.000.000, and leave about * ( .»5, 000, 000 of revenue. He urges the necessity of re vising the tariff, and, though he disclaims any desire to do away with protective du ties, he thinks the moreartbles can be put on the free list the better it will be. He calls attention to the s.lver coinage, recommend ing its suspension. He discusses the iiuan cial question, coinciding with Secretary Folger in deprecating the too rapid liquida tion of the public debt, and pointing out the dangers which must arise if our immense surplus continues to bo raised, and a considerable part of it is applied to this work. His views on these two ques tions arc conservative and judicious, and indicate personal examination of it. In regard to the tariff, he somewhat curiously thinks Congress will derive enlightenment from the labors of the Tariff Commission. This shows that the President is of a very sanguine and confiding nature. His own views, however, are such as Congress could very well afford to accept as its guide in the premises, for he is emphatic in behalf of a thorough revision and a very considerable reduction of duties. We judge from his representations in this re gard that President Arthur is well fitted to become an active member of the Cobden Club, if he does not already belong to that institution. In referring to the report of the Secre tary of War, he speaks of the urgent need for better fortifications on the Pacific, char acterizing those now existing as utterly useless, and expressing a hope that Con gress will attend to this important matter. Some space is given to the question of the retirement of army officers, whicn is evi dently a tangled subject, and it is recom mended that more attention be paid to the arming of the State militia. Tae river and harbor appropriation bill affords him an opportunity to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution, allowing the Executive to veto separate items in ap propriation bills, in accordance with the principle already incorporated into fourteen State Constitutions, among which that of California is numbered. This is certainly a very judicious proposal, and it is clear that if adopted it will have a most whole some deterrent fiiect, and enable the Presi dent to nip many a flagrant job in the bud. The paragraphs relating to the Navy are somewhat melancholy. The President evidently feels that there is wry little to be said on this aubject, and he refers al most sarcastically to " such vessels as we "possess." In connection with this he discusses the decline of our mercantile marine, but his ideas en that matter do not appear to have been thoroughly digested. He however recommends the reconstruction of the Navy in conformity ! with the proposals of the Advisory Board. Hia review of the Postal Department ia made the vehicle for an argument in favor of the redaction of domestic letter postage. He urges this measure with a good deal of enthusiasm, and refers to the experience of England to show that it is certain to pay. The Postal service in fact is already be coming a paying institution, and in a few years, at the present rate of progress, will return a large revenue. The views of the President upon Civil Service reform w ill be received with satisfaction by tha country generally. He takes bold and positive grouuJ on behalf of reform, and expresses himself in the clearest manner. He de clares himself in favor of abolition of the spoils system, establishment of genuine competition, permanence of tenure, and the extinction of ciEciai patronage altogether. He says that experience has convinced him of the necessity of relieving the Executive from the intolerable burden of appoint ment making. In fact he speaki on this subject as every President since Lincoln has spoken. On the subject of Political Assessments he is equally frank and thor ough-going. He is for the abolition of the system, and he admits the troth of all that has been urged against it. It is perhaps unnecessary to inquire whether the recent elections have had anything to do with the positiveness of the President's expressions on these topics. It is enough to know that he has by this last message committed him self fairly and fully to the approval of the most sweeping reforms that Congress can be eot to p»". Oi the Tinrp imwwlautfcl question*, therefore, that is to say, the tariff, finance, coinage, civil service reform, a id political assessments, the President has placed himself fully abreast of the most ad vanced thought of the time, and if Con gress is only able and willing to follow him in this intrepid policy there n no telling \ what reaction it may not eet ap. 

FOUL PLAY. The American clipper ship Joseph S. Pinney, from Havre to San Francisco, in ballast, had a strange experience while on her way out. Oa sounding the pumps one morning in the North Atlantic, she was found to be making water fast. All hands were sent to the pumps, and after working through the night the water in the hold was so reduced that it became possible to make an examination. And then it was discovered that a deliberate attempt had been made to scuttle the ship. Three auger holes had been bored in the bows, and the author of the mischief had care fully plugged the holes through the skin, bo that it should not be possible to detect what had been done until it was too late. Oi course the discovery of the leak saved the Bhip, for it waa easily stopped. But all the Captain's efforts to find oat who committed the crime proved fruitless. It waß a horrible deed, and especially bo be cause the Captain's wife and family were on board. The case recalls Charles l^ade'a Btory " Foul Play," in which the mate of the vessel plays exactly the same trick, but is more Buccossful. In this instance, however, it is diffi;ult to asekn a motive for the crime, and it mußt be remembered that the man who committed it took his chances of going to the bottom with the ship, or of undergoing all the sufferings which shipwrecked people are exposed to. It seems very improbable that the criminal will be discovered cow that the crew have I all dispersed, but the man who could do I such a thing must certainly be a very sin gular kind of scoundrel.

San Johe, December 4th. — This afternoon at 2 o'clock tho large frame warehouse near the S )utheru Pacific Iliilroad depot, owned by Berry k Evans, of tbij city, containing; absjut 1,!)00 tons of hay, was, together with its contents, totally destroyed by tire. The hay wa§ valued at $lti per ton, and wa« in sured at $10 per ton to tho amount of SlB, --509, including §2,000 on the building. The I insurance is divided between more than a dczen companies, none carrying more than 81,000. Owing to the distance from water the fire department did not go i:.t > Bervice.
