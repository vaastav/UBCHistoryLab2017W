JAMES," said Gerry Talbot sudden ly, looking up from the letter he had just received, "you needn't mind about the rest The dinner will not come off, after all." The decorated end of the big, sumptu ous studio looked oddly distasteful to Gerry Talbot since the reading of Miss Wakefield's telegram, which had shat tered his enthusiastic plans. He had in vited her—and her brother and his wife —to a Christmas studio dinner which he meant to make as festive as possible. Of course, her rejection at the last hour had been a gentle invention prepared to *vert a greater disappointment, for he had let her know unmistakably how it was with him, and he had been so hope ful of success that he had selected a ring for her Christmas gift—a little gold en circlet set with a clear white soli taire. The streets were thronged with bust ling Christmas shoppers, glad of heart, with merry, expectant faces, and here and there a wistful one, too, looking on, tut not buying. Talbot noticed two lit tle girls gazing wistfully into a confec tioner's window. "Yes, Min, I would. I'd do It fust thing," said the taller of the two. "Oh, my, wouldn't it be nice to be rich an' invite all your friends to a big turkey an' ice cream dinner!" They were very poorly clad, thin featured and ill-nourished, but not un pleasant to look at. Talbot was con scious, all at once, of an inexplicable impulse to gratify the child's wish. "So you would really like to give your friends a Christmas dinner!" said he, smiling down at her astonished eyes. "1 have a great mind to let you have your wish." "Oh. dear me. Min!" gasped Lou. "I can't hardly believe it, can you? It sounds just like a make-believe thing. Won't Mis' I'osey be s'prised! A::' Jonas an' Meg an' Tom. Oh, won't they be jest too pleased!" "How many shall you invite?" Talbot asked gravely, taking out his notebook. "Well, there's Aunt Katie an' Uncle Tim an' the baby.* Mis' Posey, Jonas Hoggs. Meg an' Pat Fooley—Min, can you think of anyone else?" "Lame Betsy an' Moll." "How many's that?" asked Lou. "Twelve, counting us three." "Don't you think it would be nice to have a little present beside each plate?" asked Talbot. Both girls gasped, but looked immense ly pleased. "Suppose you two go round with me and pick out what you consider suitable for each of your guests, because 1 should not know what to select." W hen Lou appeared at the studio on the following morning she was a very different looking girl, and any one would have known by the pure joy of her voice that some great and festive event was at hand. Talbot had finished the decorations which had been so harshly interrupted by Miss Wakefield's mes sage, and the result was extremely grat ifying. especially after Lou's rapturous acclamations. At precisely 12 o'clock the bell rang f' r the first time to announce the ar rival of Aunt Katie and Tim and the baby, all polished and prinked t«> the verge of painfulness. Next came Mis' Posey, a little, fa led, bowed, ancient woman in rusty black, with long gold loops in her wrinkled ears. Lame Betty thumped in on her crutches, closely tal lowed by Moll, in borrowed finery, of va rious sizes. Meg brought blind Julias, and a merry little wraith of a man called Tom Doom. Talbot shook hands all around with a "Merry Christmas!" after which they ail took their places at the beautiful tthlt, the like of which none ef that humble party had ever looked upon. But it was a kindly madness that possessed the host of that bountiful dinuer, for his stories were of the pleasantest and his watchful care was unflagging. His guests rewarded his efforts by a sponta neous enjoyment of all that was set be fore them. It was good to see them wait upon blind Jonas, who could not help himself, and upon lame Betty, whose crippled hands made difficult the use of knife and fork. Talbot rose to replenish a half-emptied plate as the hall bell thrilied merrily. There was a pause; then James' quiet, well-trained voice said: "Yes, madam; he is at dinuer in the studio." The door swung inward. Talbot knew that he was not dreaming when she came toward him with outstretched hands and a ripple of explanation of which he heard not one word. ludeed. to him one isolated fact filled the world —that she was smiling up at him with a great promise in her eyes. "A little friend of mine wanted to give her friends a Christmas dinner, and I persuaded her to let me share it," he explained jauntily. "It has been a great treat to me." Miss Wakefield read the whole truth for herself as she looked into the good, homely faces that reflected their host's praises in every glance. She said noth ing, but her eyes told what Talbot would have given all he possessed to hear from her lips. Then Mr. Wakefield and his wife ventured in. and Talbot bethought himself to ask if they hi:d Jined, which they had not. Lou and Talbot made room for three plates here and there, and as there was a plenty of crullers and turkey and icet cream, all went well to the very end of the function, when the eleven originally invited gzuests rose and made their adieus with glad hearts and beaming faces. Miss Wakefield before the grate while her brother and his wife examined a row of pictures half hidden behind the holly wreaths. "I was so sorry to disappoint you yes terday," she said, "but poor Ted's tele gram was so urgent that we were afraid he was worse, and hadn't the heart to refuse him. When I discovered that we could take an early train home I made up my mind to run in and wish you a Merry Christmas, anyway, and so we came, you see." Talbot thought of the ring. He had taken it from its hiding place. "For a long while I have wanted to ask yon to accept this —and what goes with it," he said simply, holding the glittering bauble toward her. A red glow crept into her face. She made no audible answer, but when the young couple at the other end of the room sauntered toward them they were smiling. 

CHRISTMAS TREE FIRES. How the Danger of Parlor Co-iflagra* tions May He Minimized. Several accidents on Christmas eve and day each year recall the fact, appar ent only on that day, that the Christ mas tree is quite as dangerous as it is pretty, and that the proud father per sonating Santa Claus should take the precaution to equip himself with asbes tos whiskers. About the usual number of fires are recorded in the country each year as a result of the inflammable na ture of the Christmas tree and its dec orations and their careless handling. This warning always follows Christ mas just as the outcry against toy pis tols is raised after the Fourth of July. Of course no rose is free from thorns, and apparently no holiday can be ob served in the conventional fashion with out risk of accident to the merrymakers. Sputtering candles on a Christmas tree are a very real danger, and the same may be said of the trees themselves, the wreaths of evergreen and the mistletoe. After a day or two they become dry and inflammable to a high dpgree, and in the joy of the celebration risks are run and precautions neglected. A tree thus load ed down with presents and decorations may become in an instant a torch capa ble of starting a disastrous fire, as many cities discovered the other day, to their great cost and to the serious discomfort of their fire departments. By taking preventive measures thoa sands of dollars will be saved every year. Trees should be bought late and kept out doors until used. In the case of fresh, green trees the risk will be min imized. Candles should not be too close together and should be constantly watch ed. Above all. a wet blanket should be at hand, also a sponge on a poie long enough to reach any point of the t :v»es or ceiling. So. at least, say the tire fighters, who every year have their own Christmas spoiled by the neglect of t.iese very obvious precautions. Old Ideas About Christmas. Even as late as 1753 there was some doubt as to tlio exact date of Christ uas, the old count bringing it to the s;!i of January, the new count giving ti> the 2.~ith of December, which is "the day we celebrate." In Devonshire. Englan 1. it is believed that if the sun shines at noon on Christmas day a plentiful crop may be looked for in the following year. The Tho-ightful Giraffe.

Although the people of Norway have decided to cut away from Sweden, they have little against King Oscar as a democratic individual. He is a tall, erect, handsome old gentleman, court ly and kind in manner, and is. perhaps, the most approachable monarch. Sev eral years ago, while aboard his yacht "Drott," in northern waters, a party on a passing steamer asked permis sion to go aboard. It was courteously granted. King Oscar, In greeting his visitors, said, "I fear I can not show you such a yacht as you have shown me this morning, but she Is comfortable enough for an old gentleman, and I have spent twenty-two happy summers on her." To a Journalist in the party the King granted a few minutes' conversation, and his first question, in perfect Eng lish, was, "You have a great many of my countrymen In your northwestern territories! What sort of citizens do they make?" "The beat we have, your majesty!" Smiling, and thinking for a few mo ments, he remarked, "Is that the truth, KINS OSCAR. or la It a newspaper man's diplomatic answer?" Not long ago King Oscar was sitting In the smoking room of a Wiesbaden hotel, where a group of gentlemen were discussing the questions of the hour, strikes, socialism, communism, the revolutionary tendencies of the time, etc. One of the party, expatiat ing upon his pet theories with consid erable 7ebemence, wound up with the remark, "The days of monarchies are numbered." King Oscar looked up and smiled. "Evidently you don't agree with me," resumed the speaker, "but can you give mo any good reasons for thinking otherwise?" "Only one, I am the King of Swe den," he replied. Dntoh Are Thrifty. The people of the Netherlands are thrifty and economical, excellent mer chants, and, in proportion to the popu lation, their nation Is one of the rich est In the world. They are cosmopoli tan and large minded In the Invest ment of their capital. They were the first and most extensive foreign buyers of United States bonds of 18G1-65, but did not touch the confederate issues. According to estimates of official sta tistical and financial sources, Dutch capital to the amount of $544,500,000 is Invested In American bonds and shares, and' $400,000,000 in Russian bonda and shares. Very large sums of Dutch capital are Invested in Mex ican government bonds and in bonds and shares of Mexican railroad and in dustrial companies; also in the gov ernment and railroad bonds of Aus tria-Hungary, Portugal and numerous other countries, and a large amount is working profitably in the Dutch In dian colonies in sugar, tobacco and rubber plantations, the mining of tin and other metals, petroleum wells, etc. A financial book of reference places the capital of all Dutch joint stock companies at $744,164,000, but this does not embrace the numerous Dutch companies which have their headquarters In the colonies and in foreign countries.

How many of the countless pupils who struggle with the decimal frac tions In their school lessons are aware that the source of their troubles was "a fatal book" written by a mediaeval mathematician at the court of a Ma hommedan king, the famous and su perb Al-Mamoun, son of Harun-al- Rashld, the calif who is immortalized in the "Arabian Nights Entertain ment?" The name of this worthy—the med iaeval mathematician —was Mahom med Al-Khorawazimi, or Mahommed of Khoresan. He lived and wrote in the early period of the ninth century. He Is "the father of modern arithme tic" and was a great "light" in his time. But his fame is clouded by one huge blunder that he made —the blun der of having stopped counting too soon. If he had not stopped and turned when he counted ten, but Instead had kept on and turned at the twelve, he would have started the duodecimal system and conferred a priceless boon on humanity. Although he has been dead a thousand years, the so-called "blunder" of the old Arabian goes marching on. It is with us yet In the decimal system—now regarded by the leading mathematicians of the world as one of the greatest calamities ever inflicted on mankind. The extent of this calamity may be bauged from the sensational statement of Professor Archibald McMurry, author of stand ard school books, that "The American people waste 500 years' time every day In figuring out accounts, divisions, etc., which involve fractions that could and would have been dealt with easily and quickly if Khorawazlmi had given us NEW FOLDING BED. Brooklyn Man Has Secured a Patent on One of Metal. Patents are still being Issued for folding beds, although they are not in such demand as they used to be. A Brooklyn man has secured a patent for a sanitary, metallic folding which he claims will revive rffie de mand for this style of compact furni ture that Is really needed more now to fit the smaller rooms in modern apart ments. The bed differs but slightly from the enameled and brass beds now in use, the improvement being in the method of hinging the head and foot, which allows the bed to fold up in a small compass. When it is desired ~o fold the bed the spring is pulled out to the end of the slotted plate: this al lows the mattress to clear the back brace and lifts the springs up to a ver tical position and then draws in the head and foot. When the curtains are METALLIC FOLDING BED. drawn around on the overhead rod the bed is hidden from view, protect ing It from dust, and it gives the ap pearance of a bookcase. Another feat ure of this bed is that the housekeeper may easily get at any part for clean ing and making it up, without pulling it from the wall. All that it is neces sary to do is to swing the head or foot out from the spring and it is then pos sible to get at any part of the bed without reaching over the head or foot, as In the old way. The bed can be taken down the same as the ordi nary iron bed when moving. It doos not weigh any more than any other bed. There are no weights or mechan ical Joints to get out of order. |' A country girl must be desperately in love if she respects * man who can not drive a horse. the duodecimal Instead of the decimal scale." If Khorawazlmi had not stopped at the "ten place" In the numerical scale his name would be called "blessed" by all the great modern mathemati cians. But he did stop and now his successors as mathematical authors— all of whom regret and bemoan the untimely halt that he made —are striv ing with all their .might to create a public sentiment that will cause tha universal adoption and inauguration of the great reform that he overlooked —the substitution of the duodecimal for the decimal system. What success the scholars are to have in their crusade for "the duodeci mal" in arithmetic is problematical. For centuries the duodecimal has been known in algebra and the higher math ematics, but what the great mathema ticians want is the introduction of the system into the arithmetics of the schools and into shops, the counting house and all the commercial and trad ing institutions of the people. In any gathering of mathematical teachers may be found a strong sentiment for the popular displacement of the deci mal by the duodecimal system. Deep-rooted though the decimal sys tem is In the practical life of the peo ple, the duodecimalists are not dis couraged. They believe they see an awakening. No less than Ave of the most eminent mathematicians in the land who came together by chance the other day at the University of Chi cago expressed themselves as satisfied that the time is approaching when the public interests will become so enor mous that the duodecimal system will not only be conceded as superior to the cumbersome decimal system, but will become an actual public necessity.— Chicago Chronicle.

Disorder attending the presidential campaign in Cuba has led thoughtful people to a consideration of the power of the United States to prevent a re newal of the conditions of anarchy that prevailed in the island during the last years of Spanish rule. It is re called that this country interfered in the affairs of Cuba seven years ago In order to put a stop to disorder and misrule, which produced such condi tions as brought infectious disease to our Southern ports and required the constant vigilance of the navy to pre vent those ports from being used as the base for filibustering operations. Cuba was occupied by American troops, and Congress ordered that they should not withdraw till a government had been established under a constitu tion which should give to the United States the right to "intervene for the maintenance of a government ade quate for the protection of life, prop erty and individual liberty." The Cu ban constitution gives this right to the United States, and it is still further secured by a treaty duly ratilied and proclaimed. The certainty that this government would intervene in case of grave and widespread disorder has had a salutary effect on the Cuban politicians trained in the methods of the old revolutionists. If they succeed in holding themselves in check during the political canvass which closes with the presidential election 011 Dec. 1 they will have advanced far in the arts of self-government. But. says the Youth's Companion, if the United States Is compelled to intervene to put an end to the annoyances caused by a disorderly neighbor, the Cubans will have only themselves to blame for the outcome. The President's forthcoming message is a matter of concern to those inter ests that have reason to believe they will be dealt with. Among those who show greatest concern are the railroad corporations of the country, because of the President's known attitude toward rates and rebates. Already these cor porations have begun to assemble a strong lobby. Among other interested parties are the great trusts of the country whose concern extends In two directions: First, toward the Presi dent's enforcement of existing law; and second, toward his possible recom mendation of tariff revision. The pro tected Interests, alarmed by the stand taken by the Massachusetts Republi cans, fear that recommendations will j be made which will bring up the whole j tariff question. Then there are the in surance companies, which fear some suggestion of Federal regulation and control. Other interests may be cited as being extremely anxious regarding the President's forthcoming but these are the more important. One reason why all such Interests art more anxious than they would other •vise be is because President Roosevelt has no further political aml'ltiona. This idea regarding the matters above, cited leads to the conclusion jWt whatever recommendations are in his forthcoming message will lJw *o radical legislation; that Is, radical In the estimation of those interested When the Senators and Representa tives return to Washington to attend the approaching session of Congresi they will be astonished at the transform matlon in the eapitol.
