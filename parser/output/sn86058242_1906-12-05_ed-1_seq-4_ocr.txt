Bryan is well pleased with that part of the president's message that has started another quake in Califor nia. IT, IS unfortunate that the New Tork Mutual had stuck in its mite to ward the campaign fund that helped to elect President Roosevelt, before the law prohibiting- corporations from contributing money for campaign pur poses gets in Its deadly work. 

ROOSEVELT seems to have gotten ahead of himself in the abolition of legal red tape propostion. i. e., with regard to the adjustment of the school difficulties in California. WE had always been under the im pression that "summary death" has been the rule with regard to the negro assaulters of women, especially In the Eouth. THE "WIDER STREET" MOVEMENT. The proposed widening of Calumet avene from eighty to 100 feet is a timely suggestion that should be acted upon at once. Every progressive city In the coun try has been confronted by the prob lem of narrow thoroughfares as soon as it has reached proportions where congestion in which the average width of streets becomes a possibility. In majority of instances, however, the necessity if ignored or fought over until the expense of widening makes the undertaking a serious prop osition. If not impossible, it at least, when Improved with many buildings. Is attended by such great expense as to work a hardship on many of those who are obliged to bear the burden of the improvement. The widening of State street in Chi cago, a quarter of century ago, was ncconiplished only after the most bit ter jopposltlon of property owners whose buildings fronting that thoroughfare had either to be moved at great expense or torn down and re built. Chicago right now is In the throes of an agitation to widen Halsted street, and Hammond will do well to take warning from the rich heritage of ex perience in this connection dearly bouerht by other municipalities the country over. Calumet avenue is in the trend of the encroachment of business, which is bound to be eastward henceforth, and while the widening of the street might worts a Temporary narusnip upon a few property owners right now, it will He a iHT.ei.t in tne long run both to the land holders and the city as a whole. WITH THE EDITORS. To Change the Ballot Law. Louis Ludlow, writing from Washing ton to the Indianapolis Star, states that there is a good deal of talk among members of congress from In diana of a movement to separate the congressman's name from the county ballot in future elections. It is prob able that the republican members of the Indiana delegation will hold a cau cus on the subject soon and outline plans for bringing this reform before the state legislature at its coming ses sion in Indianapolis. An act of the legislature would be required to re move the congressman's name from the county ballot. The recent elections In Indiana furn ished many Illustrations of how con- gressional candidates suffer by hav ing their names appear on the county ballot in each county of their respec tive districts. This plan draws them into the vortex of every local factional light. The congressman often loses heavily, not because there is any op position within the party ranks to hiia. but because of the local dissensions directed against the county candidates. Many men are afraid of losing their votes if they "scratch" and therefore they vote the entire county ballot of the opposing party, at the same time vot ing the state ballot of their own par try. Others who undertake to scratch thoir county ballots make a botch of it and their votes are thrown out. WHO ARE IIOOSIRItS. Because a reader in the Indianapolis Star lias suggested the name of Capt. Eads for Indiana's niche in the Statu ary hall, the Washington Herald is in clined to treat this with levity, for the reason that Capt. Eads has not lived in this state all his life. In answer the Star says: "The Washington Herald waxes merry over the fact that Capt. Eads is claim ed as a Hoosier by some of the Star voters, which it thinks "will doubtless surprise many persons, who know that this great engineer achieved all of his fame only after he had left Indiana.'" It stat-s that 'there is a good old prin ciple in Indiana which lays down tho rule 'that once a Hoosier always a Hoosier,' and it is probably on this principle that Eads is being considered.' "And pray, why not? A Hoosier is either a native or a resident of Indiana, according to all the dictionaries and ancient usage. A man once born in Indiana can never be born anywhere else. Ho is a Hoosier per sc. If a man who has the misfortune to be born elsewhere realizes hla unhappy lot and comes to this state, his repentance and Indiana accepts he becomes u Hoosier by adoption. "But the Herald ia rather late with its theory. If it were applied now there would have to be some removals from Statuary hall. For example, Pennsylvania has a statue of Robert Fulton, and her claim to Fulton Is not as strong as Indiana's claim to Eads. Eads was not only born in Indiana but also received all the schooling he ever had In Indiana, and had shown his taste for mechanical invention be fore he left the state. Fulton left Pennsylvania as a youth to study art in England, and was turned to me chanical pursuits later. Ho never re turned to Pennsylvania to- reside, but settled in New York, and died there. "New Hampshire has given n statue of Daniel "Webster as one of its sons, but Webster's fame was made after he had removed to Massachusetts. But New Hampshire is entitled to him be cause his early life and education form ed his character and developed his ability. Mere birth may be considered an Incident,' but so may mere resi dence. What locality is entitled to a credit for a man's greatness, the one that produced him, or the one where he happens to locate? Rhode Island sends a statue of Roger Williams, but It did not make Roger Williams, though he did something toward mak ing Rhode Island after he came over from Wales. John Wlnthrop was 42 years old when he came to Massa chusetts, but Massachusetts sends in his statue. "If the Herald will look a little deep er it may find cause for surprise in Statuary hall. The law calls for stat ues 'of deceased persons who have been citizens thereof (the several states) and are illustrious for their heroic re nown, or from distinguished civic or military service.' New Jersey has a statue of Phil Kearny, who was born in New York, and was a citizen of the world. He was never a citizen of New Jersey, but commanded the First Bri gade of New Jersey troops in the civil war until he was killed at Chantilly In 1S82. Wisconsin has a statue of Fath er Marquette, who was never a citizen of that state. Its only claim to him is that he passed through the region where the state is with Joliet, and spent a winter at the mission on Green Bay, because he was sick and could not get away. Indiana has as much claim to La Salle or Abraham Lincoln as Wisconsin has to Marquette." The Justice Shopa. Speaking of justice Chicago and Indiana Journal says: shops in both the Lafayettt: "The people of Chicago are rejoicing over the abolition of the justice shops, with their agents, the constables. By act of the legislature the business of the Justice courts henceforth will be determined by a municipal court. There Is a chief Justice and twenty-nine as sociates composing the tribunal. Un der the new law the municipal courts and the agents of the law serve on salaries, the fee feature being elimin ated. Chicago has seen the fee system, as it pertains to courts in its very worst phase. Under the old law black mail was common and Justice was rare. The new order marks a great reform and the people have reason for felicita tion. The situation in Chicago should suggest to the people of Indiana the advisability of abolishing the anti quated system now followed in this state. The Indiana method at pres ent is bad. Monetary reward is made the premium for the enforcement and prosecution of the law. The system is pernicious, being an insult to the law. Interpretation and prosecution of the law should be divorced from fees In Indiana. The coming session of the legislature has an opportunity to register a real reform on this question. 

GETS NEW FEDERAL BUILDING. Mr. James A. Wetmore, chief in the law and record division of the super vising architect's office, Washington, I). C, was in the city today upon mat ters connected with the selection of a site for the proposed new federal build ing to be built In this city. Michigan City News. Profanity On the Singe. The use of profanity on the stage is becoming so common that the average audience is no longer shocked by lan guage that ought not to be tolerated either in the home or in public. Even that sterling comedian Frank Danlel3 exclaims "good God," and the hardened theater-goers overlook It. And he Is one of the least of the offenders. We do not beleive that the public wants coarse plays or coarse language. They expect at the variety theaters shocking and vulgar expressions, and for the most part accordingly stay away, or at least keep the members of their families whose Innocence they wish to protect away from such places. But they are not free from offenses at the so-called best theaters. To hear language in public that does not shock "good society" is taken by the young and Innocent to give license for the use of such language everywhere. As a rule, the best plays are free from offenses in this particular. The public knows a good, clean show as well, if not better than the playwright knows it. When the theatrical managers are made to feel through the box-office that profanity and vulgarity will not be tolerated by a decent public they will purge their plays of vulgar lan guage and vulgar actions. Indianapo lis News. Iii - Is Inadequate. At Chicago a civil service postoffice examination where it was hoped there would be 600 applicants had thirty nine. The cause is not the high stand ard, but the low pay, says the Chi cago Record-IIerld, which adds: The pay offered is entirely Inade uuate. In some branches of the serv ice it is just what it was thirty years ago, despite the great increase in the cost of living. Postoffice clerks begin ut $400 and increase slowly. The posi tions that pay above $1,000 are few, and are really in the executive staff rather than in the staff of clerks. Let ter carriers in large cities begin at $600, and may reach $1,000. Railway postal clerks receive from $S00 to $1, 500, but hundreds of them with excep tionally short runs receive less than the minimum of the schedule If rail ways and manufacturing corporations see the need at this time of increasing the pay by 10 per cent,, surely the gov ernment can do the same, especially since there is more reason for the gov ernment doing it under present condi tions than there is for the railways do ing it. It will be good economy for congress to heed the postmaster-general's recommendations on this point and be liberal with the clerks. Between Trains If Thou Muat Love. If thou must love me, let It be for naught Except for love's sake only. Do not say "I love her for her smie . . her look . . . her way Of speaking gently for a trick of thought That falls in well with mine, and certes brought A sense of pleasant ease on such a day." For these things in themselves, be loved, may Be changed, or change for thee and love so wrought, May be unwrought, so. Neither love me for Thlno own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry A creature might forget to weep, who bore Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby, But love me for love's sake that ever more Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.

A certain man who resides in a neighboring city naa trounie witn a mouse recently. The little rodent had gnawed his way into the bath room and was using that apartment for his daily frolics. As a consequence the man's wife and daughters were afraid to use the room. Means of extermination, such as traps and poison were brought into play, but the mouse could not see them at all. Eventually, growing tired of hearing the complaints that the women folks were making, the man of the house went Into the bath room and laid for the little beast. The animal put In appearance and was landed into th bath tub, which served as a prison un til the family cat could be brought in to do the execution stunt. v hen the cat took after the mouse the rodent ran down the waste pipe and plugged it up. Saturday the land lord paid a plumber's bill of $27.50 for having the mouse's carcass removed. A NEW
