New York, Dec. $. Tht Sun to-morrow will lay: There Is nothing unexpected or strik ing In the message which Mr. Cleve land aent to congress. The Important paragraphs might be printed In three quarters of a column. It Is melan choly fact, that with a single exception every Important reference to Interna tional affairs Is an Indirect confession of failure and humiliation. The excep tion is the part devoted to the Blue fields incident and the policy of our government with regard to the Nlcara guan canal, and here we have nothing positive or enlightened. Mr. Cleveland does not conceal bis hope that the pres ent congress will be unpatriotic end shortsighted enough to abandon all that we have gained In Samoa. About the only vigorous passage in the mes sage is that in which the president de nounces the century-old law for the protection of American ship building as "nearer a relic of barbarism than anything that exists under the pro visions of a state of the United States." Other matters are Mr. Cleveland's commendations of the preposterous re port of the so-called strike commission as "worthy of the careful considera tion of congress;" his declaration that he will continue to borrow money when ever in his judgment the situation re quires it, and hlB very crystalline dis cussion of the currenoy question. The Tribune will commend the para graph in the message concerning the issuing of bonds to meet the deficit and to save the nation's credit, but will criticise him for not urging important economies and will declare that the proposal to reconstruct the currency proves to be little better than a thinly disguised plan to revive the old demo cratic state bank system. " Continuing the Tribune will say: . "The radical fault in this message is "that it obstinately' Ignores the prostra tion of business by a change- of public policy, and the incompetence and fail ure of congress to provide adequate revenue, suggests' no means of raising more money except by borrowing, and threatens renewed agitation for lower duties and a delicate and dangerous reconstruction ourrenoy system at a time when business can by no means bear a further shock. It is the utter ance of a man who will not see hlB own mistakes or the terrible mlsohlef done by him and his party, who will not listen to the people when they demand a different policy and thus go stubborn- ly on to disturb Industry, to diminish revenue and to anger the people still more. The Recorder will say: The message which Mr. Cleveland sent to congress yesterday la in many points one of the beat he has written. It gives in a suc - oinct way an intelligent Idea of .what the government has been doing during the past twelve months, while it is not as many of his old1 messages were weighted down with suggestions and loaded with omniscient advice to a co ordinate branch of the government He evidently felt while preparing it the re buke gave his administration on Novem. ber 6 and toe has accepted it in a be coming spirit of humiliation. Springfield, Mass., Dec. 3. The Re publican will to-morrow say: The most striking feature of this document is tha defiant emphasis put upon the declaration that the government's credit wiB be preserved. It is a nota- ,ble proclamation. He 'cannot believe that any citizens are willing that the government should default in its obli gations of drop to ai silver basis. Any how he Intends to leave nothing un done to. prevent such a calamity, and so long as no better authority is pro vided for; bond Issues suoh authority as he has will be utilized whenever and so often aa it becomes necessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve. , That Is Inspiring talk. It Is emphatic otlce served on the silver marplots In congress that their schemes cannot be earned out Just at present. Harford, Deo.: 8.-rBhe Courant will say to-morrow that the message "is on "the -whole a humdrum and perfunctory sort of a paper, in no -way equalling for vigor of expression his 'perfidy and dishonor letter or his other recent com munications, whldhi went to congress by the backdoor Instead of officially." i. The Courant endorses his position on the army and the navy and on finance' generally, 'but questions the wisdom of further perpetuating the greenbacks as proposed In the new bond scheme. - London, Deo. 8. The Standard will say to-morrow in a leader on President . Cleveland's message: . The' proposed change of the banking laws can in no way put cash Into the treasury for present or future demands, but" it" may do much to intensify ex isting dangers. . In one way alone, can the gold reserves of the treasury be re plenished without risk,- namely by changing budget deficits into surpluses and accumulating the -latter' in gold. Secretary Carlisle's provisions tend di i recti? to make a deprecated paper cur rency redundant and .therefore 'seem weak and most Impolitic . His proposal proclaims that the currency problem is one which the democrats even yet dare . not meet squarely. -. ', The Dally News will say: The trans fer of the responsibility, from the treai i - . . ' ury to the banks undoubtedly Is sound finance. The system has stood tha test of practical working in Canada. There Is plenty of gold in the United States, but Its collection and Its retention ob viously are not duties of the govern ment under the ordinary conditions of national existence. The continuance of the task under present conditions obviously would lead sooner or later to difficulty or disaster. The Dally Chronicle will eulogize Mr. Cleveland's dogged persistence In ad vocating the policy of reforms "which his mlscredlted party has neither the oourage nor the conscience to pursue." Boston, Dec. 8. The Globe (dem.) says: There Is no note of hesitancy in the president's message to congress. He declares his position on all the lead ing Issues of the time clearly and un mistakably. Mr. Cleveland's utterance regarding ways and means of main taining the gold reserve In the treasury give evidence enough, if needed, of Im patience at the failure of congress In the past to enact legislation authoriz ing the Issue, In case necessity arises, of short term low rate bonds. It Is clear the president believes himself warranted In authorizing the recent bond Issue. His views on this mat ter will no doubt be controverted by certain men in congress, but It is quite unlikely, with the obviously and press ing necessity of dealing with the cur rency problem In general, that much time will be consumed In dealing with matters of the past. It is the financial needs of the present that chiefly claim the attention of our lawmakers. The Journal (rep.) deals exclusively with the financial portion of the mes sage, and says, in substance, that the current program of the administration can scarcely fail to disappoint con servative financiers. The net result of the scheme would be to give us a form of national currency less stable and sat isfactory than we now have. Washington, Dec. 3. When question ed concerning the president's message Senator Piatt of Connecticut said: "If the president thinks the present evils are to be cured by further doses of free trade and an effort to get free ships he has failed to learn anything from the recent elections." Senator Hawley of Connecticut said: "The message Is disappointing. It Is most remarkable that It wholly omits any reference to the amazing expres sion of opinion of the people in the recent elections. As to foreign affairs the president's action is reactionary and un-American. Until Mr. Carlisle's report appears no opinion can be ex pressed of the president's financial pol icy. The message is far short os the necessities and. the demands in the judgment . of both parties."

' Kepabllrane Have aa Kseellent Oppor tunity to Wln-Demuetatle DUasToetloa Everywhere Xeventh Waid tpllt Way Itesult la Republican Bucessa There. To-day will occur on of the greatest battles of the ballots in the history ot the local town and city elections. Last evening both parties were confident of winning, but the confidence of the democrats was not nearly so outspoken as in former years. Indeed, It almost seemed as if, although they said they were sure of wlnnlng.at the same time In their inmost souls they didn't believe what they were saying. The managers ot both political par ties were kept bustling last night mak ing the final preparations for the con test to-day. Chairman James H. Mac Donald of the republican town commit tee, warns all republicans to be care ful not to use any of the spurious tickets which have been sent broadcast to the republican voters. He advises all who desire to vote the straight re publican ticket to secure their tickets at the booths on election day. There is a great contest on for con trol of the court of common council, and here the republicans have .great hopes of winning out, owing to the dis sensions and factional fights with which the democracy Is cut up. The republi cans have an excellent chance of se curing aldermen and councllmen from the strong democratic Third and Seventh wards. In the Third ward the anti-McGann faction to the number of several hundred have openly declared their Intention of voting the straight re publican ticket, and the republicans there have now a chance of their life time to elect their ward ticket The fight between the Moore and the anti-Moore factions In the Seventh ward still goes merrily on. The breach between the two factions grows larger every minute, and the fight will be one of the bitterest in this history of the ward. Yesterday a circular was dis tributed broadcast throught the ward It is estimated that this ticket will have a large following In the ward, and Indi cations are that it will be successful. With the democrats fighting among themselves one of the possibilities of election day 4s that a complete repub lican ward ticket may be eleoted in that hotbed of democracy, the Seventh wnrrl 'T-he circular denounces .loqre,,'rie opposing , candidate, alleging' that- he failed to oppose the Standard Oil com pany's locating their tank in, the Seventh until a "general cry of Indigna tion at his apathy was raised in the ward. The circular In a pathetic tone calls upon the voters to reject Moore and vote for John E. Dalley for alder man, and Klernan, Hurd and Chris. Doerschuck for councllmen. The democrats have finally succeeded In finding eight men with sufficient te nacity to run up against the strong republican tickets and majorities in the Second and Tenth wards. The nomina tions in these wards were made yester day and are as follews: Second ward- Alderman, Joseph W. Hammond; coun Oilmen, Frederick L. Scovlll, Patrick F. Henchy and Louis E. Jacobs. Tenth ward Henry C. Seabrook, alderman; councllmen, Albert J: Parmelee, Her man Voltz and Daniel J. Brennan. THOUSANDS MADE HAPPY. Employes of the Havemeyer Sugar Be- flnerles Resume Work. Brooklyn, Dec. 8. The return to work In the Havemeyer sugar refineries in Williamsburg last night and this morn ing of more than 2,500 men who were laid off on Thanksgiving evening, had the effect of making thousands of poor families happy to-day. V. " New York, Dec. 3. The Evening Sun prints an interview with President H. O. Havemeyer of the Sugar trust. Mr. Havemeyer said: "Work has been resumed In the refin eries on a very reduced scale. I do not anticipate the passage of a free sugar bill. The Franklin refinery in Phila delphia Is working with a reduced force. The Spreckels refinery is not working at all. The Boston refinery is working with about one-half the regu- lar force. The Matthiesen and Weicher refinery is with one-half force." Mr. Havemeyer denied reports of dif ferences with other directors.

Dewell from Mayor aargeal Two Tear As-Trom Bogus lleketa Which Wars Ctaralated by tha Thoneaads Yesterday Thoroughly De nounced. Yesterday our well known townsman, James D.

Hendrlck and with other changes In the ticket calculated to deceive re publicans, wrong names being printed for those of some of the republican nominees oti the ward ticket. The reception of this ticket recalled to mind a letter he had received two years ago from Mr. Sargent, in which the views of the latter on the Issuing of bogus tickets are so clearly s.M forth as to need no further comment The letter received by Mr. Dewell two years ago. Is as follows; and will no doubt highly interest the thousands of voters In New Haven: MAYOR'S OFFICE. New Haven, Conn., Dec. 10, 1892. James D. Dewell, Esq.: Dear sir Your congratulations are received and kindly accepted as you request. I am sorry to see my old party fallen so low In political morality as to fraud ulently Issue 10,000 ballots on the Holy Sabbath Day of the Lord, purporting to be Issued by another party. The law passed by a republican legislature stamps such work as fraudulent and criminal. I trust the democratic party will never follow down to such prac tices. Yours truly, J. H. SARGENT. THE EARL OF ABERDEEN AT TALE. Aa Interesting Addreu Before Member, of Yale University. The Earl of Aberdeen, governor gen eral of Canada, addressed an immense gathering of students in Dwight hall at 7 o'clock last evening. The large lecture hall was filled to Its utmost capacity and many people crowded into the' hallways and adjoining rooms In order to match a glimpse of his earl- ship. . He made a strong impression on all who listened to him as a man of high culture and strong personality. He gave an Informal talk rather than an address, but he was listened to with the closest attention. V In his remarks he said: "I: do not see as it makes much difference whether a man believes fit the modern theorfes of" the origin drthe world or as our fathers believed. Alterations in - the out phases In which, truth Is presented do not change the vital truths and principles of things. The educated man should take high ground. Some unfortunately have an Idea that their Intellectual level Is heightened If they give vent, to utterances of'tllsbellef. It is belief that saves one from all that distraction, which turns away from a steady purpose. It is character and the training implied' by character that tells In the long run and helps to resist temptation. We should aspire to a recognition of the fact that In spite of all business cares, a man should spend a part of his life In striving to influ ence. for good the government of city, state or country. "I consider a great benefit and privi lege to be brought into contact with such a robust body of young men. I come as a representative from that northern country with which I hope your relations will grow' ever closer and friendlier. It am glad to find that Yale recognizes religion and learning as interwoven and identical, and as the years go on Yale will be more and more recognized as a beacon light and an Inspiring influence throughout the world." The earl Is being entertained by Pro fessor O. C. Marsh at his residence on Prospect street.He Is accompanied by Lady Aberdeen, her brother, the Hon. Arhclbald Majorbanks, and Mr. Hewitt, his private secretary. Professor Marsh, during his trips abroad, has often been the guest of Lord Aberdeen at his country seat In Scotland, and also at the government house in Ottawa, Can. After the gov ernor general's stay in this city, he wiM return immediately to Ottawa. BVROZARY ON SHERMAN AVENVE several Hnndieda of Dollar. Worth of ' Property Taken Last Evening.

The Murderer of Albert J. Skinner, the Wiudaor Farmer, Will Pay tha Tonally of Mia Crime on the Oallows Two Week from To-day st 8tate I'rlsoo. Hartford, Dec. 3. -The state board of pardons held their regular meeting In the supreme court room this afternoon snd heard the cases of several prisoners who made applications for a pardon from the prison. The most Important case which the board acted upon was that of John Cronln, who was convicted of the murder of Albert J. Skinner, a farmer of South Windsor, who employed Cronln. Cronln's attorneys pleaded for com mutation of Cronln's sentence on the ground that the condemned man wus suffering from Insanity when he com mitted the deed. Attorney Mlldeber- ger, Cronln's counsel, made a strong plea for the man. Dr. Downs, who was called as an expert, testified that he had made a careful examination of Cronln andj stated that In his opinion Cronln was sound mentally. The board heard all the evidence that was produced in Cronln's favor and at 5 o'clock went Into executive session. Half an hour later they returned to the court room and it was announced that they had decided not to interfere In the case, and denied the pardon for Cronln. The latter In the meantime had been taken - back to the state prison by Warden Woodbrldge In a car riage. On the ride back to Wethers field, the warden and the condemned man engaged In conversation. The warden asked Cronln what he thought would be the result of the board's hearing, and the latter replied that he did not think that a pardon would be granted. "Then you will not be disappointed if they should decide agalnBt you?" asked the warden. "No," was Cronln's reply. Cronln said that he was ready to meet his fate and the sooner that it was over the better, so far as be was concerned. Cronln's manner is the same that he has shown since he was imprisoned, and is that of a BUllen unintelligent character. Cronln has not been notified of his fate, and he will not hear of it until Warden Woodbrldge receives official notification of the action of the board of pardons from Governor Morris. This will come within a few days and then Cronln will learn for the first time .that hts fate Is sealed. The execution, will take place on the morning of December 18 next between the hours of midnight and sunrise There are no preparations to be made for the new gallows is In position, and Cronln could be executed In fifteen minutes' notice. A coincidence of the hearing to-day was the fact that a convict named Roberts of Stamford who has been serving out a sentence for forgery, and who. prepared the plans for the new gallows upon which Cronln is to be hanged, was this after noon granted a pardon by the board. He - was to have served three years, but -has only spent two years in the prison. The board granted him the pardon for good behavior. The crime for which Cronln Is to be hanged was committed last fall. .He was sentenced March 24, 1894, to be hanged on the 24th of last August. He was reprieved until October 24 by the governor, owing to the absence of Dr. Francis Bacon of New Haven, who was in Europe, in order that the whole board1 would be present to hear Cronln's petition. 

SECOND REGIMENT SAND BAZAAR, Throngs at. the Armory Last Evening. A large crowd was present at the for mal opening of the grand military ba zaar of the Second regiment band at the old Union, armory last evening. Col onel J. B. Doherty and several members of his staff were present and assisted in the opening. They were escorted by the Sarsfleld Guard which, headed by the band, made a short parade. After the arrival at the hall Colonel Doherty opened the fair With a short address. Miss Engler, an elocutionist of Nor wich, gave a very pleasant entertain ment, after which Dale Armstrong and Welton, the juggler, entertained the au dience. The hall is decorated finely In light blue and white cheese cloth, and presents a very pretty appearance. The list of prizes Is a long one and each purchaser of a season ticket re ceives a coupon, which entitles them to a chance upon all the articles. A beau tiful diamond ring will be presented to the most popular young lady in New Haven, also a full dress suit and a gold medal to the most popular prompter in the city, The greatest interest centers around the beautiful United States national flag, donated by Malley, Neely & Co., to be presented to the military company receiving the' largest number of votes during the week. ' The band deserves the heartiest sup. port In this undertaking. It contains some of the best musicians in the city, and under the . leadership of Frank Flchtl has received careful training. New Haveners listened with pride to the Second regiment band at camp last summer, and they should now lend their aid when it Is sought.
