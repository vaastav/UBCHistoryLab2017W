A private dispatch received in this c;ty states that the arms, some 1000 or 1500, which were sHipped from Jackson to the Sheriff of Tunica county, Miss., to quell the riot there last August, have been reshipped to Greenville by order of Governor Ames, and a full negro regiment armed with them. The arms passed through thin oity, and were shipped below by boat We are left to infer that this armed mob of no gfot m to be used against the white people of Vicksburg. A further Cght occurred at Vicksburg this morning, as we are informed by this same prival? dispatch, but the particulars have not reached us. The disturbance in Missis sippi is the result of carpet bag domination. The rate of taxation is intolerable. It amounts to confisca tion, and all the taxes come from the whites. A negro named Crosby was elected Sheriff at Vicksburg, and could not give bond for the large revenues that would pass through his hands. lie resigned on demand of tho Tax-Payers' Association, and after a visit to AmeB at Jackson called the colored popula tion to his aid to reinstate himself. They responded by the hundred and the thousand. The whites armed themselves and drove back the insurgeats, as Grant m.lil call them if they were whites. TUia irivpn an idea of the situation. A collision of the races is moat nnfortU' nate at this time, for it will be miscon strued and used against the Southern whites. It has been deliberately precipitated by reckless white Rad icals, who will be sure to keep out of harm's way, and care not how many deluded negroes are killed, so it oeats them more firmly in office. The people ef Vicksburg have our hearty sympathy, but we fear for the result. THE PEEtSlDEKT'S XESSAGE. Yesterday, December 7, was the 6rst day of the second session of the forty third Congress. The event of the day was the promulgation of the President's message. The whole country was await ing this message with great interest to see what the President would say in the light of the recent Democratic victories. Those who supposed that he would adopt a more conservative polity or indicate any kindness for the South will be dis armointed. He is in tie hands of he most extreme Radicals and reflects their views. The message is one of great length; so we give only the salient points. He begins by Blinding to the prostration of business and industries, and to the fact that labor and capital have been abundant, and it seems to him these elements of prosperity should be directed in the proper channels. He refers to the necessity that existed for creating a national curreucy, but con tinues to urge a return to a gold and liver medium of exchange, and believes there will be no permanent revival of business until this is done. He opposes any further expausion of the present currency, hut thinks a sound currency ahoiild not lie reached by the total bank rtiptcy of the credit and integrity of the nation and individuals. In a word, the President advocates a return to specie payments and a system of free banking. A highly moral suggestion is made against bringing Chinese emigrants to this country the men as slaves to a few leaders, the women for shameful par- poses. The references to our relations with foreign Governments are numerous but unimportant, eacept perhaps as to Cuba. It s a significant fact that Spain has eainod no further superiority in a strife of six years, which may make some rjositive steps on the part of other pow .r. a matter of self-necessity. The President renews his suggestions in reference to the necessity of legislation Jo settle questions of citizenship that so often ariM. The reports of the Treas urer and Secretary of War receive con siderable notice, and attention is di rected to the ti port of the Postmaster General. He recites the staU of affairs in Louisiana, from a partisan standpoint, refers to the adherents of the lieuten ant Governor, I'cnn, as the insur gents, aud says that he shall con tinue to recoauize the Kellogg gov ernment, which he believes to be !,.;!i.naie, unless otherwise directed by Congress. He assert without quali- ficationg Southern lliat in some localises in me SluU-i i.rrvtous to the late ,l,-,t. Ih.-re .U-lerminaiion by m.t. ef vi e to deprive 0H.7ei ol the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions'. Bands of masked and armed men appeared, white leagues were formed, ar ms and ammunition im ported and distributed, drills were held and murders committed, enough to spread terror among those whose politi cal action was to be suppressed, colored laborers, were threatened with discharge if they did not vote with their employers, and th ose threats often heartlessly car ried into effect. The object of the fif teenth amendment and the enforcement act, he thought, were intended to prevent this state of affairs; hence, troops to the Dumber of four thousand and eighty two were stationed at points in the South to aid officers in prosecuting offenders. Ha asserts that if Federal interference is not justifiable under such circum stances, then tho whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse than a mock' cry, and little better than a crime. And then he suggests to Congress that a committee be appointed to ascertain whether these alleged wrongs were real or manufactured for the occasion. In effect the President recommends that Congress take up at public expense the unfinished work of the carpet-bag con vention at Chattanooga. This part of the message was written or instigated by Attorney General Williams. Arkansas comes in for a notice from a Clayton stand-point. He points out what he considers the illegality of the present State government, but refers the ques tion to Congress, inasmuch as a commit tee is already or has been investigating the affairs of that State. In the same connection he makes some sweeping as sertions in regard to affairs in the South; first expressing sympathy with the better class of people who have had to endure trying end oppressive governments, and then charging them with the state of violence previously recited, and winds up a tirade of abuse and studied insult by saying that, while he remains Execntive, all the laws of Congress and theprovis inni "f the Constitution, including the re cent amendments, shall be enforced with rigor I He recommends that the number of judicial districts in the umieuoiaies oe increased from nine, the present num ber, to eleven. The peace policy as pur sued toward the Indians is oommended. He recommends that the bounty be re stored to all the survivers of the war of 1812 as haye been deprived of the same by the test oath required by late aots of Coneress. They were too old to have participated in the rebellion and were awarded pensions for services performed in behalf of the whole country, lhe coming exposition at Philadelphia is commended to Congress. Jt is impossi ble to maintain the civil service rules without more positive support from Con gress, and without some legislation on the subject he will abandon the system entirely. Suggestions are made in re cord to cheap transportation, and the revival of ship building. Affairs in the District of Columbia receive a mention which shows that the ExecutiFO is in full sympathy with the ring, evea if that fact had not been known before. The mes sage closes with a mention of the board appointed to survey the mouth of the Mississippi river, which has not yet reported. Taken as a whole, the message is a weak document Politi cally, however, it is very significant, giv ing the country to understand that the j President is guided by such men as At torney General WilliamB, Hays of Ala bama and the most rampant members of the Radical party. Its effect will be to put the Southern people on their guard more than ever, and in this respect may in the end produce salutary results. The people of the North, have already proved that they begin to disbelieve the re peated stories of Southern spirit and outrages, and the President's reiteration can have little or no effect. His sources of information all come through parti san channels, colored to suit political purposes, and never as correct as re port" furnished by the correspondents of such papers as the Aew York tlerald, Times, World and other fair papers of the country. The animus of the mes sage is unmistakably Radical and hos tile to a liberal, statesman-like policy. We think, however, that its author or va rious authors will find that the old war cry ot rebel has lost its force with the great American people. We agree with the New York Herald when it says that '' the whole system of free passes is corrupt and degrading. It has been nsed to bribe poverty-stricken editors and easy-going legislators, and putting citizens of standing and influ ence under obligations to corporations. There is no more reason why a railroad should carry man free because he in an editor or a politician than the tailor Bhould make his clothes for nothing or the grocer give him his provisions." " DpM pervisions, Josiar," have given out down in Alabama. The rations do nated by Congress to overflowed suffer ers iu Alabama and distributed in negro districts high and dry to carry the elec tions will not hold out any longer, and pow the Alabama negroes threaten to emigrate, in imitation of the little exodus which happened in Kgypt, Well, let the lazy ones go. A kill Las been Introduced in the Ohio Legislature proposing to tax all churches. Very forcible arguments are presented in favor of such a law. The objections ire certainly weakened after carefully studying Lth sides pf the question. Frank Dietl was to Chicago what Worth is to Paris the fashionable dressmaker. One day recently the costly material for dresses lu.'i at his more than fifty establishment for transformation into Kar&CBts of the latest styles were on hand. The next morning the doors were locked, and the .:. .tl. ..,,! n;..il wpr .11 all gone. The runaway is inin spokeu ot in the firrt futilities of Chicrgo as "that horrid wretch." I 

VICKSBURG. The Negroes Attack the City and are Routed at Ever j roint Their Lobs in Killed and Wounded, Seventy-Fire. A Strong: Guard Over n Prisoners and she cuy-Aii tiei at Noon To-Day. Special to the Ledger) Vicksbubo, December 8.-The attempt made by the negroes yesterday to cap ture the city was a complete and disas trous failure. They were routed at every turn, with loss of life, mules, horses and arms. The number of killed and wounded is this morning estimated at seventy five. One white man was killed and two wounded. The city was nnder strong guard all night, and the prisoners closely watched to prevent lynching. A renew al of the attack was reported this morn ing, and tho whites are all under arms. Companies have been sent to the inte rior well armed and equipped. More fighting is expected te-day. The whites are complete masters of the situation. LATER. All quiet at 12 m. A peace commit tee is in conference,, and efforts will be made to prevent the lynching of the negro Sheriff and other leaders. The negroes have all dispersed. Sullivan. BANK ROBBERY. The TlnhonilnKO Nnvlna;" Bunk Ho. I,el in Broad Iraj'llgait by four Men. Nashville, December 8. The follow ing has just been received from Corinth, Miss. : A bold and daring robbery was committed here at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. Four well mounted men rode up to the Tishomingo Savings Bank. Two of them entered and locked the door and (wo remained outside. They demanded the safe keys, which President Taylor refused. Tbey then made an attack upon him with knives and compelled him to submit. They took over $5000 in currency and as much more in watches and diamonds. Mr. Taylor was not badly hurt A negro man was in the bank making a deposit at the time and was not permitted to leave until the robbers retired. They were in the hank about fifteen minutes. People who had observed the bank closed supposed that Taylor had gone to dinner. The bank is in an out of the way place and not much noticed by the public. The men had been lurking about town and the country for two weeks. The robbers fired several shots as they departed and ro.de at full speed in the direction of the Tennessee river. The Sheritf, with, a large posse, has gone in pursuit. SEW fOBK Trial of rrokr for Mnrdr Recep tion of tbe Ulna; or Hawaii. New Vopi?, December 8. Contrary q general expectation, a jury was promptly obtained for the trial of Coroner Croker, under indictment for the murder of Jas. McEenna on election day, and there is a prospect of a prompt trial of an Impor tant criminal suit. One branch of the City Council has requested Mayor Vance to tender the hospitalities of the city to King Kala kano. Arrest of tbe Murderers of J. St Baar, at tJralll, Tenn. Nashville, December 8. Four men, Hard Hampton, Geo. Myers and tbe two Purdoms, have been arrested and held as the alleged murderers of J. N. Baur, at Grutli, Grundy county, on the 30th of November. The circumstantial evidence leaves no doubt of their guilt. Tbe mask worn by one pf the parties has beea found which was made of two pieces of peculiar and very fine goods. The Banner editorially says: "When this discovery was made, and which was not until Sat urday night, arrangements were at once made for a search, with the determina tion to find the goods from which the mask was made. On Sunday the search ing party found some of the goods at Hampton's and the other at Myers'. The jury is still investigating the case, but the proof already is said to be over whelming. The prisoners are held under a strong guard and the citizens are de termined to have juntice done." River Teeiul, Cairo, December 8.

To the Editor of tbe Ledger: I request the privilege of a few words in your valuable journal. I rend with deep interest the communication about Principal IJarnum. The fact is, we do not think U is fitted for the place. He is sometimes guilty of great brutality to our children. Some weeks ago, for a slight offense, Mr. Barnum knocked down a boy of ten years of age, baited bit bead against the wall, planted his knee on lhe dot's breast, and so forcibly and roughly held Lis lips together that n' mouth was discolored for sometime anerwara. iext day tbe bay ws un able to attend school on account of his tody b"in to veiy ore in concjuence : of the beating he had received at the haiids of Bi.rnum. It such a man filW-d drenf It lurt!i-r liUere cMiry upon the u'jjl 1 A h aiIe to furnish them. r'urliiTmoreJ Uarnuin is not in favor of colored tcachors in our schools Those who succeed in getting in he does evervthins in his Dower to depreciate. I am opposed to white teachers in our schools. As a general thing thy are Boch as cannot get situations in the white schools, and rather than miss they "condescend to teach in the nigger school." as thev call it. Wttn such feel ing in their breasts they come into our schools, thinking themselves superior to our teachers and children. I do not be lieve all white teachers feel thus. There are exceptions to all general rules. I take pleasure in naming Professor Steele, of LeMoyne, as an exception in Memphis. He and several teachers un der him I sincerely believe are trying hard to elevate our people. When we ask for colored teachers they say we cannot get those who can stand the examination. Nearly two months since a colored lady from Pennsylvania came nere upon a promise lrom ir. Pickett that if she passed the examina tion she -might have a position in our schools. After passing a satisfactory examination she was unable to get the position, and left here last week for Shreveport, Louisiana. Although Bar num knew quite well that this colored lady (Mrs. Louden) was coming ho goes to work and appoints a white lady. He has been treating ns with great injustice for several years. We don't believe that you would advocate such a man to bo set over white children, and, judging from what yon have said in the past, we believe you are just enough to want to give as the same advantages as the whites. Respectfully, Edward Shaw. Memphis, December 4, 1874. Amnaements. Memphis Theater. Last evening Miss Katie Putnam appeared in Fanchon the Cricket, and mtt with a most enthusi astic reception from a critical audience. The play was well put upon the stage by the management, the arrangements for the "shadow dance" being perfect. Miss Putnam was twice called before the curtain to receive the compliments of the audience, which was a deserved tribute to talent and dramatic ability. To-night she will appear as " Little Nell" end "The Marchioness" in Old Curiosity Shop, a dramatization of Dickens' charming story. The cast is excellent, Mr. Sullivan appearing as " Dick Swiv eller," Mr. Ward as " Brass," Mr. Kcn- nieott as "Quilp," Mr. Arnold as ' Grand father .Trent," Miss Stowe as Mrs. Quilp " and Miss Leslie as " Mrs. Jarley." The trials, troubles and death of " Little Nell " form a most fascinating story and one of Dickens' masterpieces. To morrow evening Miss Putnam will ap pear as the " Little Detective," which play will be followed by a farce, Jefferson Opera House. Manager Steele produces the extravaganza of the Grand Duchess this (Tuesday) evening. Tho company at this house has been greatly inoreased, and crowded audi ences attest their appreciation of rcan agerial energy. New faces are the rule, and rapid changes in the programme are made. Olympic Varieties. This well known Washington street theater has been reopened for the season under the management of J. T. Robinson, who has engaged a first class variety troupe, consisting of the following artistes: John E. Taylor, Tom Murray, Chas. Mathews, Chas.
