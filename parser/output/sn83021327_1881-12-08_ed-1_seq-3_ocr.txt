Austin Is entitled to the best and ablest men in the pulpit a well a In other professions.

Another president's message continued system is tbe selection, by promo tion, of all officers of the poveru- tueut above the lowest grades, ex cept such as would fairly be re ffartleil as exponents of the poL icv of the executive and the .rinciplcs of the doruinaut party. lo afford encouragement to the fa.itli.ttl public servauU by exciting in tiieir inmds the hope of promo tion ii they are found to merit it, is much to be d ;bired ; but would it be wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no other ineausof supply ing the immediate wauls of the ser ire? There are many persons who fill subordinate positions with great credit, but lack those qualities which arc requisite lor higher posts of itutv, and because the mode of 1110110 hi. and action of one whose service in a government bureau has beeu ion" continued, are that before we coutiue ourselves with unpor taut iiiicstious within the bounds of statutory enactments we may await tho result ot lurthcr inauirv aud experiment. The submission of a porliou of the nominations to a central board of examiners selected solely for treating the qualifications of applicants may, perhaps, without resorl lo I he competitive test, put an end to the mischiefs which attend Ihn present system of appointments, and it may lie Icnsiblo to vest in such a board a wide discretion to H4cerlH.in the characteristics and at tainiiieuts of candidates iu those particulars which I have already rcierrca lo as iieiug no less im portant than mere intellectual at tainments. If congress should deem it advisable at the present session to establiNh competitive testa for ad mission lo tho service, no doubts such ns have been suggested shall do lor mo Irom giving the measure my earned support, and earnestly rec- ommeud, should there bo a failure to pa-s any other act upon this sub ject, than an appropriation of $25,- ihh) per year may lie mado tor the enforcement of section 1753 of the revised statutes. Willi the aid thus adored me I shall strive to execute the provision oftlie latter according to its letter, and I am unwilling, in Justice to present civil servants of the government, to dismiss this sub ject without declaring my dissent Irom tho severe and almost, incrimi nate censure with which they have been recently assailed. That they areas a class indolent, inefficient aud corrupt, is a statement which has been often mado aud widely cred ited ; but when the extent, variotv. delicacy and importance of their duties are considered, the great ma jority ol the employes ot the gov ernment are, in my judgment, de serving ot high commeuih-tion. the contiuuiug . decliue of the merchant marine of the United States is greatly to be deplored. In view of the fact that we furnish so large a proportion of tho freights of the commercial world, and that our shipments are steadily aud rapidly increasing, it is causo of surprise that not only is the navigation in terests diminishing, but it is less than wlieu our exports and imports were uot half as large as now either in bulk or value. There must be some peculiar hin drance to tho development of the interest or entorprise and energy of the American mechanics and capi talists who have kept this country at least abreast of our rivals in the Irieudly contest for ocean supre macy. The substitution of irou for wood and ot steam for sail, have wrought great revolutions in the cnrryiug of the trade of the world, but these changes could uot have been adverse to America if we had given to our navigation interest. a proportion of tho aid aud protec tiou which have been so wisely be stowed ou our manufactures. I commend tbe whole subject to the wisdom of congress, with the sug gestion that uo question of greater magnitude or further reaching in importance can engage their consideration. In the year 1875, the supremo court of the United States declared iu the constitution that tho statute of certain slates which imposed upon the ship owners or consequences a tax of one dollar aud tilty cents for each passenger ar riving from a foreign country, or iu lieu thereof, required a bond to in demuify the state aud local authori ties against the expeuse for future relief or support of such passenger. Muce this decision the expense at tending the care and supervision of immigrants has talien on the states, at whose ports they nave landed, as a large majority of such immigrants immediately upon their arrival pro ceed to the island states and the territories to seek permanent homes, it is manifestly unjust to im poso upon states whose shores they first reach the burden which it now oears. For this reason, and because of the vast importance of the sub ject, I recommend legislation regard ing me supervision ana transitiv-Tvoi immigrants at the porta of .debarki tion. I regret to state that the people of Alaska nave reason to complain that they aro yet unprovided with any form of government by which lite aud property can be protected. While the extent of its population does not justify the application of the costly machinery ot territorial administration. there is au immediate necessity for constituting such a form of governmeut as will pro mote tbe education of the people and secure the administration of jus tice. The senate, at its last session. passed a bill providing for the con struct ion of a building for the li brary of congress, but it failed to become a law. The provision of suitable protection for that great collection of books, and for tbe copyright department connected with it, lias become a subject of na tional importance, and should re ceive prompt atteution. Tho report ot the commissioner of the District of Columbia, which ia herewith transmitted, will fullv iuforin you of the condition of attain of the district. Thev charge the vital, importance ol legis lation for the reclamation and im provement of the marshes and for the establishment of harbor lines along the Potomac river front. It is represented that iu their present condition tnese marshes seriously affect the health of the residents of adjacent parts of tho city, and that they generally mar tbe general as pect of the park iu which is located the Washington mouumeut. The improvement of that park south ot the executive mansion, a large area of valuable laud, would trans form what is now believed to ba a daugerous nuisance iuto an attractive lauuscnpe extend ing to the river frout. They recommend the removal of this team railway Hues from the surface of the streets of ihe city and the lo cation of Ihe ueccssary depots in such place as may be convenient for public arromiiioilauoi), aud they all attention lo I lie ilclicicnry of the water supply which seriously affects Ihe material prosperity aud the health ami comiortoi iu inhabi tants. 1 commeud these subjects to your favorable consideration. The importance of timely legislation with respect to tho ascertainment aud declaration of the vote for presi dential electors was sharply call ed to the- atteution of the people more than four years ago. It is to be hoped that some well de nned measure may be devised be fore another natiouai election which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a temporary char acter for the determination of ques tions upon coutesieu returns ques tions which concern the very exist ence of .the government aud the lib erties or tne people, and such as were suggested by tha prolonged illness ot the late president and his consequent inability to perform the iuucuous oi nis onicc. it is pro vided by the second article of con stitution, in the fifth clause of the first section that in case of the re inoval of the president from office, or oi nis death, resignation or in ability to discharge the powers aud uuues ui saiu oiuce, tue same snail devolve on the vice president. vt iiat is the intention ot the consti tution in its specification of inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office as one of the couiin gencies which calls the vice ore! tent to the exerciso of presidential functions? Is the invalidity limited in us nature to long coutinued in tellectual capaeity.orhas it a broader import.' What must be its extent audduratiou? (low must its exist ence be established ? lias the presi- acnt, wnose inability is the subject of inquiry.any voice in determining whether or not it exists, or is the de cision of that momentous aud deli cate question contided lo the vice president, or is it contemplated by the constitution that congress should provide by law precisely what should be the statutory ina bility, and how and by what tribu nal or authority it should be ascer tained? If the inability proves to be temporary iu its nature, anil during its continucncc the vice-president lawfully exercises the funct ion: of the Executive, by what tenure does he hold his office? Does he con tinue as president for the remainder of the four years term, or would the elected president, if his inability should cease in the in terval be empowered to resume his office, aud it' having uch lawful authority he should exercise it, would the vice president be there upon empowered to resume his powers and duties as such. I can uot doubt that these important questions will receive your early and thoughtful consideration. Deeply impressed with the:grayity of the responsibilities which have'so unex pectedly devolved upon me, it Will be my constant purpose to co operate with you iu such measures as will promote the glory of the country and the prosperity of the people.

Judges, lawyers aud marshals are overrun with applications for passes to the best parts of the courtroom. Tbe remarkable consideration shown by the otlicer s to the ladies in attend ance, among whom there is a pre ponderance of elegantlv attired belles from the West End. iu gaining admission 'and finding desirable seats for them, has been enthusias tically acknowledged by the gentler and more curious sex, who testify l heir appreciation by attending in daily increasing' numbers, to the al most complete exclusiou of the meu.
