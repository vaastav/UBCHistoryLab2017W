"...ased itself almo-t wholly in prep.mng for publication works has-d upon tlie re jcrts of the agricultural experiment Miitionsand other institutions for agricul tural it quirv in tueTJnited States and for eign countries. The recretary iu his leport for 1893 called attention to the fact that the appropriation made for the sup port or th experiment stations through out the United States were the on'y moneys taken out of the national treasury hy act ot congress for which no account ing to federal authorities was required. TIILY CAUGHT THE IDEA. Responding to this idea, the Fifty-third congiess in making the appropriation for the department for the oreseut fiscal year provided that the secretary of agriculture ftintild prccribe the form of annunl financial statement lequired by section 3 of the act of Jlarcli 2, 1SS7, and afccertniu whether the expenditures under the ap propriation hereby uiane are iu accord mce with the piovisious of said act, and ahull make report thereon to congress. Tne best service of the stati-tician of the de partmeut of agriculture is the ascertain ment of tliti actual and real conditions, favorable or unfavorable, of the furniers and fa ms of the country ami to seek the causes which produce these conditions to the end that thefac'B Hscertnined may guide their in tclliireut tientnieiit. In ohedience to this law the department of agriculture immwli.itely sent out lii.inlc Jorms of expen-e accounts to each station and proposes in ndiliiion to make through test experts, svsU-niHtic exnmiuatiou of the neveral stations during each year for thepuipose of inquiiiug by personal in vestigation the detailed information neces sary to enable the secretary of agiictilture To make, as the stale provides, a satisfac tory report to coin: rev?. CHANT. I. OF METHODS WELL RECEIVED '1 he boards ot mauageis of the .several rtttions with great alacrity and cordiality linv- approved the amendments to the law pioviding this supervision of the expendi tures, anticipating that it will increase the efliciency of the stations and protect their dnectors and managers from louse charges concerning their ne of public funds, oe-f-iile bringing the ilupartmeiit of auricul une into closer and more confidential re i t oils with t he experimental station-, and t c.ii-ih their joint service largely increa Ji their usefulness to the agriculture of 1. 1 country. A ing upon a recommendation con Li tie 1 in tne report of lflEl, congress ap pi priated 10.000 to etmhlu the secretary tif ,igricultu:e to investigate and report t , u the nutritive value of the v i! us articles and commodities iis-d for i. ii u fooii, with speci il suggestions of "U -v: olesoine and edible rations less v. -t lutthiin those in common use. TJuder tu.s. ppiopriatiou the department has pre! areil and now has nearly leady for distiihiuion an elementary iliscussiou of the nuti ilivo value and pecuniary ecom niv cf food. When wo can consider that fully one half ot all money earned by the nge earners ot the civilized world is expend- d by them for f mi, the importance ami u il ia ofsiicb an investigation is apparent. EX Pi ES OF AGKICfLTCKAL DEPART MENT. The department expended in the fiecal year 1SW -2.3o-i.S09 oO, and out ot that sum ihe total aniomit expended in scientific reseat ch was 4h 0 per cent. But in the year endiuc .lip - 30, 1S94, outof a total expenditure of 51 SJa.SSSSS, i he department applied 51 per cent ot th.it stun to scientific works and in vestigation. It is therefore very plainly bseivable that tho ecouomies which have been practiced in the administration of ill s department nave beeu at an expeuse i f scientific irs-arcli. "Ine recommendation contained in there pi it of the stcretary inlS93tliHt the v.c lciissjS'em ol promiscuous tree distribu te u of iis departmental documents be ill . ndoned, is iigain reserved. Tbc publi cations may well lie furnished without cost :o public libraries educational insti tutions and the i Ulcers of the Iitmuies of states, and the federal government, but ftom all individuals applying for them a price covering the cost of the document asked for should be required. Thus the publications and documents would he se cured by those who reiiliy desire them tor jisva'euse. Half a millioa of copies of the leport of the secretary of agriculture are printed for distribution at an annual cost about 300 0-30. Large numbers of them are cumbering store rooms at the capital and the shelves of seco id-hand book stores throucout the country. All this labor and waste might be avoided if the reeonirjeudatiou of the secretary weio tidip'td. OCJFCTS TO FKEE garden seeds. The secretary also again recommends that the gratuitous distribution of seeds cease and that no money be appropriated f r that purpose, except to experimental stations. TSE OF AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS. He reiteraies the reasons given iu liis re ject t for 1WP3 for discontinuing this unjust ifiable gratuity, aud I fully concur in the conclusion which he has reached. A further important utility in agricul tural statistics is found in their elnctda ii ii of the relMtion of the supply of farm proi'uc's to the deinnnd for them in the ru rkets of the United States and the rid. It is deemed possible that an agri cultural census mav be taken ch year ttirougn the agents of t e statistical division of the dep'Utment, S ch a course is commended for trial bv tl.e ii.jef of thatdivision.

CIVIL SERVICE HEFOHSI. Growinc Public Appreciation of Its Ad vantages lioted. The advantages to the public service of an adherence to Mie principles of civil service leform are constantly more appar ent, aud nothing is so encoursging to those in olicial life who honestly .e-i'e good government as the increasing appreciation by our people of thoeadvant.igtS.

National Board of Health Is Urged. I am entirely convinced that we ought not to be longer without a uational bonrd ot health, composed of national health officers, charged with no other duties than such as pertain to the protection of our couutty trom the invasion ot pestilence ami disease. This would involve the establishment by such board or officer, of proper Quarantine precautious or ttie nec essary aid and counsel to locate authorities on the subject, prompt, advice and assist ance to local bands of health .aid health I officers in the siinyression of con t.tgioU3 diseases, and iu c-i'-cs waere there are no such local hoards or officers, the immedi ite direction by the natiouiil board or oliiter of measures of supjiiession, constant aud authentic tulor iuation concerning the health of foreign countries and all parts of our own country Hr. rel ite.s to contagious diseases mid con sideration of regulations to be enforced iu foreign purts to prevent the iutroductio-i of contagion intoi.ur cities and the meas ures which shauld be adopted to secure their euforcenient. IXTEIJN'ATIOXAL HEALTH CONFERENCES. There seems to be at ibis time a decided inclination to discuss measures of protec tion against contagious diseases iu inter-nttiou-tl conference with a view to adopt ing means of mutual assistance. The creation of such a national health estab lisluneiit would grently aid our standing in such conferences and improve our op Doriuuities to avail ourselves of their ben efits. I earnestly leeomniend that the in auguration of a national board of health or similar national instrumentality, be lieving the same to be a needed precaution against contagious disease and in the in terest of the safety aud health of the peo ple.

ABOUT IHE TARIFF. Recommendations as to Coal, Iron, Su gar and Ships. The tariff act passed at the last session o fcongies needs important amendments. If it is executed etfectively and with cer tainly iu addition to such tiecis-ary amendments as wili not change rates of duty. I am st.Il wry greatly iu favor of putting coal and iron upon the free lis'. j So far as the sugar schedule is concerned I ' would beglaiunderexistingaggravations, ! to s-e evei v p irtiole or dlfferenti'il duty in favor of it fined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If, with all the favors iioa- ac corded the sugir refining luterests by our I tnriil law, it close its reflaeries and dis charges its workmen it would seem to , present a hopeless case for reasonable leg I isl.itive aid. Whatever else is done, or omitted, I ear nestly repu.it heie the reconimetidatiou I have made in another portion f this com mutiicaiion that the aaditioual duty of one-tenth of a cent per pound levied upoi sugar imported from cotin-ries p i yiug a bounty tor its export, bj abrt gated. It seems to me that exceedingly important considerations point to the propruty of this amendment. With the advent of a new tariff policy, notonly contemplated to relieve the consumers of our laud in the cost of their daily life, but 'o invite a bet ter development of American thritt. and create for us closer and more profitable commercial relations with the rest of the world, it follows as a logical aud imperative necessity thit we at once remove tho chief, if not ouly, ob stacle which has so long prevented our participitioa ia the foreign carrying trade of the sea. TWO 

TAF.IFF THEOr.IES COMI'Ar.ED. A tariff built upon tlu theory that if is well to check imports and that a home market should bound the Indus-rv aud effort of American producers Is fitly supplemented hy a refusal to allow an American registry to vessels built abroad thouh owned and navigate1, by our peo ple, thus exhibiting a willingness to abandon all CJtitest far the adv.ntiges of American trans-oceanic carriage. Our new tariff policy bill is upou tuetheiy that it is well to encourage such importa tions. Our people's nee I tlrtt our products and manufactures shou d find a uiarKet in every part of the habitable globe, is con sistently supplemented bv ttie creati st Iiossib'e liberty to the citizen in the owner s' ip and navigation of ships in which our pro nets aud inxiiufactures liln be trails. ported. Them l.iusUOvv paid to for igo-rr- for carrying American passenger and products across tue sea should be turned luto American hads. Shipbuilding, which has been protected to strangulatu-n, shotiid he rev v.d by the propect of pr. fi -hble employment for snips when built, and the Amer.can stilor shoul-1 be resuirected aud again tke his place, a s-urdy and indus' nous citizen iu time of pe.iceand . patiiouc aud sfe defeuder of Ameiican interests in the dtyoi conflict. j The aucien" provision of nr :w detiving j American registry to ships built abroaj I nd owned bv Americius, appears, in fe I ligi.t of present conditions, uot only to bi ! a failure for good at every point, but to be nearer a relic of brbn-m than Miiythmg that exists uuder the permission of a stat t ute o! the United Stales I earnestly rec- ommeuu its prompt repeal. 

NATIONAL FINANCES. Wherein tha Rsp t emd Necessity of Bond lasnes Are Defended. During the last montn the gold reserves in the treasury tor the purpose of redeem ing the noies of the government circulat- , ing as money ia the hands of the people. ! became bo reduced and us further deple-! tion in the near future seemed so certain that in the exercise of a proper care for the public welt tre it b'Cinu uecessa-y to rep'eiiish this reserve aud thu- mamtaiu popular faith ia the ability and determina tion of the government to meet, ss agreed, its pecuniary obligations. It would nave have been "weil if in thisemergeucy au thority had existed to issue the bonds of the government bearing a low rate of luier est and maturing within a special peri'd, but the congress having fe.iled to cot.fer such authority, reorc was necsarily had to the resumption act of 1S75, ami pursuant to its provisions, bonds were issued, drawing interest' at the rate of 5 per cent per annum and maturing ten years aft-r their issuing, that bring the shortest time atitboriz-d by the act. I am glad to say, however, that Oi the sale of tliee bouds,the premium received oper tted to reduce the rate of interest to b- pu;d by the government to less than 3 per ceut. Nothing could bo worrc or further re moved from sensible finance than the re lations existing between the currency the governnit has issued, tha gold held for its redemption aud the means which must be res jrfed to for the purpose of re plenishingsuch redemption fuad when im paired. OBLIGATIONS WniCII AltE NOT CANCELLED. The claims upou this fund were confined to the obligations origiuahy intended and tf the redemption cf tao-e obligations meant their cas.cellatiou the fund would be very small. But these obligations when received and redeemed in gold are not can celled, but are reissued aud m iy do duty many times by way of drawing i.oId from the treasury. Thus we haw an endless claim in operation constantly deple'iug the treasury's gold aud never near a fi nil rest, as if this were not bd enough we have by a statutory declaration tha'. it is the policy of the government to maiutiiiu the parity between gold and silver aud the foi-ce una momentum of this exh lusting process are added largely to the currency obligations claimui4 tUis pecu lir gold redemption. Our small gold re serve is thus subjected to draw from every side. The demands that increase our dan ger also increases the necessity of protect ing this reserve ag dust depletion aud it is most unsatisfactory to know that the pro tection afforded is ouly a temporary pallia tion. It is perfectly and palpably pla'u that the ouiy way uuder present condi tions by which this reserve when danger ously depleted can oe replenished is through the issue aud sale of the bonds of the government for gold. 

DENT BOTH IUGIIT AND POWER. Yes, congress has not only thus far de clined to authorize the issue o' bauds brst suited to such a purpose, hut there seems a di-pii&ition in some quarters to deny both the necessity aud power for the issue ot ootids at all. I c iiiuor for a moment be lieve that any of our citizens aredeiiber ately willing that their goverumontshould default iu its pccuuiaryobiigitious, or that its liuuucial opera ions should be reduced to a silver bases. At any rate I should uot fee! that mv duty was done if I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a caiamuy. As loug, therelore, as no provision is mads tor the filial redemption on the juitting aside of the currency obligation how u-ed is re peatedly aud coust-utly to draw from the government its go d, aud as long as no bet ter authority for bond i-sues is allowed than at present exists, such authorit will he utilized whenever and as often as it be comes necessary, to miiiutain a sufficient gold reset ve and in absolute time to save the credit of ttie country and make good the liuuucial declaiatious of our govern ment. 

BANKING AND CURRENCY. Refers to C rlisle's Report, Whose Plan Ho Praises Boundlessly. Que-fous relating 10 bauks aud curren cy are closely couuected with the subject just leferred to and I hey also preseut some unsatisfactory featurrs. Prominent among them are the lack of elasticity in ourcurieucy circulatioi ami its fiequent concentration in financial centers w hen It is most ueeded iu other parts of the coun try. The ab-OiUtedivorcemeiit ot thegov ernmeut from the business of banking is the ideal relaiionshiu of the government to the circulation of the currency of the country. This condition cannot bo immediately reached but as a step in that direct ion and as a means of securing a more elastic cur rency aud obv a' ing oi her obj- c ions to the present arr tgenientof bank circulation ttie seen t try f the ireu-uiy prseuis his report, A scuemu modifying present banking lnw and providing for the issue of circu lating not-s by state banks iree from tax utiou under certain limitations. The sscretary explains lm plan so plainly, and its advantages are developed by him wild such remarkable clearness, that nnv effort on my part to present argu ments in us support would be Mip-tfluons. I shall therefore ronteut myself with an unqualified indorsement of tlie secretary's proposed changes in ttie law imiU a br:-f and imperfect statemeut of their promi nent teanires. NO 

FCHTI1ER TiOND DEPOSITS. It is proposed to repeal all laws provid ing lor the deposit of United states bonus as secuiity for circulation: to permit uatiouul banks 10 issue circulating notes not exceeding in amount 75 per cent of their paid up and unimpaired capital, pro vided they deposit with the government as a guarantee fund iu the United S'r.tes legal tender notes, including treasury notes of 1590, a sum equal in amount to 30 per cent of tne notes iliey desire to issue, this deposit to be maintained Ht all times, but whenever any bank retires any part cf its circulation a part of its guarantee fund shall be returned to It; to per mit the secretary of the treasury lo prepare and keep on h ind ready for issue .n case an Increase iu cucuution is desired, blank national bmk notr-s for each hank having circulation; and to repeal the pro visions of ttie present law imposing limita tions and restrictions upou banks d siring to reduce or increase their circulation, thus permitting such increase or reduction wuhin the limit ot T3 per cent of capital. to be qti ckly made as emergency arises. In audition lothe guarantee fund required it is proposed to provide a safety tuud for the immediate redemption of tne cir culation notes of failed bitiks by- Im posing a small annual tax, sty one-half of 1 per cent upon the average circulation of each hank until the fund amounts to 5 per ceut of the total circulation outstand ing.

"When a bank falls its guarantee fnud 8 to be paid .nio this satetv fund and it-, notes are to be redeemed in tlie first in stauce from such sfety fund thus aug mented, any impairment cf snch fund could thereby be made good from the im mediately available cash assets of snil bank, and if these shouid be insufficient, such impairment to be made go--d by pro rata assessment am"Hg the ctuer bank, their contributions constiMi'iog i firs h-u Aseptic.

As a further security it is contemplated that the existing provision fixing the indi vidual liability of stockholders is to bere t lined and the bank's indebtedness, on ac count of its cii dilating notes, is to be made a first lien on all JL assets. For the purpose of m-etiug the exD-uses of print ing notes, official supervision, cancella tion, tud other like charges, there shall be imposed a tax of, say one half of 1 per cent per annum upon tne average amount of uotesin circulation. FCRTHEK PROVISIONS PROPOSED. It is further provided that there shall be no u.itioual bauk notes issued of a less denomination lhau $10; that that each national bauk. except iu case of a failed biuk. shall redeem or retire its notes in the first instance at its own office or at agencies to be designated by it and that no fixed reserve be maintained ou ac count of deposits. Another very impor t tut feature of this plati is the exemption of state banks trom tax-itiou by the United States in cases where it has been shown to the satisfaction of the secretary of the treasury aud comptroller of the currency by banks claiming such exeniDtion, that they have not bad outstanding their cir culating no'es exceeding 7." per cent of their piid up and unimpaired capital; that tneir stockholders aie ludividually liable for the redemption of their circulat lag notes to the full extent of the owner ship of stock; that the liability of such b ink- upon their circulating notes consti tutes uuder tbeirstate law a first lien upon their assets; that such banks have kent and maintained a guarantee fund in United States legal tender notes, lucludiug treas ury notes of l&'JO, equal to 30 ter ceut of their outstanding circulating notes, and that such banks have pronip-ly redeemed their circulating notes vneii preseut.ed at their principal or branch ollice. It is quite likely that this seheme may be useful, amende 1 iu some of its detiils, but I am satisfied it furnishes a basis for a very great improvement in our present bat.klug aud currency system. I conclude this communication, tully appreciating iht the respjnsibility for legislation affecting the people of the Uuited States rests upon their representatives in the con gress, and assuring them that whatever they accord with recommendations I have mad-, or not, J shall ho glad to co-operate in perfecting any legislation that tends to the prosperity aud uelf ire of our country.
