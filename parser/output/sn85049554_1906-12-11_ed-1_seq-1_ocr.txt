TRANSMITS A SPECIAL MESSAGE sive—Island Affairs as Now Admin­ istered. 1» Dec. 11.—President I could not embark at San Juan be cause the harbor has not been dredg ed out and can not receive American battleships. I do not think this fact creditable to us as a. nation, and I earnestly hope that immediate provis ion will be made for dredgi'nig San Juan Harbor. "I doubt whethei- 'Our people' as' a whole realize the beauty and fertility of Porto Rico, and the progress that has" been made under its admirable government. We have just cause for .pride in the character..of our represen tatives who have administered -the tropic Islands which came under" our flag as a result of the war with -Spain juid of no one of, them is this mor$ true than of Porto Rico. It would be im possible to- wish' a more faithful a more efficient and a more disinterested public service than that now being ren dered in ttife island of Porto Rico by those In control of the insular govern ment. "I stopped at a dozen towns all told, •nd one of the notable features in every town was :he gathering of the school children. The work 'that has "been done in Porto Rico for education •has been noteworthy.

Sugar and loDacco. 'In traversing the island even the most cursory survey leaves the behold er struck with the evident rapid growth In the culture boti of the. sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit industry is also growing. Last year was the most prdsperous year that the island has ever known before or since the Amer ican occupation. The total of exports end imports of-the island was $45,000, 000, as against $18,000,000 in 1$01. This is the largest in the island's history. Prior to the American occiftjation the greatest trade for any one| year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly J23.000.000. Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that, there was In th^ most prosperous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last year, of value of $14,186,319 $3,555,163 of Wbacco, and 28,2im,322 pounds of cof fee of the value 01' $3,481,102. Unfor­ tunately, what used to be Porto Rico's prime crop—coffee—has not shared this prosperity. It has never recovered from the disaster of tl?e hurricane, and moreover, the beneiit of throwing open our market to it has not"compensated for the loss inflicted by the closing of "the markets to it abroad. I call your attention to the accompanying memo rial on this subject, of the board of trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hope that some measure will be taken for the benefit of the excellent and high grade Porto Rican coffee. A Plea for Citizenship. "There is a matter to -which I wish to call your special at'tenition, and that is the. desirability of coiferring full Am erican citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can possibly result from it, and it seems to me a matter of right and justice to the .people of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to foe 'Un, der our flag, they are making ra-pid progress along the nath of orderly lib erty. -Surely we should show our ap preciation of them, our ptjide in what they have done, and our pleasure in ex tending recognition for what has thus been done, by granting them full Am erican citizenship.

De spite the protests of many that there is "nothing doing" in the matter of the senatorial succession, the fact re mains that some things are being done. What is the truth in regard to the" various and sundry stories in circula tion here and elsewhere in regard to the effort to defeat Dolliver? Some of the railroad organs have tried to make it out that it was a deep laid plot of th-e progressives to get the people to ment to shelve the junior senator.

The motives back of the movement and what it is expected to accomplish remain a mystery. A few days ago a leading politician, who was in the service of the railroads during the past summer previous to the republican state'convention, asked your of a te There is reason to believe that the man knew much more than he would dare tell. It has developed in the last few days that one of the newspapers most devoted to the cause of railroads .has sent out to members a long list of questions for them to answer and to commit themselves upon, including among other things, the question of the senatorship. Ostensibly this is for pub lication. But those who are active in regard to the senatorship. will have access to all the facts before the pub lic can know. It is said, however, •that the supposedly verdant new mem bers are not ijery. free with telling where they stand. A fe\« days ago a representative in a northern Iowa county who might be supposed, because of the character of his pre-convention fight to be free from entanglements, received a letter from a subordinate state official who lives in the southern tier of counties asking him if he was committed to Dolliver and whether he would be will ing to support Governor Cummins. He made the letter known to a warm friend of the governor, stating that wthile he would be delighted to sup port Cummins he is pledged to Dolliver and will vote for him. About the same time a southern Iowa senator, one not a friend of Governor Cummins, was approached tjy one who represented himself to toe speaking for Mr. Blythe, and he was asked to sup port Cummins for the senate against Dolliver. He was puzzled to know what it means and in making inquir ies let out the fact. Two other members of the house re cently asked a friend for advice as to what they should do and intimated that they had been -approached on the same subject. The disclosure thru Raymond Pat terson. at Washington, -that t.he politi cal dictator of the Pullman company, a bitter enemy of Governor Cummins, is deeply interested in efforts being made to get members to commit them selves against Dolliver, has some bear ing on the case. All this is without the knowledge or consent of Governor Cummiris and his friends. They have neither started it or encouraged it, and they frankly con fess It is mystifying to them. Several theories have been advanced# is to what It means. One is that his enemies realize that it is only a matter at time until Governor Cummins will go to the senate anyway and they 1 whole thing then a great blunder has been committed, for such a plot at of a„ needs publIclty. wonder is that the story was well send him now, making u: lim to get rid of Dolliver, who .d& himself almost equally ob 1: to the railroad interests, and a same time paving t'he way for their kind to go to the senate to .1 Allison. I- her theory advanced is that the raiuuads want to get rid of Cummins. They failed to beat him for the nomi nation jnd they failed to beat him in the election. There is no doubt of their sincerity in desiring to get him out of the chair of the governor. They figure that he would be less harmful to them at Washington than in Des Moines. For a time, at least, he would not be able to accomplish much in a body constituted as the senate is now. "We would be better off by $500,000 a year in taxes," said the general man ager of the railroad anti-Cummins campaign last summer. "If we had permitted Cummins to go to the senate as0 Our tight upon him has been a costly one for us. We must get rid of him In some way." That was the sentiment which ani mated the man who handled the funds put up to "get rid of Cummins" last summer. It is now pointed out that one way to hdlp matters, from the standpoint of the railroads, would be to send Cummins out of the state. But all these theories have faults. The belief prevails among better in formed Dersons that all that is sought by the present manifestations of trick ery Is to get up a quarrel as between Dolliver and Cummins and to Induce some of the governor's friends to break faith with the friends of the /senator then In the melee to make a rush for some other candidate for the senate, thus defeating Dolliver without favor ing Cummins. Let it be recalled that the story as originally printed in this correspondence just three weeks ago presented this view and it was not there claimed nor has It ever been claimed that the movement is In fact one to elect Cummins senator against Dolliver. It Is primarily a plot against Dolliver, making use of Cummins' name. It Is entirely probable that, In view of the pu'bllclty given the matter, the plotters will be forced to abandon their plans, and to make an effort to cover their tracks by disclaimers.

N E 2 9 5 I Interesting Debate Relative to the Adoption of the Report of Committee BURROWS ROASTS UTAH MAN Declares the Methods of His Eleotlon to the Senate Should Bar Him From Sitting in Congress—Terms Church and Politics of State Are Virtual Hierarchy. Washington, Dec. 11.—The special order in the senate today was the hearing on the report of the commiit tee on elections relative to -the ca#e of Senator Smoot, of Utah. The first address was made by Senator Burrows, of Michigan, who favored -the unseat-1 ing of, Smoot. -Burrows said that there has been so proof submitted to sustain the allega tion that Smoot is a polygamic, add ing that the recommendation of t{ie committee on privileges and elections, in favor of declaring vacant the seat of the Utah senator, is not based on such a charge. Burrows' Impeachment was based entirely upon the connec tion of Smoot with the governing body of the church, consisting of the pres idiency and twelve apostles. He re ferred to this body as a "hierarchy" and said it possesses practically every political position in the state govern ment. He cited many instances qf po- litical interference not only in Utah, but adjoining states, and quoted at length the church manifesto of 1896, requiring members to obtain consent of the hierarchy before becoming can didates for office. Smoot has been compelled to obtain tills permission. "He was nominated by the hierar chy," said Burrows, "and the selection was ratified by the legislature." He said that Smoot's membership in the church governing body which incul cates the belief in polygamy, is con ceded that proof is indubitable that in 9plte of the manifesto of 1890, is sued by the head of the church, e|un seling suspension of polygamy, the mar jorlty of the memlbers of the hierarchy: are today opeiily and confessedly de fying the laws of the land prohibiting such crimes. The record is so shock ing as to challenge credulity.". He declared that "it is shown by tes timony that a majority of the apostles are living in a' polygamous cOhabita- tlon, including President Smith. Plural marriages are performed in secret in the darkened rooms of highways re mote from habitation." Coming to the connection of Smoot with the hierarchy Burrows said that practically all the members were polygamlsts when he became a member. "The vital question therefore Is," he said, "can one be come a member and identify himself with a band of law breakers, knowing them to be such, participate in their counsels, sustain them in their confer ences and yet escape ,all -responsibility for their unlawful acts? Such a con tention will not stand the test of either law or reason." "The senator's complicity in encour aging polygamy and polygamous co habitation does not consist wholly in the fact that he is one of the governing body cf that church. By repeated acts he has, as a member of the quorum of twelve apostles, given active aid and support to the hierarchy and its defi ance to the statutes of this state and the laws of common decency, and In its encouragement of polygamous prac tices by both precept and example." Burrows concluded by saying: "I submit that an organization that fosters and encourages crime, practices polygamy and polygamous cohabita tion, desecrates the home, undermines and shakes1 the foundation of human society and government, deifies the au thority of state and national govern ment, Is not entitled to have Its rep resentatives in the senate of the United States, and I therefore ask the adap tion of the resolution." j.
