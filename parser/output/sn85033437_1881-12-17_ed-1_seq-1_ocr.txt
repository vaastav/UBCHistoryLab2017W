MORNING. DECEMBER 17. 1881.

After singing'the o!d familur song and pray ing the old familiar prayer, the 'Squire conducted the parson to the bed-room designed for the rest of th good old ser vant. "What do yon call this?" askad the parson, regarding with yj air of inter est a mosquito-bar, suspended over the bed. " Why, that is a mosquito-bar." " What account is it ?" ' " To keep'on the mosquitoes." " Brother Muckle, I thought that you were too sensible a man to give away to these town fixins. You told ro that when I Cfjne to se you that we) would have revival f the o!d days. Now yon want to hang the thing over me. Take it down, please. I'm afraid that the vanity that I've allers heard lurked about these towns is taking hold of you." The bar was taken down, and the old man blew out the candle, which he al ways carried iu his saddle-bags, with a " puff," and retired. The 'Squire and Mrs. Muckle slept in an adjoining room. They had been in bed but a few moments when Mrs. Muckle remarked : " What was that noise ?" " Pow-peng I" came from the adjoin ing room. I don't know what it is," answered the "Squire, stuffing the corner of the pillow into his mouth. ' Slap !" came from the next room. - " Did you hear that ?" exclaimed Mrs. Muckle. " It'a nothing," said the 'Squire. " Something is shaking this bed, Mr. Muckle." ' Slap, slap !" " Go in there and see what's the mat ter with the parson, Mr. Muckle." "Chuck, chuck, chuck," was all that Muckle could say. " You act like a man that hasn't got any sense. You'd lie here and see a man did In the next room." ' " How can I lay here and (chuck) see a man in the (chuck next room ? The door is shut and the light's out." "Slap, bang !" " You must go in there, Mr. Muckle." "Why don't yeugo?" "Think I'm going into a man's room? All right ; if the old man dies it aint my fault;" and Mrs. Muckle turned over, Muckle chuckled himself to sleep. Next morning when the parson ap peared at the breaifast table, he pre- sentea a swoiten appearance. JUia face was covered with bumps, and his hands looked as though they had the nettle rash. " I lay there and fiarht them thinm all night," he said, solemnly. "Reckon youd better put up that thm looking sheet," and bowing over his plate, he said, "Gracious Lord, make us thank ful for these.

Interesting -Ceremonies Over the Cincinnati, December 15. To-day the floral ship presented by the business men of this city to the managers of the Atlanta Exposition was received in charge of a body of ladies and gentlemen of Atlanta, known as a floral ship, but freighted with Southern products. - A formal reception was held at the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. The hall was beautifully decorated with j flags, and the good ship, represented as floating in a sea of moss, was placed in front of the speaker's stand. Its sheathing was of cotton, and it was profusely burdened with all manner of Southern products. The body of the hall wasT'fifled "with ladies and gentlemen. The Atlanta deputation was escorted into the hall by a band playing "Dixie," amid applause, which was renewed, when the band played "Hail Columbia."; Speeches were made byMayor Means, William j Harvey, vice -President of Ihe Cham ber of Commerce, and S. F. Coving ington, president of the Board of Trade and Transportation, welcom ing Atlanta visitors. Mayor Cummings, of Atlanta, then introduced Mr. Samuel W. Small, of Atlanta, who made a graceful re sponse. In the course of his speech, he said that he belonged to the New Sout h which has learned to labor and which found greater glory in the dust of toil on the face, than in military insignia ou the breast. He declar ed that if the South hereafter was spoken of as a section, it would be because it contributed more than any other to the advancement of the material interests of - the nation. His allusion to the late President as the " Best earth that ever graced a man," pi oduced hearty applause Ex Gov. Noyes replied, paying a compliment to the bravery of the Confederate troops, ' and saying, among the first to fraternize after the war were the men who had fought the hardest, while last to do so were those who were invincible in peace but invisible in war. Miss Rachiel Cummings, of Atlan ta, then, in a graceful speech, present ed a number of handkerchiefs made at the Exposition as souveners of the occasion. To-night the party will attend the concert at Mtuic Hall, and to morn row they will start homeward by way of Frankfort, Ky., to escort the Legislature of Kentucky to Atlanta. A Lady". Wish. .
