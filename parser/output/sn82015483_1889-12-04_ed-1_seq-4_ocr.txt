INDIANS. - The report of tha secretary of the interior exhibits tha transactions of the government with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress haa been made in the eduoation of children of sohool age and the allotment of lands to adult Indiana. It la to be regretted that the Dollor of breaking the tribal relation and deallna with Indiana, aa an Individual, did not appear earlier la our legielation. Large reservations, held in common, and the main tenants, of tha authority of tba ohlefs and head men have deprived the Individual of every incentive to the sxerolse of thrift, and the annuity has contributed an affirmative Impulse toward a atata of conBrmed pauper ism. Our treaty stipulations should bs ob served with fidelity end our legislation should be highly aonsldsrata of tha best interests of aa Ignorant and helpless people. The reserve, tlons are now generally surrounded by white settlements. We oan no longer pusn tne In dian baok Into tha wilderness, and it remains only, by every suitable agency, to push him upward into tha state of a self-supporting and responsible eltlsen. For the adult, the first step is to locate him npon a farm, and for the child, to place him in a sohool. Sohool attandanoe should be promoted by every moral agency, and thna failing, shonld bs compelled. Tha national schools for Indians have been very successful and ahould be multiplied, and, as far as possible, should bs so organized and oondnoted aa to facilitate the tranafer of tha school to States or teni lories In which they are located when the In diana in a neighborhood nave accepted citi zenship and have become otherwise fitted for such a tranafer. This condition of things will be attained slowly, but it win bs hast ened by keeping It in mind. In the mean time, that co-operation between the govern ment and the mission sohools, whloh has brought much good, shonld be oordlally and Impartially maintained. TBB LANS LAWS. In ths administration of tha land lawr, the policy of facilitating, in evsry proper way, ths adjustment of tba honest claims of indi vidual settlers npon the public lands haa been pursued. The number of pending oasts had during tha proceeding administra tion bean greatly inoressed under the opera tion of orders for a time suspending aotlon in a large part of the oasea originating in the West and northweet, and by tbe subsequent use of unusual methods of examination. Only thoae who are familiar with the con ditions under whloh our agricultural lands hsvs been settled can appreciate ths serious and often fatal oonseonenoes to ths settler of a policy whloh puts his title nndsr suspicion or delsya the lssnanoe of his patent. While care ia taken to prevent and expose frand, it shonld not be imputed without reason. The manlteet purpose of the homestead and pre emption lawa was to promote the settlement of the pabllo domain by persons having a bona fide intent to mske a home npon tbe aeleoted lends. Where this intent is well established and the requirements of the law have been substantially complied with, the claimant la entitled to tha prompt and friend ly consideration of his ease. But wnsre mere ia reason to believe thst ths olsimsntia ths mere agent of another who ia aeeklng to evade a law Intended to promote small hold logs snd to seoure by f rsudulent metbode large tracts of timber and other lands, both prin cipal and agent should not only bs thwarted In their fraudulent purpose, but snouia be made to feel the full penalties of oar crimi nal atatutea. Tha lawa ahould be so admin istered as not to oonfonnd these two olssses and to visit penalties only upon ths latter. The unsettled state of tha titles to large bodies of lands in the territories of New Mexico and Arizona has greatly retarded the development of those territories. Provision should be made by law for the prompt trial and final adjustment before ladlcial tribunal or commission of all olalma based upon Mex loan grants. It la not just to an Intelligent and enterprising people thst thslr peace should bs disturbed and their prosperity re tarded by these old contentions. I express the hope that difference of opinion as to methods may yield to the urgency of the PENSIONS. Ths law now provides a pension for evsry soldier and sailor who wss mustered in ths service of the United States during tha otvll war and la now suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in tha service and In the line of daty. Two or three nsoeetary facte, via: muster snd disability, are usually susceptible of essy proof; but tbe third, origin in the servloe, is often dlSoult, and in many deserving oases impossible to estab lish. That vsry many of those who endured the hardships of our most bloody and arduoua campaigns, are now disabled from disease that had a real, but not traceable origin in the service, I do not donbt. Besides these Is aaotbsr olsss sompoeed of men, many of whom served an enlistment of three full yeara and of re-enllsted veterana who added a lonrtn year of ssrvies, who escaped the aasnaltlea of battle and tha assaults of dis ease, who were alwaya ready for any detail, who were in every battle line of their command and were mustersd out in sound hsalth, and have, alnoe the close of the war, while flgting with tbe same indomitable and been overcome by disease or casualty. I am not unaware that tba peneion roll al ready Involves a vsry large annual expendi ture. Neither am I deterred bv that fact from recommending that Congress grant a Jensloa to noh honorably discharged sol isrs and sailors of tbe eivll war as having rendered substantial service daring the wsr era now dspendsnt npon their own labor for a malatalnanoe, aad by disease or casualty are incapacitated from earning it. Many of tba men who wonld be inoluded in thie form of relief are now dependent upon publio aid and it does not, in my judgment, consist with national honor that they shall continue to subsist anon ths local relief siren indis criminately to paupers, instead of npon the special and generous provision of ths nstlon may served so gallantly and unselfishly. Onr people will, I am aura, very generally ap prove snob legielation. And I am eauallv aura that the aurvivora of tbe Union army and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief when this worthy and suffering olsas of their oomrades la fairly carad for. There are soma manifest Inequalities ia tha existing law that snouia be remedied, to some of these the secretary of tha Interior has called atten tion. It is gratifying to be able to state that, try tbe adoption of nsw and better methods in tba war department, tba call, of the pension offloe for information aa to the military and nospiiai reeorda of pension claimants are mors promptly secured, and the injurious and vexatious delays that have heretofore occurred are entirely avoided. Thla will fa cilitate greatly tha adjustment of all pend ing claims. miUS Of BAEUMAD MX jr. , The attention of ' tbe interstate oommeroe commission baa been called to the urgent need of oongresslonsl legislation for ths bat- tar protection for tbellfea and limbs of those engsged in operating the great Interstate lines of the country, and especially of tbe yardmen and brakemen. A petition algned by nearly ten thousand railway brakemen was presented to the commission, asking that eteps might be taken to bring about the use of automatic brakes and couplers on freight ears. At a meeting of State railroad oom- mtsslonsrs nod their ncandltarl VAnresenta- Uvea, held at Washington in March fast.npon tha invitation of tha lntaretate commerce commission, a resolution was unanimously adopted urging the commission tooooslder what can be done to prevent th. Ins. of Ufa I ana lima in coupling and uncoupling freight i ears and In handling the brakes of sooh cars, f During lbs year sndiog Jans 80, 1888, over I 2,000 railroad employes were killed in service statement of a few authenticated facts snd and more than 2,000 Injured. It is compe- some general suggestions u to lerial tant,Ithink, for Congress to require nnU tlon is aU that la practicable. That the great formityta the construction of cars nsed in steamship lines sailing under tba flaga of interstate commerce and the nee of Improved England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy aatety appliances upon auoh trains.

It is a reproach to our civilization that any class of American workmen should, In tbe pursuit of a necessary and useful vocation, be aubjeoted to a peril of Ufa and limb as great aa that of a soldier in time of war. TBB WOBUJ'S TAIX. The propoaltlon to observe the fonr hua- dredth anniversary of the discovery of Amer- ica by the- opening of a World's fair or exposition in some one of our great cities will - be presented for the consideration of Con- " TBB OTTIL SIBVTCB COMMISSION. On the 4th of March last tha civil service commission had but a single member. The vacancies were filled on the 7th of May and slaoe then tha eommiaslonera have been ln- dustriously,thongh with an Inadequate force, engaged In extending the law. They were assured by me that a cordial support would be given them in tha faithful and impartial enfereement of the statute and of the rules and regulations adoptsd In aid of It. There fore the book of ellgiblea hsa been closed to everyone, except as certifications were made npon the requisition of j the appointing effi- xnis secrecy waa tne source or mucn ausptolon and of many charges of favoritism in the administration of the law what is secret is always suspected; what is open oan be judged. The commission, with the full approval of all its members, has now opened tha list of eligibles to the publio. Ths eligi ble lists for the classified postoffices and cus tom houses are now publicly posted in tbe respective offioes, as are also the certificates for appointments. The purpose of ths civil service law was absolutely to exolude any other consideration in connection with ap pointments under it than that of merit as tested by tha examination. The business proceeds upon the theory that both the ex amining boards fend ths appointing officers are absolutely ignorant aa to the politioal viewa and associations of all persons on the civil service lists. It is not too mush to say, however, that some recent congressional In vestigations have somewhat shaken publio confidence in the Impartiality of the selec tions for appointment. The reform of the olvil service will make no safe or aatlsfaotory advance until the present laws are well established in the con fidence of ths people. It will be my pleasure, as it is dnty, to see that ths law is executed with firmness and impartiality. If some of these provisions have been fraudulently evaded by appointing officers,our resentment should not suggest repeal of the law, but reform In its administration. We have one visw of the matter and hold it with a sincer ity thst ia not affected by the consideration that the party to which we belong is for a time in power. 

EDUCATION AND TBB GOVERNMENT. The interest of the general government in the education of the people found an early expression, not only in tha thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, bnt in liberal appropriations from the common resources for the support of education in the new States. No one will deny that it la of the gravest national con cern that thoae who hold the ultimate con trol of all pnblio affairs ahould have neoes sary intelligence wisely to direct and deter mine them. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form tbe constitutions! power of Congress to promote the ednoatlon of the people la not seriously questioned. I do net think it can be susoeesfully questioned. when the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the publio treasury. Such aid should be, aa it always haa been, sug gested by some exceptional conditions. The audden emancipation of the elaves of the South, the bestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of the ability or tne states where these new citi zens were chiefly found, to adequately pro- viae eauoauonai xaoillties. presented not on- ly exceptional but unexampled conditions. That the aituation has been muoh amelior ated there ia no donbt. The ability and interest of tbe State, have happily increased. But the great work remain, to be dona, and I think the general government ahould lend it. aid. Aa tha suggestion of a national grant in aid of eduoation grows chiefly out of the condition and needa of the emanci pated slave and his descendants, tha relief shonld, aa far as possible, while necessarily proceeding upon aome general lines, be ap- puaa to in. un mat anggeatea it. it is essential, it much good ia to be accom plished, tnat tne sympathy and aotive in terest of the people should be enlisted, and that the methods adopted ahould be each as to stimulate and not enDDlant local taxation of sohool purposes. As one Congress can not bind a succeeding one in such a case, and as ths effort must in some degree be experimental, I recommend that any appro- S nation mane lor thla purpose be so limited i annual amount and aa to the time over whioh it ia to extend, as will, on the one hand, give the local school antborlties op portunity to make the best use of the first yesr's allowance, and on tha other, deliver them from the temptation to undulv post pone the assumption of the whole burden themselves. The colored people did not in trude themselvsa npon ns; they were brought here in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly found, bv a crnel elave code. Happily for both races, they are now free. NIOaOES AND TBB BALLOT. They have, from a standpoint of Ignorance and poverty, which was our shame, not theirs, made remarkable advances in educa tion and in the acquisition of property. They hsve, as a people, shown themselves to be friendly and faithful towards tha white rsce under temptation, of tremendous strength, They have their representatives in the na tional oemeteries, where a grateful govern ment has gathered tha aehea of those who disd in Its defense. They have furnlshtd to our regular army regimenta that have won high praise from thsir commanding officers for courage and soldierly qualities, and for fidelity to the enllatment oath. In civil life they are now the toilere of their communi tiee, making their full contribution -to the widening streams of prosperity which these communities are receiving. Their audden withdrawal would atop production and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop. Generally they do not desire to quit their homes, and their employers resent the Interference of the emigration agents who seek to stimulate such a desire: but, not withstanding all this, in msny parts of our country where the colored population is large, tha people of that race are, by various devices, deprived of any effective exercise of thsir political rights aad of many of their civil right. The wrong does not expend it self upon those whose votss are suppressed. Every constituency in the nation la wronged. It hss been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of respect for ths law wonld work a gradual onre of these flagrant evlla. Surely no one supposee that the pres ent can be aooepted as a permanent condi tion. If it is that these communities must work out this problem for themselves, we hsve a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Do they suggest any solution! Whsn and under what condition la the black man to have a free ballot I When is he in fact to have thoae full civil rights whloh have so long been bis in lawl Whan is that equali ty of Influence whloh our form of government was intended to seoure to the elections to be restored I This generation should courageous ly face these grave qusstions and not leave them aa a heritage of woe to the next. The consultation ahould proceed with candor, oalmness and great patlenoe npon tbe lines of jnslloe and numanlty, not of prejudice and ornelty. No question In our country can be at rest except npon the firm baa. of justice and of the law. I earnestly invoke tha attention of Congress to the consideration of such meas ures within its well defined constitutional powers as will seoure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under tha constitution and lawa of tha United States. No evil, however deplorable, oan juatify the assumptlon.either on tha part of the executive or of Congress, of power not granted; bnt both will be high ly blameable if oil the powers granted are not wisely bat firmly nsed to correct these evils. The power to take the whole direction aod control of the election of members of the House of Representatives ia olearly given to tbe general government. A partial and qualified supervision of these eleotions is now provided by law, and In my opinion this law may be so etrsngtbened and extended as to seonre, on the whole, better results than oan be attained by a law taking all the process of suoh election Into federal control. The colored man should be protected in all of his relations to tbe federal government., whether litigant, juror or witness in onr oourts, aa an alsctor for members to Congress or aa a peaoef ul traveler npon onr inter-State rail ways. A NATIONAL BISQBACB. . There is nothiug more justly humiliating to the national pride, and nothing more hurt ful to national prosperity, then the Inferiority of our merchant marixe compared with that of other nations whose general resources, wealth and seacoaat lines do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on the sea. It was not always so; and our people are agreed, I thlnlr that It shall not contlnna to ba so. It la not mv purpose in this communication to discus, the cause, or tne decay or our ship- ping Interests, or tbe different methods by ', whloh it irproposed to restprs then. Ths one form or another, Is gsnerally known. That the American lines of steamship, have been abandoned by us to an unequal contest with the aidsd lines of other nations, until they have been withdrawn, or, in the fsw where thev are still maintained, are subject to serious disadvantages, is matter of : common knowledge. The present situation is suoh that travelers and : merohan find Liverpool often a . neo- canary intermediate port between New York and some oi mo doucu ahikimu Hwiaia Tha fact that some of the delegates from South American States to the conference of American nations, now in session at Wash ington, reached onr shores by reversing that line of travel, is very ooaolueire of the nsed of such a conference, and very auggeative as to the first and moat nacesaary otep In the direction of fuller and mora benafioial inter course with nations that are onr neighbors npon the lines of latitude, bnt not npon the linea of established commercial intercourse. TBB 

SUBSIDY QUBSTIOH. I recommended that auoh appropriations be made for ocean mall servloe in American steamships between onr ports and those of Central and South America, China and Ja pan, and the important Islands in both of tha great oceans, as will be liberally remun erative for the servloe rendered, and as will encourage the establishment and ia some fair degree equalize tha chances ef American steamship lines in the competitionwhioh they must meet. Thst Amerioanj.States lying south of us will cordially co-operate in estab lishing and maintaining suoh lines of steam ahipa to their principal ports I do not doubt. We should also make provisions for a naval reserve, to consist -of suoh merchant ships of American construction and of a specified ton nage and speed as the owners will consent to plaoe at the use of the government in case of need as armed cruisers." England has adopted this policy, and as a result can now, upon necessity, at once plaoe npon her naval list some of the fastest steamships in tne werld. A proper snpervision of the construction of such vessels would make thsir conversion to effective ships of war very easy. I am an ad vocate of economy in our national expendi tures; but it is a misuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds an ex penditure for the purpose of extending our foreign commerce; the enlargement and Im provement of our merchant marine; tbe de velopment of a sufficient body of trained American seamen, tha promotion of rapid and regular mail communications bstween the ports of other countries and our own.and the adoption of large and swift Americsn merchant steamships to naval uses in time of war, are publio purposes of the highest con cern. The enlarged participation of our peo ple in the carrying trade, tha new and in creased markets that will open for the pro ducts of our farms and factories, and the fuller and better-employment of mechanics, whloh will result from liberal promotion of our foreign commission insure the wideet possible diffusion of benefit to all the States and to all our people. Everything is most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal and progressive rralicy upon this sub jeot, and we should enter upon it with promptness and decision. The legislation which I have suggested, as it is sincerely believed, will promote thai peace and honor of our country and tbe pros perity and security of the people. - I invoke the diligent and serious attention of Congress to the consideration of these and such other measures as may be presented, having the same great end in view.
