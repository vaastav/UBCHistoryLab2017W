New York, Dec. 7.—The president's message yesterday together with the optimistic utterances of Governor Hard ing of the federal reserve board were influences of a constructive nature and stock market prices from the start were strong with particular buoyancry in such issues as General Asphalt, Famous Players, American Wool and others. As the session progressed some large size profit taking offerings -naie thn!r ap pearance and in the late dealings this became more pronounced with a result ant reaction from high prices of the day. The action of the mark-it in the late afternoon dealings woulJ seem to Indicate that heavy profit taking sales which were much in evidence may serve to cause a temporary extension of the setback in prices.—Logan Sc Br>an.

I Advices from Washington, which in : eluded the encouraging survey of gen ! erai business and industrial conditions I by the department of commerce, con j tributed largely to the early advance, j which embraced an unusual assortment I of industrial and special shares. ; There were a few prominent excep ; tlons to the higher trend, notably St. : Paul common and preferred, which were ! heavy under reports affecting the ccra i i, an y s ability to meet impending f-.xten I sive maturities. Pressure against mail order, shipping, ! high grade tobacco, secondary steel «nd sugar stocks, proceeded mainly from piofessional sources. These Issues were regarded as more or less vulnerable be cause of backward conditions in their respective lines. Sales amounted to 900,000 shares. Most of the day's demand loans were p":aced at 4% per cent on liberal offer ings, In which the local reserves of in terior banks were freely drawn upon. ; More 30 and 60 day loans were made at ! 4% per cent but offerings for longer i periods were scant. I Except the Dutch rate, which costtn : ued to strengthen, foreign exchange re acted in varying degrees from yester : day's substantial advance. Sterling lost ! 1% cents and vlrtuallly all continental j bulls were lower by five to almost 15 points, central European quotation» i also easing. ! Liberty issues and most other active i bonds gave way to further profit tak i Ing, but a few of the recently reorgan ! Ized rails were strong. ! Internationals were mixed, closing at moderate gains and losses. Total sales I (par value) $18,250,000. LIBERTY BONDS. !

CMcsug® M&irkdt GRAIN AND PROVISIONS Chicago, Dec. 7.—Fresh declines in the price of wheat took place today, larg ly as a result of lack of demand for cash wheat. The market closed unset tled, 1 cent to 1% net lower, with May, : $1.11% to $1.11%, and July $1.01 to ■ $1.01%. Corn finished %@% cents off to % cents advance, oats unchanged to %@% down, and provisions unchanged to a setback of 10 cents. Weakness in the wheat market was especially noticeable in the last half of the day, when selling of future de liveries became general because of the cash trade situation, red wheat pre miums here being 5 cents to 7 cents lower, and a car of No. 1 Northern sell ing at 10 cents over December as against 17 cents premium the last pre vious sale. Meanwhile Kansas mills were reported to be selling their cash wheat because of the poorness of flour trade, and Min neapolis mills were represented as sell ing December wheat at Kansas City. Such news had a discouraging effect on longs here, and they unloaded in com petition with pit bears. Talk of a big bank failure in south Germany counted also as a depressing factor. Word of some export business at the gulf of Mexico appeared to count but little as an offset. Profit taking by shorts, however, gave the market something of a rally at the last. Corn was relatively firm, owing to export demand here and at rural points as well. Oats were dull and Inclined to sag with wheat. Packing selling of lard weakened the provisions market after slight upturns had resulted from strength of hog val ues. The prices of futures ranged as fol lows: Open. High. Low. Close.

CORN GROWING PUTS RICHLAND IN SPOTLIGHT County in East End Accumu lates Big List of Prizes During Year. Richland county farmers have come to regard themselves as the premier corn producers of Montana, and point to their winnings at the state fair, at the Midland fair at Billings and at the state corn show at Miles City to justify their position, according to Charles I). Greenfield, agricultural de velopment agent for the Great North ern railway. Mr. Greenfield was in Great Falls Wednesday for a short time, after spending several days in the eastern end of the state. Result of Experiments Corn has been a more or less prom inent crop on the lower Yellowstone reclamation project in Richland county for several years, and many experi ments have been carried on to discover the varieties best adapted to the local ity, Mr. Greenfield stated. Progress of the experiments has reached a point that has given different varieties a permanent position on the project and this year farmers in the vicinity of Sidney, Fairview anud Savage deter mined to demonstrate what had been accomplished with the crop and en tered into competition with other sec tions of the state. "In one of the banks at Sidney," said Mr. Greenfield, "there is a good sized bulletin board fairly well covered with ribbons won this year at corn contests by Richland county farmers. It makes a good showing and indicates that Montana farmers who want Mon tana grown seed corn can possibly find their requirements met in that section. Long List of Prizes "At the state fair this year Rich land county took the first and sweep stakes prizes for northwestern dent, white dent, yellow and white flint and a number of seconds for other vari eties, - as well as first for red popcorn. Richland county also took a lot of corn prizes at the Billings fair, but at the state corn show at Miles City it made its big record. At Miles City Richland took first, second and third prises and the sweepstakes for yellow dent, the same awards for white flint and the general sweepstakes and grand championship in the latter class. It also took first in yellow flint, the sec ond and third for white dent, first for yellow dent and second for the county collective exhibit for the state. The Richland county boys' club won first at Miles City with a yellow dent dis play. Spuds are Famous "Richland is also becoming a pro ducer of prize winning potatoes. At the International Potato show at Du luth in October that county took sec ond on the Snowflake variety and second on an exhibit, representing 14 growers. From present appearances it seems that Richland county might take for its motto: 'Corn and Spuds."' Europe Is Dumping Its Art Treasurers Into American Market Xew York.

The land owners have authorized the directors to pro ceed with the issuance of bonds as soon as practicable. The funds realized from the sale of the issue will prin cipally be used to meet the construc tion costs of the diversion system. The directors have received many opinions from reputable irrigation au thorities testifying to the worth and value of the project. One of the well known irrigation men in the state, I. D. O'Donnell of Billings, recently in spected the proposed project and he said that there was every prospect of our plans being successfully exe cuted.

Reservoir Constructed The water to be used in the Bynum project will come from the Teton river, and plans call for its storage in a reservoir, which has already been con structed west of Bynum. The reser voir has a capacity of 95,000 acre feet, sufficient to irrigate 20,000 acres. Eighty per cent of the stock of the reservoir is held under option by the Bynum irrigation district and the re mainder is owned by the Brady Irriga tion company. Lands of 175 residents are to be placed under the ditch, ac cording to plans.
