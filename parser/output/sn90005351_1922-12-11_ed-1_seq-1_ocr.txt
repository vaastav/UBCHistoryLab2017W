HUSBAND REPORTER ON CALEDONIAN Saturday Evening Post Tells of St. Johynsbury Citizen Under the caption:- "Who's Who and Why," there appears an article in the Saturday Even ing Post about William W. Hus band of St. Johnsbury, Commis sioner General of Immigration. The Pubishers of The Saturday J Evening Post have given pemiis- sion for a reprint of this article. I It will prove of wide interest to renderà of this paner. Some theorists deveiop some fair ly good theories- on the subjects conceming which they theorize. More theorists, however, deveiop theories that ren't worth the powder to blow ti m out of the minds of their ori flators. Thus it has come to pass tlv persons of a high order of inteU.gence, when desirous of seeking advice on strange matters, usually tum to men who have aequired their knowdedge . through experience rather than to men who have de veloped ridi, ripe theories on these matters by overmuch referring to weighty and musty-smelling refer encc books in the privacy of their chambei's. The wisdom of a man may freguently be gauged by the number of theorists that appeal among his advisors. The wisdom in the highly .sp.-ced language of tho mathematicians, is in inverse ratio to the number of theorists. There is no finer grazine aground for theorists than the fichi of immigration. Here the theorists may be seen at large at any hour ot the day or night, browsing among the thistles, kick- ing tneir heels wildlv in the air and emitting deafening brays. Be cause ot the nature of immigration not many people have had the timo the tempeiament or the bank ac count to hecome experienced in ali branches of it. Many people, how ever, are interested in it.
