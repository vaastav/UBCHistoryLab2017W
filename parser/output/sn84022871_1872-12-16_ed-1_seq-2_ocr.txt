It took place on the 4thinst,in the great city of New York, where he had labored in the Xews paper profession forty years, and was at tended by many of the most illustrious men of the nation, including President Grant, Vice President Colfax, and Vice President elect Wilson, Postmaster Gen eral Cresswell, Gen.

Randolph, " Chief Justice Chase, Senator Fenton, Governor Hoffman, Senator Trumbull, Minister Washburne, and an immense number of Clubs and Associations, the whole mak ing a funeral cortege equal, in length and impressiveness, to that which folbwed the remains of President Lincoln to their last resting place. The funeral services took place in Dr. Chapin's Church, of which Mr. Greeley was a member, and consisted of Prayer, and singing of a hymn: "I know that my Redeemer liveth," by Miss Clara Louise Kellogg, and two brief Orations, one by the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher and the other by Dr. Chapin. After the services were over the procession moved through Broadway, where nearly all the business places were closed and the houses draped in mourn ing, to Hamilton Ferry, thence to Brook lyn and to Greenwood Cemetery, where the remains were interred. Mr. Greeley was indeed, a remarkable man, and although he committed some grave mistakes in his eventful career, he wrote and spoke so many strong and orig inal things in favor of liberty, equality, humanity aud education, that his weak nesses fade out of sight before the splen dor of his long and useful life. He was original in his views, and wrote forcibly and beautifully upon almost every sub ject.

VUTO.N, MONDAY, DEC. lit, 1872. "Here tkall the Prest the PtopU't right maintain, Uhawed by influence and unbribtd by gain ; Here patriot Truth her gloriout preceptt dram, Fledged to Religion, Liberty, and Law." A terrible fire occurred in New York City, last Tuesday night in which the Fifth Avenue Hotel was partially de stroyed and twenty-two persons burned to death. The fire broke out in the up per story at half-past eleven o'clock, af ter nearly all of the guests had retired, and by twelve o'clock had enveloped nearly all of the twenty-third street side. A general panic ensued and great ex citement prevailed among the servants and guests of the house, who rushed for their trunks and valuables. The halls were filled with screaming guests, and many women fainted. The fire was con fined to the wing in which it originated, and only a portion of the hotel was de stroyed. Among the prominent guests were Generals Burnside and Porter. Those who lost their lives were servants and slept on the top floor. Their bodies were horribly charred and disfigured and the position in which they were found indicated that they had been overcome by the intense smoke and heat, while en deavoring to escape. The loss of prop erty is estimated to be about $140,000. Vice President Colfax, will, it is reported, after he is relieved of his present position by Henry Wilson, en ter the New York Tribune editorial staff, taking Horace Greeley's place as editor-in-chief. Another report follows this, saying the Tribune managers have en gaged Mr. Whitelaw Reid to fill the va cant chair at a yearly salary of $10, 000. Whether there is any truth in either of these reports or not, we believe gratified in the sad circumstance of his death "Geowino Old. So Ions as we may arow therein in wisdom and worth it is well, it is desirable, to live, but no further. To my view, insanity is the darkest. the most appalling of earthly calamities; but how much better is an old age that drivels and wauders,and misunderstands and forgets? .When the soul shall have been choked and smothered by the ruins of its wasting, falling habitation, I should prefer to inhabit that tenement no longer. I should not choose to stand shuddering and trembling on the brink of the dark river, weakly drawing back from the chill of its sweep ing nooa, wnen iraitn assures me that a new Eden stretches green and fair beyond it. and the baptism it invites will cleanse the soul of all that now clogs.cloudp, and weighs it to the earth. No; when the windows of the mind shall be darkened, when the growth of the soul here shall have been arrested, I would not weaklv cling to the earth which will have ceased to nourish and uphold me. Rather "let the golden bowl be loosed and the pitcher broken at the fountain ;" let the sun of my existence go down ere the dusky vapors shroud its horizon ; let me close my eyes calmly on the things of earth , and let my weary frame sleep beneath the clods of the valley ; let the spirit, which it c;m no Ion ger cherish as a guest, be spared the ignominity of detention as a prisoner; but freed from the fetters of clay, let it wing its way through the boundless universe to wheresoever the benign Father of Spirits Bhall have assigned it an everlasting home there are few men that would revive and preserve the old popularity of the Trib une in the Republican ranks, better than Vice President Colfax. Since the above was in type the daily papers state that Mr. Colfax Iras ac cepted the position, and will tender his resignation, to take effect January first, . and enter at once upon his new duties.

SUMMARY FROM THE ALBANY JOURNAL. t The report of Secretary Boutwell is by all odds the most important, next to". the President's message, of all the pub lic documents. It opens with a refer ence to the negotiation of the five per cents, and says further loans can now be negotiated on the same hasis. The total net receipts for the last fiscal year were $374,106,869.50; the total dis bursements were $377,78,216.20, in cluding $99,960,253.54 on the princi pal of the public debt The total reduction of the debt from March 1, 1869. to November 1, 1872, was $363, 606,999.87, accompanied by a reduction in the annual interest to the extent of $24,187,854. The receipts for the first quarter of the fiscal year were $100,815,134.70 ; the expenditures $105,486,355.79, including $16,932,- 132.72 on the public debt. For the re mainder of the fiscal year it is estimated that the receipts will be $218,500,000, leaving a surplus of $44, 000,000 , ap plicable to the redemption of the debt The amount required under the sinking fund law will b $29, 290,000, so that there will be an excess beyond this sum. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1 874, the receipts are estimated at $320,000,- 000, and the expenditures at 286,600, 000, leaving an estimated surplus of $33,400,000.. The reduction of taxa tion by the several acts passed since the close of the war amounts to the internal revenue to $248,651,000, and in the customs to $60,699,171, making a total reduction of $309,350,181 a very handsome showing. ; . ; The Secretary earnestly directs atten tion to the condition of our carrying trade and to the necessity of doing some thing to improve it The , imports and exports of the United States during the past fiscal year, excluded gold and sil ver, amounted to $1,070.641, 163. And yet of this immense trade only eight and a half percent, was in American vessels. In 1860, the proportion was seventy-one per cent., and there has been a steady decline. The earnings of the vessels engaged in the foreign carrying trade exceeds one hundred millions a year, and our vessels secure less than a third. The Secretary thinks the act of Congress allowing a drawback on materials en tering into the construction of American vessels has given encouragement to ship building, but that something more is needed. Precisely what measures he would recommend he does not say, but safe it might be in the hands of Mr. Boutwell. As co resumption of specie payments, Mr. Boutwell thinks there are two ways of reaching it 'The first is to contract the volume of currency1 until paper and gold shall become equivalent ; ; but the country, in his judgment, is not pre pared to sustain this policy. The sec ond plan is the common suggestion ; of awaiting the time when the country shall have grown up to the full need of the present volume. The Secretary thinks THE 

DEAD ALIVE! A Terrible Warning to Everybody- A Well k nown Citizen of Chicago Comes to- Life his Coffin- A Fortunate . Escape from Bvrial Alive, i I A few, days ago, says trc Chicago Times, Mr Muhlbesch was taken sud denly ill at his residence. His disease was of a very acute nature, and in spite of all the efforts of his physicians, he died after a brief illness, and his sor rowing friends made ready for the funer al An undertaker was summoned, and that there are reasons for expecting under I the body properly laid out, and on yes- the influence of natural causes a steady terday the funeral services took place FUIL OF FIRE. For the last six weeks our paper has been so filled up with advertisements that we should not blame our subscribers if they grumbled a little. This week we take out about five columns and give reading matter in its place. It was our intention to issue an occasional supple ment, but fortune has smiled on us with such a run of job printing that Ave have not been able to do so. As we have heard no murmur, we conclude that our friends have a good supply of patience, for which we are truly thankful. Next week we shall commence the publication of a series of interesting articles, which will last four or five weeks, entitled the "Laws of Vermont," which should be read by every one. As usual after the death of a distin- guished personage, whether rich or not, some over-zealou3 friend of Horace Gree ley proposed to raise a fund for the sup port of his daughters. This proposition, however, has been nipped in the bud by the girls themselves, who announce that they will accept nothing. As their fa ther left them something like $100,000, they think by close economy they can manage to get through the world with- out any help. They not only refuse to accept aid from the public, but will con- tribute to a monument to be erected to the memory of their father. A Statistician has made an exhibit of the losses by fire in the United States during the past two years, leaving out ' the conflagrations at Chicago and Boston, and he finds that they amount in round numbers to the enormous sums of $76 000,000. As the loss in Chicago was put at $ 1 80, 000,000, and in Boston at $ 1 00, 000,000, we have a total loss, within the time mentioned, of 356,000,000. A terrible accident occurred on the Pennsylvania Central Railroad, about fifty miles west of Harrisburg on Tues day evening of week before last The second section of the Cincinnati ex press train, bound east, ran into the rear of the first section and telescop ed two Pullman cars. Five bodies were removed from the debris. : , Five other persons were injured, but not seriously. The municipal election in Boston came off last Tuesday, resulting in the re election of Mayor Gaston over Henry L. Pierce candidate on the citizens' ticket. There was considerable dissatisfaction with the mayor's course during and af ter the fire, which bro't out the opposi site candidate But there was not blame enough attached to defeat him. Ex-Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania, came home from Russia to help beat Grant But Grant came out victorious and now Ex-Govcrnor Orr of South Car olina has been appointed Minister to Russia, and hereafter Curtain will stay put Some folks never know when they arc well off.' SHOCKING OCCURRENCE IN SAN FRANCIS CO PHOSPHORUS AS A PLAYTHING. At an early hour yesterday morning three little boys, sons of Abraham Stras- ser, a poultry dealer, iramed Emanuel, Leopold, and Andiel, and aged from sev en to eleven years, were playing in an alley in the Chinese quarter; and while there they discovered a curious wax-like substance lying on the ground, and in their curiosity, picked some of it up and filled their trowsers' pockets with it. The boys then came down to their fa ther's stall and began playing about in apparent forgetfulness of their prize. All at once a terrific shriek from one of them startled every one in the market, The poor little fellow was seen dancing about in agony, and a thin blue sulphor ic smoke issued from his clothing and enveloped him in a cloud. The men in the market rushed to his assistance and threw water all over him, and cov ered him with blankets but nothing seemed to do him any good. One man, Charles Kauffman, in his efforts to tear off the boy's clothing, had his hand badly burned, and it is proba ble that it will have to be amputated, Finally the men succeeded in tearing off his clothing, and he was taken into Richards' drug store, where everything was done to relieve his sufferings. The boy was terribly burned about his stomach and thighs, and it is very doubtful if he can recover. While the druggist was dressing the lad's burns, the other two boys were standing in the doorway, looking on stupefied with as tonishment All at once one of them- Leopold gave an earpiercing shriek, and began tearing away at his clothes. The phosphorus in his pockets had ig nited, and he was enveloped in smoke in an instant. The druggist called for assistance and rushed to tear off the boy's clothing, but before it could be done the little fellow was severely bum ed in the same manner as his brother tus wounds were not quite as severe, but sufficiently so to make his recovery exceedingly doubtful. But the terrible agent had not done yet The other lit tle boy the youngest stood by while all this was going on, but nobody thought to inquire if he had anything in his pockets. Suddenly the same scene was enacted with him, the poor little urchin taking fire and yelling most piteously. Fortunately he did not have much of the phosphorus in his pockets, and so was not very seriously injured. The two brothers it is highly probable will die. One of them was horribly burned about the abdomen and up the breast, and his sufferings were intense. After some time the boys were placed in a wagon and driven to their home on Stockton street where their mother was found almost distracted with grief. The substance which the boys had picked up in their ignorance was phos phorus : but how it could have gone where they found it is a mystery. Phos phorus, after being taken from the wa ter, in which it is always kept, ignites as soon as it becomes dry. It was yet damp when the boys found it ; but the heat of their bodies dried it rapidly, and the terrible scenes which followed were the natural results. he argues that the country can afford to establish and maintain lines of steam ship rather than surrender this carrying trade, for the indirect benefits would transcend the cost. England controls the markets of the world because she controls the channels of communication. We mutt make new efforts in that di rection. The state of our foreign trade, as shown by the statistics, is not very sat isfactory. , The imports of merchandise for the last fiscal year were $636,596,- 077, and the exports estimated in gold were $144,046,0S6, showing a balance against us of $ 182,548.20 1 . This, how ever, is not all real. For the excess of goods in warehouse, $53,086,607 should be deducted ; and $66,133,845 for the excess of exports over imports of gold, leaving a real adverse trade balance of $62,528,539. The exports of merchan dise for 1S72 were 81,328,933 less than for 1871. The exports of wheat, flour, cotton, cotton goods, gold and silver, manufactures of leather, beef. and. oil fell off $82,066,325, while the exports of corn, furs, hides, skins, hams, tobac co, manufactures of iron and many mi nor articles increased $68,767,392. Of imports there was a large increase in coffee, sugar, tea, raw wool and manu factures of wool and cotton, pig iron and manufactures of iron. The Secretary makes various recom mendations among others . one for the relief of Assistant Treasurer Hillhouse from responsibility for the defalcation of James I. Johnson and then proceeds to consider the future financial policy of the country. The war, he says, pro duced three great changes in the busi ness and finances of the nation. In the first place, it imposed the necessity of heavy custom duties, and thus necessa rily and without special intent the country entered upon a policy of broad protection. In the second place, it led to the issue of Government . Treasury notes as currency. And . in the third place, it created a system of. national banks with circulation resting upon the national credit, and prohibited banks of issue by State authority. Mr. Boutwell strongly sustains the policy of Protec tion and makes a cogent argument for it He believes that it has largely con tributed to the prosperity of the country, and that, for the present at least, in the adjustment of taxation it shall be main tained.. The Secretary considers the greenback circulation and the national bank notes conjunction, and holds that both improvement in our financial condition. Thanks to the President. Sinclair Tousy, a political opponent of the admin istration has written an open letter to President Grant for his attendance at Mr. Greeley's funeral, from which the following is an extract:. 'For your remembrance of Mr. Gree ley, dying ; for your attendance at his funeral ; for the tearful attention you paid the sad ceremonies of the occasion, Mr. President, I thank you with all earnestness. I am very sure that in doing so I but echo the sentiments of hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens whose views of public affairs led them and myself to support, in the late canvass, the man to whom -you have shown such high respect. . By these acts you have removed prejudices, changed opponents into friends, and shown the world that : great official life need not deaden the better instincts of our com mon humanity." : ; ' .,- . Horace Greeley's will is in the hands of Judge Hart who was a near neighbor of the deceased. The property of de ceased, including Tribune stock, real estate and personal property, is bequeath ed to his two daughters, Ida and Gabri- elle. The amount of Mr. Greeley's prop erty has not yet been made public, but it is stated that it is larger than is gen erally supposed. The will was mad. in November, and was written by Mr. Gree ley. He had made two previous wills, which were kept with the understanding that the seals were not to be broken without instructions from members of his family Mr. Greeley's wife, who owned the Chappaqua farm and some other proper ty in her own name and right, made a will five years ago, bequeathing her prop erty to her daughters. The Sale of the Chappaqua Farm. Although Mr. Greeley's Chappaqua farm had been advertised to be sold, the sale of course was postponed on account of his death. The reason which induced him to decide to sell the homestead was as follows: After Mrs. Greeley's death Mr. Greeley resolved to live with his daughter in New York during the winter. As a great quantity of rubbish, consist ing mostly of farming utensils, had been accumulating for jcais, Mi. Greeley de sired to get rid of it As he did not wish to hire a man to stay on the place, he decided to sell the live stock too, and make a clean sweep In the spring, if he moved back, he intended to re-stock it ST A

Common, from his late residence. : After the cus tomary services had been performed and the sorrowing relatives had taken their last look of the deceased, the coffin lid was screwed down and the funeral cortege moved slowly towards the quiet confines of Graceland cemetery,, where the body was finally lowered sadly into the grave which had been prepared for it. ' The last prayer had been offered and the last solemn service repeated, when, just as the sexton seized rhis spade and was about to drop the first shovelful of earth upon the coffin, a sound, something like a stifled groan, followed by a scratch ing noise, as if the dead man was trying to release himself from, the confines of his narrow house, was heard proceeding from the still open grave. For an in stant every heart stood still, and the blood of every listener seemed to curdle in his veins. The women screamed and hastened towards the carnages, while the men were not slow in following them. In an instant the sexton who was the only man left at the grave, and he, too, trembled at hearing what he had never heard before. Finally, he recovered presence of mind enough to descend into the grave and break open the rough box in which the coffin was encased. Then the noise was repeated, and he knew that the occupant of that grave, who in a few moments more would have been consigned to a horrible death, and whom his friends had already mourned as dead, was still alive and anxious to be set free. A screw-driver was soon procured from the undertaker present, and the coffin lid removed, when its occupant, instead of being cold and dead as he appeared when last seen, was found to be once more alive. His friends who had bv this time recovered courage enough to return to the grave, were, of course, al most overjoyed at this strange and unex pected turn of affairs, and hastened to rescue the late deceased from his unpleas- nearly covered.

Mrs. Buth God dard, daughter of Nathaniel Hale, died at Littleton, N. 1L, Nov. 21stahundred years and six months old. ;. She was born in Brookfield, Mass., May 17th, 1772. Here she lived with her father's family, until she was 36 years of age, spending many of her early years in suc cessful teaching, when she married and removed to Petersham. Here her hus band lived but seven years after their marriage, but here she continued to re side until the marriage of her daughter, thirty years ago, to Mr. Spaulding Hale, when she removed with her daughter to Passumpsic, and two years later to Wat erford. The last year of her life has been passed in Littleton. She. distinct ly remembered many of the events of the Revolutionary war, the "dark day," and particularly the surrender of . Bur goyne, with the passage of his troops through Massachusetts to Boston.

There is not in either England, Ireland Por Scot land such a thing as a sleeping car ; nor, in fact, anywhere in Europe save in Rus sia, where the railroads are modeled af ter our own. There is just now a strong demand made for this peculiar "accom modation in England, and even so pow erful an agent as the Times is enlisted on the part of the public.

The Postmaster-General recommends in his report the purchase by the Gov ernment of all existing lines of telegraph, provided they can be obtained for a rea sonable sum. If companies insist upon exorbitant prices, he then recommends that the Government be authorized to build independent lines. He estimates that, at the rates he considers fair and just, the lines, poles, instruments and other property of existing companies are worth about twelve millions of dollars. In this, however, he does not include the value of prospective business, etc. His system contemplates complete own ership on the part of the government and making all connected with the post al telegraph, officials and the appointees of the Post Office Department. The members of the committee on appropria tion, in partially examining into the question of cost, have come to the con clusion that such purchases as tbe Post master-General recommends cannot be made, either through arbitration or otherwise, for less than thirty millions, t Friday a twelve years old son of $ DON'T FORGET H s O'Brien, went on horseback from . j L I i Orwell, to make purchases for the fami ly.

If the buildings blown up were at such a distance from the fire that it is doubtful if they would have ley for the Presidency ? electors by the people imposes no other than a moral or honorable obligation up on them to vote for the person indicated by the nomination which they support ed. Various contingencies might arise between the time of election and the meetinc of the electors iu the various states, which would make it ' altogether proper for them to vote for some other man. Such a contingency has occurred in the death of Mr. Greeley. Some one else must receive the votes intended for him. if they are cast at all. The New York Tribune and other pa pers proposed that the votes should be cast for President Grant so as to make his choice unanimous. A new White House is talked of, the old one to be converted into a Presiden tial office.
