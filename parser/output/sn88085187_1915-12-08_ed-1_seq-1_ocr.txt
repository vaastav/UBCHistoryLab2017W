B.—Tacoma must not think that all of Seattle is going to rise up spontaneously snd agree with one acclaim to change the name of Mt. "Rain ier" back to Tacoma. Though Mayor QUI, Editor L. J. Ritchie of the Star, Seattlte's most Influential paper, the Uo tari.ns ami many other progre" j»lvo leaders favor letting ItoMMA rename the mountain, nearly a the old time leaders are dead sol against It. So much a canvass made heru t< cay for The Tacoma Ti _i.. demonstrated. "Futile and Foolish." " "Futile, as well as foolish!" This is the verdict of promin ent business men, heads of vari ous clubs and other organiza tions. For instance, The Tacoma Times man interviewed a num ber of persons, with the fol'.ow f.'ig .(-suits lv the absence of . rev.rick V. _ .i wn, president of the K.iliiicr clul, his predecessoi, Oeorge I-nworth, speaking for a.t club, which is the exclusive "100," Judge Ballinger organisation, Kid he strenuously dl-spproved of changing tlie name of th* mountain. » "There is nothing to arbi trate," • said Donwoit.i. "The r.ai.ip was fixed by th_ govern ni.r.t years ago and is a dead is sue. There Is no more question •bout the name of the mountain than there Is about the name of Puget Sound." Judge Burke Opposes It. Judge Thomas Burke, presi dent of the chamber of com merce, and President Robert S. -Boyns, of the Commercial club, both joined In the opposition. "For its historical connection," •aid Judge Burke, "it should stand. It is a trivial matter, but the name Rainier should stard with the rest of the names or Puget Sound." "I see no reason for any change," declared President. Boyns. "The Indian name, Ta hiinia, was a very pretty one, but ,1 don't know of any reason why it should be changed now. Every body knows It as Rainier." Calls It "Winter Sport." "It seems that Tacoma must he idle and must hay. something to keep her out of mischief," wa. the opinion of Dr. M. A. Mnt , thews, of the First Presbyterlai church. "If they want to take It up as k s winter sport, let them play at It. They can hurt nobody, nor get anywhere. The government has already officially named Rainier National park 'after the mountain,' and Tacoma couldn't change the name if she were to howl her head off. In justice, the mountain should be called Tshonia, but t§ attempt to change it would be useless." Judge Ronald With Us. On the other hand, Judge J. 1. Ronald, former president of the State Good Roadß association, is a Seattle citizens who is willing to be recorded in favoring of changing the name of the moun tain to Tacoma. The Star, nothing daunted by this adverse sentiment among leaders of this city, in going right •head In ita advocacy of the • change.

The once mighty P. 1., now the tall-ender in the race for news paper supremacy, comes out today with an editorial which in a be wildered way tries to make light of the movement to change the name, yet yields it a grudging plea for consideration.

Throws Rocks In Humphrey Pond 

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 8. —Secretary of the Treasury Mc- Adoo took one stiff, solid punch at Congressman Humphrey's frog pond postoffice site in Seattle In the course of his annual report to congress today. While he was about It, McAdoo launched a fight to be made on the pork measure, the omnibus public buildings bill, knocking it full of holes with convincing ar guments. This fight on the pork stuff followed close on the heels of the bill Introduced by Humphrey Monday asking for a big appro priation for the erection of a building on his "submarine" site. McAdoo was in Seattle looking over the site not long ago and he told congress what he thought about it. Below the Sewer. "An examination of public building legislation shows a lack of ayatem and a disregard of eco nomic consideration In authoriz ing the construction of public buildings," he said "in Seattle, Wash-, a site was purchased in 1911 on the 'tide flats' for $169,500. An authori zation of 1800,000 waa subse quently made for the erection of • building.

BACKS CLEAR DOWN In m power contract and franchise ordinance submit ted to the city council today Manager l»ui- Itaan of the Tacoma Hallway A Power Co, backed down complete l> from his previous Mgli htuidod (leinunds. He agreed to every big i "in maloii that the citizens of lm .mm through tin- me dium of The Times nnd .Mayor Fawcett, have de manded since tlie power ne gotiation began. Mayor Fawcett today said that he would attempt to obtain a 5 per cent gross earnings tax ou the T. H. A P. Co.'s power busi ness. Instead of the 2 per cent named In the ordinance, and would back up West End citizens in their efforts to obtain a Bl_th avenue extension. Otherwise, however, lie said he was thor oughly Batisfied with the new measure.

"Every objectionable featuro has been eliminated," commented Mayor Fawcett enthusiastically today. "The T. R. A P. Co. has simply found that It cannot rail road the thing through this city hall.
