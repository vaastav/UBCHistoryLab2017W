And I had tried many rem edies sent to me by kind friend but they all railed. His head, fncp. and nock were covered with large Bcnba which he would rub until they roll off. Then blood and matter would run out and that wouid bo worse. Many a time he looked as If his ears would drop off. Friends com ing to see him said that if ho got well ho would lw disfigured for life. "When it secmod as if ho could pos sibly stand It no longer, I decided to try Cutlcura. I bought a cako of Cuti cuxa Soap, a l)x of Cutlcura Ointment, and a bottle or Cutlcura Resolvent.

Speaker Cannon's refusal to support the proposition of the government Is suing bonds as a method of financing a scheme for comprehensive "waterway Improvement has drawn the flro cf criticism upon him. And lt""may bo surmised that even Speaker Cannon Is not Inviting criticism thesu driys and would avoid It as much ns possible. Still, lh frankly stating ttmtdio would .tot vote fpr .such a measurt'tlhulspiaki r must bo awarded tho merit of n can dor that many of his colleagues lack. It may also be .ibfaiimed - that the question of watT transportation and river Improvement will nb( bo delayed very much In Its Una) and satisfactory answer by any atltue1oJpJ.ps,ephQ. Cannon. A few cenfurlos hence 'our waterways will be In truth the streams f our national life. Sparse settle nonts of today will be tho congested ireas of a later day that will lool: to Irrigation for sustenance. And the part hat water transportation will play In ho equation of traffic will bo mtglhty; it will bo prodlgt.usly boyond tho ll roam of today's visionaries to con ceive. Any plan, howetvef vast and elabor lie It may seem today, will, In tho "evelatlon of jiostorlty'a needs nnd so utlnus, bo primitive and even tonta .Ive. Our duty will be met by making he best and wisest beginning that may 10 made, bequeathing tho bigger wvrk o a bigger day and generation. Mr. !annon may delay this beginning. He ins delayed much. He Is on obstruc lonlst, principally because he Is quite .vlthout perspective. Sometimes, too. ie seems to enjoy displaying tho mi nority of little mlndedncss'. But he Is leltlaor a maker nor an, nn-aiaker -cf llstory. Doutlny Is not going to hoot aff at a variant tangent because of any thing Joo Cannon can do or ?an pro vent being done. . But whllo newspapers affecting b approvo the era of progressive- Rupiih licanism tako delight In hammering Uncle Joo It seems pertinent to recall another Instance In connection with the Iforts for river Improvements. A .ear or moro ngo, when tho sentiment 'dig her deep through Dixie" was ruu alng through tlio Mississippi valley a delegation of representative citizens having gone on to Washington, wore javalierly Informed by the chairman t the rlvors and' harhora commlttoo that they would bo allowed ton or .If toon minutes x. prosont their caso. 1'lioro were men In that delegation of w big intellectual caliber a the chair nan of 'the rivers nnd harbors commit tee; and tuore wore niqn who In tho public service had records of achieve nent superior to that of tho chair nan's. Nothing that Joo Cannon over lid was mere autocratic or downright mpudent than tho cursory manner vlth which Theodoro Burton waved aside the gentlemen uho had gono to Washington to secure the river and harbors committee's Interest In the proposed deep waterway from the lakes to tho gulf. Tho enormity ot the chair man's offense was accentuated by the fact that ho was supposed to bo a pro grosstve and learned statesman one of our congressmen who rcaslonally reads a book. And he still enjoys that reputation bo much so, in fact, that ho Is rumored to be the president-elect's choice for speakor to succeed Cannon If that Is practicable; If not that he will he made secretary of slate. Cannon Is criticised for championing tho old system of rivor nud harbor ap propriatlons as an Item of political Bpalla and patronage, with nothing to show tor tho money wasted exupung tho hog-tight political fences of th. representatives from coast- inc con sresslcnal districts. Be that as li ma ,o nowspaper3 that are enfilading Gannon on this score will find in the scholarly Theodoro Burton a ropr sc .. tatlvo who has never neglected the tjui litlcnl advantages accruing from Of expenditure ot Undo Sim's money along tho linos whero Lako prlc's va ors lap Cleveland's glistening sands Mr. Burton, having acquiesced are profited by a system of po.ltlcal sp , atlon which Cannon approves and would perpetuate, does not appear from this dUtanco to bo any more of a nope r an augury for the future thah does his braver, though blunter, colli aguj from Danville.
