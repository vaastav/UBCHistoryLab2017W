New York, Dec. 7.-Stuyvesant Fish, the recently deposed president of the Illinois Central Railroad, has thrown a bombshell into Wall street through a speech delivered last night attacking corporations and the "an? archistic rich." It is reported in financial dis? tricts that Fish proposes to assist President Roosevelt in his future in? vestigations of railroads and trusts. In his speech Mr. Fish declared dis? honesty is the issue and Roosevelt is the one to control it. "That there has been mal-adminis tration, not to say stealing, in many of' our corporations is a matter of common notoriety," he said. "Some men have ogne to great lengths in : ridding from the restraints of law, equity, ethics and even common de? cency, themselves and those with them in the higher circles of finance."

Washington, Dec. 5.-The house today, waiting on the report of ap? propriation bills, began its legislative grind by passing ' three measures in? corporating the National German Al liance; authorizing th secretary of the treasury to duplicate gold certifi? cates in lieu of ones lost or destroyed, and the bill amending the national 3 banking laws, permitting national ( banking associations to make loans 1 on real estate as security and limiting the amount of such loans. The banking bill has been one of ] < the West's favorite measures and the leaders in the house from that sec? tion lined up generally in favor of ( the legislation, which it was asserted 1 would go far toward popularizing the national banks. The opponents of the bill, Democrats and Republicans, insisted that real estate was not a proper security for a loan, even though a limit was placed on the loan. The advocates of the measure were too strong, however, and the bill was passed two to one. EXCLUDE NEGROES. Bill in House Barring the Black? , From Army Service. Washington, Dec. 4.-Representa- j tive Slayden of Texas, today intro- < duced a bill which provides that "on j or before the 30th day of June, 1907, , ail enlisted men of the army who are ; negroes or of negro descent be dis- ? charged from the service of the Uni? ted States and thereafter no negro or , person of negro descent shall be en? listed or appointed in the army of ? the United States." In explaining his bill i'r. Slayden said: "The bill speaks for itself- It was not introduced for buncombe. My purpose is to give the congress of the United States an opportunity to purge the army of an admittedly dangerous .element. To say that the negroes are brave is not an argument against this measure. Many men have been brave, in fact most men are in the matter of fighting. The Comanche and Sioux Indians were as orave as men can be. But no one would se? riously suggest that we ultimately re? cruit regiments from them, put guns in their hands and station them near companies of white troops, toward whom they entertain inherent race hostility. The Twenty-fifth infanttry is manifestly imbued with the same race hostility and events have shown it to be quite as dangerous as the Sioux or Comanche would be." CHURCH m STATE. THE RELIGIOUS KOW IS OX, IN EARNEST IN FRANCE. Thc Government and the Catholics Are Expected to Clash O ver the En? forcement of Law Separating Church and State-Eviction of Priests Will Cause Trouble. Paris, Dec. ll.-The law for the separation of church and stat? be? came effective today. As the Pope has forbidden Catholics to conform to the law allowing religious societies to be formed to take over church property it means that ownership passes to the state. The churches throughout France stand on the verge of eviction. Serious times are anticipated if the government moves to evict the priests from churches, schools and monasteries and troops will probably be required to enforce the law. The cabinet today voted to pro? ceed immediately to liquidate the property in churches and rectories. This shows that the government is determined to uphold the law vigo? rously. The next few days it is' fear? ed will see a religious outbreak, with bloodshed, as the Catholics seem de? termined to resist the law. MARK TWAIN, LOBBYIST.

Speaker Cannon explained that he ;ould not grant the floor privilege, t>ut gave Twain his private room, vhere the humorist is lobbying mem? bers in support of his bill. . Twain has ilso called at the White House. NEW SEABOARD DEAL. Rumored That the , Southern Will Give Up Its Charleston Line to the Seaboard. Charleston, Dec. 9.-It is rumored n railway circles: here that the Southern railway and the Seaboard Air Line have come to an agreement oy which the former will turn over ts line to Charleston, formerly the >ld South Carolina railroad, enabling :he Seaboard Air Line to enter Charleston, which has been planned "or some time. The story seems im? probable in a way, but it is being per? sistently circulated and there may be 50me foundation for it The plans )f the Seaboard Air Line as generally mderstood, were to build a direct ine to Charleston from Lugoff, near Camden, but the acquisition of the Southern railway route would be pre? ferable, it is said, to the construction )f a new road. It is argued that the Southern railway has no direct inter? est in Charleston, its terminals being it other ports, which ls the cause of much of Charleston's complaints of ?iscrimnation, and it*is perhaps true, :hat with the settlement of the form? er antagonism which formerly pre? vailed between these two systems and the Atlantic Coast Line, and the ad? justment of conflicting interests, the Southern railway may now be willing to part with its branch line to Charleston. Some time ago on a vis? it of the late President Spencer of the Southern railway to Charleston he spoke very assuringly of a proper realization of the geograpical and natural advantages of the port of Charleston, and h6 might have had in mind the present project of the Seaboard Air Line taking over this branch line and making it a part of its system, and erecting new termi? nals at Charleston. None of the railroad people in au? thority would have anything to say for publication about the story and, as stated, it is not known how much truth .thre is in the rumor.-The State. HE IS

CITIES ARE NOT PERMITTED. The Charges Against Government of Congo Free State Are Made By Ignorant Persons Who Do Not Know the Real Facts. (Copyrighted by Publisher's Press Association.) Brussels, Dec. 10.-The corres? pondent of the Publishers' Press was today received in private audience by j King Leopold for an interview on Congo. King Leopold denies the charges of general atrocities practic? ed on the blacks in the Congo State. There have been cases of misjudg? ment on the part of officials, but these have been punished. Every ef? fort is made to -protect the natives, not only from the whites, but each other. Leopold complained that he has been painted as a monster by per? sons who got their information sec? ond-handed. Individual cases of cru? elty have been magnified into gener alties. The king asked the correspondent if he carried a revolver to protect himself from such a monster, and how he dared to risk his life thus. Leopold denied that he has ever made a cent out of the Congo State. On the contrary, he has spent mil? lions in developing the region. The work will go on and his sole hope is to improve the country and better the conditions of the natives. A Boston Meddler. Washington, Dec. 10.-Dr. Herbert Johnson, representing the Congo Re? form association, Pastor of Warren Avenue Baptist church, Boston, is here trying: to get Secretary Root to intervene with King Leopold to bet? ter the conditions of the Congo na? tives. He says untold atrocities are permitted. He charges that the na? tives are allowed to kill and feed on the victims. The promised reforms will result in nothing. STIRRING UP TROUBLE. Washington, Dec. 10.-Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, has intro? duced a resolution in the senate call? ing for an international inquiry into the alleged atrocities in the Congo Free State. 1 KING LEOPOLD'S INTERVIEW. London, Dec. ll.-The action of King Leopold of Belgium in giving an interview on Congo affairs to the Publishers' Press, has aroused great interest throughout Europe. The German paper? take the stand that this is another indication of the "American peril." They say the monarch is discredited in Europe and is trying to rehabilitate himself in America. The United States newspa? pers are-becoming the supreme court of the world's opinion, and Europe wont tolerate this. Throughout Eng? land, Francqf and Italy there is the fullest discussion of the interview. Opinion is about evenly divided as to the gravity of Leopold's offense. INCENDIAMES ORGANIZED. Astounding Information Comes From Newberry-Three Suspects in Jail Now. Columbia, Dec. ll.-An astounding condition of affaira is revealed in a telephone message from Newberry. Three negroes, charged with having burned the barns and stables of Mr. P. N. Boozer near Kinard's last Fri? day night, indicate that there is an organization of negroes there who or? dered this work to be done. Louis Burton, colored, has confessed and it is upon his statement that the arrest of Ernest Burton and of Levi Ebaugh was made. There was a great deal of excitement at the time and the 'phone message stated that the sheriff, Mr. M. M. Buford, deserves great credit for his quick action, and that th e people of the vi? cinity deserve congratulations upon their forbearance, considering the fact that they were very much work? ed up. The fire destroyed 17 head of stock and 15 bal?s of cotton in addition to the building.. The moneta ty loss therefore is considerable, but the fea? ture of the case is the motive alleged by the negroes. Immediately after the burning Sheriff Buford received a phone mes? sage calling him to the scene of the trouble, 15 miles from Newberry. When he arrived, Sheriff Buford found Louis Burton in the custody of. a large body of men who were very much enraged. Some of these were strongly of the opinion that the ne? gro should be dealt with in a sum? mary nanner. However, the more prudent men prevailed upon the others to desist and the negro was delivered to the sheriff. Some of the cooler men were deputized by the sheriff to take charge of the prisoner while the offi? cer went in search of Ernest Burton and the negro was caught. Sheriff Buford got this prisoner in advance of a searching party. The two Bur? tons were then lodged in Jail by Sher? iff Buford. Levi Ebaugh, who was charged with complicity, was arrest- I ed yesterday and is now in jail. Louis Burton is said to have made a confession in which he :mplicated the two now in arrest and several others. It is alleged that Burton in his confession stated that he had no cause for malice against Mr. Boozer, but the crime was committed because he and several others had been ap? pointed to do this work. He alleges that the burning was planned at a meeting of the organization held last Wednesday night. He asserted that he had no grievance, but that it had faller, to his lot to destroy the prop? erty. Grace Glenn, a negro woman said to be 103 years old, died in a suburb of Columbia Saturday. THE NOBEL MEITZE, President Roosevelt Will Establish Permanent Industrial Peace Com> mission.
