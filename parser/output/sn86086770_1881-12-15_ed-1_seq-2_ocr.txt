MINERAL PQINT^ L _VVTSCONag Mokk than fifteen hundred new build ings have been erected hi Kansas City during the present year, and new ones are being commenced every day. One hundred more Mormon elders are on the point of sailing for Europe to work up recruits, and the Detroit Free Preu comments that we send $7,- 500,(Xi0 hi the heathen each year. Several witnesses from Freeport, 111., were examined in the Guiteau case. All testified that the Guiteau family were sane, sensible, and public spirited as far as they knew. They did not think that Guiteau's father was in sane, and, as far as Guiteau himself was concerned, he acted while at Free port like any ordinary young man. The claim that Manitoba and the British northwest have a white popular tion of 100,000 is disputed by the Toronto Mail. This paper puts the whole pop ulation at 04,000, an increase since 1870 of over 50,000. In the same time the population of Dakota increased from 14,181 to 1 .‘15,180. Gen. Sherman and the executive committee of the Garfield memorial 1 ospital have received encouraging re po, ts from abroad. It appears that in most of the European cities, and even in Cairn, Egypt, committees have been organized to collect money for the pro posed testimonial, as a token of great love and respect for the late president. The legislature of Tennessee was convened Wednesday in special session to re-district the state for legislative representation. The constitution of 1870 provided that when the popula tion of the state should reach 1.500,000, the legislature might increase the rco resentation in the house from seventy five to ninety-nine, and in the senate from twenty-five to thiity-three, beyond which the representation should never be increased. The republicans have, with Mahone, 38 voles in the senate, not counting Davis of Illincu. The democrats have 157 votes. Senator Davis, in his speech on Tuesday, settled the question of committees and left the question of officers in a tantalizing condition. His vote with the democrats could not elect officers, hut it will prevent the election of officers by th■ • republicans. Lieut. Fi.ih'EK does not make a very clear explanation of how the shortage* in his accounts occurred. He says the funds were kept in his trunk, the key of which was in his possesion, and In believed the money to be there until the itsspi clion took place and it was found missing. His servant girl kept part of her clothing in the trunk, but had no key and used tii.s occasion ally for a few moments only. He does not suspect her of taking the money. It is reported that anulhei scheme U grab the lands in the British north west.has been organized in England. The company will have a capital of $10,100,000, and will purchase 2.000,000 acres of land in the northwest of the Canada Pacific and —,oaN>.( 00 acres of the government. The Duke ot Man chester is the president of the company, and Lord Elphinstono vice-president. Canada might learn some lessons in the disposal of public lands from the I uitod Btatea. ____________ It is stated on good authority from Washington that the medical and sci entific experts who have been sum moned by Mr. Scoville to establish Gui teau’s insanity, have been in attendance on the trial and watched the conduct of Guiteau long enough to convince them of his responsibility. When some of them arrived in the city they had prejudged the case, deeming the villain insane, but the proceedings at the trial have cleared their vision. The most of these experts in the insan ity bn iness will be of little use to the assassin. Tucki is to be a course of lectures in Brooklyn on free trade and protec tion, which will bring out Henry Ward Beecher, Professor Perry, David A. Wells and Professor Sumner in advoca cy of the former, and for the latter Pig Iron Kelley, and Professor Robert Ellis Thompson, of the university of Penn sylvania, w iiu is said to be the only pro fessi.c of political economy of any col leen in America who is opposed to free trade. Mr. Beecher is so deeply inter ested in the matter that lie has made an announcement of the coarse from his pulpit. Senator Wisdoms bill to admit southern Dakota as a state makes the northern boundary the forty-sixth par allel of latitude. This is in accordance with the expressed will of the people of the northern half of the territory, as it throws the Northern Pacific rail road district of activity into what, un der this bill, is to become the new ter ritory of northern Dakota. The forty sixth parallel divides the territory al most equally, and gives the northern half a fair start tnwa r d statehood.

Mr. Gladstone, of who whom it was rumored that ho was to be created Earl of liverpool. denies that he is to be raised to the peerage. Railroad* and the Farmer*. In hia admirable address before the Minnesota State Fair, 001. William F. Vilas spake of the immense benefit which the western farmers have deriv ed from the railroad*. He said : Before railroads were devised there was no extensive freight communica tion but by water. And lh*t was val ueless unless conveniently accessible. From this, the agriculture of past ages gathered around the seas and lakes, or lined the rivers’ margin. It girt the Mediterranean and made famous the valley of the Nile. The unwatered w rid of the interior was left to the wandering nomad or the forest barba rian. It was the unknown region full of mysterious terrors. The great Her cynian wood was the home of beasts, brute and human ; the latter ever the impending peril, and finally the de stroyer of the civilization ©f the world. The reserve corps of barbarism lay back on the plains of Russia and Tartary, which nourished the fierce savages who could live ju equine Hesh and carouse on the milk of mares. So, too, water communica tion was slow and tedious, even when accessible. That is true, especially of inland navigation. It is week* by wa ter from St. Raul to New York, though the aid of steam is invoked; and in Northern climes that avenue is avail- We for but half the year. Your mag nificent wheat fields would mostly lie unbroken, farmers of Minnesota, had not ihe invention and enterprise of other men. stimulated by your de mands, laid the double-lined highway to carry the freight-car laden with your precious berry to the sea; the Indian would still be master of the territories of the west. Your lands derive their value, your industry, its reward; your homes the luxuries and the comforts they exhibit, from the railroads of the continent. ; In the beautiful language of that noble lover of human liberty, once the pride and ornament of Wisconsin’s supreme bench, the lamented Byron Paine, “Railroads are the great public highways of the world, along which | its gigantic currents of trade and | travel continually pour high | ways compared with which the I most magnificent highways of antiquity dwindle into insignificance. They are the most marvelous invention j of modern times. They have done more [ to develop the wealth and resources, to | stimulate the industry, reward the labor [ and promote the general comfort and ! prosperity of the country, than any j other and perhaps than all other mre j physical causes combined. There is ; probably not a man woman or child whose interest or comfort has not been in some degree subserved by them, t They bring to our doors the productions of the earth. They enable us to antici pate and protract the scasor s. They en able the inhabitants in each clime to enjoy the pleasures and luxuries of all. They ; catter the productions of the press aud literature broadcast through the country with amazing rapidity. There is scarcely a want, wish or aspiration of the human heart which they do not in some measure help to gratify. They pro mote the pleasures of social life and of friendship; they brine theskilled physi cians swiftly from distance to attend the sick and the wounded, and enable his absent friend to be present at the bedside of the dyi ig. They have more than realized the fabulous conception of the eastern imagination,which pictured the genii as transporting inhabited pal aces throngh the air. They take a train of inhabited palaces from the Atlantic coast, and, with a marvelous swiftness, deposit it on the shores that are washed by the Pacific seas In war they trans port the armies and supplies of the Government with the greatest of cel erity, and carry forward, as it were on the wings of the wind, relief and com fort to those who are stretched bleed ing and wounded on the field of battle.” But, while we do them justice, let us not forget there are doubtless many faults to be corrected, and abuses to be reformed in the administration of these highways. Corporate powers and cor porate values have advanced with a more rapid step than the invention of our sta'emen and lawmakers. The agency of the corporation is compara tively modern, and like the agency of steam, is a mighty power. Unless sub dued by proper appliances of law suf ficient to control it, we are liable to dis asters injurious to our welfare, as the accidents which sometimes befall '.he train are destructive of life. But 1 must not protract this weary hour to discuss this problem foreign to my subject. Important as it is, we need not ferr it. The railroad, rightly used, is the friend of the farmer and the whole people. It is the paramount interest of its owners that it should so remain. They dr.re nut make it an enemy, and when we reflect that a single invention—the steel rail—has re duced the freight tariff forty percent, we may trust somewhat to time and genius to relieve the inconveniences, and continue to enjoy its blessings with com posu re.

Remarkable Small-Pox Remedy. A correspondent of the block ton (Cal.) Herald writes as follows; “ I herewith append a recipe which has been used to my knowledge in hundreds of eases. It will prevent or cure the smiill-oox, though the pittings are tilling. W hen Jenner discovered cow-pox in England the world of science hurltd an ava lanche of fame upon bis head, but when the scientific school of medicine in the world —that of Paris- publish 'd this recipe as a panacea for small pox, 'it passed unheeded. It is as unfailing H- fate, and conquers in every instance. It is harmless, when taken b\ a well person. It will also cure scarlet fever. Here is the recipe as 1 have used it. and cured my children of scarlet fever; here it is as 1 have used it to cure small pox; when learned physicians said the patient mum die, it cured : Sulphate of zinc, ope grain; foxglove (digitalis), one grain; hilf a leaspoonful of sugar: mix with two tahlespoonfnls of water. When thoroughly mixed, add lour ounces of water. Take a spoonful everv hour. Either disease will disappear m twelve hours. For a child, smaller doses, according to age. . It counties would compel their pby-iciaM to use this, there would be no need of houses. If y. t value advice and ex perience, use that for this terrible dw ea*e.”
