A . .PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. .-----. ; M" jjHuraioj, Demnbcr S, 18". ' : To the Senate and House of Representatives : In transaiittin to you my Funrth An nual Message, it is with thankfulness to the Giver ot all pood that us a nation we nave been blessed for the last year with peace at home and abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few people. . n mi we exception 01 tnc recent Uevas fating fire, which swept from the earti , with a breath, as it were, millions ol ac- cumulated wealth in the citv of Boston. . there have been no overshadowing calam ine wiinm me vear to record, lttsgrat itying to note Iiow like their fellow-citizens of the city of Chicago, under similar ircu instances a year earlier, tne artisans of Boston are rallying under their misfor- tunes, and the pro peet is that their en- .-ergy ana perseverance will overcome all obstacles, and show the same prosperity soon that they would have shown had no ' disaster" befallen them. Otherwise, we . have been lree- from pestilence, war and 5 calamities" which often overtake nations, ""nei a far as human jndgment can pene trate the future, no cause seems to exi.-t . to threaten our present peace. When Congress adjourned in June last, a question bad been raised by Great Brit . ain and was then pending which for a time seriously imperilled the settlement by friendly arbitration of the differences existing between this government and that f Her Britannic Majesty, by the treaty of , . "asuingion.wnicnnaawH'nrvteiTPtitotne tribunal of arbitration which had met in iieneva, in Switzerland. The arbitrators, , , however, disposed of the question which liad feonardized the whole of the treaty, and threatened the relations of the two na tions toward each other most unhappily in, a manner entirely satisfactory to this gov ernment, and In accordance with the views and the policy which it had roaln r yarned.- The tribunal, which had eonven i -d in Geneva in December, concluded its lanorous session on the 14th day of Sep tember last, on which day, having availed t itself of the discretionary power given to ' ft by the treaty to award" sum in gross, , wade its decision whereby It awardud the . Fumofft5.50a.00a in gold as the indem nity to be paid by Great Britain to the - Uniftwf Stales forthe satisfaction of all the C lanusreJetrl to Its esnsideration.This de rision happily disposed of a longstanding ., Jif&rence between the two gevernments. ... jmwI do connection wfttt another aw:ml made by the German Emperor under a l CM e nee to him by the same treaty .leaves th two governments without a shadow upon the friendly relations, which, it is; ny sincere hope, may forever remain equally unclouded, j , . ' -V-.'Tbe report of the agent of lh trriied otaies appointed to tne tienev tribunal. accompiiuied by the protocols of the pro - - eeedingsof the arbitrators, the arguments of the counsel ot both governmei ts, the - award ot the tribunal, and the opinions . given by the several arbitrators. Is trans-mitt-d herewith. I have caused fo ba eonimiinieated to the heads of the three jneaaiy powers who compiled with the joint request made, to tiiem under the treaty the thanks of this government tor the appointment of arbitrator made by hcai respectively, and also tnv thanks to the Runent personages named bv them. , and, Jnv app eciattou of Uie dignity, pa tience, impartiality and great abTlitv with which they discharged rheir arduous asd Jiigh ftrectioiis. Ifi-r Majesty's govern ment cms eonimnnieated to me the appre ciation by her Majesty ot the ability and wdef.tigable industry displaced by Mr.. Adams, the arbitrator named on rh j part of this government, during the protracted inquiries and discussions ot the tribunal. I cordially unite with Her Majesty this appreciation. It Is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to record my high appreciation of the marLed ability, unwearied patience, and the prndence and d-scretfoa with widen bo conducted the WJ responsible and delicate duties com ml ted to him, as it is also due to the learned and. eminent counsel who attended I the tntntial on the part of the Govern ment to express my sense of the talents and wvsora which they brought to bear . in the argument of the. result so happilv reached. It will be within the power o"f Congress to provide lor the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to w pm. . . -4- I Although the sum awarded tat not able until a year from the date .f the award, it is deemed advisable that no time oe lost with asking a proper examination - of the several cases in wirch indemnift ca- ' tion may be due; consequently J recom mend the creation ot a board of commis- doners for the purpose. By the third and fourth article of the Treaty of Washing ton, the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain In their con . etniction of the treaty of thj 15th of Juu, . t 1816, defining the boundarv line bet wem their respecti ve territories were submitted to the arbitration and award of his Maj s ty, the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of those claims - is most in accord ance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1S46. His Majesty, the Empe ror of Germany, having been pleased . 4 undertake the arbitration, has the , : earnest thanks of- this Government, and of the people of the United States for the labor, paius and care which he has de voted to the consideration of this long --- pending difference. I have cau e an ex pression ot my thanks to be Cbmmuuieat i to his Majeaty. Mr. Bancroft, the re-P-n-?-w- ---OYernment at Berlin, conducted the cafe and prepared the stated SfI2.t.J?n 1- P" of the United States " JJ.i u"y thlLt hU Pt service Justi . i, fled tnr. pubUe to expect at his bands.

This award confirms the United States in their . : claims to the important i rcbipeiago of . i-land lying between the Continent, and Vancouver's I4and. which, lortwenty-six years since the ratification ot the treaty. oreni isrit.uu ! as contested, and leaves - n for the first time in the history of the United States as a nation without a dis puted question of boundary between our territory .and .the possessions of Gruat t Britain on this continent. It Is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt and spontaneous action of IT'-r Majesty's Goemment in givi: g eftect to tlie award. In anticipation ol any request lrora this government, and before the reception in the United States m the award signed by the emp ror. Her Majesty has given instructions for the te uoval t her troops, which had been sta . tioned there, and for the aessation of all exerci se or claim ot jurisdiction, so as to - leava the United States in exclusive pos session of the lately (Msputott fcTritory.

JOHN F. BOSWORTH, Editor VOL. XXII. the actual line between the territory ac quired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining possessions ot lier untanmc Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests 6t individuals or ot iuiisdiction, are likely to interfere to the delav or embarrassment of the net tial location of the line. If deferred until the population shall enter and occu py the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array tne two gov ernments in an agonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of a commis sion to act jointly witn one mat may ne appointea on tne part oi ureat Britain, to determine tbe line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminous posses sions ot ureat Britain. In my last Annual Message, I recom mended the legislation necessary on the part of the United States, to bring into operation the articles of the Treaty ot Washington, of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and its posessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not then been had, and during the session of Con gress a question was raised which for a time raised a doubt Whether any action by Congress In the direction indicated would become important. This question has since been disposed of, and I have re ceived notice that the Imperial Parliament and the legislature of the Provincial crov- emment have passed lavs to cirrv the provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into operations I thcrSjiore re commend yam- early aaoption ot the legislation in he same direction necessary on the Part of this Government. j The Joint Commission for determining I the bourul&rv lino between " the United States and the BritUli possessions bet ween the Lake of the Woods and the Koekv Mountains has organised and entered upon its work. It Is desirable that the force be increased, in order that the com pletion of the survey and determination i of the line may be the sooner ctta'ned. To this -end I recommend that a supple-Mfc-n(al appropriation he made. - VV ieh France, our earliest ally, Rnssi:i the constant and steady friend of the Uni ted ' States,- Germany- with whose government and people wee have so r many : causes of - friendshin and-' so, many common . sympathies, and with the other powers of Snrope our relations a'e ma!r.tAuied On the tuwst friendly terms. 5ince my last message the exchange has been made of the ratiti catletis at a treaty with tho Ausrro-Hun-gary empire, relating t naturalization ; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consols and trade-marks : also of a Ireaty with Sweden and Norwfiy re lating to natnralbtatioat U which trea ties have beendnl proclaimed. Congress, at its lat-t ersion, having made an appro priation to defray the expeuse of commis sioners on the part of the United States to the International Statistical Congress, at St. Petersburg, the persons appointed in that character proceeded to thvir destina tion aud atteaded the sessions of the con gross. A , report, shall, In duo tcison be laid before you. Tin's TJSug- ess meets at intervals oi,abii three years and has held its seniors in several of the countries of Kulope.- I submit to your consideration the propriety of extending an invitation fo the Congress to hold Its next mcetin" in the United States. The Centennial ! Celebration in 1876 would afford ah appro- pnawj wxasion ior sucn meeting. Preparations are meting for the Inter national Expedition to be held during the next year In Vienna, on a scale ot very gresi magnitude. The tendency of these Expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization, and the elevation of Industry and labor, and of the Increase of human happiness, as well as or greater inter course and good-w 11 between nations. As this Exposition Is to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves efthe opportunity for the pre sentation ot their product tons if encour aged by proper aid and protection. At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this Government at the Exposition. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of appropriation there is danger that the im portant benefit whieh the occasion aflords. wili, in a large, degree, be lost to citizens of the United States. I recommend the Subject strongly to your consideration, and also recommend that an adequate ap propriation be made for the purpose, to further aid American exhibitors at Vien na, at the Rxpositlon, I would recom mend in addition to an appropriation ot money that the Secretary of the Xavy be authorized to fit np two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna and back, their articles for ex hibition. Slice your last session the President of the Mexican republic distinguished by his high character and by his services to his countr.-, has died. His" temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the people, a proof of con fidence on their part, in his patriotism and and wisdom which it is believed will be confirmed by the results of his adminis tration, it is particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government of either republic to strength en their relations as neighbors and friends. It is much to he regretted that many law less acts continue to disturb the quiet ot tlie settlements on the border between our turrit-ory aud t- at of Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to American citizens in various parts of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in u hieh the neighboring republic has so lonjr been iu volved has in somedegn-e contritnHcd to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule ol order through cue liepunnc wiuen may be expected trum the present Government, the acts of which just complaint is made, will cease. The proceedings of the commission un der the convention with Mexico ot the 6ih of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have unfortunately been checked by an by aa obstacle for the- removal of which measures have been taken by the two governments which, it is believed, will prove successful. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolutions of Congress ol tho 7th of May last, lo inquire into dep redations on the Texas frontiers, have dili gently made investigations in that quar ter. Their report upon this subject will b communicated to you. Their research es were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriations made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of her government, has appointed a similar commission to Investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially, but the press of that country states the fullest investigation is desired and that the co-operation of parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be marie at the earliest day practicable to enable the commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their la bors without delay. ' It is with regret that I have again to an nounce the continuance of the disturbed condition of the ' Is land of Cuba. No advance toward tlie pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made, while the Insurrection has gained no advantage, and exhibits no more of the elements ot power or of the prospect ot ultimiie suc cess than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on, the other baud, haa-not suc ceeded in' its repression, ami the parties stand apparently in the same relative atti tude which they have occupied for a long time pat. This contest, has lasted for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance" from our' iiei.'hlMrhoo-l, we might be indifferent to its results, al- THE 

AMERICAN and Proprietor. "Bound though humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents, wherever they might occur ; it is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the comin nance ot this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the aiiministra'ion ot the government ot Cuba could not fail to advance the restor ation of peace and order. It i especially to be hop-d that the present liberal gov ernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. The law of emancipation, which was passed more than tivo years since, has remained unex cuted, in the absence of regulations for its enforcement It wat but a feeble step toward emancipa tion, but it was the recognition of riirht and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with se tiin-nt. ol hu manity an justice, and in sympathy with the other powers of the Christian ai.d civilized world. Within the past few week- the regulations for carrying out the laws of emancipation have been an nounce', giving evideuce of the sincerity of the intention ot the present govern ment to carry into effect the law of lSi i. I have not failed to urge the considera tion of the wisdom, the policy, anil the justice of a more effective system for the abolition ot the great evil which op presses a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close to our border, as well as the expedlencV and the Justice of conceding reform of whieh the propri ety is iiOt..question d.

They are thus in deii- ance of the spirit of our own Uws con tributing to the continuance ef t'ds dis tressing unj stffcehiiig contest. Iii my last, annual message I referred to this suti- ject, and I again recommend such legis lation as may be proper to da .ounce, and i! not prevent, ar, least to discourage American citizens from holding or deal ing in slaves. It is gratifying to announce that the ratification ot the Convention, eotlcl rtd. l under the auspices of this Government, hc- cween npatn on tne one part, and the .u- lied Republics of the Pacific, on the other. providing ior an armistice, has been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith submitter). It is hoped that this may be followed by a pcrmsnect peace be tween tne same parties'. The difTerehces which at one time thi"ealened the maintenance of peace le- tween Brazil and the Argentine ltepubhc, it is hoped, are in the way of satistaclorv adjustment. With these States, as with tlie Republics of Central ami South Amer ica, we continue to maintain the most friendly relations-. . , it is with regret, however, I announce that the government M? Venezuela has madejio furthtT payments on account ot the awards under the Convention of the 2oth of April, 1866. That Republic is un derstood to be now almost, it not quite. tranonilized. It is honed, therefore. thr it will lose no time In providing for the unna:d baian'ceS Ot Its debt to the United States, which having originated in injur ies w iu unveils uy uie Venezuelan t.u thorities, and having been acknowledged pursuant to a treaty, in the most solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference over debts ot a different origin, and contracted in a dif terent manner. This subject is airain recommended to the attention of Congress ior sucn action as may oe oeemea proper. Our treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. Ah imposing embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visited this country dm ing the year that is passing, but being unprovided with powers Tor the siguing of a convention in this country, no conclusion in that di rection was reached. It is hoped, howev er, that tne interchange of opimous which took place during their stay in this coun try has led to a mutual appreciation of the interests whicli may be promoted when the revision of tbe existing treaty shall be undertaken. In this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, that to" give importance and to add to the effi ciency of our diplomatic relations with Ja pan and Ch na, and to further aid in re taining the good opinion of these people and to secure to the United .states its share of the commerce destined to flow between these nations and the balance ot the Commercial world, an appropriation be made to support it least four American youths in each ot these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our min isters. ' Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain ar ot some other powers as now situated. Our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon the natives of tnose countries who know our language imperfectly, or pro cure for the oijc-s-iou the services of em ployees in foreign business houses, or the interpreters of other foreign ministers. 1 renew the recommeauaiion, made on a previous occasion, ol the trail?' "-r to the Uepartmeut ot the interior, to which they seem more appropriately to bclotiif. of all the powers anil duties in relation to the Territories with which the Depart ment ot .Vtatc is now charged by law or by custom. Congress, from the beginning of lhe Government, has wisely made pi' v's cm for the relief ot distressed seaman in I r eign countries. No similar roision. however, has heretotore lM--n in.ide ?-r the relief ot citizens in distress aluo.r: othi rilian seamen. It is undcrstooit to lie customary vvilh other governments to authorize consuls to extern! such rdiel to I heir citizens or suijects in c r tain cases. A similar aiitliotitv. and an appropriation to carry it into ell', ct, are recoinuicuutjU incase ol citizens oi t::e United States. It is well known that such citizens re sort to foreign counti ins in great num bers. Though some ol them are able to hear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who. through accident or otherwise, beco i-e penniless, and have no friend at home able to sui'cor them. Per sons in th situation must either peri-h, cast themselves upon thecliarityof foreign ers, or lie relieved at tiie private cost ot our own officers, who Usually. even with the most benevolent dispositions, have noth ing to spare tor such a purpose. Slio Id the authority ami appropriation aked lor be given, care wili i e taken to crry the beneficence of Congress into effect tnat it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.

With the great reduction of taxation by the acts ot Congress at its last session, the expen diture of the Government in eollecrlnir the revenue will be much redu.-ed f.'r rl.' rext fiscal year. It is very doubf.nl. however, whether any further reduction ot so vexatious a burthen upon any peo ple will lie practicable fir the present at all events. As a measure of justice to the holders ot the nation's certilic-it.es of indebtedness.

All war accounts for money and property prior to 1871, have been examined and transmitted to the Treasury for final set tlement.

Such a route along our eoast would lie. oi great value at all times and of inestimable value in caseot a foreign war. JNature has provided the greater part of thi route, and the obstacles to be overcome are easily within the skill of engineers. have now alluded to this subject, with tlie view of having no further expenditure of public money at tins time man may oe necessary to procure and place all the ne cessary information oetore congress in an authentic form, to enable it hereafter, if deemed practicable and worthy, to legis late on the subject without ueiay. The report of the Secretary of the Xavy, herewith accompanying, explains fully the condition of that branch of the public erviee. its wants and dehcienc.es, exnenses incurred during the past year, and appropriations for the same. It also uri ves a complete history of the services of the navy tor th past year iu addition to its regular services. . It is evident that unless steps are taken to preserve our navy, that in a very lew years tne uniteii States will be the weakest nation upon the ocean, ot all great powers, mtn an eneriretic. progressive people like ours. penetrating and forming business relations with every part ot the known world. navy strong enough to command the re spects ot our nag anroaii is necessary ior the protection ot their rights. 1 recommend tlie ean-lul consideration by Congress of the recommendations made, bv lhe S-eretary of the Navy. The accompanying report oi the Post master General, furnishes a full and satis factory exhibit of tiie operations of the I'o.-toitii Department during the year. The ordinary revenue for the department for the fiscal year ending .Tunc 30ih. 1872, amounted to $21,915,426.37, and the ex penditures to S26.658.192 21. Compared wall ill previous fiscal year the incrcusc ot revenue was 1.878,30.95. or 9.37 per cc;ir.. and the increase of expenditure? $-.!.2;.S.iiS8.23, or 9.29 per cent. ; adding to the ordinary revenue the annual appro priation of $700,000 for free matter and lhe amount paid to the subsidies on mail sreamship lines from special appropria tions. The deficiency paid our of the general Treasury was $3,317,765.94. an excess ot $3S9.7o7.2S over tiie deficiency tor the ycar 1-71. Other interesting statis'ical information relating to our rapidly extending postal service is furnished in this report. lhe total length ot railroad mail routes on lhe 3oth day' of June, was 57 911 miles. 8,u77 miles oi such service having been put into operation dining the year. Kight new lines of railway postotHees have been es tablished with an aggregate length ot 2,909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with fori ign countries as 24.362. 500, an increase of 4,066, 502, or twenty per cent, over t' e number in 1S71. and t ip po.-tuge thereon amounts to $1,871, 257.25. The total weight of the mails exchang ed w.th the European countries exceedc. 8J0 tons. The cost of the United States trans Ai Untie mail steamship service, was $220, 301.70. The to al cost of the United Stales ocean steamship service, including the amounts paid to the snhsiiiizeil lines of mail steamers, wits $1,027,020.97. The following are the only steamship' lines now receiving subsidies for laail service under the special acts of Con gress: The Pacific Slail Steamship Com psny receive five hundred thousand dol lars per annttm for carrying a monthly mail b tween San Francisco, Japan and China, whi-h will be increased to $1,000. 000 er a 'imm for a semi-monthly mail on and alter October 1st, 1S73.

Your favorable consideration is respect fully invited to the recommendation made by the Postmaster General tor an increase of service fro-n monthly to semi-monthly trips on the mail steamship route to Bra zil ; for a subsidy in aid of the establish-' ment of an American line of mail steam ers between San Francisco, New Zealand and Australia ; for the establishment of post office savimrs ban-s; and for the in crease of the salaries of the heads of bu reaus. I have heretofore recommendel the abolition ot the franking privilege, and see no reason now lor changing my vitevs on that subject. It not having been fa vorably regarded by Congress, however, I now suggest a modification of that priv ilege, to corr!ct its glaring and eostiy abuses. , I would recommend also the appoint ment Ot a eommitti-e or commission to f.tke into consideration the best method, equitably to private corporations, who h ive invested their rime and capital in the establishment ot' telegraph hues, of acq Hir ing the title to alt telegraph lines now in operation and. of connecting thi service ui'.h The po-ta" service ot the nation. It is not nrohable licit this subject could re ivivc the proper consideration during the limits ot a short Session of Congress, b;:t it. may be initiated, so that further action may tie fair to the government aud to pri Tare rjart'vs concerned. There are but three lines of o.fean steamers, namely: The Pacific mall S. S Co.. belwe-nSin rraiic'sro, China and J .pan, with provisions made for semi monthlv service after O tober 1st, 1873: the United States and Brazil line, month ly, and the California, New Zealand artl Australian line, monthly, plying between th United St itosand foreign ports, and owned anil operated under our llag. 1 earnestly r- commend that such liberal contract i ttf irarryhig maiis be authoriZi d with these l.nes as tf-i!l Insure fheir con tinuance. It the expediency of extending tlie aid of the Government to lines of steamers which hitherto have not received it should be deemed worthy of the consid. ration ol Congress, political and commercial objects make it advisable to bestow -uch aid on a line u-.der our-ftaa between Pana ma and the wester: South American Hurts: Bv this means trade now diverted to other countries might lie bro'tht to usj to the mutual advantage of thi- country and those lying iu that quarter of the con tinent of America. The report of the Secretari' of th- Treasury will show an 'alarming falling off in our carrying trade or the l.i-t ten or twelve years.'and even ior the past year. I do not believe that tne public treasure Jan b! (' ''tee expended in the interest ot the who'e people than in trvmtr to recover this trade. An ex penditure of live million dollars per an mini, tor the next liv years, if it would re store to us our proportion ol the carrying trade of the world, would be prohtably expentied. The price of labor in Europe has so much increased in the last few years that t- v cost of building and oper.tting ocean steamers in the t inted States, is not so much greater than in Europe, that I be Ih'vc the time has arrived for Congress to tjike this subject into serious eonsidcri- tion. , A detailed statement of the disburse ments through the Department of Justice will be furnished bv the report ot the At torney General, and though these have been somewhat increased through the recent act of Congress to enforce tlie rights ot citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the Union, and to enforce the provisions ot the four teenth amendment to the Constitution ol tlie United States, the necessity and salu tary effects of these enactments are appar ent. itecKiess ami lawless men, i regret to say, have associated themselves togeth- r in some localities td deprive other citi zens ot the rights guaranteed to them Dy the Constitution ot the United States, and to that end have committed deeds of vio lence; but the arrest and punishment ot many ot these persons nave tended greatly to the repression of sucli disor ders, and I do not doubt tl at a great major ity of the peoples iu all pans of the country favor the lull enjyincnt by ail classes of persons ot those riiihts to which they are entitled under the constitution and the laws, and to :n voke the aid and influence of all good cit. izens to prevent organizations, whose oh lecfs are. bv unlawlul means to interfere witn these rights. I iook witn conn.ienee to the time not far distant when the obvi ous advantages ot good otder and peace will induce an abandonment of all combi nations prohibited bv the acts referred to. and when it will be unnecssarV to cirrv on prosecutions or inflict punishment to protect citizens from lawless domgs oi such combinations. Applications have bi-en made to me to pardon persons con victed ot a violation ot said acts, upon the 'round that clemency in such cases would tend totraiupiilize the public mind, and to test the virtue of that pol cy, I am dis posed as my sense ot justice will permit. to sive to these persons a favorable con- ideration; but any action then on i-not to be construed as ikdicating anyc ange ir.y dcienuination toenforce with vigor such 'uws so lonir as the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the tot the country. It is much to be rcerettcd. and is regretted by no one more than myself, that a neites-ity has ever existed to exei ute the enforcement act. No one eaii desire it more than 1 that the necessity of applying it may never again bo demanded. The Secretary ol the Interior reports -afistactorv improvement and progression of each of the several bureaus under the ontrol of the Interior Department, flics - are all in excellent condition. Tiie work which iu some O' th ui for some ears has been in arears, has been brought lown to s recent date, and in all the cur rent business has been promptly dis patched. I he policy which was adopted at tnc beginning of the-administration with re gard to the management of the Indians has bee . a successlii. as its most ardent ric nds anticipated within so short a lime.

The policy will ho ma ntaincd wiihoutany change excepting such as iur therexperience u.av show to he necessary to render it more elih-ient. The subject ol Oliver ing the so-called Indian Territory, soul hot Kansas, into a home for the In dians, and lhe erection thereof a territo rial form of government, is one of great importance as a complement of the exist in uf Indian policy. The ipn-siion ot re moval to this portion of the pijblic domain has generally b. en received by them with Vavor. As a preliminary step to tic organization of such a Territory, it will he necesvarv to confine the India' s now resident tnertiu.

There is no other location now available wheie a people who are endeavoring to acquire a knowl edge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits, can be as well accommodated as upon the unoccupied land in the Indian Territory. A territorial government should how ever protect the Indians from the inroad ol whites tor a term of years intil they become sufficiently advanced in the arts and civilization to guard their own rights and the disposal of lands held by them. During the last lis cal year, there were disposed of, out of the public lands, 1 1.8-4.975 acres, a quantity greater by 1.099,270 acres than was disposed of the previous year. Oi this amount 1.370.3-0 acres were sold for cu-h: 380.460 acres located with military war rants; 4.671. 332 acres taken lor home steads) 694.613 acres located with college scrip: 3,554.885 acres granted to niilrotuls; 465.347 acres granted to wagon roads: 7 14,255 acre sgi yen lo states S'l'Waiiip Ian i; 5.7 0 acres, located by Indian scrip.

The reports from the subordinates ot tiie Iand oilee, contain interesting informa tion in regard to their respective depart ments'.

During the year ending Scptemlier 30. 17'i, there were l's.stte.l irom the Patent Office 13.62S patents, 263 extensions and Coij certiiieates and registers ol trad.s. marks. Durlff the same time 19.587 ap plications for patents, including' r.-is-ues and designs, have been recelt-'-l. and 3,100 caveats filed. The fees received during the same peri od amounted to $623,553 90. and the total expenditures to g!5tti, 153.46, making the net receipts over the expenditures $77. 400.50. Since lS3a, 210.000 applications for patents hare been tiled and about 134. 000 patents i-sin d, fife .tli -es Ih ing con ducted tinder the same law nd g ncia! organization as were adopted at, file' "ugi nal inauguration when only HO to 500 ap plications were made per annum.

This subject was presented to foiiar ss in a spiHMal coiiiiut;nif!tiO'i in F. bruarv last, with my approval and thcapprovai i.t lhe Secretary ot the Interior, aud the sn:r-ge-tioiis contained in said communicafl were embraced in a bill that was reported to the House by tbe coeimiitee on pat ents at the la -t.

The amount pai l for pensions in the last fiscal vear was $301,603.40, mi amount larger by $37.(N.4 than was paid I'riring the p eccding year. Ot this amount, 2:1.134.61 were paid under the act of Congress of February 17, 1871, to survivors f the war of 1812. The an nual increase of pensions by the legisla tion of Congress has more than kept pace with the natural yearly losses from the rolls. The act Of June 8. 1872. has added an estimated amount of 750,000 per an num to the rolls without increasing; t!a? number of pensioners; we cannot theTft 1 fore look for any substantial decrease in the expenditures of this department, for some time to come, or so long as ou sfresg continues to change the dates of pensions. The whole number of soldiers enlisbnl in tiie war of the rebellion was 2.688.553. The total number of claims lor invalid pensions is 176.000. hcins but. six percent. of the whole nuiiiiK-r of enlisted ni The total number of claims on hand at the beginning of the year, S1.60; the number rec- ivinl during the year, was ifl.- 574; number disposed of was 35.173. ma dug a net gam ol 1.264. 1 lie nuiiiner ot claims now on hie is 79.081. On the 30th ol.luuc. 1872. there were on the rolls the names ot 95.405 invalid military pensioners. 113.518 widows, orphans and dependent relations, making au aggregate of 203.923 army jieii sioncrs. At the same time there were on the rollsthe nam 's of 1.449 navy pension ers and 1.7:10 widows, orphans ami de pendent relatives, makin..' I he who!; num ber of navAi pensions 3.179. There have been received since the pas sage of the act to provide pen -.on forthe survivors of the tvur of 1812. 36.551 ap pli.jmts prior to June 30. 18.2. Ol thesr there were allow -d, during the hist fiscal year, 20.126 claims; 4.845 were rejected during the ye.ir, leaving 11.580 cl.-d us laming at that date; the number of lw-n-sions irranred during the last fi-cal year was 33 830. During that period t here were dropped troin the rolls, tor various causes. 9.146 names, leaving a grand tot- I of 232.229 pensioners on the rolls on the 30th av oi .;u e. 1872. It is thought that the claims lorjKii- sions ou account ot he war ot 1SI2 .mII all be disposed of the first ot May. 1873. It is estimated that $3J.480.000 will lie re quired for the pension service during the next fiscal year. The ninth census is about completed. Its completion is a suhj -ct ol congratula tion, inasmuch as the use to be made ot the statistics therein cont lined depend Very greatly on the promptitude ot puti- ncation. 1 tie secretary oi tiie interior recommends that a census lie tuk: n iu 1875. which recommendation should re ceive the readv attention ot i.ongress. 'he relations at preent established bc- tw.i'ii the ledcral census is so long that the information obtained at the di'im 1 periods as to the material conditions wants and resources ot the nation is ot ittle practicil value after the expiration of the first half ot that period, it would probably obviate the Constitutional pro- ion regarding t he decimal census, u a census taken in 1875 should be divested of II political character, and no reappor tionment of congressional representation lie made under it. Such a census, coining. as it would, in the last year ot the Hr-t i-enturv of our national existem-e would Ornish a noble monument ot progress ot the United States during tnat century. The rapidly increasing interest in edu cation is a most, encouraging nature in the current history of the country, and it no doubt true that this is due tu a great measure to the etlorts ol the Bureau of Education.

Ii has seamed to lie the policy of the leg islature ot Ulnh to evade 1.11 responsibili ty to tbe government of the United Slates, snd even to hold a position in hos tili'v to it. I recommend a careful re vision of the present laws of the Terri tory bv Congress, and the enactment of such a law as the one proposed in Cou-s-ress at its last session of instance, or something similar to it. as will secure peace, the equality of all citizens before the law, and tlie ultimate extinguishment ot polygamy. Since tne establishment oi a lerrnonai rovernment for tlie District of Columbia the improvement of the condition of the Citv of Wasliinsrton and surroundings. and the increased prosperity of the citi zens, is observable to the most casual visi tor. The nation, nt-ingaiarge owner oi property in this citv, should bear with the citizens of the district its just share t tlie expense of these improvements. I recommend, therefore, an apppropna tion to reimburse tlie citizens forthe work done by them along and in front of pub lic grounds during the last year.and seve ral appropriations, in order that the im provement and embellishment of the pub lic buildings and g. ounds may keep pace with the improvements of tlie Territorial author!! ies.
