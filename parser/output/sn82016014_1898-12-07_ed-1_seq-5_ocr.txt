It is stated in "Vall street that the board of trustees of the Seaman's bank for savings is considering the question of reducing' the rate of inter est from 4 to 3H per cent and that if this bank takes such a course many of the other big institutions that have been hesi tating will probably follow suit. The Seaman's bank has been reluctant, according to some of its neighbors, to make a change for six months or a year yet, but it is said that the previous course taken by the Kmigrani, Industrial and Greenwich Savings banks had considerable weight with it. Since these banks reduced their interest their deposits have continued to expand. It is about two years since the Emigrant bank came down to a 3Vs Per cent basis. The idea of reducing interest has been under consideration for several years and it was actively broached at the last meet ing of the New York Savings Bank asso ciation. It was the general opinion that early steps would have to be taken, al though no formal course was recommend ed. The savings banks in many western cities have already come down to a per cent basis, while others have reduced their rate to 3 per cent. Many of the local savings bank officials believe that it is only a Question of time when they will have to come down to 3 per cent in New York city, for there are now very few investments outside of land mortgages yielding more than 32 per cent in which the savings banks are allowed to use their funds. In "Wall street an impression prevails that the bankers of some of the leading cities have been exchanging notes with a view to taking uniform action, thereby dispelling the notion that any one or two cities are adopting arbitrary measures. MATTER OF PRECEDENT. Whether Pay Should Be for Two Full Years or N"ot Four years ago the second Monday In January came on January 14 and when the Lewelling administration went out they drew their pay up to that time, although it gave them more than two years' salary-. Two years ago when the Morrill administration went out the second Monday in January came earlier, but the officers put in their bills for two full years, and they were paid, although it took four days' pay from the appro priation for the present officers. Some of the present clerks and offi cers claim that this precedent entitles them to draw two full years' salary be fore they go out of office, and that the deficit will have to be made up out of the appropriation for the next admin istnfcion. The question has been re ferred to State Auditor Morris for set tlement, but he has not ruled on it yet. 

HOCK ISLAND EARNINGS. Net Income for October Shows a Sur plus of Over $100,000. Chicago, Dec. 7. A feature of the Oc tober report of the Rock Island road, which has just been issued, is the large increase in passenger earnings. The increase in freight earnings was small, and as the increase in operating expen ses was more than three times as large, there would have been quite a decrease in net earnings il it had not been offset by the large increase in the passenger earnings. As it is, net earnings for the month show a surplus of over $100,000. The road did an enormously large freight business, and if the rates had not been so badly demoralized the in crease over the earnings of last year would have teen phenomenally large. DR. EMBREE ISWEDDED. Former Pastor of the First Methodist Church. Married to Misa Mary Waters, Daughter Of CAPT. J. G. WATERS At the First Methodist Church This Morning. A Large Number of Prominent Members Of the "First Church" Present at the Wedding. Dr. A. S. Embree and Miss Mary Waters were married this morning at 10 o'clock at the First Methodist church. Dr. Embree is pastor of the North To peka Methodist church and former pas tor of the First Methodist church. Miss Waters is the daughter of Captain and Mrs. J. G. Waters of Topeka. Rev. J. R Madison, presiding elder of the Topeka district of the Methodist conference, ofrieiated, assisted by Dr. J. D. Countermine of the First Presbyterian church. After the ceremony the guests present offered their congratulations and Dr. and Mrs. Embree left in a carriage for the Santa Fe depot, where fhey took the 1:45 train for the west. Dr. Embree would not state where they would go on their wedding trip, but laughingly said: "We will be back soon. Just tell them we went away." Mrs. Embree wore a traveling costume of brown novelty cloth, tailor-made, a small dark hat and a short black cape lined with American Beauty silk. The wedding was a surprise to many of Dr. Embree's and Miss Waters' most inti mate friends and it was not until yester day that the wedding invitations were is sued. Neither Captain nor Mrs. Waters nor any of the bride's relatives were pres ent. It is understood that the bride's pa rents were strongly opposed to the mar riage. Yesterday afternoon Dr. Embree went into W. V. Roehr's store and asked him if he would play a wedding march the next morning at 10 o'clock. Dr. Embree did not sav who would be married and Mr. Roehr did not know until he saw Dr. Embree walking up the aisle with Miss Waters. Those present were Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Shellabarger, Colonel and Mrs. A. S. Johnson, Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Griswold, Mr. and Mrs. P. I. Bonebrake, Mrs. Criss man. Mr. and Mrs. Geo. M. Noble, Mr. and Mrs. II. Clarkson, Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Fellows. Mr. and Mrs. W. M. Davidson. Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Torrington, Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Gossett, Mrs. Tewkesbury, Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Sim. Mr. and Mrs. Jas. A. Troutman, Mr. and Mrs. S. S. Ott, Mr. and Mrs. W. M. Forbes. Mr. and Mrs. W. N. Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. W. S. Fur man. Mrs. C. C. Adams, Mr. and Mrs. W. I. French. John V. Abrahams. C. P. Adams, Mr. and Mrs. W. A. McCarter, Judge and Mrs. G. A. Huron, Mrs. T. B. Sweet. Miss Sweet. Miss Welcome, Mrs. Balr. Mr. J. K. Bair. The bride is one of the most accomplish ed young women in Topeka. To a woman lv grace and bearing is added a beautiful form and face. She has dark eyes and almost raven black hair. She has long been one of the most enthusiastic mem bers of the First M. E. church and has been prominent in church work. She is Just past 32, while her husband is 20 years her senior. The opposition of the family to the mar riage was because of the secrecy which was observed. Dr. Embree personally in vited a few of his friends and they were all requested to say nothing about the ap proaching marriage. The confidence was so well observed that only a few outside of the invited guests knew of the cere mony. One of the prominent members of the church said today after the ceremony: "The best people in Topeka will approve of this marriage. They have known the bride as an excellent young woman and she will be of great assistance to her hus band." The members of the Waters family re fuse to discuss the marriage. Dr. Embree lives in a beautiful home at the corner of Fifth and Lincoln streets and when he and his bride return from a brief wedding trip they will make their home there. 

FRANK GOULD'S DENT Seems to Be in the Direction of West ern Union Property. New York, Dec. 7. Now that Frank J. Gould, the youngest of the sons of Jay Gould, has reached his majority, thereby under the terms of his father's will becoming one of the executors and trustees of the estate, it is expected that he will also soon be elected to member ship in the directories of the various Gould properties. His three older brothers are on these boards, but each has some interest to which toe devotes bis special attention. George J. Gould is especially active in the management of the Missouri Pa cific system. Edwin looks after a big match company, and Howard, who was elected to membership in the New York Stock Exchange on February 24, 1898, it is said will go into Wall street on his return from his wedding trip. Frank J. Gould is, like his brother George, an expert telegrapher, and has always taken a particular interest in the Western Union Telegraph company, and it is believed that he will turn his attention chiefly to the affairs of that corporation. He is also said to be greatly interested in the International and Great Northern Railroad company, one of the Gould roads in Texas.

It post the Republican state central committee Just 67 cents less than $10, 000 to elect the Republican state ticket, according to the statement of the ex penses of the campaign as just filed with the county clerk by F. G. Willard, treasurer of the state central commit tee. This amount, of course, does not include what was spent by individuals and by congressional committees, but just the money which passed through Mr. Willard's hands. . In making out his statement Mr. Wil lard apparently took the check book of the committee and copied the names of the persons to whom the checks were made out and the amount without specifying for what purpose the money was used. There were 284 different Items in the statement. The highest amount received by any one person was by the secretary of the committee, Frank L. Brown, who re ceived $2,378.48. Mort Albaugh, chair man of the committee, on the other hand, received only $195. One stenog rapher received $310.95. George A. Clark received $282.95. "M. G. Miller, treasur er," is charged with $206.42. Of the Republican newspapers the Hutchinson News received the most, $274.55. The Kansas City Journal re ceived $175: the Topeka Capital $144.80, and the Mail and Breeze $97. lo. The cost of stereotype plates of the Wetmore letter and other campaign matter, which were furnished free to the publishers of the country newspa pers, was one of the big items of ex pense. For this purpose the A. N. Kellogg Newspaper company received $567.80. The Western Union Telegraph com pany was paid $852.82, and the Postal $77.58. The Missouri & Kansas Tele phone company received $75.80. The money was largely expended, of course, in the payment of the expenses of the campaign speakers, and for help and clerk hire around the committee rooms. There is no item for postage in the entire statement, but this was pro bably paid out of the amount drawn by Secretary Brown. The receipts of the committee were $10,116.88, so that there is still on hand $117.55. This money was all received from Chairman Albaugh by Treasurer Willard. in amounts varying from $51.73 to $2,306.26. Where the money came from originally the statement does not show. TAKEN FROM THE TRAIN Young Man Arrested on Early Santa Fe From the West. the The police this morning' arrested Charles L. Thompson, on the Santa Fe passenger train from California that arrives at 4:20, for embezzlement. Last night the following telegram was received from Los Angeles: Chief of Police, Topeka, Kan. Arrest C. L. Thompson on No. 2 from California. Will arrive 4:20 p. m. Trav eling on special soldier ticket. Charge, embezzlement. (Signed) JOHN BURR, Sheriff. When the train arrived Sergeant Ow ens and Officer McElroy boarded the train and were told by the conductor that Thompson was asleep in a berth of the tourist car. The officers awak ened him and told him he was under ar rest. "What for?" he asked. "Embezzlement," was the answer and w-ithout further questions Thompson dressed and accompanied the officers to the station. His trunk was taken from the baggage car to the station. The conductor of the train informed the officers that two tickets, one from Los Angeles to Albuquerque and one from San Francisco to Kansas City had been missed by passengers on the train. When Thompson was searched the two tickets were found in his pockets and $40 sewed in his undershirt sleeve. When the tickets were found he said they had been given him to keep and that he had forgotten to return them. Thompson is about five feet nine and fairly well dressed. His trunk contain ed civilian and military clothing. He will be held until the California officers arrive. A MODEL CITY. Saa Been Made of Santiago by Oen. Wood. Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 7. General Leonard Wood.governor of the province of Santiago, has wrought wonders in Santiago. From the very commence ment of his regime dirt and disorder began to give place to cleanliness and quietude, although the people who were being benefited were the last to ap preciate his efforts. Even the most rabid anti-American who knew Santiago in the past must perforce admit now that not only is the city clean, but that the people and even the animals are looking better than at any previous time. A small bridle path around the city has been turned into a fine, wide road that carriages can drive over, and it is the intention of General Wood to plant a large number of eucalyptus trees which will not only lend a pleasant shade of the drive but will be largely instrumental in conducing to the future health and well being of the city. Several of the main streets of the city are being macadamized. The civil hospital is a magnificent building, situated in a splendid location, with an unequaled view of the city, the bay and the surrounding hills. Inside, however, dirt, mismanagement and a total lack of any system of drainage formerly helped to kill off more patients than were cured, but today no speck of dirt is to be seen, everything is under perfect management; there is a system of drainage that would not discredit a New York hospital and the patients have everything that medical comforts and human ingenuity can obtain for them. In the old days the governor of the province used to pay a visit to the hospital about every six months, notifying the hospital officials several days before hajtd of his intended call, so that by the time of his arrival all that looked unpleasant was carefully hidden out of sight. Nowadays Gen eral Wood calls at some unexpected time at least twice a week. Gambling has been sternly suppressed. A bull fighter and his assistants ar rived here a few days ago with the in tention of giving a "classical" enter tainment. But General Wood quickly nqtified the promoters of the enter prise that no permit for the proposed exhibition would be granted and that if they tried to give a performance everybody engaged would be fined $1,000. The members of the troupe are now packing up their belongings and intend to go to Havana. The appointment of Senor Bacardi as alcalde, or mayor, has given great sat isfaction to the Cubans. He is a wealthy man. Fair and supper at Unity tomorrow. RUSHING WORK. Lively Preparations in Cuba for Com ing: of American Troops. New York, Dec. 7. A dispatch to the Herald from Havana says: A severe test has been given the new pier at Marianao beach by a strong norther that has been blowing for four days, and its builders are pleased that it has weath ered the attacks of the waves. The storm has demonstrated, however, the impossi bility of landing troops or supplies there during the heavy seas. The result is that a new landing place has been selected at the oil company's pier between Chorrera and Vedado, near the mouth of the Chorrera river. Work upon the new docks at this point Is being hurried by the volunteer engineers and by Sunday, when the troops are expected, any transport drawing 25 feet of water or less may be accommodated, thus obviat ing the necessity of lighterage. The vol unteer engineers are now comfortably en camped. They have had the tent floors boarded and are busily pressing forward the work for the reception of the troops. On the site of the camp for the First bri gade the ground has been cleared, streets have been marked out and everything has been put in readiness for their arrival. Plans for the sewerage and water sys tem have been completed and the ground has been plowed out for the , necessary pipes. Three sidings are being construct ed connecting the camp with the railroad system and as soon as the necessary ma terial arrives these various works will be pushed. It is probable that much of the work will be given out by contract in or der to expedite matters. President McKinley's message has given the greatest satisfaction to the Cubans, who look upon it as a definite declaration of the policy of the United States toward Cuba. Rafael Portuondo, the president of the Cuban assembly, said: The message is most satisfactory to Cuban aspiration and will have an excel lent effect here. It proves beyond further cavilling and dispute the honest intention of the United States toward Cuba. It will quiet many of our more violent associates who have talked loudly about America and been suspicious of her intentions, and it will enable those, like myself, who have believed and trusted in her, to co-operate more fully with her officials in their work.' It is a good message and fully satisfies us." ! In carrying out his work of sanitation for the city. Major Davis, with a sanitary inspector, maue tne rounds ot tne princi pal cafes and hotels, examining the inter nal arrangements, with a view to Issuing orders for their compulsory cleaning. Of the nine hospitals inspected by him. Major Davis reports that the Reina Mercedes is the only one in fit condition to receive pa tients. General Humphreys has ordered that no Cuban physicians attend the men of the quartermaster's department, and in the future physicians of the marine hospital service will give professional attention to anv of his men who may fall 111. The price of provisions continues to ad vance, the supply not being equal to the demand.

HARRIS'S AMENDMENT "Will Ba Added to the Nicaragua Canal BilL New Vork, "Dec. 7. A dispatch to the Herald from Washington says: The senate committee on the Nicaraguan canal will add to the canal bill now pending- a provision intended to bring about a treaty with Great Britain for a joint gruar anty o-f the neutrality of the canal. This provision is embodied in an amendment which has been prepared by Senator Har ris of Kansas, who is one of the closest students of the problems relating- to the construction of the canal, as well as one of the most earnest supporters of the ca nal project in congress. The Harris amendment will authorize the president to negotiate a treaty agree ment with Great Britain for a joint guar anty of the permanent neutrality of the canal. It is designated to meet the Kng--lish objections that the plans of congress for American construction and control fly in the teeth of the expressed terms of the Clay ton-Bui wer treaty. The failure of the president to make any mention in his message of the existence of that treaty has called forth a note of criticism from the London newspapers, particularly those which are regarded as representing" the views of the British government. The president's failure to refer to- the treaty Is construed as encouragement to congress to go ahead without any reference to the terms of that document which Great Brit ain contends are and ought to be still in force. The American contention has. of course, been that Great Britaain's violations of the terms of that treaty have been such as to practically abrogate it and certainly euoh as to give this government full war rant in going ahead with the construction of the canal without any reference to its provisions. It is Senator Harris idea, and Senator Morgan agrees with him. that the simplest way to prevent any misunderstanding' is to authorize the president to make an agreement of the kind contemplated by the amendment. 

HARSH PLEADS GUILTY. To the Indictment Made in Connec tion With, the Keystone Bank. Philadelphia, Dec. 7. Gideon W. Marsh, president of the Keystone Na tional bank, which failed in March, 1891, was arraigned in the U. S. district court today and pleaded guilty to indictments charging the misappropriation of funds of the institution and the making of false reports of the bank's condition to the comptroller of the currency. Sen tence was deferred. It will be remembered that Marsh disappeared In May, 1891, his bail of $20, 000 being forfeited, and that he was a fugitive from justice until November 3, last, when he returned to the city and voluntarily surrendered to the court. Wm. Steel, formerly cashier of the wrecked Chestnut Street National bank was also arraigned today and pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him with aiding and abetting President Wm. M. Singerly (now deceased) in the misappropriation of the funds of that institution. 

KAISEK DISAPPOINTED. He Found Jerusalem Badly in Need of Repair. New York, Dec. 7. A dispatch to the World from Berlin says: Disappointment was the dominant im pression left in the kaiser's mind by his visit to the Holy Land. His address to the evangelical clergy of Bethlehem, now first published, candidly expressed that feeling. He said: "To describe the impressions of the last few days, I must say that I am, above ail things, very disappointed. "I did not want to say that here, but as T have heard that my court chaplain felt the same thing, I will not keep it from you. "It may be that the unfavorable approach to the town at Jerusalem contributed to this, but when one sees the state of things at holy places and what goes on there, it cuts into one's heart. "Only the Christian life can make an im pression upon Mohammedans. "Nobody can wonder if they have no respect for the Christians in ecclesiastical matters, as the Christians aer divided. "They must be prevented, even by force, from quarrelng with one another at this sacred spot." The emperor has said since his return: "My visit to Jerusalem has shattered the dearest illusion of my heart. Its squalid and undignified decay is indescrib able." Anti-Treating Crusader Sued. Providence, R. I., Dee. 7. Suit for di vorce has been filed here against Oli ver Sumner Teall of New York, the or ganizer of the anti-treatlng crusade. Florence B.
