Treaty To Come Later (bV Aseoclated Press) Washington, Dec. . 2 General recommendations , on legislation to combat thehigh Cot of living, radicalism and readjustment of the nation ito a'peace time basis, were features of President Wil son's message to Congress,.today. The peace treaty and the railroad question will be discussed in a la ter separate message.' , , The President's principal re commendations are the establish-' ment of a budget system for na- j tional finances; reorganization of the taxation system with simplifi cation of income and excess pro fits; readjustment of, the tariff system, if necessary, to meet the changed world conditions and make the' system conform with the fact that the United States is the "greatest . capitalist in the world;" recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war particularly, in the way of govern ment farms as proposed by Sec retary Lane ; prqper methods to foster the dyestuffs industry to keep the United States independ ent of Foreign supply ; enlarged program for rural development in recognition of the farmers' part in the war, and measures which "will remove causes of political restlessness in our body politic." ,At this points the ' President made his most extensive refer ence to the- peace treaty, saying the causes for unrest "are super ficial rather than deep seated" , and that they "arise from or are connected with failure on the part of the government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting the , return to normal conditions from transfu sion' or. radical , theories .. from seething European centers, pend ing such delay from heartless profiteering from the machina tions of passionate and malevol ent agitators, and with the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear., ' The President renewed recom mendations for legislation to deal effectively with "those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institu tions." - i , -' Several recommendations were made to cut the cost of living, in cluding extension of the food con trol law Ho a, peace time emer gency; cold storage law and law to secure ""competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits "by federal license v of corpora tions selling food in interstate commerce. A long portion of the message was devoted to discussion of con ditions and rights of labor. "A definite program to bring about improvement in conditions of la bor and genuine democratization of industry" were recommended '" "The only.wayo keep men from agitating against grievances is to remove the grievances," the message said. At another point it declared the "seed of revolution is present" and asserts .that the League ( of nations principles of fers the only way to industrial pertce and conciliation. ' No oth er road is open to us. , . The message declares "collec tive bargaining is humane and la bor must not be treated as a com modity.". "The right of individ uals to strike is inviolate' the message says, "and ought not to be interf erred with by any pro cess of government, but there is a predominant right and that is the right of government to protect all its people and assert its power rfrld majesty against the challenge of any clas9." i This was refer ring to the recent coal strike in junction. f , j ' '. , The message closed with point ed reference to radicalism and red doctrines, and referred Jto Russia today; with' Its "bViod and terror" as. painful object lessons of power bf'minorities. ; , : "Orderly processes," the mes sage declared ,'is the only way to obtain relief and reform; any oth er, method is enemy mothed. Let those beware who take any short-j er road of disorder and . revolu- tion. In J795 it took 100 days mail from London to Bombay.
