The biography has, therefore, a strong autobiographical character. It is only the political career and public serricee of this Apostle of Free Trade, which the author has sought to sketch. A raluable index has been appended, in which the author has endeavored to give a ready clew to the opin ions of Mr. Cobden on all public questions, and to group around him his associates.

The McIIenry House in Meadville has a reputation as broad as it is excellent. IU model landlord, Mr. Tay lor, formerly our fellow-townsman, is soon to return to the Angier House in this city. The Meadville Republican explains the wil lingness and the brisk and polite manner with which the table attendant and em ployees at the McHenry House perform their duties, by the fact that their employer exhibits toward them the same traits of gen erous liberality, which are so well known to the public. On Thanksgiving day, about three o'clock, P. an elegant dinner was given by Mr. Taylor to his employees, at which the following sentiment was proposed and drauk wiiA ail the- honors i - Oua Hospitable Employee and nis akiablk Ladt : Ever ready to attend to the comfort of their guests; always contribut ing to the wants of the needy ; never for getful of their employees, in sickness or in health, but ever willing to add to their hap piness, we, as employees, wisn tnem every hsppiness; and will freely labor to promote one of their greatest wishes, namely, the in. te rests of the McHenry House. The Republic observes! ' ' "This deserved testimony to the worthy host of the McHenry, reflects credit upon both par ies ; on him for so amply deserv ing it, on them for knowing so well how to express it" Is Search or a Ebeabt Wife Matbiho kial " Teavailb." We saw and heard, yer terdsy morning, a love-husband, and father lorn man breathe his 'plaint against an er rant wife and mother, actual and prospect ive, of his or some one's children, into the ear of the attentive police.. . He is a son of toil, resident in Newburgh,and is afflicted either with paucity or softening of brains. Four years ago he took unto his bosom as wife Mary Jane Gains, of Elyria, by whose as sistance he was rearing a hopeful family. But a month ago she folded her tent like the Arabs and as silently stole away with a brother-in-law of the deserted. Sincewhich event the husband and father has been on his travels, in travail to find her. Having exhausted his little pile of greenbacks, he asked the privilege of sleeping in the city prison Sunday night .

Judge Abbey heard a number of eases of more than ord nary interest, yesterday morning, including burglaries, robberies of houses, horse thefts, Ac, Ac The standing room outside the bar of the court room was all too small to accom modate the rabble. Many of the spectators were colored people, called there by the fact, that two or three culprits of that perauation figured on the docket, with heavy charges hanging to them, la the cat with a stone tied to her neck, which the naughty boy in the Second Reader is throwing into the "drink.

Nothing could be proved against him, but, having just got out of jail, and having made a strike of good luck avoiding going to the peniten. tiary, moneyless, and given to no manifest employment, all the circumstances of the ease were exceedingly suspicious, and Judge 1KW accordingly "sentenced" him to thir ty days hard service in the Work House. " Bill " immediately arose and began whispering and gesticulating violently to his counsel. An oath now and then boned over, in the effervescence of his rage, into the general ear. He was madder than onrod and infuriated bull of Bashan. He protested his innocence, and every several sorrel hair on his skull stood up in resent ment, like quills on the fretful porcupine.

About SI9 per cent, of these heartily endorse the Presi dent's post and commend his proposed fu ture policy. important Case. The case of the United States against Governor Pearce, of Boston, arising from, and involving the history of the great Floyd lraudulent acceptances, win come up mis week in the United States Court of Claims. Gen. Caleb Cushing is counsel in the case. Addresses. of the Holy Trinity, Brooklyn, last evening, addresses were delivered by Bishop Leigh, of Arkansas, and Bishop Potter, relative to the Protestant Episcopal Freedmen's Soci ety, in which its objects were explained and appeals msde in its behalf. The objects are the conversion of the Freedmen in the South. Impressive -services in honor of all who fell in defence of the Republic during the late rebellion, took place last night in the church on the corner of Broadway and Thirty-fourth street, in the presence of a congregation which crowded every portion of the house. There was musical exercises of a superior character, and the sermon, re counting the heroism, sufferings and virtues of tbe fallen, and stating the grand results which will follow the nation from their de votions and sacrifices, was preached by Rev. Dr. Thompson. The Times' Washington special says Gen eral Banks visited the President 8atunlay, and gave him assurance of his co-operation in measures proposed in the message.

General Steedman has ordered troops to that county. Representatives and a commission in be half of the State of Missouri arrived at Washington Saturday evening, with in structions to Dresent to Congress the claims of that State for $400,000, alleged to be due for expenditures on the account of the gov ernment during the War.

CLEVELAND LEADER. THE CLEVELAND LEADER. A Daily, Tri-Weekly and Weekly NEWSPAPER. The Largest Paper in the West Outside of Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati. PROSPECTUS FOR 1866. The new year upon which we are about to enter will usher in an era oi national growth, prosperity and greatness unexam pled in the history of the world. After four years of desperate conflict, tbe prin ciples which the Leadkk, in common with the patriotic citizens and soldiers of the country, has always announced and de fended, have tnumpnea, ana tne war lor the Union and rroedom Has enaea in vic tory and peace, secession ana slavery have both been crushed, ana our nepuDiic, re-united and regenerated, enters upon a new and glorious career. The future is full of the promise of greatness to our nation and of prosperity to its citizens. Ana yet tne crisis oi our unuger m uui passed. 1 he contest has only been trans ferred from the military to the political arena. The weapons are ballots instead of bullets, the pen instead of the iword. The spirit of secession is yet alive. The great work of reconstructing the relations of the Southern States to the Union, so that the nation may be made secure, its faith and honor kept inviolate, and equal rights to all its citizens guaranteed, is yet to be performed a work which for its immense importance and eicantic diffi culties is only paralleled by that which we have just concluded. In this most cri tical and important period in the midst of these great evenU no man, rich or poor, can afford to be without a news paper. It is an article of prime necessity in every household. "Without it a man is half a century behind the age. The Cleveland Lxader enters upon the twenty-second year of its existence with thetbrightest of prospects, and with a more widely-extended and well-deserved popu larity than at any previous period in its history.
