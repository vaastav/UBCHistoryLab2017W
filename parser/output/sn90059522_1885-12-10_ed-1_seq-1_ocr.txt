VOL. VII. THE RYAN RECEPTION. ; St. Paul's Peerles Hostelry Formally Opened Last Night With a Grand Ee ception and Ball, Upwards of Eight Hundred People As semble in tae Spacious Parlors and Eeception Eooms. A Dazzling Display of Elegant Cos tumes—A Magnificent Floral Design. A Fascinating Ball-Room Scene— A Sea of Whirling Figures and a "World of Music The Opening 1 Ball. The God that rules the elements looked down with favor upon St. Paul citizens last night and allowed them to participate : in the formal opening of the Hotel .Ryan. | the peerless hostelry of the Northwest, un- j der the most propitious circumstances. The : sky was buried in clouds that considerately j kept their burden to themselves and ter- j pered the atmosphere to a degree of mildness that rendered wraps of extra heavy weight extremely burdensome and uncomfortable. More than 1.800 invitations had been issued and at least 1,000 had been accepted, which portended an affair that for brilliancy and Elaborateness has not been excelled and hardly equalled since the city's incorpora tion. As early as 8 o'clock the guests began to irrive. and there was an almost continual irriving and departing of handsome turn juts for an hour and a half. From without tiie hotel looked like a vast palace or i light so magnificently was it illumi nated. Alighting from the carriage, one was ushered through the entrance by polite policemen in their be>.t dress, wiiere he or she fell into the hands of gracious servants. who directed each across the rotunda to the marble stairway which led to the cloak and coat rooms. A corps of assistants aided the ladies in undoing their wraps and the gentlemen were divested of TIII-.IU lIKAVV COATS, overshoes and hats in the twinkling of an eye and a check for the entire outfit shoved into their pockets almost before they knew it by attendants in polished livery and kid gloves. The attendants worked with a harmony and unison that gave tiie impression that they had been rehearsing for the ocoasion, tire lessly, and tiieir promptness greatly accele rated the carrying out of the program. Long before the hour of 9. the Ions: and airy halls were tilled with people and the various drawing rooms and parlors looking out on the main corridor, presented a charming panorama of constantly moving and shift ing colors. In the reception room, at the head of the main stairway. Mr. anil -Mrs. J. 11. Brugh received their guests, assisted by Mayor ltiee and daughter and Stanley Prondfit and Mrs. Ah in Patten of Cincinnati. Mrs. Burgh wore a superb costume of bro caded velvet?with knots of flowers in natural tints upon a white ground: train and front draperies of scarlet satin; front panels ornamented with bunches of plumes in scarlet, white and black; plumes in coiffure, scarlet gloves, diamonds and flowers. Mrs. Patten wore a trained costume of salmon pink with trimmings of deep red, and pink and red plumes in high coiffure. Miss Rice appeared in a handsome short dve-;s nt whiio crape combined with watered >ilk and trimmed with white lace. The gentlemen wore the conventional dress suit. It was nearly 10 o'clock when the ai me reception room. Without in the corridor, was stationed Sciberfs orchestra which tilled the upper air with a melody that floated seductively through the broad balls and spacious rooms. The musical proeram during the reception consisted of tc» following selections: Overture. 4-Festi val." Bach; selection, "Journey Through Africa," Snppe; grand march, "Tann ." V7agner. In the blue drawing-room stood a mag nificent floral cornucopia on a center table, ;of Mrs. P. R. L. Hardenbergh. It %vas an object of unbounded admiration, and the fragrance that it breathed tilled the room. It was a great mass of calla lilies, imbedded in heliotrope, smilax, anemones, myrtle, pansies, violets and tuberoses, the contrasting colors blending harmoniously, and giving a striking effect. This was the only departure in floral decoration notice able, nearly all the dependence for effect being placed upon the rich and elegant cos tumes of the ladies. 1>- THE BALL KOOM. A half hour before the last guest had been received the ball was on. ancT the great dining hall, with its pillars and posts, its over-arching and gaudily decorated ceiling, was tilled with whirling and pirouetting Hgures, GLIPIXO GRACEFULLY through the bewitching mazes of a waltz. It was a scene entrancing. From the bal cony over the entrance to the hall, in look sng down upon the undulating sea of forms below, one could Well believe that he was dreamine. First a form lithe and graceful, robed in immaculate costume, would whirl across the vision, followed by a flash of red. then a stately figure in heavy, clinging robes of black and then blue, and pink, and move on until the scene melted into a kaleido scopic extravaganza^ . Seibert's orchestra, on a raised ' platform at the extreme end of the hall, discoursed the music and their time was well occupied in running off the lengthy pro gram of fifteen numbers, for there was al ways a crowd of dancers waiting at the doors for an opportunity to get to the floor *-. ->. and swing into a waltz, mazourka or galop. Fifteen numbers were danced. The following floor manager!? watched carefully after the interests of the dancers: Charles "W. Mclntyre. Stanley Proudrit, C. F. Sibley. A. W. Hardenbergh. P. W. Hunter, W. W. Price, Whitney Wall and Sherman Finch. THE BEFBESHHKKT TABLES. Refreshments were served in the ladies' ordinary in an informal manner. The doors wen; thrown open at 10 o'clock, and those who desired to test the cuisine of the hotel found an elegant spread of salads, cold meats, cakes and warm drinks. The tables were arranged along three sides of the room and the wants of the guests were attended to by a corps of wai.ers. Now and then a couple of old citizens would be noticed in a corner regaling themselves on cold turkey aud drinking to EACH OTHER'S lIEALTH. and congratulating themselves on being residents of a city that can boast of such a magnificent hostelry as the Ryan. The ladies seemea to enjoy the perpen dicular lunch as heartily as the gen tlemen, and heroically ran the risk of discoloring their costumes with the hot tea or coffee that steamed in the tiny cups in their hands. It was appar ently a more enjoyable and social way of eating than sitting at a table ham pered with the conventionalities of a formal banquet. At 12 o'clock the doors of the re freshment room swung together and those who had not taken an early advantage were barred out. From that until the early morning hours the ball room held the at tention of the party. These Were There.

There was a very small meeting of the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders at the Everett house this evening. It opened with a bare quorum, which dwindled in less an hour to a dozen mem bers. After much discussion the following resolution was adopted: That no horse, mare or gelding shall acquire a record for the purpose of registration or a contest against time, unless such horse, mare or gelding shall already acquired a record of 2:3u or better against other horses in a public race. The time of the committee on scale of points was extended. The sentiment of the meeting was against the adoption of a scale of points. J. W. Gray tendered his resi#- nation as treasurer, but it was not accepted. The members of the executive committee whose terms of office expired were Charles iJockman, B. F. Tracy. Leland Stanford, L. D.

Business of Base Ball Associations. Philadelphia, Dec. 9. — At the meet ing of the American Association of Base Ball clubs yesterday, after the franchise of the Metropolitan club of New York had been revoked and the National club of Washington admitted to membership, a resolution was adopted by which a player aeleased from an American association club will be obliged to play with any association club desiring his ssrvLtx- withir ten days from the time of his release. Mr. Wyrnan. who had lately acquired the ownership of the Metropolitan club, said: "I do not propose to tamely submit to treatment so unbusiness like. Staten Island shall have a base ball club, and 1 already have had offers to form a new and stronger associa tion than the one just now guilty of the sharp game reflecting very little credit on base ball ethics." President McKnight then said the American association was forced to revoke the franchise of the Met ropolitan, because that club had been re moved from New York city to Staten Island and and its management and officers are controlled by the officers of the New York League club. When any dispute arose between the two organizations the Metropolitan representative acted in accord ance with instructions from the League club, and in addition reports all contem plated action to the League club officers. It is understood among base ball managers that the players of the Metropolitan club will bo placed at the disposal of the Balti more and Washington clubs. Manger Byrne of the Brooklyn club, however, in sists upon having Orr, the Metropolitan first baseman, transferred to Brooklyn. Mr. Wymann will institute proceeding against each member for §50,000 for direct losses sustained. THE 

ARBITRATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT. The arbitration committee of the League and American associations met last evening. The report on qualified admission of minor leagues and associations was adopted. It provides for the protection of all players en gaged by these clubs who are signed after Nov. 1. This will give the League and American associations from Oct. 20 to Nov. 1 to engage players from the clubs or minor leagues. The black list of these minor leagues will be observed. The admission will be S5O each for each league or associa tion. The following have already applied for protection uuder the national agree ment: The Southern, the Eastern, New England and Canadian leagues. Federation of Labor. Washington, Dec. 9. — The Federation of Labor Unions of the United States and Canana at its session to-day considered the resolution giving the legislative committee of the federation authority to manage all strikes and lockouts in co-operation with the local organization, to levy assessments upon the different organizations not in ex cess of 2 cents a week per member, and limiting the benefit to be paid members of strikes to S3 per week. It was finally de cided to extend the time for voting on this measure to March 1 next, in order to allow all organizations an opportunity to express their sentiments in regard to it. The reso lution providing that the eight-hour resolu tion to go into effect May 1 next was brought up. but its consideration was post poned until to-morrow. A resolution was offered denouncing the use of boycott for every "frivolous, trivial or imaginary grievance." It was referred to a committee which met to-night and de cided to report it favorably. A resolution was also offered urging on congress the consideration of an international law fixing the hours of working people. It was re ferred to a committee. Enconrag ins for Loggers. Special to the Globe. Eau Claire, Wis., Dec. The trains running from this city to Ashland and other Northern points are literally crowded with woodsmen, and the rush of the various log ging districts tor the past few days is un precedented. A good snow fell yesterday on the hard frozen roads and swamps, which will allow pinery work to proceed without any interruption. There is ample snow for all practical purposes, and it fortunately fell unaccompanied by wind, thus preventing distasteful drifts. Large squads of men continue to arrive from other states, and it is now believed there are more men by hundreds than can be used. The outlook, from now forward, to loggers is most encouraging, and there will be no hindrance in getting in the amount of cut intended. William Gunnison & Son, cotton manufac turers at Troy, N. V-, made an assignment. Preferences were given for over $60,000. The assets are not given. ST. PAUL'S PIVOT PIER. The Minnesota Congressional Delegation Discuss the President's Remarks on Our Bridges. Miss Cleveland Accused of Being the Au thor of Grover's Eemarks on Mormonism. Mr. McMillan Introduces a Bill for the Belief of Minnesota Swamp Land Settlers. Morrison, Springer and Others En liven the House Proceedings With a Discussion. Minnesota measures. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 9. — Minnesota members informally discussed this morning the allusion in the president's message to the pier of the railroad bridge at St. Paul. Mr. Gilfillan says the matter can be easily adjusted. The city bridge was constructed under the federal law. but the railroad bridge under the old territorial act. The whole complaint of the pivot pier being an obstruction in the channel comes from the engineer of the war depart ment, who says he has no authority to interfere. Senator McMillan introduced a bill giving the state of Minnesota the right to select other lands, except mineral, in case smueis nave seuuieu iiouicsicau vi pre-emption rights upon swamp lands once deeded to the state by the government; also a bill to grant William P. Faenger SSB3 for property destroyed by the burning of the government building at Fort Ridgeley Jan. 19, 1885. Senator Sabin introduced a bill to refund to Edward A. Grant, postmaster at Fargo, $6,950 for clerk hire paid during several years. 

ROSE WROTE IT. A Fart of the President's Message Attributed to miss Cleveland. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. — Literary experts, who have carefully examined the presi dent's message, have identified the author ship of a portion of that long and interest ing document. The introductory para graphs were from the president's own hand, as were the arguments in favor of a sus pension of silver coinage and civil service reform. About one-half of the message, all that relating to foreign affairs, is by Secretary Bayard, but the most interesting discovery made by the literary experts is the fact that Miss Elizabeth Rose Cleveland, the accomplished lady of the White house, is the author of much of the paragraph against polygamy. The following extract, when compared with the peculiar literary style that characterized Miss Cleveland's book, leaves no doubt of her authorship of that portion of her brother's message, to wit: The strength and perpetuity and the des tiny of the nation rest upon our homes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care, regulated by parental author ity and sanctioned by parental love. These are cot the 

HOMES OP POLYGAMY. The mothers of our land, who rule the nation as they mold the characters aud guide the actions of their sons, live according to God's holy ordinance, aud each, pure and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood unperverted and unpolluted upon all within her pure and wholesome family circle. These are not the cheerless, crushed and unwomanly mothers of polyg amy. The fathers of our families are the best citizens of the republic. Wife and children are the sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental af fection beget devotion to our country. The man who, undefiled by plural marriage, is surrounded in his single home by his wife and children has a stake in his country which inspires him with respect for its laws and courage for their defense. These are not the fathers of polygamous families. There is no feature of this practice or system wfiich sanc tions it which is not opposed to everything of value in our institutions. The general comment here upon this lit tle essay on the beneficence of marriage and the family is that, coming from an old bachelor and an old maid, it is very good. WORK OF THE SENATE.

CHAIVGIA'G THE BILES. Duties of the Appropriations Com* niittee Discussed in the House. Washington, Dec. 9.— After the read ing aud approval of the journal the speaker asked and received permission of the houso to appoint the committees on rules, ac counts and enrolled bills. Mr. Morrison of Illinois offered a resolution for reference to the committee on rules when appointed continuing in force the rules of the Forty eighth congress with certain modifications, among them being one for the distribution of the work of the appropriations commit tee among the other standing committees of the house. This committee is still left with jurisdiction over the pensions and fortifica tions. District of Columbia, legislative and sundry civil bills. The well-known rule 21 is proposed to be amended by striking out the clause which provides that no provision in any such bill (general appropriation) or amendment thereto changing existing laws be in order except as being germane to the subject matter of the bill or shall retrench expenditures by the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States, by the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the United States or by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill. The reference of the resolution was ordered. Mr. Springer of Illinois then presented for im mediate action the code of rules prepared by him. which has already been published. Mr. Herbert ot Alabama raised a point of order against the proposition, but withdrew it for the present to enable Mr. Springer to explain his proposed code. Mr. Hammond of Georgia offered a resolution calling at tention to the absolute necessity of having some 

RULE OF PROCEDURE while the subject of amending the rules was under consideration. A general dis cussion then followed, participated in by Messrs. Herbert, Hiscock, Springer, Reed, Regan, Randall and Burrows, after which Mr. Hammond amended his resolution by providing that the house shall be governed by Jefferson's manual, as modified by the parliamentary practice of me nouse oi reresentatives, ana as thus amended it was adopted. During the discussion Mr. Springer took the noorjforabrief explanation of objects sought to be obtained in his revision of the rules. The first of these objects, according to Mr. Springer, was a practical distribution of the labors of the committee on appropriations, and he argued in support of the view that such a distribution would result in a more thorough consideration of and a more speedy action upon the great money bills which were brought before congress. He repelled the assertion that the distribution would result in extravagance in public ex penditured, and regarded as a reflection upon the representatives of the people the idea that there was a favored few and hon ored few in their midst who could alone be trusted. He also proposed the abolition of a number of useless committees and pointed out the advantages that would result from this concentration of committee membership by enabling committees to secure a quorum for the tran saction of business, which had heretofore been difficult, owing to the fact that every representative was a member of two or more committees. Another object sought to be obtained by his revised code was to facilitate the transaction of business by permitting the passage of bills during the morning hours. Another proposition, which he thought would commend itself to the members, was that of abolishing the in corporation of general legislation into gen eral bills. On motion of Mr. Springer, the proposed rules were referred to the commit tee on rules. The speaker appointed a committee on rules as follows: The speaker, Messrs. Randall, Morrison, Reed and Hiscock. In order to give the commit tee time to consider the various propositions referred it, on motion of Mr. Morrison, the house adjourned till Saturday. It usisi j:s the Railroads. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 9. — Senator Van Wyck has introduced a bill compelling rail- roau L'umpiimt's 10 wiucu xanu nas ueen granted, to cause the survey of the same and accept title as soon as the land is earned by construction of the road, and in cases where lands are now earned to pay for the survey and accept patents within sixty days from the passage of the act. This bill is aimed at the Pacific and other railroad companies, the terms of whose grants required that they pay for the survey of their lands. These companies have taken advantage of this fact and have omitted to cause a survey, leaving the land still unpatented to them, and by this means have avoided payment of taxes to the amount, the senator says, of millions of dollars. He proposed by this bill to compel them to accept title to their lands where earned or pay taxes on the same or forfeit them. Logan's Committee.

Special to the Globe. Toledo, 0., Dec. 9. — The developments of the Wilson burglary case to-day were interesting as teaching a lesson to the average female with a tendency to flirt. Miss Louisa Matthias was the pretty wit ness who told the story of an escapade which now forms one of the links in the identity of Burglar Wilson. The testimony is that Miss Matthias, with two friends, Miss Flora Wilders of Perrysburg and Miss Lou Small of Walnut hill, Cincin nati, were on the steamer Waite, going to and returning from Detroit, on the 13th of August, the day before the burglary. They flirted with Wilson, who claimed to be a drummer, Scott by name, and so agreeable was he that all hands had their pictures taken in Detroit. These pictures were found on Wilson when he was arrested in New York, and the young ladies are gain ing no small amount of unpleasant noto riety in consequence. The Duke of Portland is said to be the greatest matrimonial catch in England. His income is $750,000 per annum. NO. 3 4 4 A PILLAR OF FINANCE.

Several engineers have already placed crape on their engines. All the officers of the company will attend the funeral, and tickets for ad mission to the church will be issued. Cor oner Messemer this morning took the fol lowing statement from President Robert Garrett of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad on Mr. Vanderbilt's death: I reached Mr. Vanderbilt's house yesterday about a quarter past 1 o'clock. He received me in his library, and we conversed together about an hour, perhaps a little longer, when jnr. v auuerum s speeca Decame muistinot, aniljthe.next instant I noticed a twitching of the muscles of the mouth and face, and almost at the same instant his face was suddenly convulsed. He was sitting ou the edge of the chair. He fell forward and I reached him in time to thrust my arm under his shonlder and prevented his falling heavily to the floor. I placed a cushion which was at hand under bis head, and immediately summoned a servant and called for water, with which I bathed his face until the arrival of his son, Mr. George Van derbilt, and Dr. Miller. We did not realize fact of his death until the arrival of Dr. McLean. Dr. John F. Miller, who was" called in by a servant on Tuesday afternoon, this even ing made a statement before the coroner. He examined the body, found it warm, the face purple, the tongue purple, respiration almost absent, and pulse almost extinct. He concluded the case was one of apoplexy. The Coroner's Theory. Special to the Globe. New York, Dec. 9. — In reference to making an autopsy on the body of Mr. Vanderbilt, Coroner Messemer said this afternoon : I have not yet decided to make an autopsy. I have heard some gossip which implied that Mr. Vanderbilt may have been poisoned while eating his lunch, but this canse I very much doubt. 1 shall consult Drs. Fordyce, Barker and Miller and get their diagnosis of the case, after which I will look into the testi mony of Mr. Garrett and examine it atten tively. I shall not make an autopsy to-night, if I should decide to make it, but if I do so at all, I will make it to-morrow morning. Dr. Messemer inclines to the theory that Messrs. Garrett and Vanderbilt were discuss ing the proposed extension of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad to Staten Island, and, the discussion waxing hot, the consequent ex citement caused Mr. Vanderbilt's death. The Vanderbilt family are satisfied that Mr. Vanderbilt's death was caused by apoplexy, and they are horrified at the idea of an autopsy. In consequence of Mr. Vander bilt's death the proposed dinner to Robert Garrett by Erastus Wiman and others, which was to Like place to-morrow even ing, has been postponed to Wednesday of next week. AVostom liiion Resolutions.' New York, Dec. 9. — A special meeting of the board of directors of the Western Union Telegraph company was held this afternoon and the following tribute, which, by resolution, was spread on the minutes, was offered: When a member of the board, it was Mr. Vanderbilt's constant endeavor to build up and strengthen the company and to placo it in an independent position, with ability to defend itself against all its rivals. We are indebted to him for wise counsel and able service. In the great domain of railway transportation in which Mr. Vanderbilt had long held the most conspicuous position, hi^ conduct had been guided by wisdom and sagacity of a high order, and he had won the confidence and esteem of all of a vast con stituency in the various corporations with which he had been associated. As a citizen he was known to us as a man of great publio SDirit. with a kind heart and generous im- pulses, which keeps his memory dear to tho community a3 a publio and private bene factor. English Opinions. London, Dec. 9.— The Daily New 3 praises Mr. Yanderbilt for his high-minded and delegate generosity toward Gen. Grant. The Standard takes a different view from other leading London joxrnals in the esti mate ot Mr. Vanderbilt's career and does not give him credit for acts of liberality. The Times says: Mr. Vanderbilt sacri ficed his health and even his life to main tain his proud position. His career de serves careful siudy. His pursuits were hardly ideal ones and their termination war almost disastrous. Against tlae Buzzard Dollar.
