COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS Reported From the Country's Business Centers TRADE IS GENERALLY QUIET Somewhat Increased Demand by Whole sale Dealers Legislative Influences Have Produced Little or No Effect Upon Business-Corn Is Low and Stow Associated rresi "oeclal wire. NKW YORK, Dec. O.—Bradstrect's financial raviow tomorrow will say: Congress has met and the president's message has hson published. The docu Snent agreed with previous anticipations, but no legislative action is probable till alter the liril of Juur.ary; tbe disro altion In speculative oircles is to wait. Very little indeed was done in other por tions of Ihe „took list, loading interests aeeming inclined to wait until there is some delinite knowledge In regard to the attltodo of oongress toward tho currency complications. Europe was also very in active, though it would seem that tlie Idea of tbe failure of congress to act on tho currency and the possilblltv of a re vived agitation of ibe tariff question in this country has hail an unfavorable affect on tlie standing of American secur ities abroad. The exchange marie! was very dull all week and could scarcely he counted as a factor in speculation,though the shipment of $3,100,000 gold to Kuropo had a slightly unfavoralbe influence at the close of the week. Iron and its products are lower. Plates at 1.6 and bar 1.8 cents and Bessemer pig $12 at valley mills, with billets $1(1.50 The average of all quotations is S'S per eeni below the highest point in Septem bcr, but actual sales are frequently made below quotations. Rails have not changed, while Besse mer pig has declined So and biilels $ti per ion, and a purchase of $10,00(1 for ban Franoisco from F.nlgand is noticed, witb a considerable portion of wire nails at Boston. Copper is weaker, witb 11 cents for lake with narrow damani, ami tin is a quar r weaker with the visible supply here and abroad 29,981 tons aganst 22,440 tons a year ago. Anthracite coal is weaker at d sold at £{.80 here against 14.16 nccording to cir cular. Failures in the United Slates for the week have been 824, against 886 last year, and 62 in < anaja, against 40 last year, t General trade continues as the pieced ing wees, small in vnlnme, quiet in tone, business being conducted conservatively; active in woolens, clothing, shoes and hardware und new orders generally of a lilling-in character. The season has been a late one, mild weather having delavcd orders until the Christmas demand and tbe belated au tumn request enmo together Notwiln stan Ing almost uniform reports ot quiet una good conditions, it should be iotcd tbat Jacksonville, Augusta and Birming ham nt the souib; Milwaukee, Kansas City nnd St. Louis at tho west, prove ex ceptions to tbe rule by reporting gains in demand for wholesale staple goods compared with tbe preceding week. Exports of wheat, Hour included as wheat, from Doth coasts of the United States this week amount lo 3,166,00(1 bushels, as compared with 21.00,n0'J last week und 8,011,000 in the week a year age. The total business failures in tbe United States, as reported to Bradstreets, number 315, as against 288 last week, 322 in the lir.t week of December last year, :iS3 tn ISU3, and 2(15 In 1392, Dun & Co.'s Report NEW 

YORK, Deo. 6.— R. G. Dun & t.'o.s weekly review of trade, which issues tomorrow, will say: Business is still sluggish, as if gorged by excessive indulgence of appetite for buying when prices were advancing. In neany every branch stocks not yet dis tributed to customers stand in the way of new orders, and competition of produc ing forces, largely exceeding tbe present demand, puts down prices, that decline retarding purcb <ses yet more. After tbe holidays many look for n larger demand. For the present the springs of new busi ness are running low, but enough is do ing on old orders to keep most of tbe works employed in part and a good pro portion fully. Finanaiul influences have not hindered and rarely has tbe opening of a session of congress affected business bo little. Wheat has advunced about a cent for the week, tlioua i western retoipts havo been 7,(114,911 bCShels, uguins: 3,727,78* last year, and Atlantic exports (Hour in cluded) against 1,887,737 last year. Tlie best western estimates ol the crop have been raised again. Corn moves from farms less freely than a year ago, the low prices hindering. Wool has been slightly strengthened by tbe London sales, but tbe average quota tions by Coates Bros, is only a ten .h of 1 per cent higher. Sales continne large, (1,4(13,100 pounds tor the wcea, of which 00 per cent was foreign.

Tbe list named figured lirst in point of activity. Tho principal element in the speotiloton was the covering of shorts, interest at the opening centered entirely upon Chicago gas, oeing stimu lated oy the nuexpectctl sodden and favorable deoision of Judge Snowaltcr. The buoyancy ot Chicago gas had a strengthening influence on tho general list despito the -oported engagements of gold for shipment tjmorrow, aggregating $2,000,000. Ol this amount ull but $200. 000 comes out of tee treasury reserve. Liberal gains wero made iv the other In dustrials. Soon after the initial dealings recessions occurred, also due to the tak ing of profits. Before midday the hulls again assume I control of the market and accordingly sugar was maraod up BJj per cent to $1.07),; und tobacco. 2Jj per cent, to 79.'.,'. In the early dealings the bond market exibited a drooping tendency. In the late session, however, there was a gen eral stiffening in prices, which imparted a ;!rm tone to the closing.

CHICAGO MARKET The Day's Transactions on the Chicago Board of Trade CHICAGO, Dec. 0. —Business in the wheat pit was dull during tho greater part of the forenoon but active in tbe afternoon, with prices moving up in a lively way. Compared with yesteiday's linaljquotations, December is X% cents higher and May % cents higher. Thi spread bstween 'be two montns is thus seen to have narrowed % cents. The Armour elevator people, who were dis satisfied with t;o cents carrying charges between December and May, were the best buyors of December In tho pit today, and their action prevented tho execution of a good deal ol shipping business in spring wheat. There was no enticement in tbe early news for either bulls or bears in the wheat market. It was all about the com plexion of what tbe traders call a "stand off," ana that is about what tbey dio wlb regard to the market during the most ot tha forenoon. The opening wns rather strong and a little higher than yesterday's closing price, but tbe bulls soon lest tbat advantage and t.b.i bears gut even wben tbe price dipped to as much under tbe previous days' final quotations v! it hud gone above them during tbe opening rattle of tbe trading. The action in May wheat up tn the last hour was: Opened U\\c, sold off lo rallied to 01c and held linn and bid at that price. December dropped to 5%c and firmed to 57W0 bid. Wheat had a further advance in tiie last half hour. The buying was the best in many weeks. Elevator people were called buyers of December on a large scale. It was claimed Armour was retting back his own receipts by bidding within :i%o of May lor them. This sort of business may lei\o prevented cash sales foi shipment. On the late broad market December wheat went to 58;»c, May to BPJ.o, clos ing at the top. Corn was in good demand for January. May appeared to follow the course of wheat over aoottt a 3-Pic range. The trade as a wholo was narrow and chiefly local. Better activity marked the provision trade. Brokers reported reme.kably good buying of pork for May around $11. To is was the low and closing price, wito n little bulge to $9.05 at one time. Lard closed 2]40 off and ribs closed uncnanged. Leading futures ranged as follows: Wheat No a— December.
