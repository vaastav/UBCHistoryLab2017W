Plendei a U the well-known grocer, nt 621 N.Saginaw Btreet, and thnt the statement he makes her is true in every particular, goes without saying. This is what he says: M For as Jong as four years 1 suffered fro" pains across my hack over the kidneys, was that old backache, sometimes better and sometimes worse. Anyone who has experi enced such 11 pain will understand how dis tressing it is. 1 was continually annoyed l.v its presence. 1 knew the kidneys were at fault, as there were other signs of kidney disorder. That pain across the kidneys had become very constant. If I accidentally jarred mytelf, I would feel it much worse for a time. One day I happened to read about a remedy for the kidneys called Doan's Kid ney Pills. I determined to try them, so 1 went to Dullam Bros.' drug store and pro cured a box. I had taken only a few doses when I felt relief tromtlie pain, I continued to use them, taking altogether three boxes, ami they have cured me. The backache is entirely removed and I have felt its good since as I ever did in mv life. Doan Kid ney Pills are truly a kidney cure. As long as I have a chance T shall recommend and peak a good word for them, advising others to use them." Kvervwheie von go 'tis just the same as this. No article or medicine has ever caused such a stir in the world from it extraordi nary properties as has Doan's Kidnev Pills People call them "The little conquerors ol kidney trouble," " The littlespecialist," "The little enemies to backache," and many other such names, and thev have good reason to. Doan's Kidnev Pills are for sa'e bv all dealers prio 50 cents per box. Mailed by Foster-Milbn rn Co . Buffalo. N. Y., sole agents fortbe United States. Remember the name, Doan's, and take no other.

POST In Order to See the Statesmen Started at Tl eir Work. Plenty ofBunlneim Ready To Be Attended To Meksttge Duly Read In Both Iluuitn-home Prominent Ques tions That Confront the Congressmen. Washington, Dec. 6. The regular, or long session of congress, as it is called, because there is no constitutional limi tation upon the period of its duration, opened at noon today. The leaders and a large majority of the members of both houses were here to participate in the opening ceremonies, and President Mc Kinley made the journey to Washing ton from the bedside of his dying moth er that his absence might not delay the national legislature at its assembling. The house was called to order by the speaker, and prayer having been said and the roll called and the presence of a quorum demonstrated, the clerk was directed to notify the senate that the house was ready for business, and a committee was appointed to wait on the president. After that there was a re cess to await the arrival of the presi dent's annual message, which was read upon its reception. It is the in tention of the house leaders to proceed with the business of the session as rap idly as possible. The committees will all begin their labors this week, and as all of them have more or less bills on hand which were Introduced at the extra ses a slon there will be no lack of material for the house to work on after the com mittee hoppers have begun to grind. Some beus.ttions In PronpeoU The appropriations committee has been at work for ten days and Chair man Cannon expects to pass at least two of the regular budgets before the holidays the legislative, executive and judicial and the pensions appropriation bills. Among the early general meas ures to receive consideration will be the bankruptcy bill. Beyond doubt there will be several resolutions of inquiry during the week which may be more or leas- sensational, and some of the radical pro-Cuba members will attempt to get consideration for a Cuban resolution be fore the foreign affairs committee can act. Representative Livingston, of Georgia, is one of these. But owing tc the nature of the house rules all these hasty efforts will prove abortive, and the resolutions will probably take their regular course. Three Hundred Bills In the Senate. There was nothing except indisposi tion on the part of members to prevent the senate entering promptly upon Its work upon convening today, as there was a calendar already made for it with about 300 bills reported from com mittees during the special session. But H is not customary for the senate to be In a hurry about most things. The reg ular routine of opening was duly ob served; the committee to notify the president that the senate was ready for business was appointed, performed its duty and reported. The president's message was received and read, and what may happen before adjournment is reached had not developed at this writing. The indications are now for a little more activity than usual during the pre-holtday session. This is largely due to the fact that the supporters of the administration and advocates of an nexation are very anxious to secure the earliest possible consideration of the treaty with Hawaii. Long Mesaion of CongreNM Begins. Washington, Dec. 7. Nothing sensa tional occurred at the opening of the Fifty-fifth congress Monday. In both house and senate the galleries were filled with a curious crowd, and both houses were full on the floor. The sen ate was made gay with floral tributes sent to the desks of senators by their friends. The body was duly called to order, a committee appointed to Inform the president that such was the fact and in due time the message arrived and was read and was listened to with attention. After the reading the senate adjourned. In the house Dingley, Bailey and Grosvenor were selected as the commit tee to call on the president and notify htm that the house was In seslson. Then the message was read, receiving a round of applause at the close. Then In honor of the memory of Senator George, of Mississippi, and Representative Wright, of Massachusetts, deceased during the recess, the house adjourned. There were a number of bills intro duced, among them one to establish the postal savings bank system. Washington, Dec. I In the senate yesterday 108 bills, many of them for private pensions, were introduced with several joint resolutions. Money, the new senator from Mississippi, was sworn In. A discussion as to right of way for Lodge's immigration bill was pending at adjournment. The house, after a spirited debate, divided the president's message among the umrriHtees. Grosvenor made an at tack on the civil service reform law, which was warmly defended by John son of Indiana, who charged Grosve nor with being derelict In his duty to the Republican party, which he said had repeatedly Indorsed the law. Ity Elections In M assachusetts. Boston, Dec. 8. Seventeen of the thirty-two cities of the commonwealth hoi their municipal elections yester day. In a majority of cases the Repub licans were successful in electing their mayor anil securing control of the city government, although the results show that the idea of independent or non partisan COEtfOl of municipalities is st"iidily STo.vlng In favor. 

MESSAGE OF THE" PRESIDENT. Salient Points of the Document That Was Read to Ooagpnas Monday. Washington. Dc. 7. President Me Kinley's message to congress begins with the currency question, and his recommendations in that respect, out side of an approval of Secretary Gage's banking plan, is contained in the fol lowing: "I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the ex penses of the government, that when any United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are re deemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold." In regard to Cuba he takes sub stantially the same position as that assumed by President Grant during the previous revolution. His conclusion of the whole matter la that, as Spain has now evidently begun a policy of real reform for the island, which proposes reasonable terms of settlement of the long-existing trouble, the government of the United States should not inter fere, until It is evident that this policy is not accomplishing the results de sired. The president strongly recommends the ratification, by the senate, of the treaty providing for the annexation of the Hawaiian islands. In considering other governmental affairs, the presi dent extols the work of the bimetallic commission; recommends Immediate legislation for the improvement of the conditions in Alaska; advocates the establishment of a special commission to investigate the causes of. and remedies for. yellow fever; discusses the sale of the Pacific railroads, and favors the maintenance and possible extension of civil service reform. He urges con gress to observe the strictest economy in appropriations. 

CRISIS REACHES HAYTI. It Is Brought There by a Conple of Ger man War hi pa. Port au Prince, Haytl, Dec. 7. The trouble between Germany and Haytl, the result of the arrest and imprison ment of Herr Lueders, an alleged Ger man subject, reached a crisis yester day. Two German cruisers entered this port during the morning, and an ulti matum from the German government was delivered to the Haytlen govern ment, giving the latter eight hours In which to grant the demands of Ger many for an indemnity to Herr Lued ers. The members of the diplomatic corps here believe the government of the republic has decided to accept the conditions of Germany. In anticipation of trouble the citizens of German na tionality sought refuge Sunday on board two steamers which were at this port, and the French steamer Ville de Marseille has been requisitioned by the French minister in order to serve as a place of refuge for French citizens. The Tille de Marseille has arrived here di rect from Porto Rico. The population f this place is in a state of great ex citement, but the Haytlen government has strong forces of troops at its dis posal and is resolved to maintain order. RECOGNIZED BY HIS MOTHER. President McKlnley's Dearest Wish Has Been Granted at Canton. Canton, O., Dec. 8. The president and Mrs. McKinley arrived yesterday morn ing. The fondest hopes the family has cherished since the affliction came was that the president might be permitted to be present when the Inevitable disso lution came and that the mother might again realize his presence and he know that he had been recognized. These hopes have been granted them and they now patiently and resignedly await the end. The scene in the sick room when the president arrived was touching and pa thetic. He gazed upon the dearly-beloved face, showing only an emotion of Joy when the mother's eyes opened and her face lighted up with a smile of rec ognition and of greeting. Then as he stooped to kiss and caress her he felt the tender entwining of her arm about his neck. The president remains al most constantly at the bedside. Haytlan Incident Closed. New York, Dec. 8. Advices from Port au Prince, Haytl, say that President Simon Sam has agreed to all the Ger man demands and saluted the German flag, the salute being returned by the two German school ships now In the harbor and which was all the naval force Germany sent here. What this "climb down" may mean for President Sam is in the future. It may mean a revolution, for the people are anything but pleased with the humiliation of the German affair, which, however, may be considered closed. Knd of the Railway Hearing. ' Washington, Dec. 4. -The hearings of railroad men before the interstate com merce commission In the matter of ex tending the time for the equipment of railway cars with safety appliances have come to an end. but there will yet be some testimony given under oath. It Is hardly probable that the commis sion will extend the time more than three years, and It may only extend it a year at a time, requiring each railway to do a proportionate amount of equip ment each year on pain of having the penalty applied.

GAGE SEES DEFICIT8. One for the Y.-ar f ifcMH.KOO.OOO und Over $31,000,000 for Next. Washington, Dec. 8. A notable thing about the report of Secretary Gage, of the treasury, Is that he figures out a deficit not only for the current year, but also for the next year. He esti mates the deficit for the current fiscal year at $28,000,000 and for next year at 121,647,885. With reference to the tariff he says: "It is confidently believed that when in full operation it will afford ample revenue for the ordinary needs of the government, while adequately protecting our manufacturing and agricultural interests. But the im portant part of Secretary Gage's report relates to the something necessary to be done to put the currency on a dlf fereut basis. Upon this point he recommends the establishment of a division in the treas ury department to be designated the issue and redemption division. To this should be turned over all matters re lating to the Issue and redemption of currency; it should be furnished with $120,000,000 in gold set over from the general fund of the treasury, with all the silver dollars now held for re demption of silver certificates and with $200,000,000 in legal tender notes of the United States to be disbursed only in exchange for gold. This is the plan referred to in the president's message. As to the currency he recommends that the organization of national banks be permitted with a minimum capital f $25,000 in places of 2,000 inhabitants, that the rate of taxation on circulation be reduced to half of 1 per cent, and that the banks be permitted to issue notes to the par value of 2 per cent, refunding bonds (the issue of which he advises) when deposited with the treas urer of the United States, or green backs, treasury notes or silver certifi cates similarly deposited to a total amount of $200,000,000. And here the secretary makes the fol lowing recommendation: "After said banks have deposited such bonds, greenbacks, treasury notes or silver certificates to the amount of 50 per cent, of their capital they shall be per mitted to issue bank notes in addition to the 50 per cent, thus provided to the extent of 25 per cent, of such deposit, which said 25 per cent, may be unse cured by any direct pledge of security, but issued against the assets of the bank." Gage would extend the gov ernment guaranty to all national bank notes, whether issued against deposited security or against assets. To secure the government against loss he would impose a tax of 2 per cent, per annum on the unsecured cir culation for a "safety fund," and also make the government's claim a first lien upon all assets in case of failure of the issuing bank. All national bank notes to be of the denomination of $10 and upwrad. The secretary argues the expediency and safety of his plan in extenso, basing it primarily on the recognized necessity for a reduction in the volume of the demand liabilities "now constituting a menace to the pub tic treasury." Need S-nvi.S47.sss to Ran Us. Washington, Dec. 7.
