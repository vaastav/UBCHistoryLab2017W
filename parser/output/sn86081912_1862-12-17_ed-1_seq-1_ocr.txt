Can this be the home of my youth Where in childhood I gatnbol'd and play'd ? Can this be the house where Iliv'd 7 And is that the same room where I lay 7 Oh ! where is that tree, where the birds Came so often to chirp and to sing! Can that be the same running brook Whencfe the water we often did bring 7 How vacant, how scattor'd thoSe woods, Where the pheasant oft beat with his wing- Where the whippowill always was heard When the evenings grew warm in the spring! The willow and black walnut trees, With their bushels of nuts all around, Which the swine did so patiently crack Till the snow lay quite deep on the ground ! Those pear trees that bore in the fall, And were sure to be loaded with fruit— That stood up so straight and so tall, Are dead lroin the top to the root. That soft gentle voce of my mother— The voice that was always so dear 'Twould be sweeter than music of heaven, If now it could break on my ear. Oh, that mother! —that dearest of mothers : Net a mortal on earth can I find Where the chorls of attachment are equal- Where the chains of affection so kind. • If now I could see my dear mother— If bnt ever I could meet her again— llow light would that heart be within me, Aud my tears would run down like the rain! 1 ut my father and mother are gone, And tny brothers and sisters are dead ; Oh ! le v. lonely how dreary I feel, While my heart weighs within me like lead, n * gB .. t—■—— i——u i rrwr M—M IpsaUamflm VIVIA AGAIN. BY GEORGE MARTIAL. It lias lxen nearly three months since I have seen mv littleJriends, Lou and Vivia Buracole. Silken flounces no mere rustle in my hall, my study is forgetting bouquet do Caroline, and the little stool in the corner is getting quite an old-time look for want of use. The girls have been spending the summer out of town, visiting an the Hudson, and the last three weeks at their own pretty cottage on the seashore. From that locality I have re ceived several letters from Yivia, who has en stalled ine as father-confessor, embodying material for a first-class romance, with the help of the usual " sensation" style. The summer had been rather a hollow af fair for Yivia, who, for reasons best known to herself, had on hand a little private stock of restlessness and discontent. She had flirted, danced, and laughed ; been always well-dress ed and gay ; in a Word, played her part in the sorry degrading farce to perfection, arid paid for it as do all furgces, with double inward misery. When at last their traveling trunks stood on their own piazza, her sensation was one of relief. " I atn so glad," she said, wearily. " Here I can be at rest and by myself. Y"ou and Guy can entertain*each other ; father will be busy with his old friends, and in my own room, or walking by myself, I can have the rare luxury of looking as I feel. This whole summer has been such a disgust and weari ness to me." Lou. who had felt something of Yivia's heart sickness, longed to console ; but, being wise in her generation, forbore, and only wrote to Phillip instead—the consequence of which was a letter to Yivia on the fourth day of their arrival. She opened it Carelessly enough, sitting at tiie breakfast-table, linger ing over her last cup of coffee, read it with a start, turned very' pale, and handed it to Lou. It was from Phillip, who stated that he was only a few hours behind it. lie was coming to pay them a visit, to learn for himself the cause of Vivia's late silence, and put an end to doubt forever. Lou read it coolly, as she does every thing i (though, to tell the truth, 6ho could hardly have been expected to have been so very much surprised, as she had suggested some such course of action in her letter,) folded it up and handed it back. " Well,® 7 she said, " I see rro' need of turn ing pale. We have all our Che6ts here, and the spare room is in order. We are quite prepared for the attack." " 0 Lou! how can you ?" " llow* can I what ?" The two girls were alone. (It had been' a habit of theirs, since the death of their moth er, to breakfast together in their own room.) Vivia got up, and coming round by Lou, sat down at her feet, and laid her head in her sister's lap. " O Lou !" she said, pitifully, "you know very well what is the matter. He is coming to know why I have been silent, and I—" " Well—^ "I must tell him, of course. There is no other possible way. If I could deceive him j even in the smallest detail, I muat sink lower I "TO SPEAK HIS THOUGHTS IS EVERY FREEMAN'S RlGHT."—' Thomas Jefferson. TUNKHANNOCK, PA., WEDNESDAY, DEC. 17, 1862. even in my own esteem thslri 1 have done yet Think of it, Lou. I must, accuse myself; hurl myself down from thfe pedestal on which he has placed me in his belief; etpose my own miserable folly; confess my own uiter worth lessncss ! Oh ! I could easier die than do it, and yet I would die a hundred times over rather than not do it." Lou flung both arms around her sister's neck. " That is my cwn brave sister. I knew that you were true and noble at hoait, and I told Guy so. O Vivia, you don't know how glad you have made me." " But that is not all," pursued Yivia, grow ing suddenly very red. " I—you don't know —oh ! how shall I tell you ? I love him bet ter than I ever did before. I have been com paring him with all the shallow talkers and thinkers we have met this summer, and read ing alternately his grave, loving letters, ati 3 Allan's passionate protestations and demands. Why, Lou, he seems almost godiike beside such natures ; the man whose honor is stls. tair.cd, whose word is strong as truth itself, who fears only God, a-'d would face a battery sooner than swerve from a principle ! Think of his loving a shallow, worthless thing like me, so dull that I didn't even understand the worth of the nature that bowed before me 1" " I think you undervalue yourself a little," said Lou ; " but, however the case may be, you are quite right; you cannot evade the duty which lies straight before you." At this juncture Vivia wrote off one or two very pathetic letters to me, byway of divert ing her mind from the terrible hour that was fast approaching. Philip came at last, kind and genial as ev er ; and the family, who knew nothing of Yivia's troubles, welcomed him very much as usual, and took an early opportunity ol slipping out one by one, ou some convenient pretext, and leatihg the two lovers (?) to gether. Lou went last, and, with her, all Yivia's courage. The crisis was at hand. Philip came and sat down by her on the sofa. " Now, Yivia,"' lie said, grately, " what have you to tell me ?" Vivia edged quite away in the other corner of the sofa, put her head down in the sola cushion, so that he could see nothing but the ro'.ls of dark hair, and the tip of cue littie ear, and began. She told the story mercilessly ; she spared herself not in the smallest detail ; she exoner ated Allan (who was utterly ignorant of her engagement) and called herself some of the hardest names in the calendar. " And now," she finished, " if reparation is possible, I will make all that I cm. My con duct has freed you, of course. Let it be un derstood by the world that you bruke our engagement, and why." A rising sob warned her to bring her sen tence to a close as speedily as possible ; but no answer was returned. She waited a mo ment ; the dead couldn't have been more ut terly still than the uiSn at her side. She be gan to fear, she hardly knew what. She raised her head hastily. He was ghastly pale, his features working, and a strange look in his eyes that she had never se. n |>e fore. "Philip! Philip!" she cried, in terror. " don't-look so. I never thought that you would care. Oh ! this is worst of all. I fan cied that yoti would be angry—that you would hate and despise me; but this—this is dreadful. Philip, for pity's sake, speak." If she had dared, she would have laid her head on his shoulder, pressed her lips to his; as it was, she took his hand and kissed .it. lie did not push her away as she expected ; only said, sadly r " You needn't blame yourself, child. The fault is mine. lat least might have known that you were young, and had not fairly test ed your love; but I thought only of my own passion, and was chiefly anxious to bind you by a promise, and have you for tny own. I am justly rewarded." "Oh ! but this is intolerable!" burst out Yivia. "Keenest reproaches couldn't behalf so bitter as to hear you blame yourself unde servedly. I tell you, Philip, I did love !" "You thonght so." " I did—l shall always. I know it now; only I have such a contemptible nature that it c nldn't be true on the surface, though it was at heart." Philip turned toward her with a sadden flush of hope. " Take cire, Yivia. Do you knotV what yen are saying V "What do you mean ?" " You said, just now, "I did and 6hatt al ways love you." Vivia crimsoned to her temples. " Did you mean that ?" She bent her head low. lie drew her to ward him, and gently forced her to look up " Answer, Vivia ; did you mean that?" (i Yes," whispered Vivia. That trembling monosyllable bridged over all the gulf of difference between them, for said Phlip. " The best surety that I could ask that you Will be true to me, is that you have dared be true to yourself; and this painful experi ence has but proved the strength of our mu tual love." " But Allan !" murmured Vivia. Philip looked grave. "Ah ! there is where the sting of evil will make itself felt. I cannot help you there > you must, tread the path alone. I have for given you, for I have your love. What he will do, I cannot tell." The thought came agsin and again, to check and mar Yivia's happiness. Wrong i& double-edged : it. hurts the doer as well as the sufferer. Allan was coining home on lurlough; his first visit would be to Yivia, and she must go through the trial alone. Lou, Guy, and Philip pitied indeed, but they could not help. It was at this juncture that I received the second pa'hetic out pour ing. Some one had advised Yivia to write the truth to Allan, but she refused indignant ly. "I think that, Mr. Martial (she wrote to me,) is the very most cowardly and unfenii nine thing that a woman can do. ITe ha>> a right to hear it from my lips, and I will not spare myself the pain." Allan came ; Vivia met him at the door, 1 motioned back his caresses, put away his | , i offered hand. "I am not Worthy of it," she said; "wait and hear rue." And for the second time she went over the miserable story. Allan interrupted her by a fierce exclama tion, ground out between his teeth : "If you were not a woman—oh ! that it were only a man that had dmie me such a wrong, that I might kill him !" " Kill me, if you like," answer Yivia, who was wrought up to that pitch that she realiy felt that she deserved, and would rather have preferred such a fate. Allan turned on her with a cold, sarcastic smile. "Kill you ! You aro not worth it. I wil despise you and all your sex ; that is the only feeling that a woman deserves. Tsey are pretty play things, and can protest and promise fairly ; but honor and truth they know nothing about ; and the man who ex pects it from them deserves what I have received at your hands. Good morning, Miss Baracole." Bitter are the fruits of etil. Vivia is happy tn having been loved by one man among a thousand ; a man who not only could but dared forgive. Yet Allan's words ring ?n her ears; the thought of him, with fath and love destroyed, haunts her. It was ea-y enough to do the wrong; who shall und > it ? Utter carelessness and weakness wrought the harm ; a whole life-time of repentance may never efface it. AFRAID OF THEIR RECORD. The action of the majority in Congress, in tabling the resolutions off-red by Mr Cox and others, offered the lirst da}' of th session, whicn we noticed last week, asking an inves t'gation of the arbitrary arrests made by the present administration, shows that these cow ardly Abolitionists are afraid to allow the facts in these cases to be made public. They, therefore, smother inquiry, and permit the President and his Cabinet to monopolize all the information as to the question. But the time is comicg when the damning rec rd will be spreaJ before the world, and when the au thors of these outrages will become a hbsing and a scorn throughout Christendom, if not among even barbarians of the earth. It is not wonderful that the Abolitionist desire to keep the record of their acts from the light of day as long as the" have the pow r to de so; their cowardly nature prompts this course, for with ell their f"lly, they are wise enough to know that a full di-closure of thejfacts might endanger their personal safety among their outraged and indignant fellow citizens.— E.v S32T"The Post thinks in the matter of arbi trary arrests the government has mad a mistake only " in the needlees secresy and '• mystery with which it has made arrests and "ordered imprisonment." But for the epidemic insanity of the time, under which the Post suffers severely, this simple statement would be its own refutation. It beg.i the question, or avoids it, of the right lor wrong of these imprisonments, and con demns only an incident and accident of them --their privacy. Outraged law, the violate 1 rights of citizens, the disregard of personal liberties—all these are nothin? to the Post. But that they were done in private—that is the error. Has the Post to learn that despotism al ways vails itself? Light and publicity are the guarantees of liberty and law. Secresy and mystery the very indices of arbitrary power World.

VOICE FROM THE \HOLITIOX CAMP. The HusUm Commonwealth, Hon. Charles Sumner's organ, says: Ii is said that once there was a man who thought that if he should run i v.o niili3 le could jump over a mountain. When, after bis run, lie reached the base of the mountain he sat down to rest. We are reminded ol 11; is individual by the President's fiie-sage. Taking a hundred days start he nears the base of his mountain ; but it seems is very tired and sits down to rest. lie nods. Xev er did wide-awakes uher in a more heavy eyed President, Ilere, evidently fallen asleep, he takes to dreaming of the year 1900 Is it that despairing of the present he is turn ing his attention to future salvation 1 It will doubt less occur to many that we have abut as much as we can attend to to deal with De cember 1802, without undertaking the bur thens of the second generation from this. Possibly that generation may have brains of its own in deal with its own affairs. The President says that slavery is the C uisfe of the war ; the cau-e of it? continuance; that we can have no peace so long as it ex ist£. Then his proposition can only amount to d, pfop. sltion to continue the war until the year 1900 ! To get any gleam of hope from this mes sage is like trying to extract sunbeams from cucumbers; so much is said to the point of that ivhith is nothing to the point ; bur the least objectionable thing in it is that he indi cates an intention to adhere t > his proclama tion. The question, however, arises, it the President means to carry out liis edict of freedom on the New Year, what is all this sti.fi about gradual emancipation ? The guns of our army and navy cover to day one million slavr*. Will the President on that day strike the fetters from that inill ii" win the reach of his arm! Let htm at tend to that, and, for God's sake, let the Twentieth century al ne ! lie la our Presi ident, not that of posterity. The en articles, f-.r the Constitution are ludicrious, and (.ne can hardly I eln-vt that Orpheus C.

One of these ar ticles gravely - imports :hat after we have got a State free from slavery and the slaves pair] for, if that State wants to re establish slave :y, it may quietly do so, only it must pay u? bstck our money ! One sen ence in the mc>age strikes in as disingenuous. It says, " Some would abolish is >uddenly ami wit lout compensation.'' A? if the idea of c >rnp-tisation had anything to do with the gridualness of emancipation ! The President must be Impele-idy ignorant if he does not know ihat all but a v iv fi-w emancipationists in this country are in favor of striking at slavery directly and immediate- ly ; that they be! it Ye that slavery can be reaclie 1 only by the wir power, v i cli from its very nature acts upon ah -exigency ; and that many euianc.pationistsj fav jT fcuuipensa ti. n. The fict is the President seems to be innn of inadt quote calibre; lie does not cotnpre bend his position ; he has exhausted himself apparently in taking up the gauntlet which the South threw d wn. Either tlws theory is true, or ehe that Mcphistoplus, Seward, is paralyzing h.s powers. THE 

PRESIDENT AND THE NlGGEßS.—Pres ident Linci'ln, in presenting bis views to the Senate and ll<>nse of Representatives, on the subject of negro emancipation in the South, savs;—' It is insisted Ih it their presence would injure and displace while labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a time for mere arguments, that time, surely, is not now " This, then, according to his logic,' is not the tune to advocate the interests of the wnit_ la boring men of the North, many of whotn are in the army fighting the battles of then 1 conn try. The negroes must be permitted to flood the Northern States, and drive out the white laborers, because the President has as-ure I us I hat "if they leuve their old places they leave them open td white laborers." That i>, if the negroes come North to Jill our wotk shops, tnine®, &c., <tc., the poor laboring men in the free Sta'es must be sent to fill the place vacated by the negroes in the cotton, rice and sugar fields of the S null. The workmgmen of Pennsylvania will not fail to appieciate the logic of an Abolition President who is endeavoring fo rriduce them to the de graded level of the negro. That portion of the President's Message is an insult to the white freemen of the North. The Abolition ists may endeavor to disguise the fact as they, will, the whole aim of their party hffs been to elevate the negto at the expense of the white man.— Ex.
