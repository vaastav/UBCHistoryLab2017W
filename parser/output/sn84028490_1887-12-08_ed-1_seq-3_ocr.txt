The Journal of United Labor contains a Becona leiier irom jir. i'owaeriy on the "works of Knighthood.' In the course oi us columns he says: From an organization numbering less than 10,000 members when the first general assembly was held, we have seen the Knights of Labor grow until over 70, 000 men' and women claimed member binp at one time. While that vast in dustrial army was being gathered to gether, while the seed was being sown, men who were pioneers were making sacrifices . that the order might live in history as a power for good. Men good and true were blackmailed and discharged but they never murmured They were not working for self nor the present; they worked for posterity, and the future. When I hear men talking of seceding from the organization with the threat of starting an improved oTder, 1 fancy that, they Know but little of the trials, the dangers and tbe odds against which tliey wm have to conteuu, ana i leel that the amount of energy necessary to build up a new order, it properly ap plied to the old one. woulu make it in vincible."

Saturday night a boy named miditower was attacked by three or four negroes wno aenianueu to know . whether be ; was "wet" or "dry," and upon his replying that he was "drv". he was struck on the. head with a club and has since died from his injuries.

A DOUBLY GOOD WORK. All Deoule w ho.Teat are indebted to the Royal Raking Powder Company not more for having perfected and prepared leavening agent that is pure and wholesome oeyond a question than .for its exposures, so ooiuiy maoe, or me numerous impure, adulterated and in jurious articles that are sold under the name of baking powders, bread prepa rations, etc., in this community. In making these exposures the Company has. of coure, made itself the target for sorts of counter attacks, but the animus of these attacks has been per fectly understood by the general public, by their very virulence have served more piominently call attention to the good work of the "Royal" Company. Food frauds of the usual class, such wooden nutmegs, chicory coffee and watered milk, although they are swin dles in a commercial sense, are often tolerated because they do not particu larly affect the health of the consumer. Rut when an article like baking pow that is relied upon for the health preparation of almost every meai is so made as to carry highly injurious if not rankly poisonous elements into our daily food it would seem to be the duty of the press as well as of the criminal authorities to take cognizance of it. In the tight for pure food made by the "Royal" Company sometime ago, when its guns were particularly trained against the alum baking powders, it was noticed that the most trustworthy scientific authorities were emphatically upon its side. So in the recent contest w ith the lime and other impure baking powders, the result has proved that every statement made by the Royal Raking Powder Company ,tboth as to the purity of its own and the adultera te n of other baking powders on the market, was fairly authorized by the most competent chemical and medical authorities of the country. In this contest two facts have been 1 retty conclusively settled in the minds of the public the first, that the Royal Comyany has foiffid the means, and uses them, to make a chemically pure article of food, and the other that the average baking powder, no matter how strongly endorsed by "commercial" chemists, is an exceedingly doubtful pi paration. i .ire baking powders are o e of the cliii f aids to the cook in preparing er feet and w holeboiiie lood. The recent rontrorvtrtty in Die piess has lett it m longer a question with those who de sire purity and wholi'Sumeiiess of foec wln.t baking powder they shall use. More About the Coughlin Case.

THE FARMERS' INSTITUTE AND PRESIDENT NISWONGER. The Massillon Independent says: "The discourtesy of President N'iswon ger, in hastily adjourning the Fanners' Institute, on Saturday afternoon, should be rebuked. A number of strangers were present, who had prepared ad dresses. Mr. A. McGregor was in the midst of a very entertaining lecture upon Scotland, and a large audience was on hand, anxious to hear all and more than the program promised. At 3:40 o'clock, while Mr. McGregor had the floor, the president of the Agricul tural Society coolly arose and declared the meeting adjourned as train time had come. Of course, at this signal the audience quietly dispersed, although loath to go. There was no occasion at all for this unseemly haste. If Mr. Xiswonger desired to leave, there were plenty present who were just as compe tent as he to direct affairs, whom he might have called to the chair. The strange gentlemen felt hurt, and the people of Massillon, who were the hosts, felt insulted, in having their hospitali ty disposed of in this summary man ner. So far as they are concerned, they deeply deplore the action of Mr. Xis wonger, and beg to assure the speakers who should have had more time, that the strange management of affairs is due entirely to the arbitrary whim of one individual, and he a stranger, and not to the concerted action of others." Senator John Sherman has been visiting New York this week on "priv ate business." The "private business" is supposed to embrace two or three other things, such as hobnobbing with Frank Hatton, who has just started the Press, a new Republican paper, but strongly anti-Rlaine, and attending the Ohio Society, where he thawed out to such an extent as to cause one of the members to remark: "Why, Sherman was so jolly that I believe he would even have kissed babies if there had been any present." He shook hands with 300 odd members. Again, his "private business" included private con ferences with prominent Republican politicians, in which he was joined by Bill Cappeller, chairman of the Ohio Republican Committee. If sly John does much more "private business" of this sort Mr. Rlaine had better hurry home and start in on the "private busi ness" racket himself. County Teachers' Institute.
