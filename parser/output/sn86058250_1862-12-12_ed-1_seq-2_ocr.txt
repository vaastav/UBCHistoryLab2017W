Qk The city is on fire, bat it is thought most of the buildings will be saved. - The enemy have been skirmishing alt day with our advance, bat are gradually falling back. Oar losses insignificant as far as known. Gen. Parke telegraphed: "We are in full ! possession of Fredericksburg to-niht. ' Oar troops are crossing rapidly. The wbole army will be over, ready to eugage the enemy to-morrow."

' From the GOtli. We are permitted to take an extract from a letter from one of the members of the CO h, dated "Near Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 2nd, 1862:" We arrived here Monday evening. It was the most pleasant trip, I have ever yet taken with soldiers. We were taken thro by railroad and river, and without any de lay. The weather is very pleasant citi zens say they seldom have colder weather. I bad raddisbes for dinner to day, and be hind our camp I saw a nn plowing rath er curious to rr.e to see fanning going on in December. We are in a beautiful camp, two miles north of the city it has been christened by the boys "Camp Perry," in! honor to the Adjutant. The camp of the , Brigade is called "Camp Woll River."

We regard this division, under General Emorv. which, sailed, concord of sentiment as more than sicrnifi- from Fortress Monroe on Friday last. It is assumed that Banks has landed, and is moving from Suffolk upon Petersburg, and that Foster is coming in to co operate with him by way of Weldon. Weldon is 63 miles from Suffolk, by railroad, Petersburg 58 miles from Suffolk, by another railroad, and Weldon distant from Petersburg, by a direct read, 64 miles. Petersburg is 20 miles distant from Richmond. Gen. Banks has, we presume, 20,000 men in hia expe dition ; 30,000 are reported already at Suf folk : Gen- Foster would probably bring np 10.000 or 15,000 more niakiDg a formida ble army on the South bank of the James, and sufficient to compel the rebels to look well to their lines of communication south. General McCIeL'an. in his letter to General Halleck from the Peninsula, advised that ',' all points of secondary importance else where should be abnndoned," to strike a blow at the heart of the rebellion. It looks i as though, this was at last being done, and the mighty energies of the nation were being brought to bear on the head and front of the gigantic insuirection. , Falmouth. We clip the following from the correspondence of the Cincinnati Times. It is of interest as giving a description of Falmouth where oar army ia at present en camped: '' This place, Falmouth, is a dirty, doleful, dismal, half deserted village, and" probably had from three to four hundred inhabitants once. The buildings are begrimed with age, and the citizens with stupidity and filth. Before the war it was more respectable, and was a place of considerable business. Two small cotton factories and one woolen mill were operated here. The former ware run ning up to a neek ago; also the woolen es tablishment within a fortnight past. The machinery of the latter was taken down the day our advance forces reached here, and sent to Danville. Its owners have been manufacturing cloth for the Confederate Government, and received the clever sum of seven dollars per vard for a coarse, mis erable pantaloon stuff. There are also two flour mills here, but they are "resting from their labor," while the millers amuse them selves in bobbing for cat-fish and eels in the muddy and turbulent Rappahannock. V The enemy still occupy Fredericksburg, just opposite; their pickets and ours hold a social talk throughout the diy, across the river. Large camp fires are plainly distin guishable at night, several miles back from the enemy's lines, and from this lact, and others more significant, it is presumed they intend to contest the crossing of the river here, or else give us a general right a few miles inland. Bat the Grand Army ol the North is going to Richmond this time, rain or shine, mud or snow, fight or play.

Strange to say. however, that the four leading dailies of the city of New York bare finally met on a 'common gronnd. , In oup comments on the t- -i cant. A few 6hort extracts will suffice to show that Abraham Lincoln's message may become, as we trust it will become, the olive-branch which will restore peace to our tempestuous national convulsion. We be gin with the Herald, which says : " The message is a very remarkable doc ument. It is marked throughout by the characteristic simplicity of style and honest and earnest patriotism which distinguish all the official productions of its author. If bis views are presented often in the shape ol rough diamonds, tuey are none the less diamonds because of their roughness. " Upon the all important subject of the national finances the most prominent feature of the message is the proposition for ' the organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress,' to be furnished by the Government with circulating notes on the security of United States bonds de posited in the Treasury. In other words. lr: ,nc4D proposes tne adoption by the rturni uuieiuuraui ui lut) iew x OIK banking system, which experience has proved to bo an excellent one, and bis argu ment in support of it is enti led to the practical consideration of Congress. ' Our plan would be to settle first witb the armed forces of this rebellion, and then, with the restoration of the rebellious states to the Union, leave to them, each Stale for itself, the settlement of the slavery question. We should, however, not b without hope of the success of the President's plan if ihe party in Congress identified with his admin istration could be lilted up to bis platform of patriotism." " Next, the Tribune, as follows : " Heartily agreeing with him on the main question, we differ with him on sub ordinate points without reserve and without feeling. , We know that he believes Grad ualism with Negro Exportation calculated to commend ' Emancipation to the. South : we believe, on the other hand, that our Country has no laborers to export, and that the planters of the South cannot soon find laborers so easily paid and so docile as those to whom they are accustomed would gen eralfy prove themselves if free. " But so long as the end is kept steadily in view, we can waive all incidentals. Gradualism, Compensation, Exportation if these tubs amuse the whale, let him have them f .When it shall have been settled that Slavery is to die, it will have ceased to be a power able to corrupt priests and sub sidize politicians, and all will choose to be done with it so soon as possible." ,!;Tben the Times r , -; , ' The " message of President Lincoln, which we publish in another part of this morning's Times, is a concise, clear and perspicuous document. It will of course be read by every one able lo read in this country, and by every person in Europe and over the world who ttfces an interest in the military and civil affairs of this Gov ernment and people. The view which it presents of , the progress of the war for quelling the rebellion, if not as brilliant as could be wished, is still sufficiently encour aging to stimulate hopes of speedy and decisive results. , What the President has to say of pros pective emancipation, and the colonization or inn enirancoizea siave?, win not com mand universal assent, and we deem it very doubtful "whether Congress will enact the laws necessary to carry his recommenda tions into effect. But no one can doubt that the President has made them from the most patriotic motives, and with a sincere desire to contribute all in his power to the permanent settlement of the most important question of the age." And finally the World, the mouth-piece of the Opposition in the city of New York, and undoubtedly under its new regime ih the ablest advocate of that party : "If President Lincoln, who, though no statesman, is a man of honest instincts, bas fallen into some grave errors in the coarse of his administration, they have been owing partly to the difficulties of an unexampled crisis, but still more to the baleful influence of his party. But his native sense and hon esty seem perpetually struggling to get the better of this malija influence, and to assert the r proper control over his public course. lla b ssage ne yesterday sent to the umrui iivui ubi luo radical news- mongers bad led us to expect, it is pitched ia e key so different from that of ' their san guine predictions that we have no hesitation ia saying that the country has reason foi congratulation. Since the issue of the Sep tember proclamation, the Presideut has had opportunity for gave and aaxions reflec tion, aided by the iastruetivej political events which occai red ia the months of Ociober asd November. That sober 'second thought of the peopl,' which, in the language of the late President Van Buren, is always wise and generally efficient. bas evidently been of great advantage to Mr. Lincoln, himself , do inapt type of the honest and thinking masses, 1 ill l. i "Tbe Proclamation contemplates a sweeping 'system of uniform emancipation without regard to differences of local eir eumEtances ; the message proposes to leave the fact, time, mode, and concomitants of emancipation to the discretion of each state, thu affording opportunities to temper the wind to the shorn lamb. by measures adapted to the density and prospective means f subsistence of tbo slave popula tion, and to the peculiar industrial necessi ties of the individual state." - Senators and Representatives in Con gress 1 you who differ 60 frequently, why cannot you accept and oonstrao the mes sage of Abraham Lincoln in the spirit which animates that quintuple newspaper influence in New York, which, bereiofore so bitterly divided, seems at last to be united in favor of the message of tnm PaxsinaJix? ;v Qf We have heard several of our soldiers describe the delays of "marching orders," but never so graphically as the following life-like sketch which we take from the 'Western Chris tian Advocate,' of Dec, 3: h renciltwgs osa ilse Maurcte. i '

A portion of the Re publicans while claiming the right of the President to make sucb arrests, and ! even justifying the suspension of the writ of ha beat eorpmt, declare that ihe power should be carefully exercised, and committed them selves to a full investigation of the late ar rests. Among these is Sbebm ait, of Ohio. Others, however, such as Senator Wil son, "glory in the arret-ts," and do not favor imparting to them the dignity of a Senato rial inquiry. The "Conservatives," of course, desire that the President be pushed to the wall. 1 It is now understood that Judge Holt will be the successor of Secretary Smith. Col. Joes McHkmrt, of the Seventeenth !

While on this subiect. the followinir, which occur- red in the House on Monday is to the point : aa exhihitini? the amrit of those who have State is pretty well shorn of her strength. The discussion in Congress indicate that the Republicans will be split on the question of arbitrary arrests. The Western mem bers, especially, are disposed to condemn the manner of the arrests, . and to demand' of the Government a prompt bearing in all political cases, in accordance with the estab-. lished laws of the country. There is a strong disposition in Congress to lay hold oi the corruptions , ef the army, and especially to put an end to tbat abuse, through which officers desert their com- ' .mauds without cause. Both Houses have called for information which will throw light ; upon this abase. Among the resolutions introduced on the 10th, was one instructing the Military Committee to inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill forfeiting the pay and emoluments ot omcers ot the army during the time ihey are absent except up on sick leave; and another making inquiry as to the number ot aid-de camps that can be dispensed with without injuring the pub lic service.'

Their blockade of the Southern ports, thtir preparations ' for action on " tb inland waters! by means 6f gOnboaU, thei immense levies of men,thTr policy of eman ctpation for the negroes would alt lave been thrown away or rendered nugatory; while, on the other hand, the Confederates would have everything to gain and nothing to lose by a cessation of hostilities. The blocksde temporarily raised, Ihey woold have time to procure ample supplies of food. j clothing, arms and ammunition, of all which thev are, no doubt, now terribly in aeed The President's proclamation of slave eman cipation on the 1st of January must be saspeoded. and opportunity afforded to them to ship of! their neifroes to Cuba or make such another disposition of them as they can to frustrate the anti tlavary policy of the Federal Qjvernment. But there is something more to be con sidered, continues the Star,' and that is the honor and safety of England: - " To any settlement ef this question which left the Southern system of slavery Un touched, whether snpported or not, as here tofore, by the power of our great federali zation over the American Continent, Eng land could be no party without incurring indellible disgrace. Placing the matter on the lowest ground, of material interest, it is better for ns that the question of slavery should be settled now at once and forever, even if it, unhappily involves the contin uance of the struggle for another year, than that a hollow and delusive peace should be patched up, leaving the old cause ' of quarrel ia existence, and the manufactu rers of Lancashire in a state of uncertainty how sooa a repetition of their present suf-, ferings mnst come upon them. While sla very lasts on the American Continent we have no certainty of a future supply of American cotton. .-;" ;;.. 'r --; ! The French journal. La Presto, says that "mediation ean not, after all, reach the one question at issue in America. Whatever may have beer said ot done, the real mat ter has not been : changed, nor has it been altered, that the question which its debated on the battle fields of America is tbat of slavery. . We have said from the first, even when the fugitive slaves were seat' back by the Unionists, that sooner or later complete emancipation would be - proclaimed. The late proclamation of President Lincoln ii m first and great step on this road, on which he will have to go still further if the war is prolonged. 'The first effect of an armistice would be to re-assure the slaveholders, and to allow tbem to take cruel retaliation on tbdr revolted and fugitive slaves. It is true we should bare cotton, but at what cost? On the very eve of being solved, the slave qnestion would be indefinitely adjourned. All the Llood shed by the Armies would have been to no end, for it would not have washed out the black spot of slavery which pollutes the flag of the Union.' J ' '.'Production of Indiana. It nay not be generally known that tobacco is fast be ooming one of the staple products of oar State. . The counties of Warrick. Speacer , and Dubois have each sold $200,000 worth of tobacco this year, or 9600,000 for the three counties. Large amounts have been produced and sold in other counties. , . ., l McDowell Coart Rlatrtlal. The testimony of General McCIellan in the McDowell court-martial is important in its bearing npon the conduct of lioDowell while at Fredericksburg; and, taken witb the dispatches which passed between the President and McDowell, which were pro duced in court, relieve the latter from all responsibility, for failing to advanoe from Fredericksburg. The order recalling Mc Dowell from the Rapphannock was dated May24ch., As a soldier should do, Mc Dowell responded that it should be obeyed, though the blow was crushing to him, and, at the same time, with almost prophetic in stinct, pointed out to the President the consequences of the movement that he had just ordered While- 'he Could 'accomplish nothing, the movement woald paralyse our arms from Richmond to tbe Sbenandoah; and it did. The fact is. and events will show it more .and. more, plainly, tbat the wbole Peninsula csmpaign turned upon the movement from Fredericksburg i bat had McDowell been permitted to go forward and effect a ' junction with McCIellan at Hanover Covrt-bouse, be would 1 have ac complished for the ' rebels precisely what they did themselves to the Army of tbe Potomac. It won Id ' have been a flank movement as decisive for our arms as Stone wall Jackson's was for the rebels. Gener al McCIellan expressed the opinion in court, that, with McDowell's eo operation, be would have been' is j Richmond within a week ; and, in this opinion, the best milita ry talent in the Army of tbe Potouae bas concurred. We, sometime since, was dbown a private letter from General McDowell, setting forth tbe facts substsniiallj as de veloped in the court, yesterday, but more explicitly pointing out tbe taisuke made in recalling him from Frederieksbarb, tbe very morning he was- to have advanced southward, and the fatal consequences of that blunder. . t: .. -. Tbd President assuesed the responsibility of the order, and tbe evidence shows that be aloDe is responsible. , He of coarse finds justificaiiota for it in tbe daager to which be believe! : Washington City was exposed, and the paramount necessity of assuring its safety. He does not deny, nor wilt his friend deny for bim, that the order recall ing McDowell, while it secured the para mount object the safety of tbe capital lost to tbe country tbe secondary object, the capture of Richmond. It was, in fact, en abandoasneat of the fruits of tbe campaign on tbe Peninsula up to that date, aod a trusting of the chances of success to condi ttocs not in the rlan of tbe campaign. Wbi:e we do not intend to reflect upon tbe actit n cf the President, or assume that it may not have beta lor the best, we still wish to remind ef tbe Pestawjuiar defects in the plan tatertervac N Jetatared tite pls- by tsAia frees Miev portant element calculated open as tial condition of sueeees.
