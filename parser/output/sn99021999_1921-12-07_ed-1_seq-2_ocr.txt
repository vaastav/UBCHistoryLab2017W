By E. C. SNYDER, Waahlaatoa CormDoiiilMit Onih. IU. Vihinftton, Dec 6. (Special Telegram.) Congressman Mc Laughlin of the York fXcb.) dis trict, in reviewing the high lights of president Harding meisage to con "There are fniir ouutanilinc nninfa of the preiident'i meMAge that are of cjprciai economic vaine at tins time. "First, the expressed idea that the best interesti of this republic lie in me airecuon ot party government and that the party in power is re sponsible for the inauguration of a definite aggressive policy is borne out by many years of political history in this country. "Second, the advocacy of a trait commission with power to inaugu rate change of tariff rates at any time necessity may require is sound and practical, and such authority should be given to the tariff com mission immediately. "Third, the emphasis of the neces sity of stabilizing foreign exchange values Ss timely and the importance of such action should be apparent io all. The international conference for the accomplishment of this pur pose is of importance to the entire world. We cannot expect a favor able price for American products until exchange rates are satisfactorily adjusted. "Fourth, the president's emphasis of the Importance of co-operative mar keting is in keeping with the need and development of our time. All necessary agencies between producer and consumer must be dispensed with, so that the producer may re ceive more for his products and the consumer pay less for the finished article." Points Out Urgent Needs. Representative Andrews said: "The president's message was a clear, practical presentation of the public questions requiring immediate consideration. It withheld rainbow predictions and promises, while it pointed out the urgent needs of the hour. The demand for the reduction of railroad rates was timely and forceful and should be heeded by the Interstate Commerce commis sion without delay. He voiced the superior rights of organized society over any and all individual interests, or the rights of organized labor or organized capital. All agencies must serve the public welfare. This was one of the strong points of the mes sage. , "The prompt passage of the fund ing bill relative to the foreign debt and the permanent tariff received due emphasis. It served notice on the senate to proceed with"business with out delay. The value of the budget legislation in the last . session is proved by a reduction of former esti mates of nearly $500,000,000. "In concluding,.! the ' president voiced the earnest prayer of America for universal peace and international good will. This-", eoncluding state ment was eminently fitting:, because of the presence of the members of the international conference on the limitation of armajnepts." " Message Showed Courage. . ... Representative Evans said: ' ."The mcssaee was . eomnrelion. sive. It was decided in its declara tions and wise in its recommenda tions.. As to the president's dec laration as tP labor difficulties it certainly showed courage to take hold of a very difficult problem and present it in a fair way to the legis lative branch of the government. Upon the whole tU nrAciriAt - ----- ."v k uvu ,a iu be commended for the . position he nas iaKen. "I cannnt TirMenA ' 1 t r.vuy iu vuilc an opinion on some of the phases of me message, especially with refer ence to the granting of enlarged Dowers tn tho tariff -..:..:.. lnat will come later after mature Muay. tor the president realizes the limitation that mc hi . ij UYClLUIilC before we can proclaim tariffs at win. Altogether the message is admirable and a splendid chart by which to steer." Approves Valuation System. Representative Green of 'Iowa; ranking member of the ways and means committee, which formulated much of the legislation to , which the resident referred mM.' . . , ' , i am in entire accord, with what tne president said with reference to the American svsfem r( i--,i.,-.t: as a basis for assessing our tariff uuues ana tne danger that the gen eral adoption of this system would make ous tariffs prohibitive. I have from the first been opposed to the system of American valuation, be Keying it to be impracticable in ad ministration and that it .inevitably would make our duties 'so high as to cause a rise in the price of nearly every article upon which a tariff was laid. I think a plan could be worked out in line with what I understand to be the thought of the president, using the foreign costs as a basjs in the same manner as now, but authorizing the president, by proclamation, to apply the Amer ican valuation plan in certain cases. "The adoption by the house f Husband and Wife Every time, my wife goes out she carries fonropjive bundles-H. V. G. the yteni of American valuation in the tariff bill has been the chief cau.e of the delay in it final enact ment. If it U now, in accordance with what would seem to be the de lire of the president, to be laid aside, while it will require extensive changes in the bill at prepared by the house, I am satisfied it will much sooner become a law, "I was very much pleased that the 'premdent o tringly endorsed a constitutional amendment prevent' In ir the further issuance of- tax exempt securities. J shall press tinon the immediate consideration of my committee a bill for that pur pose and hope to have it reported out at an early date. With the tup port ot the president already an nounced, it ought to be passed at this session 'and will be unless there is senate delay, as there has been in so many other cases. Our tax system can not be a complete suc cess until this amendment is adopted. . Suci an amendment should in my opinion provide that the government should not tax state and municipal securities at a higher tax than st taxes its own bonds. Some provision of this nature will be necessary to protect thc state issues from unfair discrimination and thus obtain the consent of the requisite number of states.'

Its sides were cov ered with snow and ice and it .was with the greatest difficulty that' '.he injured were dragged out. Several of the charred bodies had not been identified, and it was thought possible that more might lie in the wreckage. A statement from the railway of fice said the accident "seems to be due to train .151 (train from Phila delphia) overrunning its orders." In vestigations are under way. The inbound train makes no stops between Southampton and Hryn Athyn. The outbound train usua ly waits on tiding for it to pass.
