" MANY LIVES ARE LOST y CLIFTON, Dec, 4. For the third time Clifton was again visited today by a disastrous flood attended by loss of life estimated at this time to be between seven and twenty. Part of the town has been destroyed; Chase Creek and the F.ast Side being the heaviest sufferers. The reduction plant of the Arizona Copper Company presents a scene ef desolation. Boulders, parts of houses, debris of every description, mud and water are piled about the smelter and concentrators, and it will be several weeks at the earliest before the plant will be able to resume. The Coronado railway, connecting the reduction plant with the mines at Met calf and Longfellow was completely swept away. The flood will also cause a suspension of operations at . Shannon smelter, which is dependent upon the Coronado railway for the transportation of its ores. There were many narrow escapes from drowning and a party of rescuers did effective work in saving lives when the flood was at its height. The flood came rushing down Chase Creek, presenting a wall of water ten feet high. It swept every thing before it and the people fled to the hills for safety. Some were caught in their houses and drowned as the buildings were swept down Chase Creek and into the San Francisco river. A full list of the dead has not yet been made up and probably the full number of dead will never be known. Tonight the Arizona Copper Company has an army of employes at work in an attempt to clear away the wreckage about their plant. Miners from Metcalf and Morencf have been brought to Clifton to help in the work. PHOENDC, Dec. 4.

Nearly all of the stores were greatly damaged, many of them being ruined. The works of the Arizona BOTH HOUSES OF SESSION Entire Day Given to Considera tion of President's Message.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE SENT 10 FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS Both Houses Listen to Recommendations of Chief Executive. Agitation In San Francisco Against Japanese Is Dealt With In a Vigorous Manner President Calls On All Law-Abiding Citizens to Assist In the Suppression of Lynching. Both Houses of Congress yesterday listened to the reading of President Roosevelt's message to the Fifty-Ninth Congress. The document Is one of the most exhaustive messages ever sent by a President to Congress .and touches upon all subjects of National Im portance. The President does hot mention statehood in his mes sage, which may be taken to mean that there will be no further at tempt to join Arizona and New Mexico in joint statehool. The mes sage in part was :i3 follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: As a nation we still continue to en Joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and It la probable that only reck less speculation and disregard of le gitimate, business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosrerlty. No Congress in our time has done more good work of Importance than the present Congress. There were seeral matters left unfinished ;t your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete be fore your adjournment. Corporation CnnipolKn Contributions. I again recommend a law prohibit-,'"' Ing all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any par ty. Such a bill has already past one House of Congress. Let Individuals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit In effective fashion all corpo rations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or Indi rectly. Government's 1 tight of AppcaL Another bill which has Just past one House of the Congress and which It ! urgently necessary should be en acted into law Is that conferring upon th Government the right of appeal In criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists In many of th states; It exists In the District of Columbia by act of the Congress. It Is of course not proposed that In any case a ver dict for the defendant on the merits should be. set aside. Recently in one district where the Gcvernment had In dieted certain persons for conspiracy In connection with rebates the court "u-tained the defendants demurrer. while In another jurisdiction an Indict- rnnt for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, con- ... .. , . . ,. ! . . . . j,.,', .i defendants sentenced to ImprLonmentJ The two cases referred to may not be In real conflict with each other, but It Is unfortunate that there should een be an apparent conflict. At pres- ent there Is no way by which the Government can use such a conflict. when It occurs to bo solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of Justice are blocked without any real il decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill In question A failure to pass It will result In seriously ham pering the Government In Its effort to obtain Justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who Jo wTong: and may ajso prevent the Government from obtaining Jus tice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest - case where the Judgment of an in-(recy anJ pr00f of u ypn ,,,fncuIt oHor court has been against them . tj obtaln Tne ,nter8tate comorr I hav specifically in Mew a recent. n neaHv Uvnty .'pcMon by a district Judge leaving s Bw s,nc( that ,m p0. m-iway employes without remedy for h of .he of ,,,., hy Mo'Mlon of a certain so-called labor, raIrca(Js have been common. urfrCnt statute.

It Is well to recollect the real effi-, clency of the law often depends not upon the passage of acts as to which there Is great public excitement, but upon the passage of acts of this na- ture as to which there Is not much public excitement, because there s little public understanding of their Importance, while the Interested par- ties are keenly alive to the deslrabll- Ity of defeating them. The Impor- tance of enacting Into law the partlc- ular bill In question Is further increas- ed bv the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust and Interstate commerce cases vhere such a coure offers a rea.ona- ,,, -nc f w.

Judge Holt, of the New Tork district court. In a recent decision admirably stated the need for treating with just severity offenders of this kind. His opinion runs In part as follows: "The Government's evidence to es tablish the defendant's guilt was clear, conclusive and undisputed. The case was a flagrant one. The transactions which took place under this illegal contract were very large; the amounts of rebates returned were considerable; and the amount of the rebate Itself was large, amounting to more than I """"" "L "'" ,c""' "" "'' -' -""""-" XJ .'l dlse from this city to Detroit.

This crime Is one which In its nature Is deliberate and premeditated.
