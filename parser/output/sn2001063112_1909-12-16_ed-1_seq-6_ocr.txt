Thtee Month* In Mtvanm 40 OFFICIAL COUNTY PAPER THE PRBSIDBNT'8 MESSAGE. President Taft's message will cause •wo sensation. For a time those who tellghted In the thrilling language of Theodore Roosevelt's communlca ttoas to congress will be obliged to Awl with their disappointment as ttv read the almost prosaic mes sages of President Taft. It should be tone In mind bjr all of these that Yatt's methods are not Roosevelt's nd that It is Quite possible that the present executive may be able to se cure more of progressive legislation from congress than his predecessor. If he does so, it will be a peculiarly personal triumph for him, as he has •ot the faculty of pitching popular Osithuslasm to a high key as did Theo dore Roosevelt and |therefore will hardly create the public sentiment in support of the measures he advocates which gave Roosevelt all the. in iluence he had with congress. The president's first regular mes sage to congress does not reveal the president's mind on certain proposed legislation of most interest to the yabllc. He defers for special mes sspi his recommendations of change* Vjjbjtfc* anti-trust and interstate com fURM laws and fdr coaservatlon of "'tko nation's resources, with which «tf io-called "Roose^t poUcies" are ^llnt closely identlied. The mes- Is concisely '"mimy snbji :. yhW» thefts will he Interest relate to fMieral tartif postal Iks, ship subsidy, the budget and "Uted taard of three experts to assist the department, a« the estab- less an authority' than Sen- provision of tho Payne tariff law and *e will not be surprised to find Hale. Ss* impropriations, refusing to permit the of government funds tot those ex ports if, as instructed by the presi dent, they inquire into the whole tariff subject, including the differ- iOnce in cost of production at home jand, abroad. The president signi ficantly states that, if the disclosures 4lnade by this tariff board 6how -any of the duties in the Payne law to be excessive he will not hesitate to urge f- 1 £?ipon congress the necessity of chang ilng them. This iB by far the most 'important statement in the whole Jmessage, as we find in it a republican president committing his adminis- hundred years congress has been fix- |&as eared to obtain. Hereafter, if President Taft Is to be allowed to "^ittp&te precedent, we will find a In continues session and the tinatlve recommending changes In tariis as this hoard's discoveries suggest.

Speaier ion was quoted a few weeks ago expTessing the opinlon that such m:*hould be deferred until the stair commission makes Its re jj^ iwo',or' more ypars hence. The -mentions' this suggestion "1 ktes emphatically he sees no on fOr any such delay. No solu- gp mm the 'proposed is to have the postal banks' funds re-deposlted with private banks in the same locality, but this at once, suggests a question as to how the government would be secured for these deposits placed in the private banks by the postal banks. If the private banks would be asked to put up bonds as collateral—which has always been required by the govern ment—the necessary bonds would bring a premium that would make It expensive indeed for private banks to obtain these deposits. Such a process would be only a roundabout way of requiring private banks to give bonds as security to depositors unwilling to trust their general cred it. If this is to be done, what function would the postal banks perform that would justify their expense? There is reason in the demand that the government give assurance to the public of the payment of moneys de posited in banks, but the establish ment of postal banks iff only one of several ways by which that end might be reached. Sanction is given by President Tatt as was done by President Roosevelt, to the proposal to subsidize merchant marine. Hardly any measure is more unpopular in the middle west and there is excellent ground for the as sertion that it is utterly wrong in principle. Few indeed are the Sen ators or Representatives from the middle west who will stand with the president in this recommendation. Results that must be gratifying to the president as well as to the tax payers of the whole country, are shown as following the executive's In structions, issued early last summer to the various departments, that all estimates for appropriations by thla congress be reduced to the lowest possible point. The departments were moved to abandon their custom of padding estimates to allow tor a ,hrtnk,l*e ln bjr procedure. amount asked by the departments is no less than $42,818,000 less than The president reaffirms his deter, the appropriations for them for this Atafttloa to construe tho creation of iduiraia&of ttMrftpproprla- :*n^:.ta^alter. for thf statement thatcongretT did not Z?

There may be difference interest, is the of opinion as to this but there' will be approval of his statement that, as compared with English prac tice, that in our courts is "archaic and barbarous." The president pro poses the establishment of a com- mission to inquire into the law and equity procedure in federal courts, the law of appeals' to the circuit courts of appeals and the supreme' regular message to congress was his court and recommend changes to' recommendation that legislation be simplify and expedite the movements passed for the purpose 'Of brec.Uinsr TO

There has been a good deal in re cent magazines.'concerning this hid eous business, and concise and un emotional statistics show to what ap palling proportions it has grown. The story of the Introduction of this Euro pean business into the new world under the protection of the Tammany political organization, its monstrous gravity, the spreadlns of its web, the tightening of its meshes, until its snares are spread in every fair Bleed city of tho United States, makes al most incredible reading, and a piti ful and significant narrative as well.

Federal officials presumably would not be subject to such local influence. So it goes without saying that, for example, officials .directed from Washington should be more energetic in breaking up the white slave trade in Denver, than Denver officials di rected in Denver. In opposition to this proposed leg islation Democrats in congress may be tempted to raise again the ancient and hard-worked spectre of an over-' centralized government. Their zeal in defending what they are pleased to term "states' rights" has been demonstrated often enough. But surely our good democratic friends win not go so far in upholding any abstract right of the states to govern themselves, as to forget what is sure ly the Inherent right of the poorest of girls to live a life at least as de cent as her own Inclinations.
