Germany owes Its commercial pro gress largely to the trade schools which have raised the efficiency ol German workmen.

The American skilled workman U • indeed skilled, but be is himself the first to see the advantage of getting ^iis skill as early in life as ls possl , ible, and he knows the need that more and more men as skilled as he Is |(hkll come from the younger genera* lion.

The de vclopment of the granges In America has been accompanied by some effort at economical co-operation, but ao far this form of union has not made great progress, owing perhaps to thc fact that prosperity has rendered auch devices of economy less neces sary here than In Europe. The fact that the farmers are scattered over a vaster territory haa also stood in the way of wide-spread co-operatton. 1 'jr I riiT> a * * M&ny Needed Letws Are Suggested to the People's Representatives providing something to the effect I w-'t each ot er, but it is unfortuuate tha. ° ? °a!

Setting Aside of Judgments and Granting of New Trials. In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our cirm inal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judg ments of inferior courts on technical ities absolutely unconnected with tho merits of the case, and where there is no attempt to show that there ha« been any failure of substantial jus tice.

STRONG ON MORALITY Mr. Roosevelt writes a Particularly Strong Message In Which He Deals With Live Issues, Such as Injunc tions, Lynching* and Their Causes, and Other Matters of Vital Inter est to the Whole Country. The following ia the substance of thc annual message of President Roosevelt to Congress, as read in both Louses : Introductory. To the Senate and House of Repres entatives : As a nation we still continue to en joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is probable that only reck less speculation and disregard of ligi timate business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. * No Congress in our time has done more good work of importance than the present Congress. There were several matters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will com plete before your adjournment. Corporation Campaign Contributions. I again recommend a law prohib iting all corporations from contribu ting to the campaign expenses of anv party. Such a bill has already past one House of Congress. Let indivi duals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contribu tions for any political purpose, di rectly or indirectly. Government's Right to Appeal in Criminal Cases. Another bill which has past one House of the Congress which it is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon tbe Government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in manv of the States; it exists in the District Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set aside. Re cently in one district where the Gov eminent had indicted certain person» for conspiracy in connection with re bates, the court sustained the defen dant's demurrer; while in another an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained bv the eourt, convictions obtained lender it, ar;d two defendants sentenced to im of prisonmeot, Jh^ two cases Referred tC may not be in real conflict with

But there f " j n connec ti on w Rh the delay* of the law, I call your attention and the of at t en tj on 0 f the nation to the pre va i enCe Q f crime among us, and above a Ji to the epidemic of lynching and ^ violence that springs up, now in so one of our country> now ia an . ^ otber Each section, North, South, £ agt 0 r West, has its own faults; no gection çan with wisdom spend it< mi^, jeering at the faults of another ! ^ J i 7' <h ould be busy trying to amend it. own shortcomings.

In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of in junctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy for criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most sum mary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of thc power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated laid year. In this matter of injunctions there is lodged in the hands of the judiciary a necessary power which is neverthe less subject to the possibility of grave abuse. It is a pcfwer that should be ex eicised with extreme care and should be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all men, and condemnation should be meted out as much to tbe judge who fails to use it boldly when necessary as to the judge who uses it wantonly or oppressively. Of course a judge strong enough to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to violence or intimidation, especially by conspir acy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rights of the original quar rel. There must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder, must likewise be no such abuse of tbe injunctive power as is implied in for bidding laboring men to strive foi their own betterment in peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the injunction be used merely to aid some big cor poration in carrying out schemes for its own aggrandizement. . ♦ Lynching. is of to is are in ors in Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon; and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, that two-thirds of the lvnchings not for rape at all; while a consider able proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated on one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a varity that I have, with in the last month, saved the lives of half a dozen innocent negroes who were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court of a law in which they were acquitted. As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi, has finely said: "When the rule of a mob obtains, that which distin guishes a high civilization is rurrend ered. The mob which lynches a negrj charged with rape will in a little while lynch a white man suspected of Every Christian patriot in America needs to lift up his voice in loud and eternal protest against tbe mob spirit that is threatening the in tegrity of this Republic." Governor Jelks, of Alabama, has recently spok en as follows: "The lynching of any person for whatever crime is inex so are crime. yt mme. Mortality Among Stock. McEwen, Special.—Horses mules are dying in this county from some unknown disease. Apparently they are in good health up to with in a few hours of their death, working and eating as usual, when they sad denly collapse and suffer intensely. A similar malady affected cattle here last year. Some farmers think the trouble is caused by rotten corn. In effect, it is something like blind stag gers, and no remedy haa been dis covered for it. and in to to cusahle anywhere—it is a defiance of orderly government ; but the killi:i_ of innocent people under any provo cation is infinitely more horrible; aud yet innocent people are likely to die when a mob's terrible lust is one.' aroused. The lesson in this; No good citizen can afford to countenance a defiance of' the statutes, no matter what the provocation. The innocent frequently suffer, and, it is ray obesr vation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The white people of the South indict the whole colored race on the ground that even the better elements lend no assistance whatever in fer reting out criminals of their own ool oi. The respectable colored people must learn not to harbor their crimi nals, but to assist the officers in bring ing them to justice. This is the larger crime, and it provokes such atrocious offenses as the one at At lanta. The two races can never get on until there is an understanding on the part of both to make eommon cause with the law-abiding against criminals of any color. Moreover where any crime commit ted by a member of one race against a member of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if not the individual criminal, but the whole race, is attacked, the result is to exasperate to the highest degree race feeling. There is but one rule in dealing with black men as with white men; it is the same rule that must be applied in dealing with rich men and poor men; that is, to treat each man, whatever* his color, his creed, or his social position, with even-handed justice on his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to themselves as to the col ored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he de serves such treatment; for it is sure ly the highest wisdom to encourage in the colored race all those indivi duals who are honest, industrious, law-abiding, and who therefore make good and safe neighbors and citizens. Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an individual, will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the mem bers of the race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of "social equal ity'* or "negro domination" involv ed; only the question of relentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man the right of his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as his own qualities of heart, head, and hand enable him to achieve it. Every colored man should renliz? ihnt the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the negro criminal who commits the dreadful crime of rape; and it should he felt as iu the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in par ticular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunt ing down with all possible earnest ness and zeal every 6uch infamous of fender. Moreover, in my judgement, the crime of rape should always be f unished with death, as is the case with murder; asault with intent to commit rape should be made a eapi tal crime, at least in the discretion of the court ; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should bt so conducted that the victim need not ^ wantonly 6hamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details, The members G f the white race on the other hand should understand th.t every Ivnehiny représente by just so much a loosening of the bonds of civilization; that the spirit of lvnchin( . ine vitobly thro«, into prominence in the community all the fool and evil ere.ture. who dwell therein . No man can Iake part io thc torture o( , huma „ ^ without having his own moral nature perman ently lowered. Every lynching mean. just se much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowi edge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next gen .oration of Americans. Let justice be both sure and swift; but lei it be justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked sav ^ of • mob, Evil Capital and Labor. In dealing with both labor and cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are men who seek to excite a violent class hat red against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of cor porations and for doing away with the abuses cannected with wealth, iu to a campaign of hysterical excite ment and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a camapigp of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those working for r. genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and. sometimes masquerade as the reformers. In reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they pro fess to advocate, just as the purvey ors of sensantional slander in news paper or magazine are the worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad in our social and governmental conditions. To preach hatred of the rich man as such, to carry on a cam paign of slander and invective against BRIEF ITEMS OF NEWS. Witte's enemies aetive against him in Russia and meanwhile he prepares to again become a potential factor iu country's affairs. Congressman John Sharp Williams attributes South's rapid development to practical political disfranchise ment of the negro. The J. J. Astor Camp of Spanish War Veterans indorsed the action of President Roosevelt in dismissing the bataillon of colored troops. of if is him, to seek to mislead aud inflamo to madness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached—all this is to com mit a crime against the body politic aud to be fa^se to every worthy prin ciple and tradition of American nat ional life. Moreover, while such Reaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain noto riety to some of those who take part in it, and may result in the tempor ary political success of othres, in the long run every such movement will either fail or else will provoke a vio lent reaction, which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by the demagog and the agi tator, but also in undoing the good that the honest reformer, the true upholder of popular right», has pain fully and laboriously achieved. Cor ruption is never so rife as ia com munities where the demogog and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands become loosened, and hys teria and sensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anar chy thus produced men are sure in the end to run toward any leader who can restore order, and then their re lief at being free from the intoler able burdens of class hatred, violence, and demogogy is such that they can not for some time be aroused to in dignation against masdeeds by men of wealth; so that they permit a new growth of the very abuses which were in part responsible for the original outbreak. The one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fearless, but sane and cool-headed, advance along the path marked out last year by this Congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into following either that base crea ture who appears and panders to the lowest instincts and passions in order to arouse one set of Americans against their fellows, or that other creature, equally base but no baser, who in a spirit of greed, or to accu mulate or add to an already huge fortune, seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous disregard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others in order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches other for financial profit; and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. The plain people who think—the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom America traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given popular government is to elect an unworthy and sinster agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, fqr in such cas.* democracy is iteself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the triumph of the pluto cracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if cumb to the other. Railroad Employees' Hours and Eight Hoar Law. I call your attention to the need of passing a bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em - ployees. The measure is a very mod erate one and I can conceive of no serious objection to it. Indeed, ao far as it is in our power, it should bo our aim steadily to reduce the num her of hours of labor, with a6 a goal the general introduction of an eight hour day. There are industries in which it ia not possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just a» there are communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the Tropics, so situated that there ia no analogy between their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for instance, the conditions ara in every way so different from what they are here that an eight-hour day would be absurd; just as it is absurd. Iso far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor can not be employ ed, to bother as to whether the neces sary w'ork is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we the direction of securing the general observance of an eight-hour day. Employers' Liability. we suc can in Among the excellent laws which the Congress past at the last session was an employers' liability law. It wa 3 marked step in advance to get the recognition of employers' liability the statute books ; but the law did not go far enough. In spite of all precau lions exercised by employers there are unavoidable on accidents and even deaths envolved in nearly every line of business connected with the me chanic arts. This is inevitable sacri fice of life may be reduced to a mini mum, but it can not be completely eliminated. Investigation of Disputes Between Capital and Labor. The commission appointed by the President October 16, 1902, at the quest of both the aathricite coal ap eiators and miners, to inquire into, consider, and pass upon the questions i.: v eontroversy in connection with the strike in the anthricite regions of re First Woman to Hold Office. New Orleans, La.j Special.—Miss Jeanne Gordon, a leader in work for the masses, was appointed Tuesday by Mayor Behrman as factory inspec tor. to create which position the State constitution had to be amended at the recent general election. The office pays $750 per year. Miss Gordou will be the first woman to hold public office in Louisiana. Pertnsylvania and the causes out of\ which the controversy arose, in their report, findings, and award the belief eral governments should provide the machinery for what may be called tbf compulsory investigation of contro versies btween employers and employees when they arise. Withdrawal of Coal Lands. It is not wise that the Nation should alienate its remaining coal lands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands which the Oeological Survey has indicated as containing, or in all probability containing, coal. The question, bow ever, ean be properly settled only by lvgislation, which in my judgment should provide for the withdrawal of these lands from sale or from entry, save in certain especial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United States, which should not, however, attempt to work them, but permit them to ba worked by privat.* individuals under a royalty system, the Government keeping such eontrol as to permit it to see that no exces sive price was charged consumer,. Corporations. The present Congress has taken long strides in the direction of seeur ing proper supervision and control by the National Government over corporations engaged in interstate business—and the enormous majority of corporations of any size are engag ed in interstate business The pas sage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passage of the pure food bill, and the provision for increasing and rendering more effec tive national control over the beef packing industry, mark an important advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will perhaps b: difficult to do much further along this line; and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavorin'/ to increase their scope, because only operation will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings and thus give opportunity to defins what further remidial legislation is needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable in connection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting a date on the label and for charging the cost of in spection to the packers. All these laws have already justified their en actment. exjuest that tha State and Fed * « it Agriculture. The only other persons .whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as is the welfare of tho wageworkers are the tillers of the scil, the fanners. It is a mere tmisrn to say that no growth of cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial de velopment can atone for any falling off in the character and standing of the farming population. During the last few decades this fact has been recognized with ever-increasing clear ness. There is no longer any failure to realize that farming, at least in certain branches, must become a tech nical and scientific profession. This means that there must be open to farmers the chance for technical and scientific training, not theoretical merely but of the most severely prac tical type. The fanner represents a peculiarly high type of American citizenship, and he must have the same chance to rise and develop as other American citizens have. More over, it is exactly as tme of the far mer, as it is of the business man and the wageworker, that the ultimate success of the Nation of which he forms a part must be founded not alone on material prosperity but upon high moral, mental, and physical de \elopment. This education of the fermer —self-education by preference, but also education from the outside, as with all other men—is pecularly necessary here in the United States, where the frontier conditions even in (he newest States have now vanished, where there must be a substitution of a more intensive system of cultiva tion for the old wasteful farm man agement, and where there must be a better business organization among the farmers themselves. Marriage and Divorce. is I am well aware of how difficult it H is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless in ray judgment the whole question of marriage and <U vorce should be relegated to the au thority of the National Congress. At preseht the wide difference in the laws of the different States on this sp.bject result in scandals and abuses; and surely there is nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of tbe nation, nothing around which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good from every standpoint. In particular it would be good because it would confer on the Congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy ; and this should be done whether or not mar riage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to leave thé question of polygamy to be dealt with by the several States. Power to M deal with it should be conferred on ies When home ties are loosened; when jget men and women cease to regard a worthy family life, with all its du ties fully performed, and all its re- tl sponsibilities lived up to, as the life In best worth living; then evil days for u the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. the National Government. ms a the

On the question of International morality Mr. Roosevelt comes out strongly, advocating clean dealing be tween the nations of earth and also strongly advocates international arbi tiation as a means of settliug all dif. Acuities that may arise. American Shipping. Let me once again call the atten tion of the Congress to two subject» concerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. One ia the question of developing Ameri can shipping. I trust that a law em bodying in substance the views, major part of the views,exprest iu tho report on this subject laid before the House at its last session will be past. I am well aware that in former years objectionable measures have been pro posed in reference to the encourage ment of American shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed meas is as nearly unobjectionable as any can be. It will of course bene fit primarily our seaboard States, Maine, Louisiana, and Washington; but what benefits part of our people in the end benefits all; just as Gov ernment aid to irrigation and forestry in the West is really of benefit, not only to the Rocky Mountain States, but to all our country. If is prove impracticable to enact a law for the encouragement of shipping generally, then at least provision should be made for better communication with South America, notably for fast mail lines to the chief South American ports. It is discreditable to us that our busi ness people, for lack of direct com munication in the shape of lines of steamers with South America, should in that great sister continent be at a disadvantage compared to the busi ness people of Europe. Currency Reform. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great pur pose in aiding the enormous business development of tho country; and within ten years there has been increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $^3.0S. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional legislation is needed. The recurence of each or a un an crop season emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a re vision of them, because to leave them as tfiey are means to incur liability of busi ness disaster. Since youjr body ad journed there has been a fluctuation in the interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent; and the fluc tuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The Secretary of the Treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is the ad vance in commercial rates and the un certainty felt in the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All com mercial interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New York attract money from the interior banks into the spe culative fields; this depletes the fund that would otherwise be available fot commercial uses, and commercial bor rowers are forced to pay abnormal rates; so that each fall a tax, in th* shape of increased interest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country. Onr Island Possessions. It is urged that these shall receive the careful consideration of Congress and that tariffs, etc., shall be upon a just basis. Army and Navy. The message goes at length into the matter of the efficiency of our army and navy. The President is much gratified at the progress w*e are mak ing in both branches of our defense. In the matter of rifle proc tice the President says: The Congress has most wisely pro vided for a National Board for tha promotion of rifle prictise. Excellent results have already come from this law, but it does not go far enough, Our Regular Army is so small that in any great war we should bavé to trust mainly to volunteers; and in such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot; for if a soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of himself in the open, his efficiency on the line of battle is almost directly proportion ate to excellence in markmanship.
