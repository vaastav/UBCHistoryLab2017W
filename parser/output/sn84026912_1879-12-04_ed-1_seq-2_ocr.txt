Tho mar ket has exhibited but little change for thc food staples, and prices for thom rulo about thc same as previously.

KKOWEK COURIER was started in May, 1849-just thirty years ago-thc lust Issuo of that paper announced tho beginning of tho fifteenth volume. Tho KKOWKG COURIER since Colonel Thompson went into ellice in 1853 has been ono of tho ablest aud most conservative papers in tho State, und wc always feel (L<at ive aro not far wrong when wc havo tho endorse ment of such a jost ami discriminating paper as tho K-OWKB Count EU. Tho peoplo of Oconce should support their County paper most liberally, and tho merchants of Walhalla, SeucoaCity and Westminster should not neglect to do themselves and tho paper good by advertising in it. Tho present proprietors aro not wholly unknown to our people. Colonol Thompson and Mr. Smith were onco printers at Abbeville, und Colonel Keith has a reputation for valuable services to the State. The KKOWKECOURIER should always live aud prosper.-Abbeville Press and Banner. - * - Tho Lunatic Asylum, Of Columbia, under tho fostering caro of thc Stalo, should bo visited by all our peoplo who go to Columbia.
