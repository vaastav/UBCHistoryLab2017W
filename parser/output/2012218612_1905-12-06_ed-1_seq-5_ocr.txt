Indian Redskin Very Seldom Cries-Is Strapped to a Plank, Washed in the Creek and Hung on a Tree to Dry Out. In tie Indian papoose child nature is essentiaily the same as in the Cat ca ion babe, though there is a strik ing contrast in their manners, due to maternal treatment, or as a student of child nature might say, to environ ment. The chief differences, really, between the little Indian and the little white is that the former is less a cry baby than the latter. The reason for this is that the white baby usually gets what he cries for if it be within moth ers' power to procure it.,Learning .his from experience, for every mother knows how wise and shrewd the baby is, whenever he feels that a certain ar ticle would conduce to his content ment, he forthwith howls. Now,- the Pi'poose,-so far from being encouraged in this vocal exercise, is repressed. His mother is unresponsive and the baby not achieving what he weeps for, soon learns that tears and wails profit.n(,t. Perhaps if the white mother dwelt n tLie deserts or the mountains so that Lal'ys eryItIg would not disturb the ne bors even she might let him cry - ti l weariness brought sleep. and per -haps if the redskin mother lived an- : sensitive neighbors she might e :o pac:fy; the cryin bab. with K' .4AW NAVAHiOE P'AP~,O Tb - Rednzin Not Ashia-nz V and Wa I.that the neighbors might not e her . itu neglect of maternal s.y, or her iaby with an evil disposi t.ion. lci eta ther reason for the calm and ~aci ha-it and orderliness of the pa>'ose as ompared with his fair broiter is th' t the darker little say 3Zg has no ci adle. crib or go-cart to oiort and gar bol in. but is either packe-d tightly in a basket or strapped to a board.

When the bath is ended a cloth is tied round the baby and he is hung up on the branch of a tree or a sapling till sun and wind have dried him. Then he is packed in his basket and trundled on his mother's back home-! ward to the family tepee. Death for Weakling Babies. Nearly all Indian children that one sees are hardy and well formed. This is because only those of robust consti tution survive the trials and. exposure of their- babyhood. It is desired that only .the naturally strong should sur ive, for it is a custom in most of the tribes to wilfully expose, suffoca-e or drown born weaklings or deformed babies. Death is the lot of the un-, happy little baby whose health and physique are below the tribal standard. The Albino child, and these are more. common among the Indians than might be supposed, is certain to perish soon after birth, because the coming of such a child is regarded as evidenct' of dis pldasire of the Gre'at. 'Spirit. The redskin babe is released from his lacings and swaddlings as soon as he is old enough to walk, and then his real child life begins. He has great freedom. When it is warm enough to go without clothes, and the Indian child is inured to cold, he tum bles and romps naked. His pets are dogs and ponies and is as fond of these as are his blond cousins. As he grows old enough to run he takes an interest in the athletic sports of the tribe and the usual young Indian games are deer and hounds, hide and seek, foot racing, pony racing, bow ar d arrow shooting, spear throwing, wrestling, and follow the leader. Developing the Brave. The child is given every possible en couragement to play and is - never whipped by his parents, because it isI the Indian's philosophy that whipping breaks the spirit of the child a'nd the Indian ambition is to be brave and self-reliant. It is a fact that though tie Indian child is not subject to cor poral yierment .iAd the ruder forms of di:s'iplin'e which white children are often made to endure, they are rever c.t, obedient, docile and extraordina rily respectful toward their parents and seniors. It is the Spartan quality which the mother and father strive to deN elop in their boys. School of the Indian. The Indian lad of the wilds is not o )ppressed with book studies.

BLACK WALNUT NUTMEGS. Bishop Potter Was Sure That He Was Tasting the R.,al Article. The power of suggestion is not merely a phrase; it really is a power. It has the strength to deceive men in the matter of cigars, wines, whiskeys and what not. It is a force in medicine as every doctor knows. It is an agent .n therapeutics. The power of sug gestion and the force of example are intimately related. But to illustrate the pranks which suggestion may play with one's palate the following story is told on Bishop Potter, a reverend gen tleman of ecclc.astic note and recent Subway Taverr fame: In the course of his diocesan ram bles he called on an old friend from the South. It was evening, and the bishop was invited to supper, not din ner, for as people of the South know, the appropriate time fo:: dinner is mid day and the meal after candle-light is supper. One of the dishes served was cottage-cheese or as it is more often called in the ]anguage of the olden time "smear-case." This is often eaten under a plentiful dressing of cream and sugar. The bishop elected to have a "mess" of "smear-case" but his ap petite craved a little grated nutmeg as a flavor. This was eabarrassing to the host's wife at the foot of the sup per table, but she said to Aunt Dinah, who waited on table, "Aunt Dinah, bring the bishop some nutmeg." "Dar ain't no nutmegs in de pantry," whispered Aunt Dinah. "Well, ask Mrs. Tomlinson, next door, to lend me one." "She ain't got none. She done use de las' she hayde in makin' egg-nog," reported Aunt Dinah. "Well, then, run down to Miss Bet sy's and see if she's got a nutmeg." said the troubled hostess. who talked with augmented vivacity and anima tion to make the time pass quickly till that nutmeg should be broug-ht. Soon Aunt Dinah came in. her black face wreathed with triumphant smiles, and placed before the bishop the mess of "smear-case" generously sprinkled with grated nutmeg. "Ah," said the bishop. speaking with that tone of complacent assurance. coming from a consciou1sness of a per feet familiarity v.iih his subject, smacki.ng his lips and beaming with Flood Damnage to.

PRESERVING Ti DESTRI CRUSADE HEADED BY PRESID FOREST FAMINE A RICHARD HAI Reserving forests in the west from monopolizatioi for private gain is a goverliielt policy with which the peo pie have become somewhat familiar, our nationa-l forest reserves amounting now to nearly sixty million acres; but the idea of ap)lying this principle to the older forests in the eastern states may be new to sone people and yet is becoming a )roIniIeIIL one. Noth ing is giving it popularity and import ance so muen as tie great interest manifested by the President in ie subject. Ther'e are proposed great national reservations in the Southern Appala chian forests. in the White Mountains, in Minnesota, and in other eastern states, entirely separ:te and ar .rt from the great reservations in the west. President Roosevelt is an arch disci ple of forestry and the great promi ience into which the subject has juiped may Lhe indicated by the growth of the Bureau of Forestry froil a snill oflice. a few years ago, emnployingo half a dozen people-. to :in institultionl w'ith annual1,1 appropriations of half a niilon doll:irs. eiploying hundreds of trained foresters in the field, and having the supervisioli. : tual and tentat live of niarly a hundred million acres of forest.

The entire south-the territory east of the Mississippi anli south of the Ohio rivers-is affected by this proposed reservation of some four million mountain acres in which rise all the rivers which water this area. The President said: "I walt to say a word to yOU on a special su bect in which a tle eonn I*vN is concerned. but in which North! Carolina has a special concern.
