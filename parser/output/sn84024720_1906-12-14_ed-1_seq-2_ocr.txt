It is to be regretted that Augusta county, the richest aud most prosper ous county in the State, bas not set an example to the other oouuties of the State by making a special exhibit at Jamestown, and one worthy of the county. It is needless to recall thai when tbe Jamestown Exposition was first talked of, we opposed it tooth and nail. We looaed on it then as the shrewd act of some land boomers in Norfolk, and we could not bring our selves to countenance the scheme In any phase. Wbeu Virginia gave $200, --000 to it we believed aud said that this was, in our opinion, a gross violation of good government.and a wilful waste of the people's money. We thought it would prove a fake aud a failure But the enterprise has broadened, and under the guidance and fostering care of strong and clean ineo.bas expanded into a national enterprise, and no mat ter now what the original promoter* may have had in mind, nor what the} may reap from H, it is a stupend ous affair, growing in might, and pow er, and beauty every day, and is the first aud only real National advertise ment of tbe arts of peace, Virginia hat ever had. This enterprise has carried tbe name of Virgiuia to the lour cor ners of the earth. The navies of the world will be assembled there, antl these can only come by consent of the heads of their governments, and these heads never knew poshibly that Vir ginia existed prior to this time, and especially did some of them possiblj not know that iv her bosom was rocked tne infant nation, which has grown in strength until In a few brief years it has become the Nation, of the Nations. People who never trod Virginia's soil nor heard her name before, will be there to study her wajs, and be wise It is remarkable, therefore, since we now see the advantages this exposition is bringing to Virginia, that her coun ties have not systematically gone to i Wi/iu. ' ■■■:■' '>W «'hi -■■ the J vlU'iUUt to I la the Slate. Had beaded a j movement of this kind her lnagnib' j cence might have been spieau befoie the gathered multitudes—not possibly as the Queen of Sheba's wealth before Solomon, but the field and tbe factory would have had at least an opportuni ty which will not now be accorded them. Augusta could for a sum our people would never have felt, placed her exhibits before the world in a way ■be has never done before, aud in a way she will never have an opportunity of doing again. It 16 useless to advertise where no one sees. The rainbow is set in the heavens, had it been set in the earth who would have beheld it? Tne sun runs his course, his path high in limitless space, and thus are his life giving rays shed upon the my riads of dwellers in innumerable worlds. Were his orbit circumscribed within narrow limits his life givir.g influences would likewise be limited. Even of men it if said —they do uot light a candle aud place it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick. Here is the candlestick, here the place that we should have let our light so shine that others seeing our good works might go and do likewise. But by a mistaken policy we are shutting our eyes to our best opportunity either to thin, the world who and what we p.re, or to Show our brethren who have gone to other lands what an Eidorado tbey have left behind, thus inducing otheis to come, if we may not entice those who have gone away, to come back again, to our limpid water«,our fertile valleys, and our blue acd benultful mountains. A BAU MIXUP. A most uuusual controversy has arisen between the President and Mr. Bellamy Stent who was Ambassador to the court of Austro-Hungary, but who for his indescretiuo in meddling with the affairs of the Catholic chuich in tr) iug to aid Archbishop lieland in his aspirations to be a cardinal, tbe President was obliged to remove him. Mrs. Scorer, who seen.s to be a lady not lacking in what in men would be called 'cheek," and whose lntiiii ,tcy with the President led both her and her husband to presume that tbey had a certain propreitary right in the piesioenl, and Mr. Storer have within a few years b.ck beet me ardent Catholics It is ntedliss to say more, this explains the situation. They did as new converts do, became over zealous. The I'.tsi dent was at last forced to recall Mr- Storer. The Storers are mad. Mr. Storer has now issued a pamphlet giv ing many private letters of the Presi dent and purporting to give conversa tions also. We are sorry to see Mr. Roosevelt mixed in the affair, but for once, if never again, the President bas done the right thing in dismissing Bellamy Storer, though be did wrong to have ever allowed himself to get mixed in tbe affnir at all. In his great praise for Aicnbishop Ireland he was simply playing politics. I m * Uncle Bam explains tbe proposed in crease in the salaries of members of Congress, by the fact that nearly all of the big corporations are doing the gxine thing. Washington papers say that Secre tary Leslie M. Shaw has found a near wiy to the While House. It has long been apparent Ibat if Leslie got there it would be bj some short cut. i THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Tbe message of the President to (•ongress is a most remarkable paper I To our mind is displays en unpardon I able ignorance of tbe fundamental : principles of this government, and is - such a paper as King Edward would < not have sent to Parliament, nor the Emperor William to the Reichstag, and one we hardly believe, the Czar would have sent to any civil body in his domains, a Duma or any other. He labored over lynching to tbe ex tent of a thousand or more words. He ha-: no more to do with lynching—nor has the Federal government—than it has to do with the ordinary robbing ot a hen roost. He wants the public schools supplied with a shooting galley, su all children will learn to shoot. Where did he get authority for such rot '( He might as well have suggested tbe color of the school houses, and demanded that tbey he painted with the stars and stripes on the outer walls, and with battleship colors within, inter larded with noted paintings of great conflicts. He threatens California with all the forces "military aud civil" which he can bring to bear—putting military first —to compel proper recognition of treaty rights due the Japanese. He wants Congress to give the presi dent power to dismiss officers from the army and navy when he shall deem them unworthy. This is such a step toward centralization as was never contemplated and iv the minds of most people should never be accorded. He would take nearly all power from Congress and bestow it on tbe cxc cv tive and thus set up a dictator, if not a Czar. We will not undertake to discuss all of the alarming features of such a message, and tbe dangerous character of such an executive, but we do say tbat beside bis utterances all utteran ces of Wm. J. Bryan are as the placid surface of a lake to a tempest torn ocean. No man has before been ele vated to the high office of the presi dency who so regarded the cilice, or who had such contempt for constitu tional rights. He has never studied that instrument, he has never, it seems, gone over the Federalist nor tbe early debates, and seen what were the controlling influences which led to the formation of this compact, but he treats the government as it it were a plaything in his hands, to be used, handled, and shaped to suit his own sweet will. Nothing to our mind has ever so clearly shown the fact that it is the fixed purpose of Mr. Koosevelt to be me next Republican candidate for the presidency, as this message. No man ever advocated such unbridal ed powers unless he himself expected to wield them. Just as we are slow to plant vineyards and build houses for those who come after us, when we our selves kuow our days are numbered, and that we have passed tbe period of three score years aud ten. Just as we are slow to laj up r'ebes when we know not who shall galutr them, so will uot a president ask for power which can only he conferred on others, aud especially when such power would be dangerous except in tbe bauds of conservative, careful, wise, patriotic, and most judicious chief magistrates. It is patent that what Mr. Roosevelt asks for himself he would not readily give to others. If he were in the Sen ate and some one else in the president ial chair we believe be would be among tbe first to withhold many, if not all,of tbe powers he desires now conferred upon the president, for his own pecu liar personal enforcement or use. He calls the navy and army "our safeguards for peace," when as a mat ter of fact they are the very opposite, they are our most dangerous posses sions. We cannot maintain peace by aweing other people. He bas this idea bred in him and it is on a par witn many of his wild and erratic notions, (ioliah's size did not save him from David's sling, nor will our army and navy save us from attack if we give offense, no matter what their size. For about one hundred years no enemy has attacked us either on the Atlantic or Pacific coast, and we have had no ter rifying navy. We are less likely to be at tacked on the Atlantic coast now than ever before, but not on account oi the number and size of our battle ships. We are, however, not quite so sate on the Pacific coast, but this comes not from a weakness in our navy, but from a most unwise if not a criminal seiziug of the lands of others, certainly from a most degrading and dastadly departure from the steps of our forefathers. The president, how ever, sniffs blood, certainly powder, he wants shooting taught in schools. A3 he had learned it, he profited by it wheu tbe poor Spaniard was fleeing for his life. He exercised in the re. cent Spanish war bis early training received in the far west, where the re volver and tbe Winchester rifle were bis companions. Had be not learned to shoot so early and readily of course be might not be now able to pride him self upon so great an accomplishment in the art of war, and so rare an achievement as having secured at least one scalp. Government of railways is mild stuff beside that which has just been spout ed to Congress 1 This is "hot stuff," this is calculated to make the average statesman catch his breath and wonder where "we are at." Almost anybody can see a Monarch iv the not distant future, stepping upon the throne now building by this titular dignitary, who undertakes to revolutionize all teach ings and trample under foot the con stitution,aud its attendant safeguards. A 6001) 

TRUST WANTED. It is said there are good trusts and bad trusts. Even the president in his recent message has intimated that such an animal as the good trust could be iouud in the gang. But we notice that no one has ever put his linger on that animal, or been able to point him out to visitors. Not on» single trust that has ever yet been inspected has been able lo show that it bore this pc culiar marking, and when one of tbe kind known as the "good trust" is ' found, it ;s safe to say tbat all tbe side shows will be seeking it.to add to their 1 "freak collection." ] Sight now Mr. Joe Bailey is having j a check-ered career. •, 

PLUCKIWG THE 0009. t It may seem strange that when alt bill w»s offered iv Congress last week j t to increase the salaries of onr Senators '■ and Representatives lo $7.51X1, there whs not one of all the stalwarts, not t one ot all the Treasury watch clogs \ who would open his mouth against it. j But then it is not so strange when we look at it from an unbiased and un- • prejudiced standpoint. Do they uot i worK constantly to make fortunes tut l others, then why not for themselves 't , Tne poor Congressmen who started iv ] I,t«* in many iusiances possibly ou 50 i cent" a day, cannot look placidly or ] pitieutly ou men wearing aprons who , hammer in hand, are daily pounding t out morn money than those who forge I national thought. They canuot bear to see men with picks turning up the , shining pebles which make them mil- i liouaires, when those who delve in ' musty touies aud search for the wis- ' dom which is to guide them in push ing the course of Empire in the proper direction, are getting the paltry sum of $5,000. Not enough they find ou reaching Washington to pay for decent quarters ou Massachusetts Avenue* North West, or aiound Dupont Circle. This is unbearable. A man who starts on 50 cents a day when he rises iv the world wants soup hoc out of the ladle. Those who began lite with silver spoon in their mouths if any of them have ever reached Congress—which of course is very seldom—have not the heart to hold their aspiring brethren back, aud especially when they face that awful word, Demagogue, in so doing. There is an awkward uncouth bird inhabiting some of the distant South iSea Islands which has short wings unfit with which to fly. Clumsy feet, and cannot run. This bird Is called a Dodo. Its value consists only in its feathers; it is easily caught and easily plucked. Uucle Csain is of the Dodo vaiiety. When his own guar dians begin to snatch the down, it is easy tv see how soon be may be pluck cd. But who, when he is starving, will not pluck ripe fruit. Who, when he wants a downy bed, will not take feathers from a Dodo t Danville, Va., bas indicted her coal and wood dealers, it being proven that there was an agreement between them that they would only sell at a certain fixed price. When the Western State Hospital advertised for bids for coal this year, and the same has been the case for years, there were only four bids and they were exactly the same. There may be no arrangement of terms between these companies, but the fact that they all offer to supply the coal at exactly the same figures is such strong circumstantial evidence of an agree ment, as would put the burden of prov ing there is no agreement on the per sons offering the commodity. It now seems certain that Thomas F. Ryan, John D. .Rockefeller, Jr., and others, have bought out King Leop old's Congo Fiee State rubber trade. We learn that Leopold's slave drivers were accustomed to cut off the arms j or legs of those who did not bring in their due quota of rubber. W hat the j new owners will do is not certain in I cases of this kind, but if the natives ! are on a par with many of our people at home, and if these magnates are really after rubber, the natives would not only be compelled to give up their legs and arms, but their necks also. If all the big corporations increase the pay of their employee, United States Senators need not worry over the proposed increase in their salaries. That "the laborer is worthy of his hire" will receive an awful jar when Congressmen increase their salaries lo $7,500. Tbe Bellamy Storers have learned that in the game of diplomacy, it is poor playing to swap a King for a Bishop. WASHIN6TON LETTER (From our Keuular correspondent.] Washington, D. C , Dec. 8. Many bills are being introduced in Congress every day, but there are only a few of them of real national iv teres! One of the most important, and which stands a possibility of pass ing at the present session, is that Ly Representative Perkius of New York, embodying the ideas of the President on tbe inheritance tax. This bill is not very drastic, but is drawn with an idea of withstanding the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. In provides for a tax ou all legacies of $25 000 or over. The amount assessed varies with the closeness of kin between the testator and legatee. la case of a direct descendant, a brother, sister, husband or father, the tax will be only 75 cents in every $100 on the minimum amount named, this tax in creases as the consanguinity dimmish es, and in the case of a legacy to strangers it amounts to $5 00 in every |100. On the other hand there is a sliding scale, which increases tbe tax ation as the legacy increases, so that in the case of legacies of $30,000,000 or over the tax would amount to one quarter of the bequest itself. Provision for the collection of the taxis made through the Bureau of; Internal Revenue. In the case of estates over $1,000,000 in value, the executors are given three years, if de sired, in which to settle the taxes. The deferred taxes will draw interest at the rate of 6 per cent,but the object of the delay is to prevent sacrificing real estate or securities by throwing a large amounts immediately on the market. The question of an income tax has not yet been broached, but it is understood that a bill to this end will be Introduced a little later in the session. An elastic currency bill is now be ing drawn, it is underrtood, under the direction of Sentor Aldrich's com mittee. This measure will emboay the recommendations that were agreed on at the recent meeting of the Cur rency Commission in this City. These provisions were fully discussed at the time. News has been received at the War Department of the receut fight in Leyte, in the Pbillipines, in which tbe American troops were badly cut up by an outfit of liolo men. This is one of tbe liviiest fights tbat the War De partment has had to record in the past two yean. The insurgents were not really insuneetors at all, but rather a stronger band than usuai of the Lad rones who infest, many of ihe islai ds. Some of them were armed with guns, but all had the deadly bolos, in the use of which the natives are very ex pert. They fired a volley at the troops and then rushed them with the sword, killing five before they were finally dis persed. Several of the soldiers who escaped death werebadlv injured, but tbe encounter is one which is not like ly to be repeated again very Soon The Puljanes, the robber organization which infested the island of Samar, has li»m rff'etmlly bnk«n up nnd I J all the iiitiiuiaiion th;'.t now comes to I th» War Bepirtmerit indicates that's the P hill'pines ti-ive en'ered an e.r\ of ;! comparative peace combined wi'h :• 11 fair amount of prosuerilv, Explicit, cittlradietiou has been j sii veil to tbe report that a new treat' I was t'j hi i cgdiaUd with J«p m prov- j lding for the pxhlosicd of .lapanrgelt laborem from this con.itrt A <!ei.ial]B» Of aucti stateiueut i< h tr.liy B Tne urgeu' qu"i-t'oii at lhe pies-?!)'

The interest of the con vention in this measure was indicated by the fact that 15 out, of the 20. lustra i elected were from the region inside the Mississippi watershed. Such a deep waterway would take advantage j in a large part of tbe Mississippi Biver itself, but there would be a very large amount of Canal work necessary in addition.
