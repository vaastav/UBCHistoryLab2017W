To test its permanent value fur ther time will he required, and th" people, satisfied with its operation and results thus far. are In ho mind to withhold from it a fair trial. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress, the question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. The work of putting our finances upon a sound l?asls. difficult as it may seem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the Government since IsWi. On the thirtieth day of June of that year we had outstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $7U?.Si;S,447.41. On the first of January. 1h7'j, these liabilities had been re duced to IM3.wV.llK.8fi. Of our interest be.tring obligations, the figures are even n.ore striking. On July 1. INK'., the prin cipal of the interest-lxaring dcot of the Guvernn-ent was K.XS2.331,3JH.

AUTONOMY SUPPORT It is Very Shadowy in the Island of Cuba. FORCIHG MEN TO TAKE OFFICE Reformists Do Not Believe in the Sagasta Plan. THINK INDEPENDENCE NEAli (Copyright. 1897.) Spen-lal ('orrespetDeleDce of The Kmilnr Star. HAVANA, Cuba. December 'J. 1HU7. Captain General Blanco wan able to begin the other half of his task first. This was to make a showing of Cuban support for autonomy. Unlike with the Spanish ele ment, he had the name of a party with which to make a beginning. In the political history of Cuba the autonomlsta party has bren a respectable organization. The shell remains. The kernel is gone. The name does not conjure the autonomists who joined the insurgents back from the field. A few men of fair talents who were identi fied with the original movement halted when the choice was revolution. Thry re mained autonomists in theory, and held their peace under the shadow of Weyler's displeasure. They called themselves lead ers. yet they were without followers. ForrlnK Cubnnii to Tokf OHIce. This was the condition which confronted General Blanco when he took control a month ago, with instructions from Sagasta to select Cubans for the posts of civi! gov ernment. He summoned the autonomist leaders before him and Invited their aid. The captain general's first shock was In discovering the unwillingness of meist of them to take office, a rare spectacle in any cou;itr>. They shunned a share in the re spcnsibility of restoring peace in Cuba, un der the c lonial pe>licy of which they had been advocates. Its nature was too well known to them. Official pressure, which amounted to government coercion, finally Induced som- of them to take hole!. ?em>r liruzon. a distinguished lawyer, .x'came civil ge.vernor of the province of Havana. It is said he had his choice between that and exile to Africa. The government put it a little- differently, saying Spain die! not expect a loyal subject would refuse ids services when they were needed. Autono mists were named as governors of other pro*inees i-nd also as alcaldes or mayors in se>me e?f the cities. The first step ir. Spain's autonomistlc program was not taken with the* unani mous support, of those who went by the name. Though only the semblance of. a political organization, the autonomists split the shadow of themselves and divided into radicals and conservatives. It Is some thing like the fractional division of a frac tion. Marquis Montaro. who is recovering from a severe illness, became the head of the conservatives. Years ago Mr. Mon taro had influence with his people. That Influence ceased the day he came out in favor of the reforms of Canovas and got his title. If any of it had remained, his action lr signing the testimonial to Weyler on "the butcher's" departure would have destroyed what was loft. Blanco seems to I have had political Instinct of the right sort ! In knowing whom not to select for carry ing out the policy of the Sagasta minis try. The division among the autonomists is not in itself important. The "reform is tos," who in former years had advocated liberal reforms without distinctive home rule, fill in the breach, and by upholding the new order get their share of the pat re nage. Their felicitations to Sagasta and Moret on having given Cuba a govern ment by Cubans and for Cubans are sin cere. for the reformists expect to be part of that governmert. While none of the leaders who have been placed in i>ositions by Blanco have' been in the field, most of them have rela tives and friends that are out in the brush. How far their persuasion may go with these to lay down arms cannot be deter mined at once. It does not yet give prom ise of great results. Some of these au tonomist leaders will exert themselves only on the surface. One of the best known of them Is credited with saying: "1 hold offi cial position because 1 must, but it is only while Cuba is drifting to her destiny." He no longer believes that the destiny of Cu ba is to be even nominally a colony of Spain with a large measure of home rule. If a single insurgent leader who was for merly an autonomist could be induced to yield his arms and support Spain's pre-s ent policy it would have greater ^weight than the combined influence of the group of autonomists who have not smelt pow der. That Is, it would have weight If an insurgent leader who look such a course could be credited with patriotism Instead of with Spanish sold, and If he could reach Havana without being shot or hung by his fellow insurgents. Though much Is heard in the states about bribing the in surgent leaders into quitting, little atten tion is paid to it here. Itt-MUlta .Nut Kne'ouraielnif. General Blanco's plan of conciliating or persuading the men who have been in re volt against Spain's authority to quit for a consideration must be measured by re sults. So far these are not encouraging. General Pando was to carry out the plans. He took the field ostensibly for military operations, in reality to arrange terms with the rebels to whom overtures had been made. After a week In the field the surrender of the Cuervo brothers with 1UU of their followers and the promise that more would come In was reported. A reputable eye witne-ss of that "surrender," an American, gave me an account of It. He counted Just twenty-five men in all and he heard of no others who were expected. When the event was first reported the in surgents sought to discount it by saying that the Cuervo brothers had never oper ated with them. This was untrue. ih? force of the surrender of the Cuervos was weakened, however, by the fact that Gen eral Gomei had ordered them to report for court-martial for some breach of discipline lr. a raid on Guines. General Pando has since been to other parts of the Island and Is continuing his military operations. The telegraph may carry occasional tidings of hia succesaoe and here and there the yielding of a Cabe cllla, or chief of a small band, may be re ported. but until Gomez and Callxto Garcia give the word there will be no end to Um Insurrection as such. Picking It apart piecemeal by persuasion or otherwise seems a fruitless method. The results secured are not lasting. Treachery has caused tome bands to be broken up. General Castillo, who was ill command of the Insurgents in Havana province, was undoubted1}- be trayed to his death a few weeks ago. Other officers have fallen in the same way, yet there is always some one to take their place. Reported Surrender* Deceptive. The reported surrenders are also decep tive. The insurgents are taking advantage of tile invitations of Gen. Blanco to resume their allegiance by having their sick for whom they are unable to care give them selves up. The same thing was done under Weyler. who also issued proclamations of this kind. Moreover, the presentados. or persons wiio give themselves up, do not al ways stay presented. Often the men go out in the Held again, though these men are not numerous enough to make a serious tilt - ference on either side. In going through the official reports 1 have been able to find 110 change trom the Weyler regime. The presentados are still chietly made up of wo men and children, or of men "sin armas ' without arms. They are worthless as an index of pacification or acceptance of au tonomy. The insurgents so regard them. Their reply to Blanco's overtures was to burn the cane fields within sight of Ha vana. This has been stopped under orders from headquarters since New York parties opened negotiations for grinding the sugar cane on the payment of a fixed sum. It might be thought that the Sagasta ministry and Gen. Hlanco could depend on the people they have let out of prison or permitted to return to Cuba from the penal settlements of Africa to heartily uphold the policy of autonomy. Hut amnesty ia a bending reed on which to lean. The reed may not break, yet it will never be sate to trust. Most cf the "indultados," or par doned suspects, are treasuring the memory of a great wrong, and many of tliem, too, of great suffering. They do not seem to look upon their release as giving the gov ernment a claim 011 them. Instead tney want restitution. A group was pointed out to me this morning, all of whose members were just back from Africa. A chance in troduction to one ol them later gave me an opportunity to ask his purposes. 1 had as sumed that he would support the new policy. "You are mistaken," he said, "two years ago X was an autonomist. i*'or tual I have had twenty months' imprisonment. Weyler was responsible for it, but Weyler was Spain, lie may be Spain again. W hy should we taik 01 autonomy when we are so near independence?" Others are asking the same question. 1 do not think, how ever, that many ol those who hai'u been released will lake the field with the insur gents. The majority of them are likeiy to remain passive. Air. Viondi, the lawyer who defended Sanguilly, and who was soon thereafter thrown into Jail, is among those who have been freed, it is announced that he will resume the practice of his profeo sion. 1 am told he is advising the accept ance of autonomy Cor a time at least. Tnese ale tne conditions as they appear today. What progress is made by Caplajn General Blanco w.ll be recounted 111 the future as it may develop, in Hie meantime, while waiting to give autonomy a fair chance, a long wait is not necessary to judge the results of the promised policy of suctoring the starving people. No con tacting or antagonistic elements have to be harmonized in order to give relief, lhat is a matter of good administration and prompt measures to meet an emergency which con cerns human lives. Both are lacking. 1 he palpable evidences that the decrees and orders for the benefit of the reconcentra does exist except on i>aper, are not yet ap parent. They are still dying of hunger and diseases due to neglect. Sad Condition In I'lnar del Klo. A Spanish-born tobacco merchant, who is a naturalized American citizen, gave me today his own experience in parts of Pinar del Rio. He found the concentradoes dying In worse surroundings, if that could be pos sible than during the last few months. The authorities had done nothing to carry out the humane Intention of General Blancos levocat 011 deciee. They l ad no means with which to do anything, they sa'd. Within his own observation had come an instance of bloated and diseased cattle killed and the meat eaten to satisfy the ravenous hunger of the paclficos. In the villages, where the water supply Is from the run ning streams, it has been polluted by the soldiers washing their wounds and through similar causes. Nothing was done to warn the people or to give them protection against disease. In Consolation and neigh boring places smallpox has broken out for the third time within a year. "I would not pass another week in Pinar del Rio for $10,000." said this tobacco merchant In tell ing his experiences. The same man told me how his own ef fort to take advantage of the revocation order and help some of the paciflcoes had been foiled. This was at Alequlsa. in the province of Havana. He had proposed to take a few families, put them on a tobacco farm near the village where the insurgents have not interfered with the crop, build huts and provide food until they could earn something. The local commandante re fused permission for the paciflcoes to leave unless the tobacco merchant would put up little forts for the soldiers, who, he insisted, would have to be detailed to protect the paciflcoes. This meant that It would cost more to get the crop In than it would bring in the market, and th's merchant was thwarted in his effort to help the starving people. I have heard of other Instances in which the commandantes defeat the execu tion of" General Bunco's revocation decree. They do nat apenly defy it, but they have no trouble in keeping it from being carried out. CHARLES M. PEPPER. OPEXISG OF COJiGUESS.

ACCEPTS. He Will Be Nominated for Attorney Genernl. Governor Griggs of New Jersey has ac cepted the President's offer of the office of Attorney General, to succeed Mr. MoKen na. Governor Griggs will be nominated for the position after Mr. McKenna's nomina tion to the Supreme bench has been con firmed. The new Attorney General, how ever, will not enter upon his duties until some time in January. The New Jersey coi stitutlon fails to make provision for a lieutenant governor, and the successor to the governorship would be the president of the state senate, who is limited in the as sumption of the office to the time when tho legislature is in actual session, which will not occur until January 1. Should Gov ernor Grigg relinquish his place now. there consequently could be no head to the state government during the period of time be tween now and January 1, and the gov ernor is unwilling to leave matters in such a state. It is thought that it will be near the mid dle of January before Governor Griggs will assume the duties of the office. NO

It was quickly discov ered that the President was anxious to retain Mr. Ross as Commisisoner, if the condition of the latter's health would per mit, and the President readily withheld the resignation frcm the files and gave full opportunity for and encouragement to the effort to secure its withdrawal. It was also learned that one of the contributory causes of Mr. Ross' ill health was nervous worty, due to friction with his colleagu.-s ai.d to a misunderstanding of their ival sentiments concerning him. A full and frank interchange of views between the Commissioners was brought about, and finally the atmosphere was cleared and many misunderstandings removed. Mr. Rcss last week wrote to the President in dicating his willingness to conform to the President's wishes in the matter of retain ing the oommUslonershlp, stated to one of his colleagues that he had withdrawn his resignation, and went away for a brief trip of recuperation, which had been strongly urged upon him. Naturally it was the desire of those sincerely Interested in the retention of Mr. Ross as Commis sioner and concerned in the same connec tion In the welfare of the District that no publicity should be given to the fact of the tender of the resignation while It was still pending, and they deplore the exploit ing even at this date of past differences and misunderstandings between the Com missioners.
