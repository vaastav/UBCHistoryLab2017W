Owing to the length of this impor tant document, (although short com pared with many messages which have from time to time been furnished for the consideration of Congress,) we can not give it entire in oar columns. We give below the more important portions, bearing upon matters in which the pub lic is mostly interested at the present lime; Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives : In the midst of unprecedented polit ical troubles, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solic itude, chiefly turning upon our own; domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in the at tempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factions and domestic divisions is exposed to disre spect abroad, and one party if not both is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition; although measures adopted under such influen ces seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the U. S., who have offered the ruin of our country in re turn for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received loss patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations in this ease, discarding all moral, social and treaty obligations, would net solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including specially the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear as ret i not to have seen their way to their ob j ject more diiectly or clearly through j the destruction than through the-pres- j ervation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that for- j eign nations arc actuated by no high er principle than this, I am quite sure a sown 1 argument can be made to show them that they could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion, than by giving! encouragement to it. The principal lev-! er relied on by tbo insurgents for ex-; citing foreign nations to hostility | against us, as already intimated, is the I embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, notimprob-! ably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort , for disunion produces the existing dif- futility, and that one strong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments. It. is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign nations, be cause whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of our gov ernment mainly depend not upon them, but upon the loyalty, patriotism, vir tue and intelligence of the American people; the correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted, I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liber ality toward foreign powers, averting any cause of irritation, and with firm ness maintaining our own right and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here as in every state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures bo adopted for maintaining the public defenses on ; every side. While under this general recommendation, provisions for defend ing our coast line readily occurs to the I mind. I also in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation j improvements, at well selected points upon these would be of great impor tance to the national defence and : preservation. I invite your attention to the corres : pondence between her Britanic Maj ; esty’s minister accredited to this Gov ernment and the Secretary ot State relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June last by the U. S. steamer Massachusetts for a sup- 

GRAND RAPIDS, WISCONSIN. posed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvi ous misapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her de tention. By the act of the sth of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of salable ves sels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to mo that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re capture any prizes which pirates make of U. S. vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts now established by law in the Eastern countries to adjud icate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and of Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling how ever to inaugurate a novel policy in re gard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consid eration the expediency of an appropri ation for maintaining a Charge d'Af fairs of each of these States. It does not admit of doubt that important com mercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties w ith them. The operations of the treasury during the period which, has elapsed since your ad journment have been conducted with signal success. Tho patrotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the Government the large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been taken by citi zens of the industrial class, whoso con fidence in their country’s faith, and zeal for their country’s deliverance from its present peril, have induced them to contribute to the support of the Gov ernment the whole of their limited ac quisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations t > economy in disbursement, and energy in action. It is gratifying to know that the ex penses made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loy al people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sus tain it till peace and union shall again bless the land. I respectfully refer to the report of the Sec'y of War for information re specting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency, and the well being of the various bran ches of the service entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that the patri otism of the people is equal to the occa sion, and that the number of troops ten dered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to tiiose portions of his report which make al lusion to the creditable degree of disci pline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the iutire army. The recommendation by the Secre tary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis, is a subject of vi tal importance to the future safety of the country, and is commended to the seri • ous attention of Congress. A lage ad dition to the regular army, in connec tion with the detection that has so con siderably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service, and the ; activity and energy which have char | acterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase its effi i ciency and power. Such have been the : additions by construction and purchase, i that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service ; since our difficulties commenced. Besides blockading our extensive I coast, squadrons larger than ever be- I fore assembled under our flag, have | been put afloat and performed deeds ; which have increased our naval re | nown. I would invite special atten | tion to the recommendation of the , Sec’y of the Navy, for a more perfect | organization of the Navy by introduc ing additional grades in the’ service. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court—two by 

—SATURDAY, DECEMBER 14. 1861. the decease of Justices Daniel and Me Lean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so far for borne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the States now overran bv revolt, so that if successors were ap pointed in the same localities they could not serve upon their circuits, and many of the most competent men there probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to servo even here upon the Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments northward, thus dis abling myself from doing justioe to the south on the return of peace, although I may remark that to transfer to the north one which has heretofore been in the south, would not. with reference to territory and population, be unjust. During the long and brilliant career of Judge McLean, bis circuit grew in to an empire, altogether too largo for any one judge to give the courts there in more than a nominal attendance, ris ing in population from 1,470,000 in 1830 to 6,151,405 in 1860. Besides this, the country has gener ally outgrown our present Judicial sys tem, If uniformity was at all intend ed, the system requires that all the Stales shall be accommodated with cir cuit courts, attended by supreme judg es, while in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota lowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas and Oregon, have never had any such courts, nor can this well be remedied without a change of the system, be cause the adding of judges to the su preme court enough tor the accommo dation of all parts of the country with circuit courts would create a court al together too numerous for a judicial body of any sort, and the evil, if it be one, will increase as new*states come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful, or thov are not useful. If useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful no State should have them. Let them be provi ded for all, or abolished as to all.— Three modifications occur to me, either which, I think, would be an improve ment upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient num ber in every event. Then, Ist Let the whole country bo divided into circuits of convenient size, the Su preme Judges to serve in a number of them coresponding to own number, and independent-circuit judges be pro vided for all the rest; or, 2d. Let the Supreme Judges bo re lieved from circuit duties, and Circuit Judges provided for all the circuits ; or, 3d. Dispense with circuit courts alto gether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an in dependent supreme court. One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire j suppression, in many places, of all or dinary means of administering civil justice by the officers, and in the forms of existing law. This is the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent States and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those States, the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts nor officers to I whom the citizens of other States may ; apply for the enforcement of their law-i ful claims against citizens of the insur- I gent states, and there is a vast amount I of debt constituting such claims.—-! Some have estimated it to be as high I as $200,000,000, due in large part from ; insurgents in open rebellion to loyal! citizens, who are even now making i great sacrifices in the discharge of; their patriotic duty to support the Gov- I ernment. Under these circumstances,! I have been urgently solicited to es-1 tablish by military power courts to ad- i minister summary justice in such cases. i I have thus far declined to do it, not' because I had any doubt that the end: proposed, the collection of debts, was ' just and right in itself, but because I ; have been unwilling to go beyond the I pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power, but the powers of congress I suppose are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to congress with a hope that a plan may be devised for | for the administration of justice in all | such parts of the insurgent States and j Territories as may be under control of! this Government, whether by a volun-! tary return to allegiance and order, or ' by the power of our arms. This, how-! ever, not to be a permanent institution, ; but a temporary substitute and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some raoie con-! venient means should be provided if; possible for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their increased number by rea son of the war. It is as much the duty ot the government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication ot all claims in their nature belong to the judicial department, besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged, for some time to come, with great national questions. It was intended by’ the or ganization of the Court of' Claims, mainly to remove this branch of busi ness from the halls of Congress, but while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of inves tigation, it in a great degree fails to ef fect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final.- Fuby aware of th; delicacy* not to say the danger of the subject, I commend t'n your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not be properly given to the Court re versing the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court with such other provisions as axpcrience may have shown to be necessary. The relations of tho Government with the Indian tribes, have been great ly disturbed by tho insurrection, espec ially in the Northern superintendency, and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in possession of the insurgents from Texas anci Arkansas. The agents of the U. S. appointed since the 4th of March, for this superintondency, have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time, have espoused the in surrectionary cause, and assumed to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrection ists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as a military force, and attached to the armv of the Insur gents. Although the Government has no official information upon the sub ject, letters have been written to tho Commissioners of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assur ance of their loyalty to the LTnited States, and expressing the wish for the presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is believed that upon the reposses sion of the country by’ the federal forces, the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the Govern ment. Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has'not a department or a bureau, but a clerk- ship only assigned to it in the Govern ment. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be giv en voluntarily with general advan tage. Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, com merce and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestions as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and sta tistical bureau might profitably be or ganized. The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of con gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have recently been at tended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel a? a slaver, have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain ta ken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of which is death. I recommend to the favorable con sideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia. The insur rection has been the cause of much suf fering and sacrifice to the inhabitants, and as they have no representatives in Congress, that body should not over look their just claims upon the Govern ment. Under and by virtue of the act of Congress, entitled an act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary pur poses, approved Aug. 6th, 1861, legal cairns of certain persons to the labor avffi services of certain other persons, have become forfeited and numbers of the latter, thus liberated, are already dependent on the U. S., and must be $1.50 A
