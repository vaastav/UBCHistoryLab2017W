THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. E. WENKi Editor 4 Propriitoh. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, ISM. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinley's anuual mes cage was delivered to Congress ou Monday. The document is quite lengtby but exceedingly interesting, treating exhaustively as it does of the momentous questions that have en gaged the mindsof all the world with in the past year. We give the mes sage in supplemental form to-day, and since it is perhaps the best his tory the country will ever have of the causes which led up to the ' war with Spain, as well as the conduct and completion of the war, t should he carefully read by all who have the opportunity. Peace is a noble word when hon orably at ained. The people of the Uoited States welcome it with a sense of duty performed. An off year in Pennsylvania is a year in which the Republican party rolls up only 100,000 or 130,000 ma jority. Kansas City Journal. Admiral Dewey started out to protect our shipping on the Pacific and the administration has backed him up in making a permanent job. It was Weylerism and the destruc tion of the Maine that precipitated the war. The sorrows of Cuba, how ever, must have come to an end some time. "Admit the bearer and one wife"is a formula of Arteraas Ward that may be of some service to the next Con gress in dealing with the Utah dele gation. It has been said that annexing Hawaii would burden us with an ele phant The animal is 8 well-behaved that the Philippines "elephant" may be expected to turn nut equally well. A silver paper in Utah fears that one more good crop in this couutry will ruin the remaining prospects of free coi' age. It still has a lingering hope that the worst will not happen. In view of the streams of gold flow iog to this country the idea of a financial declaration of independence is not as facihating a topic as it used to be around the country grocery stove: Gen. Merritt, like Admiral Dew ey, says keeping all the Philippines is u necessity of the situation. Their judgment as practical observers on the ground is better than that of Carl Suhurtz and Prof. Norton. If Utah's newly elected Congress man with three wives is admitted.and the three wives visit the gallery of the House together to hear him make a speech for more per capita, his do mestic responsibilities will form a strong background. "Coin" Harvey's new lecture is entitled "A Review of Civilization, the Cause of the Decline of Republics and the Necessity of an Organization of the People of the United Statu to Save the Country f om the Fate ol Euiope and Asia." This is topheavy. "A Farewell Calamity Wail" would cover the ground. Blanco's resignation has been ac cepted. He did not have courage enough to stick to his men and be in at the surrender of Havana. Per haps if be had been at Santiago he would have sneaked out before that city fell, and have left to some subordinate the job of turning over the city to the Americans. An American officer would stay with his men through evil and good report. This desertion is the most discredit able incident in Blanco's receut ca reer. A New Yokk weekly newspaper has a queer idea of what it calls "un necessary war taxis." One "oppres sive tax" to which it refers is that of one cent on every ticket for a seat in a parlor or sleeping c.r. How the poor people groan under this oppres sion Is only hinted at, but the burden must be tremendous. The Pullman Company recently added millions of dollars to its already heavily watered stock, and with all the "water" the stock "el lb at 139, and large divi dends are paid regularly. As pas sengers do not p iy tho tax on the tickets, rates remain unchanged, the oppressive burden on the poor people can well he imagined. The poor brewers are also suffering because of the additional tax on beer. Their profits are said to have been cut down, so that dividends in some cases fall below 20 per cent. Speedy relief from such taxes is demanded. But hard hearted Mr. Diogley says that no relief will be granted this Con gress. This is an awful state of affairs. If Spain had accepted the tendend friendly offices of the United States be fore the war it tvuld have secured sev eral hundred millions for Cuba and saved the Philippines and Porto Rico The choice of war was deliberately made by the people of Spain. The official returns of (he late elec lion have beeu computed at the State Department, Harrishurg. Stone's plurality over Jenks is 117,512. The official vote for governor : William A. Stoue, (Rep.) 4G9.834 ; George A. Jenks (Dem.) 352,322; Silas C. Swallow. (Pro.) 131,537. It is a matter of no particular cou sequence, says the Punx'y Spirit, but for the sake of accuracy, nud to cor rect an erroneous impression that has gained geueral currency to the effect that Admiral Dewey is a Dem ocrat, it may be well enough t state that the hero of Manila is a Republi can, and has been one all his lfe. The ease with which Mr.McKinley compelled Spain to cease dilly-dally-iug and accept the terms offered by ibis government, as soou as he him self got don to business, shows that the treaty of peaco might have been signed a month ago had the adminis tration made proper use of its power. The inference is plain thatjthe delay was allowed because it suited the plns of the administration. Brook- ville Democrat. B'gosh I Now will you, good Mr. McKinley ? The London Spectator says : "You can not rid the average Americau farmer of the idea that when silver and paper money are pleuty times will be good " The average Ameri can farmer deserves a better reputa tion than this. He showed in the re- cent electiou that he does not think silver and paper money in abundance necessarily make good times. In that ejection he declared that silver and paper curreucy need bracing up, and that gold must be used to do the bracing. The farmer voted for the preservation of the gold standard. It was the farmer's vote that saved the gold standard from assault in the next House of Representatives. If me firmer! had been faithless to the cause of financial sanity t.e Republi cans would have been beaten in the election. In the manufacturing and commercial region the Republicans lost ground. Thtv gained ground in the agricultu al districts. When tha Spectator digests the recent election returns from the Western states it will have a higher cpinion of the American farmer. The Totes That Count. Reminding citizens that if they take as much interest io candidates and political questions before elec tions as afterward theie would be morestable government, a Chicago writer aptly says : "Voters net as if they wpre conferring a special favor on campaign managers by going to the registration places and calling their names. It requires constant drumming and indefat'gable work to get men to register. They think that if a President is not to be elected there is no need of their walking around from their bouse before going to their work and registering. Yet after election when an ordinance or law is euacted which is obviously against the best interest of the com- mnnity these voters who forget or neglect to register are the first to rail against rotten politics and dishonest officials." nttsburg Commercial Ga zette. is To Shoveling Snow. Persons who have lame backs from shoveling snow from their sidowalks may be interested In a rocent decision by Chief Justice Blodgett, of New Hamp shire. In the case of the Commonwealth versus Jack man he held that it in in con travention of the 14th amendment of the United States constitution for a munici pality to pass a Jaw requiring household ers to shovel snow troni the sidewalks in front of their bonnes. The amendment quoted by the learned justice reads: "No State shall make or enforce a law which shall abridge the privileges or immuni ties of citizens of the United States." Justice Biodgett holds that as a sidewalk is part of a public street, municipalities cannot impose on any citizen the duty of keeping it clear of obstructions, and have no power to fine him for refusing to do so. But don't throw away your snow shovel on account of this. New Hamp shire decisions are not binding in Penn sylvania, though they are sometimes comforting. Pittsburg Aeits. So far as the shoveling goes it looks like good common sense if the sidewalks are p part of tho public streets. Hut ad mitting that, thmi a property owner can not be compelled to build or keep in ro pair the sidewalk in front ol'his property. Arid right here developes the best com mon sense. The sidewalk is as much a public thorolare as the middle of tha street, and is dedicated to and used by the public. In one portion of a town walks are laid, in another they are not. In one portion of a town walks are kept in good repair. In another they are not In other words one proporty holder is compelled to do what another is not. If the snow shoveling decision is good law, the further contention certainly is. And we hope the time will come when a mu nicipality will have to construct and care for the walks on the sides of the streets the same as it does for the street itself. Ex.

What is the use of making a better ar ticle than your competitor if you cannot get a belter price for it? Ans. As there is no difference in the price the public will buy only the better, so that while our profits may be smaller on a single sale they will be much great er in the aggregate. How can yon iet tho public to know your make is the best? If both articles are brought prominent ly before the public both are certain to be tried and tho public will very quickly Cass judgment on them and use only the etter one. This explains tho large sale on Cham berlain's Cough Remedy. Tho people Iibvo been using it for years and have found that it can always be depended up on. They may occasionally take up with some fashionable novelty put forth with exaggerated claims, but are certain to re turn the remedy that they know to be re 1. able, and for coughs, colds and croup there is nothing equal to Chamberlain's Cough Romody.
