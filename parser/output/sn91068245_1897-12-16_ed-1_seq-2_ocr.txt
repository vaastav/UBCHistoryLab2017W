His position on the Cuban question in tiumiliating toray the leant. He pleaded for Spain, and aked thin country to gif e that cr uel people more time to murder and crush, if possible, the Cuban patriot". Kigliteen months ago the national Republican Conven tion declared that Spain had lost con trol of Cuba and that it was the duty of our government to exert itself to re store peace and to give independence to the Island. To-day he denies the truth of what his convention declared over a Tear and a halt ago, and asks this government to wait and give SDain time. In order to contrast sharply the difference between the ut terances of his party when it wanted votes, and the utterances of the Tresi dent, now that he Is elected, and has the power to carry out his promises, we quote the following paragraph from the National Republican platform on which McKlnley was elected : "The government of Spain having last control of Cuba, and being unable t protect the property or lives of res ident American citizens, or to comply with its treaty obligations, we believe tiat the government of the United H tes should actively use its influence and good otllces to restore peace and give independence to the island. Mr. McKlnley, in his speech of ac ceptance on June 29,18!J said : HThe platform adopted by the Na tlonal Republican Convention has re reived my careful consideration and has my untialifld approval." On December , 1S!7, the President in his annual message to Congress, aid: It Is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to prove the ettlcacy of the t ew order of things to which she stands irrevo cably committed." Why has the President chaDged front? Why shall we wait now when the blood-shed, starvation, and misery in Cuba are greater than they were when the natknal platform was adopt edf The whole thing is shocking and disgraceful. 'The President makes a long argu- for the Kansas Pacific line, or else bid In the road as government property. He also admits that be has the author ity under existing law to bid in the property, but aks the advice and di rection of Congress about the matter. TLe q'lesfion arises, why did not the Pretident ask tbe advice of Congress about bidding in the Union Pacific, and why was h so anxious to sell that piece of property before Congress met? Hp must have known, as all men in formed on the ubject know that when the syndicate bad bought the Union Pacific that then they would not pay the amount of the government's claim on either the Central Pacific or the Kansas l'aciflj branches. He mint al-o know that if the gov ernment bid in these branches that in i-rder to operate them as a government railroad and have a tfirmirh line a r m the continent to compete with ther through lines and give a fair tent of government owner ship that it is absolutely iiecetsary for the government to bave the Union PacihV, the very road he so hastily sold bef.re Congrees met. This whole miserable business transaction, not to sat shady all'dir, hbuuld b- thoroughly ventilated by Congress The above are the chief points in the mesnage. J lie remainder is emooiu flowing words with very iittle mean ing. i ortoiKiE.orioiRir. X subscriber of The Caucasian in a letter to Senator Rutler.referring to the desperate efforts of certain Democrat- c papers to misrepresent his speech es, and especially his speech at Rocky Mount, asks a very significant and far-reaching question. We quote : "You certainly bave been consistent in your tight against the gold stand ard and monopolies and in your fight at the same time for free silver and transportation reform since you were elected to the United States Senate in lS!M)and introduced and passed the Railroad Commission law, and since you refused to support Cleveland in 1892 unless his position on the silver question was right and fair up to the time when you supported Bryan, the candidate of another party, because he was right on these questions, and down to the present time, no one, not even your bitterest enemies, has been able to question your sincerety and consistency, though you bave been put to the severest tests. Now vrhat I want you to explain is why certain newspapers that claim to stand on these questions just as you do, do not use their adjectives ana venon against the goldbugs, monopolies, and railroad tools, but instead use it against you? I think I know, but I would like to see you explain this in jour paper. Of course 1 do not ex pect anything but abuse and misrep resentation from North Carolina pa pers which are so rotten as to advo cate the gold standard and defend the allied monopolies." Yes, our correspondent no doubt knows, and the majority of the people are fast finding cut. truth in a nut-shell is that these so called silver papers are not sincerely and honestly with us on these ques tions. Hour correspondent will re fleet he will remember that nearly everyone of these papers abused and denounced us as an enemy of the State when we were fighting for the Railroad Commission In 1891; nearly mer when we proposed for all tbe supporters of Bryan to join io electing an anti-monopoly leg islature. Tbey have refnaed again. In fact tbemakir gef tbe proposition seems to offend them and tbey began to abuse and misrepresent and lie on us worse t ian ever. Why t Becane our proposition bad expoed tbeir inin cerity and hypocray. It exposed to tbe masses of tbe voters tbe cold ugly fart that tbey were raisir g the ne gro domination cry, not honestly, but for au ulterior purpose. It exposed the fact that thefe hypocrites (wLile loudly claiming to be for for silver and against monopoly) were arranging to make a fusion with the Cleveland gold bugs and turn tbe next legislatureovtr to tbe railroads. If the railroals can capture the next legislature it means over Ave uiiliico dollars (in the i.ext two years; in their pockets, and of course they would spend over two or three million dollars if necessary in hiring newcp 'pej-s and politicians to work for them. In order to have any chance to work this con spiracy against the people it was nec essary to raise the negro cry and make appeals to race prejudice. They hoped by appeals to our prejudice to so fright en us if possible that We would be more afraid of the poor ignorant negro than we were of the rich and powerful cor porations who bave robbed ua for thir ty years until we are poor and tbey are milliona;res. Here is tbe whole black and infa mous conspiracy, l no-e who are work ing it are responsible for the business stagnation we are now suffering. They have been parties to fastening tbe gold standard upon as, they have been par ties to granting the special privileges to monopolies by which they have op pressed and robbed us; they are re sponsible for five cent cotton and hard times. Of cou'se they denounce Senator Butler. Of course, of course. . . a aaaaaaa to be hoped that it paaMg lathe Sen I Am the Repoblicao Bgrvtsaiea rniTII Uli.JU.JJ IJtWd. ate can be prevented.

Ube Union Trade Review published at Cleveland, Ohio, which is a strong supporter of Hacna and McKinley, says editorially : The impatient, oftimea sneering, "Is this prosperity?" which accompanies newspaper announcements of reduc tions iu wages, indicates that there are many who utterly fail to appreciate tbe conditions under which "prosper ity" of whatever proportions it may prove to be, will come to this country.

Prosperity then meant loth higher wages and steadier employment blessings assured by tbe Republican policy of protection. Now, according to the Hanna organ, it sim ply means more labor for less money. The coal miners and other laborers are now learning this by bitter exper ence. They voted for "McKinley and prosperity." Tbey now understand that tbe Mc Kinley brand of prosperity is solely for tbe consumption of tbe piutccrats wbo paid tbe expenses of his campaign. THE CKIMK Or TELLING A IKl'IH, Lord Charles Beresford has set all the flunkies and snobs and dollar mark aristocrats of England to bowling and barking at bis heels. In a speech a tew days since, in which he discuss, ed tbe dangers that threatened the lib erties of the Ingush people and in which he laid special stress upon the fact that tbe greatest danger to the people was from the domination of the money power, he used a few sentences which bave been taken up, twisted, and lied about by all those who were hit by bis speech and who were unable to answer tbe facts and arguments which it contained. For some time he has contended for a number of reforms in the interest of better government Those who are profiting by the eviU which be denounced were unable to The plain gospel answer his arguments, therefore they have been silent. Now they have found an opportunity to attempt to raise prejudice against bim by lying about his speech and pntti' into bis mouth words that he did nut us. and hence tbe whole lying and hireling gang bave begun barking a' his heels. What he did say wa that -! - y the Influence of money tnd in" i alone (no matter whether is canic: honestly if not everyone of these papers were supporting Cleveland and his goldbug or aisgraceiuuy ) was exercising administration as long as he had any greater and greater influence over both otllces to distribute through Ransom, the society and politics of England.

VESTED RIGHTS FRAUD. Governor Pingree, of Michigan, has punctured the Whole vested rights fraud claims set up by the monopo- ista in three eharp pointed sentences. lie says : A franchise is not a contract.
