The decisions do oot de part in any niMnntlnl way from the previous decisions of lite court In con turning and applying this Important statute, but they clarify those dec) slum by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con structlon of the act. Ry the decrees they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of denting with tha capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions sut:get the need and wisdom of additional or stippleuioutul legislation to make It easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of rest efficiency or progress. Ns Change In tha Rule of Decision, Maraly In Its Form of Expression. The statute lu Its first section de clares to bo Illegal "every contract, combination In the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy In restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign notions" and In the second declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where the statute was Invoked to enjoin a transporta tion rate agreement between Inter state railroad companies, it was held that It was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonable at common law, be cause It was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and com binations In restraint of trade, whether reasonable nt common law or not It wits plain from tlie record, however, Hint the contracts complained of in those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable at common law.

In the Stand.nrd Oil and tobacco caaea, therefore, the court lerely adopted tba tests of the com aioo law and In defining exceptions to tba literal application of the statute only substituted for the test of being j incidental or Indirect that of being reasonable, and this without varying j In the sllirhteat the actual scope and .

I court hud originally accepted lu Its eoastrui-tlon tlie rule at common law. tt has been said that the court by In trodiicing luto the construction of the statute common law distinctions has emasculated It This ts obviously un true. By Its Jtidguieut every contrnct and combination In restraint of inter. State trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices ty stifling competition or of establish hig In whole or In part a monopoly of sncli trade is condemned by the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot Instance a case that ought to lie con demned under the statute which Is not brought within Its terms as thus con strtied. The suggestion Is alio made Hint the supreme courtty Its decision In the last two cases tins committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade ts within the terms at the statute. This Is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law Is well understood atd is clearly defined. It does not rest lu tha discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to w hich lu order that It shall be enforcon ble at all It must be incidental. If tt exceed the needs of that contract It Is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at common law to contracts or combinations or con spiracles In restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect WQUld be to stifle competition, to con trol prices or establish monopolies. The courts uevcr assumed power to say that such contracts or combina tion or conspiracies might be lawful if the parties to thorn wero only mod- erate in the use of tho power thus se cured and did not exact from tho fub- lie too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that many theorists and others engaged in business violating the stat ute have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts, but uo court of authority bos ever attempted It Certainly there Is nothing iu the deci sions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of Ju dicial discretion lu enforcing this stfit- ; ute can derive the slightest sanction. FWCce and Effectivenese of 6tatuts a Matter of Growth. j We have been twenty-one yetirs mak ing this statute effective for the pur noses for which It was enacted. The Knight enso was discouraging ana seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev er, the error of that Judgment was cor rected, and only In the last three or four years bus the heavy bnnd of the law been In Id upon the great Illegal combinations Hint have exercised surb an absolute dominion over mnny of our industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought, and a number tiro pend but Juries have felt averse to con victing for Jail sentences and Judges have been most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectable standing In society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory gllll, as tho offense becomes better un tlcrstood and the committing of it par take more of studied and deliberate defiunce of the law we can be confl dent that Juries will convict Indlvidu u!s ami that Jitll seuteuces will be lm posed Tha Remedy In Equity by Oiaaolutlon. In tho Stnndard Oil esse the supreme and circuit courts found the combina tion to be a monopoly of the Interstate business of refining, transporting and marketing petroleum and Its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations, the stock of which was held by a New Jer sey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of tills combination, di rected the transfer and pro rata distri bution by tho New Jersey company of the stock held by It in the thirty-seven corporations to and among its stock holders, and the corporations and indl- Idual defendunu were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and all agreements be- ween the subsidiary corporations tend ing to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. Ia the tobacco case tho court found that the Individual defendants, twenty-nine in number, bad been engaged in a successful effort to acquire com plete dominion over tho manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco In this country and abroad and that this had been done by combinations made with a purjiose and effect to stifle competi tion, control prices and establish a monopoly, not only In the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin foil and lic orice used In Its manufacture and of Its products of cigars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectual the will of the court and end the violation of the stat ute. There was here no single hold ing compsny. as In the case of the Ktandard Oil trust The main company wa the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling and holding company. The plsn adopted to d stray the combination and restore com petition Involved the redlvislon of tbe capital and plants of tha whole trust : between tome of tbe companies con- ; stJtatlng tbe truit and new companies organized for tbe purpose of tbe de cree and made parties to it and num bering, new and old, fourteen.

The former one tin full company Is divided Into two. oua of $S2S,OtiO capltnt and the othef of $100,000. The one snuff company il divided into three companies, one with a capital of $l5,00O,t)00. another with a capital of fS.OuO.000 and a third with a capital of fS.OOO.OOO. Tho licorice companies are two, one with a capital uf $r.,75S.30O and another with a capi tal of f'J.OOO.OOO. There Is also the ItrltlKb-Ainoiienn Tobacco company, a llrltlsh corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $20,000,000, rhe Torto Kican Tobacco company, with a capital of $1,800,000, and tbe corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of $0,000,000. Under this arrangement each of the different kinds of business will be dis tributed between two or more compa nies with n division of the prominent brands In the same tobacco products, so as tp make competition not ouly imssible, but necessary. Thua the snioliltig tobacco business of the coun try ts divided so that the present In dependent companies hove 21.39 per rent, while the American Tobacco com pany will have 33.03 per cent, the Llg gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, tho Lorll lard company 22.82 per cent and the Reynolds company 2.G0 per cent. The stock of tho other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has been Hilton from the defendant American Tobacco company and bas been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different cotnpnnlcs lias now been given voting power which wa denied it under tho old organization. Tbe ratio of the pre ferred stock to tho common wo as 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change In the character of the owner-, khip and control of each company. In tho original suit there were twenty-ulna defendants, who were charged with being tjio conspirators through whom tho Illegal combination acquired and exercised Its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will hold amounts of Btoclc In the various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent a a maximum to 2SV4 per vent as a nilnlinmn, except In the case nf ono small company, the Torto lilcnn Tobacco company. In which they will hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine In- llvlilunl defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock ex cept from each other, and the group1 Is Huts prevented from extending Its con trol during that period. All parties to the suit and the new companies who are made parlies are enjoined perpet ually from In any way effect tug any r-otnblnntlon between any of tho com panies In violation of the stntuto by way of resumption of the old trust Each of the fourteen companies Is en joined from acquiring stock In any of tho others. All these companies are enjoined from having common direc tors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. Six of New Companisa. Objection was made by certain in dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very Ittrge capital In active business and that the settle ment that would be effective to put all on on equality would be a division of the capital and plant of the trust into unnil fractions In amount more near ly equal to that of each of the Inde pendent companies. This contention results from n misunderstanding of the anil trust law and Its purpose. It Is not Intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital In busi ness enterprises In which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when Its purpose Is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and establish ing a monopoly. If we shall nave by the decree defeated these purpose nnd restored comiietltlon between the large units Into which tho capital and plant have been divided we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the stotute. Confiscation Not tha Purpoa of tha Statute. It Is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trnst. Method of punishment by One or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corKirti(lon or by forfeiture of Its goods In transportation are provided, but the proceeding In equity Is a spe cific remedy (o stop the operation of tho trust by Injunction and prevent the future ue of the plant and capital In violation of the statute. t ffectiv.ne i ef Dcr. I venture to say that not In the his tory of Americas law bas a decree more effectlt for such a purpose been entered ly a court than that against the tobacco trust A Circuit Judge Noye said la hi Judgment approving the decree: The extent to which It bas been iictwary to tesr spart this comblna tton snd force It Into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demon strate that the federal anti trust statute I a drastic statute blch accotnpllabe effective remits. n til a so long as tt stand on the statute books touat be1 obeyed and wukb cannot be disobey ed .wltboua Jncurrtaj farresebln pen m Jlaf(cs Light, tlay f V irUIITY i Li UliUMH 1 1 i i 4 i r t iW alties. And, ou I ho other band, the successful reeonat ruction ot this or ganisation should teach that tbe effect of enforcing this statute is not to dn troy, but to reconstruct; not to de molish, but to recreate lu Accordance with tho conditions which the congress bas declared shall exist among the people of the United States." Common Stock Ownsrship. It lias been assumed that (hi pres ent pro rata and common ownership in all these companies by former stock holder of the trust would Insure continuance of the sotno old single con trol of all the companies Into which tbe trust has by decree beeu disinte grated. This is erroneous and Is based upon the assumed lncuVary and Innoc uousness of Judicial Injunctions. The companies are enjoined from co-iera tlnn or combination; they havo differ ent manager, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or many of tbe numerous stockholders, reaching Into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market iaelr number Is so large that such an attempt could not well bo concealed and Its pi lino movers and all lis partic ipants would lie tit once subject to con- tempt proceedings nnd Imprisonment of a suuimnry character. The Itnuiedl ate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by nil tlie com panic under different managers, and then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company ond stagnation by uuotlier. Only n short time will inevltablv lead to a change in ownership of the stock, ns ail oi portunlty for continued co-operation must disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration lu the trust ns a mere change of garments littve not given consideration to tho Inevitable working of the decree nnd understand llttlo tho personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught tho aol etna injunction of a court wlioe object ts made plain by the decree and whose inhibitions ore set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness unexampled In the history of equity Jurisprudence Movement For Repssl of the Anti trust Law. Ilut now that the antl trust net Is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment of the purpose of Its enactment we are met by a cry from many differ ent quartera for Us repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of destructive competi tion between small units and to make impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that nro essential to con tinued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent dei Islons tho supreme court mokes clear Hint there Is noth ing in the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mero big ness of plant organized to secure econ omy in production and a reduction of it cost It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or tbe aggregation of Immenso size ore the stifling of competition, actual ond potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing o monopoly that the statute Is violated. Mero slzo Is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants necessarl ly eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this clltulna lion is In coutrsventlon of tho statute only when the combination Is made for purpose of ending this particular com-petltlon-lu order to secure control of and enhance prices and create a mo nopoly. Lack of Dcfinitanaaa In tha Statute. The complaint Is made of the slat Ute thot It Is not sullklelitly definite In It description of that which Is for bidden to enable business men tu ovoid Its violation. Tho suggestion Is tin); we rtiiiT have n combination of I wo corporation which inny run on fot yeurs ui nl that subsequently the at torney general may conclude that It Was a vloliitton of the statute nnd .that which was supposed by tlie combliii-ra to be Innocent then turns out to be a combination lu violution of the statute The oiiawer to this hypothetical 'ase I that when men attempt to amass such attiiendou capital a will enable tbciu to suppress comiietlU'in. control price and establish a monopoly they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly In oilnd. If what they do is merely for tho purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought Of suppressing competition by uw of tlie bigness of the plant they ore creating, then they rnuriot be convicted at the time the union In made, nor can they be convicted later gillies it haipeii that later on they ronrlude to up press competition nnd take tbe nsnnl method for doing and thus wtab llah for tbcnioetiM monopoly. They can In such case hardly complain If tbe motive whlcb atibwipientiy l d! closed fa attributed by the court to tba original combination Nt ftsmodi.a tuggMtad.

I ventured to point out t lie dlsturlance to business that would probably attend tho dissolution of these offending trims. I sold: "Hut such an Investigation and poi slblo prosecution of corporations wnose prosperity or destruction affect the comfort not only of stockholder, but of millions of wage earners, employees nnd associated tradesmen, must neces sarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to dry up the now Mowing sources of capital from its place i'f hoarding and pro duce a tin It In our present prosperity tliiit will cause suffering and strained t-lri iitiiMtntices among the Innocent many for the fault of the guilty few. The question whlcb I wish In till message to bring clearly to the con sideration aud discussion of congress is whether. In order to avoid such possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these busi ness combinations may be offered a means, without great flunticlni dis turbance, of clinnglng the character, organization and extent of their busi ness Into one ullliln I lie lines of the law under federal control aud super vision, HTttrlug compliance with tbe anti trust xtntute "Generally In the industrial combina tions colled 'trusts' t lio principal bus! lies Is the sale of goods lu many states and lu foreign markets In other words, the Interstate and foreign bualues fur exceeds tlie business done lu any on slute.
