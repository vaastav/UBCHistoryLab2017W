There are prob ably three or four strips of 100 feet or more which we h ave not secured as yet and there is one piece of about Jl-00 feet along the old route where we have not secured the necessary width for the widened trackage. "Work will be started on the build ing ot the line January 1. The route out ot Los Angeles will be started from Hill street.

DIS6HM1IH FREIGHT MIES Witnesses! Before Interstate ommiflee Commission. Urir eWafhT DeSlaffiRailrdtas Favored Large" Corporations PUEBLO. Lee 3 Witnesses before the Interstate commerce commission in session hero today admitted under oath that discrimination in freight' rates is effective in the Pueblo terri tory, particularly regarding coal and coke. The railroad charged vith be ing an offender is the Denver & Rio Grande. The testimony showed a re duction In rates to the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company and American Smelt ing and Refining Company. Under a rapid fire of questions shot merciless ly by S. J. T. Marchand, one ot the attorneys for the commission, witness es admitted that while the freight rate on coal from the Trinidad fields to Pueblo coal deallers Is $1 per ton, the same service costs the smelting com pany but 73 cents per ton, a differ ence of 25 cents, which was unexplain ed and undisputed. The $1 rate is the published tariff applicable to the pnbllc. The smelting company pays $1 per .ton freight on coke from the WalsexAaiirg, Colorado, district, while the published tariff is $2, according to testimony. Coal from Cannon City costs the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company 37.5 cents per ton freight, while the public pays 75 cents per ton. The nominal charge on freight to the Fuel company on certain classes of coal from the Walsenburg district is $1.75 per ton, but the revision clerk of the Rio Grando charges but 56 cents per ton, the evidence developed today, These damaging admissions were from a Rio Grande employe, who said that the cut in the rate to the smelt ing company was made pursuant to a letter received from Fred Wild, Jr., general freight agent of the road, who made it clear that the communi cation was of a confidential nature. The billing clerks were notified of the reductions. There was no effort on the part ot the Rio Grande attorneys present in court today to explain these alleged discriminations. The commission will sit In Denver tomorrow.

GUGGENHEIMS III HELM DISTRICT Have Acquired Control of Up- riop Mining Property for 'Which- They Pa!d206;00pi txtend Purchases..- The American Smelting & Refining Company, the gigantic, corporation fre- quentlj referred to as the ' smelter trust," has entered the Helvetia dis trict. The Tucson Citizen says this com pany, which is controlled by me Gug- genheims, of Denver, multl-miliron-alres, renowned for their keen and un failing choice of good mining proposi tions, has acquired the property of the Tip-Top Mining company. Tho terms of the purcnase call for $75,000 cash and $125,C0Q additional rithin a year. This announcement is the biggest mining news that Pima county has furnished In many years. It indicates the faith which the big mining peo ple have In the future of Pima county in a mining way. It Is stated on good authority that the acquisition of the Tip-Top prop erty by the Guggenhelms Is but the entering wedge to the purchase of all the large properties In the Helvetia district. The Guggenhelms intend later to purchase the Omego, the Lew lson and probably the Helvetia prop erties. The securing of the Tip-Top prop erty, which Includes twenty-five claims, by the American Smelting & Refining Company, marks the culmina tion of negotiations which have been on for several months. The "smelter trust" Is known to be unusually care ful in its selection of mining proper ties, and not once has it been "cold' (decked" on a mining proposition. It is known that this big corporation has turned down a number of properties on which other persons afterwards lost sums running far Into the thou sands. The smelter company has been watching the Tip-Top property for a long time. During the past twelve months this mine has supplial the El Paso smelter with 10,000 tons of sulphide ore, averaging 8 per cent The shipments have always yleldo-l J '" the owners of the mine a handsorua The Tip-Top property is owned by Philadelphia parties.

This com pany, however, ls but a branch of the American Smelting & Refining com pany, which the Guggenhelms control. Although no announcement has yet been made of the plans of the new owners there Is little doubt but that the property will be worked onan ex tensive scale and that it will be made probably the leading mine on the Hel vetia district The Tip-Top mine has been often referred to as one ot the mining prop ositions that paid almost from the grass-roots.

WASHINGTON, Dec 3. The Su preme Court of the United States dis missed today, for want of Jurisdiction, the case ot the New York Foundling Hospital vs. John C. Gattl. This revives tho story of about forty orphan children sent from New York to Arizona in 1904, which at the time received much attention at the hands of the public. Tho effect of the decision, which was delivered by Justice Day. is to leave In effect the decision of the Ari zona Supreme Court, which was fav orable to Gattl. The opinion In the case brought out the fact that in October, 1904. a special car containing forty foundlings from the hospital Intended for the neigh boring towns of Clifton and Morencl, Ariz., arrived at the former place. Tho children were in charge of three sisters of charity, but were turned over to the local priest in pursuance of a request he made to have the chil dren sent out. In that request he had said that re-1 specfable. educated Spanish families desired them for adoption. Theytwere Immediately distributed throughout the two towns, but Instead ot being given to reputable people, as the priest had promised, the American residents of the place charged that the recipients were of the lowest class of half breed Mexicans, and wholly unfit to care for the children of whom they were tp become the foster pa rents. They accordingly organized a mass meeting and appointed committees to devise ways and means, with the re-

Two other men of the same character are probably fatally injured, and three are less seriously wounded. suit that the children were one and all taken bodily from their guardians after remaining with them for only one night, and adopted by Americans. The Arizona courts found much dif ficulty in dealing with the case, but they sustained the course of the citi zens and endorsed their retention of the children. The Sisters of Charity, who had control of the hospital, sought to have the little ones restored to their custody In order that they might take them back to New York. The case acted on today Involved custody of on:y one child, but It had been agreed that the decision In this case should control in all the others. The decision of tho case turned en tirely on the question as to whether tho personal freedom of the children bad been violated, and the court held that such was not the case. Speaking on that point. In the case of William Norton, one of the chil dren. Justice Day said: "There was no attempt illegally to wrest the custo- dy of the child from its lawful guard' Ian while In Arizona. Tho Society voluntarily took the child there with the Intention that it should remain. Through imposition the child was placed In the custody of those unfit to maintain control over it. It was within the Jurisdiction of the court tinder the circumstances that the rival claimants of the right of custody of the child might Invoke a court of com petent Jurisdiction of the territory to determine no the right of freedom, but to which claimant the custody of a child of tender years should be com mitted."
