Te the Congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation'! legisla tive halla of these charged with the duty of making law for the benefit of a generous and free people Impresclvelr suggsits the exact ing obligation and Inexorable responsibility involved in their task. At the threshold of such labor new te'be undertaken by the congress of the United States and In the discharge of an executive duty enjoined by the constitution I submit this communication, containing a brief statement of the oendltlon of our na tional affairs, and recommending such legisla tion as seems tome necessary and expedient. The history of our recent dealings with ether nations, and our peaceful relations with them nt this time, additionally demonstrate the ad ad Tantege of consistently adhering te a Arm but just foreign polley, free from envious or am am am Mtloua'natlenal schemes and characterized by entire honesty and sincerity. The recent death of the cur of Russia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy en the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Russian people As a further demonstration of respect and friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed te represent our government nt the funeral ceremonies. The rules for the prevention e( collisions at sea which were framed by the Maritime con ference held in this city in VSZ9. having been concurrently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and Great Britain, hnve betn announced te take effect March 1, 189V and Invitations hare been extended te all 'ZW maritime notions te adhere te them. Faver- '' able response have thus far been received ., from Austria, France, Portugal, Spain und Sweden.

The total bounty paid upon the production of sugar In the United States for the fiscal year was (1J,1U0.208.89, being an lncrrate of $S,ra. 078.01 ever the payments made during the pre ceding year. The amount of bounty paid from July 1, 1893 te August 2S. 1894, the time when further payments ceased by op eration of law, was I9C0.1U.84. The total ex penses Incurred In the payment of the bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was (130, 140.85. It Is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the receipts of the gov ernment during the eurrent fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, will be $4:4,437,748.44. and Its ex penditures $444,437,748.44. resulting in a deficit of $30,000,000. The first day of November, 1894. the total stock of money of all kinds In the country was 43,240,773,888, as against 2i,5l,000 en the first day of November, 1893, and the money of all kinds in circulation, or net Included in the treasury holdings, was $1,072,093,42, or $34.27 per capita, upon an estimated population of 68,887,000. At the same date there was held in the treasury geld bullion amounting te $44,615,177,(6, and su rer bullion which was purchased at a cost of 1177,779,988. The purchase of silver bullion un der the act of July 14, 1890, ceased en the first day of Nevember, 1893, and up te that time there had been purchased during the fiscal year 11,917,658.78 fine ounces at a coil of $8 715,521.33, an average cost el $0.7313 per fine ounce. The total amount of silver purehased from the time that law took effeet until the repeal or its purchasing clause, en the last date mentioned, was 1 88,674,68 J.5J finu ounces, whlah cost (155, 031,003.15, the average price per fine ounce be ing $0.9344. During the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals In the United State was estimated at 1,739,83$ fine ounces ei geld, of the commercial and coinage value of $35,955,000 and 60,600,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $46,800,000 and of the coinage value of $77,576,000. It Is estimated that en the first day of July, 1894. the atoelc of metallic, money in the United States, consisting el coin and bullion amounted te tl.SSl ,640.958, of which W87,9I0l was geld and $04,347.757 was slher. Fifty national banks were organized during the year ending October 31, 1894, with a capital of 16,285,000, and seventy-nine, with a capital of $10,475,000 went into voluntary liquidation. .? .' Twenty-one Damn, wjw e capum ui ,hv,wi were placed in tne nanas ei receivers, i no iu tal number of national banks in existence en the 31st day of October last, was .1,756, being forty less than en the list day of October, 1893. The capital stock paid In was $673,671 .365, being $9,678,401 less than at the same time in the previous year, and the surplus fund and undivided profits, less expenses and taxes paid, amounted te (484,131,084.10, whieh was $16,080,780 less than e October 31, 1893. The circulation was decreased $4,741,503. The obligations of the banks te each ether were increased $!17,i6,34, and the Individual do de posits were $377,l,4 less than an at the cor responding date In the previous years. Leuns and discounts were $181 ,04,933 mere than at the same time the previous year, and cbeeks and ether cash Items were $90,340,963 mere. The total resources of the banks at the date mentioned amounted te $3,473,933,556, as against $3.109,S63.:$4.34 In 1693. Frem the report el the secretary et war it appears that the strength of the army en September 80. 1894, was 2,1 of ficers and 55,T enlisted men. Al though this Is apparently a very slight de crease compared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been Increased te the eauWalsnt et nearly two reglmenu through the reorganization of the system of recruiting, ae4 the consequent release te regimental duty of the Urge force of men hitherto serving at 'the mwlllng departments. The abolition of tbM Aetttrmsntt, it 1 predlcted.wlll further mere a4hct ta annitnl redaction aprxliat. Ing $350,000 In the direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, taeral and dis cipline of the troops. The execution of the polley of concentrating the army at Important centers et popu lation and transportation, foreshadowed In the last annual report of the sec retary, has reaaltcrt in the abandonment of fifteen of the smaller pests, which was ef fected under a plan which assembles organi zations of the same regiments hitherto widely separated. This renders our small forces mere readily effcctlve for any scrvloe which they may be called upon te perform, Increaties the extent of the territory under protection without diminishing the security heretofore afforded te any locality, Improves the disci pline, training and esptrlt de corps of the army, besides considerably decreasing the cost of Its maintenance. Though the forces et the department et the east have been somewhat lnereased, mere than three-fourths of the army Is still stationed west et the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy, which secures the best and greatest service In the Interests et the general welfare from the small force comprising our regular army, should net be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation et new and unnecessary pens through acts of congress te gratify the ambi tions or Interests of localities. It Is hardly necessary te recall the fact that la obedience te the remmuncls of the constitution and the laws, and for the purpese of protecting the property of the United States, aiding the process et .federal courts and removing lawless obstruc tions te the performance by the government of Ite legitimate functions, It became neces'nry In various localities during the year te employ a considerable portion of the regular troop-, The duty was discharged promptly, courage ously and with marked discretion by the offl effl cers nnd men, and the most gratifying proof was thus afforded that the army deerte that complete confidence in its efficiency ami dis cipline which the country has at nil times manifested. The skill and industry of our ordnance edl- cera and Inventors have, it is believed, over come, the mechanical obstacles which haw heretofore delayed the armament et our coasts, and this great national undertaking upon which we have entered may new proceed an ranldlv as congress shall determine. The total enrollment of the militia of the serernl states Is 1 17.533 officers nnd enlisted men, an Increase of 6,343 ever the number re ported at the close of the previous year. . In recognition of the long and dlBtlngul'hed military services and fuithful dlchnrge of del icate and responsible 'elvll duties by Ma) -Ceil. Jehn M. Schofleld, new the general command ing the army, it Is suggested te congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant-general would be a jUBt and gracious uct, and would permit his retirement new near at hand with rank befitting his merits. The repert of the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme oeurt in overeomlng the arrears of Its business and In reaching a condition in which It will be able te dispose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is, of course vcryltrgely due te the successful working of the plan inaugurating circuit courts of np peils. Other Important topics are adverted te In the report, accompanied by recommendations, many of which have been treated at large In previous messages, and at this time, therefore need only be named. I refer te the abolition et the fee sj stem as a measure of compensation te federal officers; the enlargement of the pow ers of U. S. commissioners, at least in the ter ritories, the allownnce of writs of error in criminal cases en behalt of the United States nnd the establishment of degrees In the crime of murder, The report of the postmaster-general pre sents a comprehensive statement of the opera tions of the pest office department for the last fiscal year. The receipts of the department during the year amounted te $75,080,479.04 and the expendi tures te $81,334,414.15. The transactions of the postal pervlce Indicate with barometric certainty the fluctuations In the business of the coun try. Inasmuch, therefore, as business complications continued te exist throughout the last year te nn unferseen extent it Is net surprising that the deficiency et revenue te meet the expenditures of the pest office de partment, which wad estimated in advance nt about eight million dollars, should be exceed ed by nearly one and a quarter million dollars The po.ttnanter general states that this de ficiency Is unnecessary and might be obviated at once if the law regulating raits upon mall matter of the second elass was modified. The rate received for the transmission of this sec ond class matter Is one cent per pound, while the cost of such transmission te the govern ment Is eight times that amount In the gen eral terms et the law this rate cov ers newspapers and periodicals. The ex tensions of the meaning of these terms from time te time have admitted te the privileges intended for legitimate newspapers and periodicals a surprising range of publica tions and created abuses, the cost of which amount in the aggregate te the total deficiency of the pest office department. Pretended news papers are started by business beused for the mere purpose of advertising goods, complying with the law In form only, and dlsceutlnuln the publication as seen as the period of aaver Using is ever. "Sample copies" of pretended newspapers are Issued in great numbers, for a Hke purpose only. The result is a great less of rovenue te the government besldeH its humiliat ing use as an agency te aid in carrying out the scheme of n business house te advertise Its goods by means et a trick upon both Its rival houses and the regular and legitimate news papers. Paper covered literature, consisting mainly of trashy novels, te the extent of many thousands et tens, is sent through the malls at one cent per pound, while the publishers of standard works arc required te pay eight times that amount in sending their publications. The report shows most gratifying results in the way of economies worked out without af fecting the efficiency of the postal service. These consist In the abrogation of stenmshlt. substdy contracts, reletting et mull transporta tion contracts and In the cost nnd anion nt et supplies used tn the service, amounting In all te ',16,010.047 43. Attention Is called te the report of the t ei-re-tary of the navy, which shows very gratlfy'ng progress In the construction of ships for our new navy. All the vessels new building. In cluding the three torpedo beats authorized at the Inst sosslen of congress and exceptlng the llrst-elass battle-shlp Iowa, will probably be completed during the coming fiscal year. The estimates for the increase et the navy for the year ending June SO, 1890, are large, but they Include practically the entlre sum neces sary te complete and equip all the new ships net new In commission, se that unless new Bhlps are authorized the appropriations for the naval servlce for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 189T, should fall below the esti mates for the coming year by at least $12,000,000. The secretary presents with much earnest ness a plea for the authorization et three ad ditional battle ships and ten or twelve te ped e beats. While the unannered vessels hereto fore authorized, Including these new nenring completion, will constitute a fleet, which It is belleved is sufficient for ordinary cruising pur pose in time of peace. I recommend that prevision be made for the construction of additional battle ships and tor pedo beats. The report of the secretary of the interior exhibits the situation of the numerous and interesting branches of the public service con nected with his department, I commend this report and the valuable recommendations of the secretary te the careful attention of the congress. At the close of the last fiscal year.en the 90th day of June, 1891, there were 969,644 persons en our pension rolls, being a net lnerease of 3,531 evor the number a reported at the end et the previous year. These pensioners may be classified as fol fel lows Soldiers and sailors, survivors of all wars, 753,96$; widows and relatives of deceased soldiers, 115,163; army nurses In the war et the rebellion, 414. Ot these pensioners, 33,039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and ether wars prier te the late civil war, nnd the widows or relatives of such soldiers. The remainder, numbering P37,MMare receiv ing pensions en account of the war of the re bellion, and et these 469,344 are en the rolls un der authority et the act of June 27, 1890, soeae seeae tlnes called the dependent pension law. The total amount expended for ponsleaa durlag the year was $139,801,4(1.05, leaving an unexpended liulanr from the sum appropriated et riMOl, 712.65. The sum necessary te meet pension ex penditures for the year ending June 80, 1896, la estimated at $140,000,000, The secretary of agriculture In his report re views the operations et his department for the last fiscal year, and makes recommendations for the further extentlen of its usefulness. He reports a saving In expenditures during the year of $000,000, which Is covered back Inte the treasury. This sum Is $3 per cent, of the entire appropriation. The scientific Inquiries of the bureau of ani mal industry have progressed steadily during the year. Much tuberculin and mallelnhave been furnished te stata authorities for use in the agricultural colleges and experiment sta tions for the treatment of tuberculosis and glanders. Owing te the peculiar fealty of the stall clan's work, and the natural and oequlred fit ness naeessary te its successful prosecution, the secretary of agriculture expresses the opinion that every person employed tn gather ing statistics under the chief of that division should be admitted te that service only after a thorough, exhaustive, and successful exami nation at the hands of the United States civil service commission. This has led blm te call ler such examination of candidates for the position et assistant statisclans, and also et candidates for chiefs et sections In that di vision. The advantages te the public service et an adherence te the principles of civil service re form are constantly mere apparent, and noth ing is se encouraging te these in official life who honestly desire geed government as the increasing appreciation by our people of these advantages. A vaBt majority of the voters et the land are ready te Insist that the time and attention of these they select te perform for these Important public duties, should net be distracted by doling out miner offices, and they are growing te be unanimous in regurdlng party organization as something that should be used in establishing party principles instead of dictating the distribution et public places us rewards et partisan activity. The president Is convinced that We ought net te be longer without a national beard et health, the national health officer charged with no ether duties than such as pertain te the protection et our country from the Invasion of pestilence and disease, and earnestly recem mends legislation te that end. By virtue et n statute et the United States, passed In 1883, 1 appointed in July last Hen. Jehn D. Kcrnan, of the state of New Yerk, and Hen. Nicholas E. Worthlngten, of the state of Illinois, te form with lien. Carrell D. Wright, commissioner of labor, who was designated by said statute a commission for the purpose of making careful Inquiry Inte the causes of the controversies between cer tain railroads and their empleyes which had resulted In nn extensive and destructive strike, accompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance with considerable less of lite and great destruction of property. The tariff act passed at the last session of the congress needs Important amendments If It Is te be executed effectively and with cer tainty. In addition te such necessary amend ments as will net change rates of duty. I am still ery decidedly In favor of putting coal and Iren upon the free list. Se far as the sugar schedule Is concerned, I would be glad, under existing aggravations te see every particle of differential duty tn favor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the favor se accorded the sugar re fining interest in our tariff laws It still lan guishes te the extent of closed refineries and thousand of dUcharged workmen. It would seem te present a hopeless case for reasonable legislative aid. Whatever else Is done or emitted, I earnestly repeat here the recommendations I have made In another portion of this communication that the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent per pound, laid upon sugar Imported from coun tries paying a bounty en its expert, be abro gated. The president then recounts the necessity of issuing bends te replete the geld reserve, nnd says; Nothing could be worse or further re moved from enslble finance than the relations existing between the currency the government has Issued the geld held ter Its redemption, and the raeuns which must be resorted te for the purpose of replenishing such redemp tion fund when Impaired. Even if the cj'ilms upon this fund were confined te the obliga tions originally Intended, and if the redemp tion of these obligations meant their cancel lation the iund would be very smail. Hut these obligations, when received and redeemed In geld, are net canceled but are re-lssued and may de duty many times by way of drawing geld from the treasury. Thus we have an end less chain in operation constantly depleting the treasury's geld and never near a final rest. As If this was net bad enengh, we have by n statutory declaration tmt it Is the policy of the government te maintain the parity between geld nnd silver, aided the force and momentum et this exhaust ing process and added largely te the currency obligations claiming this peculiar geld redemp tion. Our small geld reserve is thus subject te drain from every side. The demands that In crease our danger also lncrcose the necessity et protecting this reserve against depletion nnd It Is most unsatisfactory te knew that the pro tection afforded Is only a temporary palliation. It is pefectly and papably plain that the only way under present conditions by which this reserve when dangerously depicted can be replenished Is through the Issue and sale of the bends et the gov ernment for geld: and yet congress has net euly thus tar declined te authorize the Issue et bends best suited te such a purpese, but there seems a disposition In some quarters te deny both the necessity and power for the Issue et bends at all. I can net for a moment believe that any et our citizens are deliberately willing thut their government should default In its pecttnlury obligations or that Its financial operations should be reduced te a silver basis. At any rate I should net feel that my duty was done if I emitted any effort 1 could make te avert such a calamity. As long, there fore, as no prevision Is made for the final redemption or the putting aside of the currency obligation new used te repeatedly and constantly draw from the government Its geld and as long as no better authority for bend Issues Is allowed than at present exists sueh authority will be utilized whenever and as often as It becomes necessary te maintain a sufficient geld reserve end In abundant time te save the credit of our country and make geed the financial declarations et our govern ment. Questions relating te our banks and currency are closely connected with the subject Just referred te and they also pre sent some unsatisfactory features. Prominent among them are the lack et elas ticity In our currency circulation nnd Its fre quent concentration tn nnanela! centers when It is mast needed in ether parts et the country. The absolute divorcement et the government from the business of banking Is the Ideal rela tionship of the government te the circulation of the currency of the country. This condition con net be Immediately reached; but as a step In that direction and as a means of scouring a mere olastle currency and obviating ether ob jections te the present arrangement of bunk circulation, the seeretary of the treasury pre sents In his report a scheme modifying present banking laws and providing for the issue of circulating notes by state banks free from tax ation under certain limitations. It is proposed te repeal all laws providing for the deposit et United States bends as security for circulation; te permit national banks te issue circulating notes net exceeding in ameunnt seventy-five per cent, et their paid up and unimpaired capital, provided they deposit with the government, as a guarantee fund, In United States legal tender netes, in cluding treasury notes et 1890, a sum equal la amount te thirty per cent, et the notes they desire te Issue, this deposit te be maintained at all times, but when ever any bank retires any part et its circulation a proportional part of Its guarantee fund shall be returned te It te permit the secretary of the treasury te prepare und keep en hand ready for Issue la case an lnerease in circulation Is desired, blank national bank notes for each bank hav ing circulation, and te repeal the previsions et the present law Imposing limitations nnd re strictions upon banks desiring te reduce or in crease their elroulatlen, thus permitting such Increase or reduction within the limit of seventy-five per cent, et capital te be quickly made ai emergencies arts.
