THE FULTON COUNTY NEWS, McCONNELLSBURO, PA. WILSON'S MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS Senate and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of the President. HE MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS Further Legislation for Settlement and Regulation of Railway Labor Oil putet Held Imperatively Necet ary by the chief Magistrate. Washington, Dec. 5. The senate and house met In Joint session today and hoard President Wilson's message, which was ns follows: Ooutl.'ini'n of the Cointreau: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time Information of the mate of the 1'idoii and recoiium-ndlng to your considera tion such legislative measures as mny be Judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which It seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of lime tin der which you will necessarily act at this session nnd shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which It seems necessary In the interest of the public to do nt once. In the first place. It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration nnd action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session In view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties w lib h then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of t in country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended : First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the hill recently passed by the house of representatives and now nwaitlng action by the senate; in order that the commission may lie enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon It with a prompt ness nnd thoroughness which are. with Its present constitution and means of action, practically iniosslMe. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages In the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged In the work of oper atlng trains In interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults In experience ef the adoption of the eight-hour day In railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the In terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day nnd which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the Increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute whvh provides for the mediation, conciliation, nnd arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to It a provision that. In case the methods of aeconimoilatlon now provided for should fad. a full public Investigation of the mr-K of every such dispute shall be i i -: ; t u t . i and completed before a strike or lo.koiit may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the pow.-r. In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the Cnlted States such train crews and adminis trative otliclals as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress Immediate ly acted on: It established the eight Imur day ns the legal basis of work nnd wages In train service and It au thorized the appointment of n com mission to observe nnd report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; Unusual Experience. "Man." remarked Sandy, "I did a tiling last niclit what I've no dune this twenty year. I went to ma bed palrr fectly sober, but I'm rilit thankful to say I got up tills inoniln' none the waur I" Few Beggar In Panama.

"You can't make a bluff with an nmbrella." "Why not" 'lU'cnuse you must ai'her put f or Rhut up." hut It postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It neces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant an Increuse of rates on the ground re ferred to Is Indisputably clear ami a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission's authority or its Inclination to do Justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the Increase lu the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and In lis facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, nnd the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary In time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have Intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them In such matters would find It hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon tltese grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of uctlon upon them. Not only does the Interstate com merce commission now find It practi cally Impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to lis duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative Instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for liok of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must lie no dmibt as to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of t lie military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. Tills is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrate e elhelency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the Increase In the elll cloney of the Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; Its action n Is only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the .suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue In nn employment which he de sired to leave. To pass u law which forbade or prevented the Individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society In do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I take It for granted we are not prepared to Introduce. I'.ut the proposal that the operation of the railways of (he country shall tit be stopped or Inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public Investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation Is not to propose any such principle. It Is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the In dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint Itself with the merits of the case ns between em ployee and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and oportunlty to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but t lie Justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of Its very life. There Is nothing arbi trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can nnd should be done with a full and scrupu lous retard fo,- the Interests anil liber tics of all concerned as well as for the permanent Interests of society Itself, Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital Importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged In pro moting the foreign Commerce of the country than Is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the luws against monopoly; the hill amending the present organic law of Porto Iticoj and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies In the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delay would seriously Jeopard the Interests of the country nnd of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg- Most FUhermen Have Done It.

Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and w ithout suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the deslr ablllty of giving a freer hand In the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will Immediately assume, has Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented lu our experience. We have not the necessary Instrumen talities for Its prosecution; It Is deemed to he doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear nway all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here nnd may escape u if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Need. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to ltico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the Island and regulating the rights and privileges of Its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in nny essential particular. We ought to do It at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which It Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found nnd action taken upon them. Inasmuch ns this Is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. H has been a privilege to labor In such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servlceableness and distinction. Cut Tree by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of an ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that are to be used as masts In logging operations, dyna mite Is used to shoot off the tops. After the branches have been removed, a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of irons, to the point where It Is neces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk Is usually about 12 Inches In diame ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around the trunk nt this point, Inserts a blasting cap with about JO feet of fuse In one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, and de scends before the explosion tnkes place. The tree top pumps Into the nlr with the explosion and the trunk Is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging In nnd loading the logs. Engineering Record. All He Saw of Battle.

HORSESHIP MARINA Sill BY U-BOAT Germany Makes Admission, But Questions Ships Status. WASHINGTON TO FIND OUT Cay Submarine Commander Took Vestal For Tranport Offera Reparation In Cate Of Mlitake. Washington. Subsequent to the re ceipt of a communication from the German Government admitting that a German submarine torpedoed the Brit ish horseshlp Marina, with the loss of alx Americans, Secretary Lansing con ferred with President Wilson, and It was decided that no action would be taken by the American Government until It was definitely established whether the Marina was a private ves sel or a belligerent transport. In the note Germany stated that the commander of the submarine which tank the Marina bad reported that he took the vessel for a transport, and asked the United States for Informa tion on this point. Count von Bern etorff, the German Ambassador, called at the State Department, and also aought this Information. He was told by Secretary Lansing that the United States was not yet in a position to answer the Inquiry, but would do so as quickly as possible. As a result of the developments of the day It was Indicated by officials that no action could be expected In the lmraedlato future on the Marina case, admittedly one of the two most serious pending between the United State and Germany. The other Is that of Uie British liner Arabic, sunk. In the Mediterranean. Germany, It Is understood, Is ready to acknowledege error and make of fers of settlement, If It is established that the Marina was not in the Brit ish transport service. When the ves sel was sunk It was stated In dis patches from London that she had been previously connected with the transport service, and also that- when sho sailed on her last voyage she was armed with a gun astern, manned by two British naval gunners. If the ship was in public service prior to being torpedoed, some State Department officials take the stand that the presumption was in favor of the position that an enemy might have believed her still to be a transport at the time of the attack. In order to clear up this point the nature of her previous character, the orders under which she was sailing and tie charac ter of her officers and crew will be in vestigated. State Department officials hesitate to make a ruling on what constitutes a vessel In public service In time of war until a decision' has been handed down In the case of the Italian vessel. Attuallta, libeled In the United States court at Newport News, Va., after a collision with a Greek vessel. The point at Issue is somewhat similar to that Involved in the Marina Incident, as the character of the Attuallta Is disputed. Secretary Lansing wont over the case in detail with President Wilson after the call of the German Ambassa dor, but at the time had not examined all the affidavits bearing on tho at tack on file at the State Department. It was Indicated that the American Government will be able to collect all the evidence necessary without fur ther reference to the German Govern ment. 19 

MURDERED, THEY SAY. Survivors Tell X)1 Torpedoing Of the Marina. New York. "Cold-blooded murder, and nothing else," Is the way in which the 41 American survivors' of the Brit ish steamship Marina, just arrived at this port, described the sinking of that vessel without warning by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland on October 28. The men were sent here from Glas gow by the American Embassy on the Anchor Line steamship Tuscanla, Jesse T. Hancock, a printer, of Rich mond, Va., who had acted as -a fore man of horsemen on the Marina, said that the 19 men who were drowned, Including seven Americans, had not the slightest chance for their lives, since the submarine, after firing the first torpedo without any warning, rose to the surface when the 19 were still struggling to lower the vessel's fifth boat in the davits and deliberately fired a second torpedo. With this second shot the Marina blew up and sank like a rock, taking the 19 men with her. AUSTRIA HALTS WAR RELIEF. Want American Red Cross To Stop In Northern Serbia. Washington.

Secretary of Navy Daniels Awards Big Contracts. TOTAL COST OVER $65,000,000 Battleships To Carry 16-Inch Guns. Bids For Four Cruiser To Be Opened Thlt Week. Washington. Secretary Daniels awarded contracts for more than $65, 000,000 worth of new fighting ships for the navy, Including four battleships, at ill, 000,000 each; two fleet submarines, at approximately $1,190,000 each, and 27 coast submarines, at from $094,000 to $G98,O0Q each. These vessels comprise the bulk of the great building program of 66 craft of various types appropriated for by the last session of Congress. Bids for four battle cruisers will be received this week and for three scout cruisers on January 3, with the hope of com pleting the task of getting all the ships under contract within the six months' limit set by Congress. Already the House Naval Commit tee is at work on the 1918 bill, and early in the spring the department must find building facilities for at least three more battleships, one battle cruiser and a proportionate number of other craft remaining In the three-year construction program. The bill to be put through this winter for the navy will carry a total of nearly $400,000,- 000. The new battleships will be sister ships to the California and Tennesseo, now under construction, except that they will be fitted to carry eight 16 Inch rifles Instead of twelve 14-lnch. They will displace about 32,500 tons. The department now is considering plans for the 1918 ships, three In num ber, with indications that they will b of 40,000 tons displacement, carry twelve 16-Inch guns and make 23 to 24 knots an hour Instead of 21 knots, the present battleship standard of the nary. Submarines Big A U-53. The two fleet submarines will be of the so-called 800-ton type and similar In size to the German U-53,' which call ed recently at Newport, R. I., before making a raid on Allied commerce off Nantucket. A third boat of this size will be laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, where the L-8 Is nearing completion. The type Is experimental and for comparison with the 1.300-ton Schley, now being built for the navy, with a required surface speed of 20 knots, against 16 for the 800-ton type. The coast submarines will range be tween 475 and 650 tons, according to designs, being substantially similar to the most recent submerslbles of the L class completed for the navy.

BAD MANNERS VIEW TAKEN U. S. Government Anxious To Have An Ambassador From the Haps burg Monarchy In Wash ington. Washington. Count Tarnowskl, the recently appointed Ambassador of Austria-Hungary to the United States, will reach Washington unimpeded by the British. The attitude of the State De partment toward Gre.t Britain's re fusal of a safe conduct to the Ambas sador leaves no doubt as to the ultimate Issue of the case. The United States Government Is anxious to have an Ambassador from the Hapsburg monarchy In Washington, and, If necessary, a vessel of the United States Navy will be sent to Holland or Denmark to carry Count Tarnowskl through the British blockade. Chance To Back Down. The answer to the communication In regard to Count Tarnowskl will be worded so as to give the British Gov ernment a chance to back down grace fully, but It will be Intimated clearly to Great Britain, through official chan nels, that the United States will not endure a prolonged controversy, but will at once send a cruiser for the Am bassador In case Great Britain con tinues to refuse the necessary safe conduct. The action of the British Govern ment la regarded as a peevish exhibi tion of bad manners rather than as a serious affront t6 the United States, but the State Department is deter mined to put an end to Great Britain's flouting of our desires. Indeed, It Is likely that the note In regard to Count Tarnowskl will be followed shortly by another peremptory note In regard to the passage of the United States mail to Holland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The State eDpartment, is considering the advisability of employ ing cruisers of the navy to carry the mails to and form Denmark. Z't CENT PIECES URGED.

The case of the Mu, sour!, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, selected to test the constitutionality of the Adamson law, was placed on th Supreme Court docket, the lost step i perfection by the government of lu appeal from Federal Judge Hook' de cision holding the law unconstlhj. tlonal. A motion was later presented to set a date for early argument.

In the present tion of arguments to the court, how ever, a stipulation making tho pending case determinative of all other suit may be filed. Unless the Supreme Court gives the Adamson case precedence over many others already assigned for hearing. It Is considered doubtful whether It could be reached much before the mid dle of December, even should the court agree to advance the hearings. There are some forty alroady assigned, many of them Important cases specially ad vanced. Nevertheless It is generally expected that the railroad case will be submitted before the court re cesses for the Christmas holidays on December 22. Nine additional cases were placed on the Supreme Court's call for De cember 4. They were recently passed and now are reassigned. Among them are the 'railway mail pay divisor" cases, Involving railroads' claim of $35,000,000 against the government; an alleged rebating case against tie Lehigh Valley Railroad and cases In volving right of the United Mine Workers and other labor unions to operate in West Virginia, where.
