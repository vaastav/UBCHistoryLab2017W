Louis Harway who sailed with William E. Annis, the afternoon he was shot, testifying at the trial of Thornton Hains said that Annis and himself sailed around an hour before coming Into the float. Harway said: "Annis was in the stern near the tiller. As we approached the float I saw Mr. Roberts and Mr. Birchfleld. Our boat was stopped by Mr. Birch field who took hold of the forestay. I sat over on the center board and let go the jib sheet. I looked up and found a pistol pointed in my face. I thought it was a practical joke. The pistol dropped down and a shot was fired under my left arm. There was a pause and some more shots." "Did you hear anything said?" "Yes. I heard the word 'Annis be fore the shooting. , A little before the shot was fired." "Could you see the man's face who fired the shot." "Yes. He was crouching down, his left hand was against the boom and in his right hand he held a pistol. I could see his face. After the first shot I turned and saw Annis holding his hand over his side, saying, 'Oh, don't: oh, don't; stop.' Then came more shots. I got up and went out of the boat and heard more shots. As I step ped from the boat I saw Birchfleld and Mrs. Annis on the float. I saw Thorn ton J. Hains on the float about four or five feet from Annis's boat. As I came off the defendant was facing the dock, swinging his revolver from side to side at a crowd of people. As I stepped from the boat Captain Hains was still firing shots. I heard Thorn ton Hains say, 'Stand back! Stand back! As I walked by the pistol was pointed at me." Mrs. Hains on Hand. New York, Dec. 22. It was report ed here today that Mrs. Claudia Hains, wife of Captain Peter C.

HANDCUFFED IN PAIRS. Senator Charles Curtis arrived at his home in Topeka today direct from Washington and will remain here un til New Year's day. Speaking of tariff revision, the auestion now uppermost in the minds of a large majority of Kansans, the -senator said: "There is sure to be a tariff revision measure passed at the special session early in the spring. It will be an honest and fair revision of the tariff, too, in spite of any re ports sent out from Washington that may imply any doubt in the matter. The general sentiment in both branches of congress is overwhelm ing for tariff revision along the lines promised in the Republican national platform. It will be as-fair and just as possible to all interests, but it will be honest revision, you may count on that. "There is not much to give out in the way of news at this time. The real business of the present session will not get under way until after the holiday recess. Later I will be glad to write my opinion on ceftain matters to the State Journal when to.- do so now would be premature." - Senator Curtis smiled when asked about the reception of the president's messages in the senate '. "The news papers needed the news," he said, "and they must have created some of that "hostile sentiment. "Senator Cummins of Iowa was the only new member sworn in at this term and he ia doing what all the new ones do at first, walking around to get acquainted." Senator Curtis is in the best of health and spirits and is looking for ward to a very pleasant Christmas with his family and friends . here in Topeka.

In the night rider cases the prisoners were brought into court handcuffed in pairs with a detail of two soldiers for each pair. The soldiers with rifles, halted at the court room door and other soldiers armed with revolvers met the prison ers at the threshold and escorted them to the bar. Judge Shaw was the first witness. He was the proprietor of a store near Reel foot lake. The riders forced him to give them oil to pour on the fish docks when they were burned and later whipped him when he tried to go before the grand jury. Shaw said the night riders wore mother hubbards and black masks and tried to disguise their voices by talking in falsetto tones. When Shaw was- summoned before the grand jury he tried to slip into town at night. The riders caught him and threatened to kill him. Finally they gave him his choice of a switching or hanging. He told them he was not anxious to 'en-; dure either, but if he had to make a choice he would prefer the whipping. He got it. After the riders whipped him they told him to run. "Did you run?" inquired the court. "You oughter have seen me," re torted the witness. Martin Leonard, another farmer near Reelfoot lake, was visited by the riders and given five days to move un der penalty of being hanged. Asked if he moved he casually observed that he was still alive but his homo was burned. , Witness after witness told of visita tions by the riders, but there was no identification and no effort made to connect the riders with the murder of Captain Rankin. A Mrs. Leonard was asked how many there were in the band which visited her. "About 200. I reckon, the woods were full of them," she replied. The purpose of the state is show the reign of ' terror in the Reelfoot dis trict inaugurated by. the riders and to prove that the murder of Captain Rankin was only an instance of a gi gantic conspiracy.

Frick has fig ured largely in the testimony regard ing the cost of production of steel, Mr. Frick may be subpoenaed by the com mittee.

Pier pont Morgan come before It and give any information he may have regard ing the alleged international agree ment of steel manufacturers here and abroad.

The cob is practically eliminated, being merely a. stalk on which the in dividual kernels grow. The supposition is that the corn is something like the old primitive corn from which all of our- pure breeds have originated'. ' Jn this early ; form the corn grew on the tassel with each kernel inclosed in an individual husk of its own, but the ears were very small and inferior. The new cobless corn has some very interesting characteristics which the breeder does not care to disclose at the present time as it -is in the ex perimental stage. It is claimed for this corn that when perfected it will enable, the farmer to realize a greater production in quality-and quantity than at present. - Doors Opened to French Peas. Washington, Dee. 22.

It is expected that he will continue to be a member of the board of directors. have just been completed and the of ficial announcement that a new bridge would be built was made from -the of fice of the general manager today. The plans for the new bridge do not specify the height of the new bridge above the present level. It was origin ally intended to raise the new bridge two feet in order to allow an unob structed flow of the water. But since this was decided upon the North To peka . drainage board has commenced the work on the new dikes, and the people on the south side have talked over plans. The government engineers in their reports have stated that it would be necessary to raise both rail road bridges at this point. The, Santa Fe officials will confer with the various drainage officials before the height of the bridge is determined. "We will ar rive at some understanding before the bridge is rebuilt," said one of the Santa Fe officials this morning, "and we ex pect. no trouble in the matter." All the material for use in the new bridge has been ordered and is ex pected to be delivered by the first of February. The new bridge is necessitated on account of the heavier engines which the Santa Fe is using at the present time. The present structure was built about twenty-five or thirty years ago. when the line to Atchison was first built. In those days the engines in use were very light, but the bridge at that time was considered heavy enough for traffic of the heaviest kind. The new bridge will be heavy enough to permit of the heaviest traffic. This branch which now extends to St. Jo seph carries a lot of traffic to St. Jo seph, ail of the livestoek business 'of this section .being dotoured over that line. ,Only the light freight engines can now bo used to pull long trains and frequently engines have to double head in order to haul the traffic. The new bridge wfll be of the stan dard weight and size in use on" the va rious railroads of the country at the present time. It will be a modern and up-to-date structure, which will be Every Winter Just about this near Christmas and after all the early shoppers have selected Bath Robes and Smoking Jackets and put up $3 to $10 each for them, it is customary for strictly one-price cloth iers, especially in Topeka, to break loose with a sensational advertisement about $5 and $6 Smok ing Jackets reduced to $2.95 and $10 Robes and - Jackets all marked down to $4.95; - .
