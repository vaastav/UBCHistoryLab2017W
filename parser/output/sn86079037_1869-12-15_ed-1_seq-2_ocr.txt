PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. To the Senate and IIou.se of Representatives: In (joining before you for the first time iu Chiof Magistrate of this great nation, it in with Krtititudo to tbe Giver of nil Rood for tkn mauv benefits we euioy, We ere blenseil with peace at home.niid are without eiiWntjliiig alliuDcea abroad to foroboilo trouble, with a territory uuHurnasaeil ia fer tility, of iu area equal to the abundant sup port of five hundred millions of people, nud abounding ia evory variety of use ful mineral ia quantity sufficient to supply the world for generations, with exuberant crops and vith a variety of oliniRta adapted to the production of every specie of earth's riches, and snitod to the habits, tastes and rqnirmenU of every living thing; with o population of forty millions of free people, all spoaking onelanguafio; with facilities for every uior tul to acquire an ediioation; with institu tions closing to none the avonues to fame, or any blessing or fortune that may be cov eted; with freedom of the pulpit, the press, and the school; with a revenue flowing into the national treasury beyond the requirements of Govurnoient sup ply. Uurinony is being rapidly restored within our own borders. Maun. fiictiiris hitherto unknown in our country are springing up inalldireotioDH.producing a degree of national independence une qualed by t iat of any other power. These blowings, and countless others, are in trusted to your care, and more for enfe keeping for the brief period of our tenure of ollice. In a Bhort time we must each ot us return to tbe ranks of the people, who have conferred upon us our honors, aud account to them lor our stewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you nrr I may be condemned by a free and enlightened constituency, nor by our own con science. Emorgiug from a re bellion ot gigantic magnitude, aided as it was by tbe sympathy and as sistance ot nations with which we were at peace, eleven Stiitos ol the Union wore four 'years ago loft without legal state governments; a debt had been contracted; American commerce was almost driven from the seas; the industry of one-half the country had been taken from the oon- trol of the capitalist aud placed where all labor rightfully belongs, in tho keeping of the laborer. The work of restoring the state governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering froe labor and providing means for paying interest on the public dubt has ree'd ample attention from Congress; although your efforts havo not met wiili the success, in all particulars, that might have been desired, yet on the whole they have boon more successful than could have beeu reasonably anticipated. Seven states which passed ordinances of secession havo been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, Georgia, held an election, at which she ratified hor consti tution, republican in form, eleeted a gov ernor, members of Congress, a state legis lature and all otlipr ollicers required. ihe governor was dully iuRUlled aud the legis lature met ami performed all the acts therein reauired of them by the reconstruction acts of Congress. Subse quently, however, ia violation of the coa- btitutiou which they had 31M ratmei, as nines decided by the Supreme Court ot the state, they unseated tie colored members of tho legislature, aud admitted to seats some members who are disqualified bv the third clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution, an article which tliey themselves had contributed to ratily, Uu der these circumstances, I would submit to you whether it would not be wise without delay to enact a law authorizing trie gover nor of Oeoria to convene the members originally elected, requiring each member to take the oath prescribed by tho reconstruct m act, and none to bo admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amendment. The freednieu under the protection which they have re ceiveil are making rapid progress in learn ing, mid no complaints are heard for lack of industry on their part, when they re oeivo fair rouiunuration for tuoir labor. The meruit, provided for payiuj the in terest 011 the public debt with till other expenses of tho Government are more thin ample. The loss of our com merce is tho only result of the lute rebel lion which has not received snlfloient at teutiou from yoa. To this subject I call your earnest attention. I will not now sug gest plans by which this object may be ef tected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject of a special message during the soNgioii of Congress. At the March term Congress, by joint resolution, authorized the executive to or dor an election in the states of Virginia, Mississippi and Texi, to submit to them the constitutions which each had previous ly in convention framed and submitted, the Constitution, either entire or in separate parts, to be voted upon, at the discretion of the Executive. Under this authority, elections were called. In Virginia the elec tion took place on the Cth of July, 18C!i. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor elected have been installed. The Legisla ture met and did all required by this reso lution and by all the reconstruction acts of Congiess, and abstoined from nil doubtful authority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be recognized, and that the staU be ful'y restored to its place in tbefamily of states. Electionswerecallod in MissisNippi and Texas, to cnmaieno on the JJOth of November, 10G9, and to last two days iu Mississippi and four days in Texas. The elections have token place, but the result is not known, It is to be hoped that the acts of the Legislators of these states, when they meet, will be such as to roceive your approval, and thus close the work of reconstruction. Among the evils crowing ont of the re' bollion, and not yet referred to, is that of an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which, I hope, will receive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, and ono of the highest duties, ol the Government to Bflcore to the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying val ue, This implies a return to a specie basis, and no substitute for it can be dtmed. It should bo commencod now, and reached at the earliest practicable mo ment, consistent with a lair regard to tho interest of the debtor class, Immediate re sumption, if practicable, would not be de nimble. It would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts tho premium of gold at the date of thoir purchaso, and would bring bankruptcy and ' ruin to thoumnls. Fluctuations, howover, in the paper valuo of tho measure of all values, gold, is detrimental to the in terests of trade; it makes a man ofbusi 11 ess an involuntary gambler, for in all KftlflS when future payment is to be made, both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the currency to bo paid and reueiv d. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation as will insure a grad ual return to specio payments, and put an immmlitite stop to fluctuations in the value ol currency, The methods to Hucnro these results are as numerous as the speculations on political economy. To saanro Die latter I boo but ono way, and that is, to authorize the treasury to ruder-mitsown paper at a llx')d price whenever presented; to withhold trom circulation alt such cur rency redoouaed until sold again for gold; the vast resources ol the nation, both de veloped mid undeveloped, ought to tnaka our credit the het on earth, with a less burden of taxation than the citiznn has en dured for nix years past, tho pntire pnblio debt could bn paid in ten ye us. Rut it ii not desirable that people should not be taxed to pay it In that time; year by year, the ability to pay increases in 0 rapid ratio, but the burden of Interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can bn done wttliont tlw viola tion of contract. The pnllia debt is rep resented in great part by bonds having Ironi live to ten and from ten to forty years to run, bearing Interest at the rate of six per cent, and Ave per cent, respectively. It is optional with - the Gorerninmit to. pay, their bonds at any I period af ter , the ' expiratitm of the least tirne mentioned upon their Ihco. The time has expired when a great part of thcin may be taken, and the time 1h rapidly approaching whon all may he. It is believed that all which are now Jua may lo"replaood by bonds bearing a rate of interest not ex ceeding four aud a half per oent , and that as rapidly as the remainder become due they may ba Toplaood in some way. To aooomplish thl t it may become neces sary to authorize interest to be, paid at eitbor of the three or four monoy centers of Europe, or by the Assistant Treasurer of the United States, at the option of the holder of the bond. I snggestthis subject for the consideration of Congress; also, simultaneously with this, the propriety cf redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its market value, at the time a law goes into effect increasing tho rote at which the currency will be bought and sold, from day to day, or week to weekt at the same rate of interest as the government pays upon its bonds. Tho subjeot of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention. Tho revenues of the oountry are greater than the requirements, and may with safety be reduced, but as the funding of the debt iu a four or a four and a half par cent, would reduce the annual ourreut expense lurgely; thus after fund ing and justifying a grealer reduction of taxation than would be now expedient, I suggest a uostpoaemenb of this question until the next inoetiug of Congress whon it may be advisable to modify taxation and the tivriff in instances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but a generul revision of the laws regulating the subjeot, I re commend the postponement of for the present. I ako suggest tho renewal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduced rato, say of 3 per cent. ; this tax to expuo in three years with the funding ot the national debt as hero suggested. I feel safe in saying the taxes and revenue trom imports may be reduced safely from (it) to BO millions per an num at once and still further reduction from year to year as the resources of the country are developed. The report of the secretary or tne treas nry shows the receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18(19, to be 370,913,347 dollars, aud the expenditures including interest, bounties, Ao , to be 321,'W0,5!)7 dollars. The estimates for the ensuing year are more tavorable to the Gov ernuieut, and will, uo donbt.showfi large de crease ol the publio debt. The receipts in the Treasury beyond expenditures have exceed ed the amount neoessary tobeplaood to the oredit ot the sinking fund as provided by law. To lock up the surplus in the Treas ury and withhold it from circulation, would lead to such contraction of the currency as to cripple trado and seriously affect the prosperity of the country. Under these circumstances, tne secretary or tne ireas ury and myself heartily concurred in the propriety of rising all the surplus currency iu me xrennury in me iiure;uMgu ui uui- eminent bonds, thus reducing the intorest- beuring debt of the country, aud of sub mittiim to Congress the question of the disposition to be made of the bonds purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amouut to about $75,000,000 including thone belonging to the sinking fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund. Your attention is resuectlully invited to the rocomincndntions ot tho Secretary of the Treasury for the creation of the oflbo Counuishionor of Customs aud Kevenue, for the increase ot salary to certain of ficials, and the (substitution of increased National Bank circulation, to replace the outstanding 3 per cent, certificates, and most especially to his recommendation for tbe repeal of the laws allowing shares fines, penalties, forfeitures, Ac., to officers of the tiovcrument, or to inf-iruiers. The office of Commissioner . of Internal Revenue is one of tbe most arduous and respruHillo under the Government; it falls but little if any short of a Cabinet position iu its importance and responsibilities. would ask for it, therefore, such legislation as in your judgment will place tho ollice a footing ot'.dinity commensurate with importance and with a character aud email. ncations of tho class of men required to it properly. As the United States is the freest of all nations, so too people sympathize with all peoples strug. gling for liberty and solf-government; but while so sympathizing, it is due to our honor Hint we nhould abstain from enforc. inp; our views upon unwilling nations, and from taking an interested pint, without in vitation, iu the quarrels between different nations or between governments arid their subjects. Our course should always be conformity with strict justice and law, in Urnalional nud losnl. Much has boen the policy of the administration in dealing with those questions for more than a year, A valuable province of spam, and a near neighbor of ours, in whom nil our people cannot but feel a deep interest, has been struggling for indepence and freedom. The people and government of the United States entertain the same warm faelings and sympathies for the people of Cuba thoir pendirg struggle that they manifest ed throughout the previous struggles be tween Spain and tne tormer colonies in be half of tho latter, but the contest at no time assumed the conditions which amount to a war in the sense of internation al law, or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insurgents suihoiont to jiiBtity a recogni' tion of belligerency. The principle maintained that this nat on its own judge when to accord tho right belligerency, either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government they believe to be oppressive, or to independent nations at war with each other. The Unit ed States have no disposition to interfere with the existing re I aliens of Spain to her colonial posses ions oa this continent, They believe that in due time Spain and other European powers will find it to their Interest to terminate tliose rotations and es tablish their present dependendencies independent powers, members of the family of nations. Those dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one Euronenn cower to ansther. When the present relatione of the colonics cease they are to become indepen tent powers, ex ercising the right of choice and of self- control in the determination of their future condition and relations with other powers. The United States, in order to put astop bloodshed iu Cuba and in tho interest of a neighboring people, proposed their good offices to bring the existing content to a termination. ' The offer not being accepted by Spain, on a basis which o belcived conld bo received by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped that the good of fices of the United Slutes may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this nnhappy strife. Meanwhile a number illegal expedition! against Cuba have been broken up. . It has been the endeavor the Administration to execute the neutral ity laws in good fiiith, no- matter how un pleasant the task, made bo by the suffering we nave endured trom luck or like good faith towards us by other na tions. The UniUd Slates . schoon er Lizzie Major was. arrested on the high seas by a Spauish frigate and two passengms taken from it and canned as prisoners to Cuba. Representations of these tnctH were lmuie to the Spanish Gov ernment, as soon m official information of them pwihed Washington. The two pas sengers were sot at liberty, and the Spanish Government assured the United Statts that the captain of the frigate in making the cuplnro bad acti-dwitho t law; that be had been reprimanded for the irregularity ot his conduct, and that tile fSnnnith authori ties in cntin, would not (auction any act mat count violate nunts or tritle with the sovereignty of thin notion. ' ine question of tbe seizure of the brig Mary LowulLat one ol the Bahama Islands by the Spanish aathoiitiosi, is now the subject of correspondence between : this Government mid those of Spain and Great Britain. The Captain-General of Cuba. about May last, issued a proclamation au- tuonzuig fcoarcij to be made of vessels on the high Wios. Immediate' remonstrance was mailo against this, whenehnon tha Captain-General issued a new proclamation limiting the' right of search of vessels of thu United nUtoN, so fur ns authorised un der flie treaty of 1701. -ThM proclamation waf however, ".finrrlocliatoly withdrawn. biiv always felt tbat'.the tt'iost Intimate re lation should be cultivated between the ropublio of the United States and all inde of of I 011 its till its in in is is of as to of of I pendent nations on this continent, and . .. if - may -'-he -'-- well'" Vtfrlh considering whether new treaties between the United States and them may not be profitably entered into, to secure more in timate relations, friendly, commercial and otherwise. The subjeot of an intor-ooeanio canal to oonnoot the Atlantlo and Pacillo oceauB through tha Isthmus ot Daricn is one ia which commerce is greatly interested. . In structions have been given to our Minister to tho Itepublio of the Unitod Statos of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey by this government in order to determine tbe practicability ot such an un dertaking, and a eharter for tho right of way to build by private enterprise suoh a work, if tha survey proves it to be prntio able. In order to oomply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed com mission at Lima for the adjustment of claims, it became necessary to send a com missioner and secretary to Lima iu August last. No appropriation having been made by Congress for this purpose, it is now aisked that one be made covering the past and future expenses of the oommission. The good ofBoes of the United States to bring about a peace between Spain and the South American republics, with which she is at war, having beeu acoepted by Spain, Feru and Chili, a congress has beeu invi ted to be held in Washington during tho present winter. A grant has been given to Europeans of an exolusive right of transit ove: the torritoiy of Nicaragua to which Costa Rica has given its assent, which it is alleged conflicts with vested rights of citizens of the Uuited States. The depr.rtment of state has now this sub jeot under consideration. The minister of Peru having maJa representations that there was a (state of war batweeu Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing in aud near New York thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in suoua way ns to relieve the naval force at Cuba, so as to op erate against Peru, orders were given to prevent their doparture. Wo runner steps having been taken by the representative ol the Peruvian government to prevent the departure of these vessels, and I not feeling authorized to detain the properly of a nation with which we are at peace on a more Executive order, the matter has been referred to the courts to decide. The conduot of the war between the allies and the republio of Paraguay has made tne intercourse with that country so difficult that it has been advisable to with draw our representative from there. Towards the close of the instaiiministra- tion a convention was signed at Loudon for the settlement of all outstanding claims be tween Great Britain and the United States, which failed to receive the advice and con sent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attending the negotiation of the treaty were favorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States, and its pro visions were wholly inadequate for the set tlement of the grave wrongs that had boen sustained by this government, as well as by its citizens The injuries resulting to the United States by reason of tho course adonUd by Great Britain during our late civil war, in increased rates of insurance, in the diminution of exports and imports, and other obstructions to domestic industry and production, in its effoct upou the for eign commerce of tho conntry, iu the do crease end transfer to Great BiiUtia of our commercial mariue, in the prolongation of the wax and increased cost both iu treasure treasure, and in lives, of its suppression, could not be adjusted and sntistled as ordi nary commercial claims, which continually arise between commercial "notions, and yet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary cluims, from which they differ more widely iu the gravity of their charac ter than in the' magnitude of their amount. Grent,even,as is that difference, not a word was tound in the treaty, and not an inter ence could be drrwu lroin it, to remove the sense of the unfriendliness of the courso of Great Britain in our struggle for existence, which had .universally impressed itself upon the people of this country. Believing that the convention thus misconceived in its scope and made quite liberal in its pro visions) would not have produced the hear ty ud cordial settlement of pending ques tions which alone is consistent with the relations which I desire to have establish ed between the United States and Great Britain, I regarded the notion of the Sen ate in the rejection of the treaty to have been wisely taken in the interest of peace, and a necessary stop in tho direction of a perfect aud cordial friendship between the two countries. A sensitive people, con scious of their power, are more ut ease un der a great wrong wholly unatoned than under restraint of a settlement which satis fies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustained. The rejeotion oi Ihe treoty was followed by a state of public feeling on both sides, which I thought not favorable to an immediate at tempt at renewed negotiation. I accordingly so instructed the Minister of tho United States to Great Britain,, and found that my views in this regard were shared by Ilur Majesty's ministers. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two governments can approach the solu tion of this momentous question with an assurance of what is due to the rights, dig nity and honor of each, and with the de termination not only to remove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay tbe foundation of a broad principle of public law which will prevent future ditforencts, and tend to a firm and continued peace and friendship. This is now the only grave question which tbe United States have with any foreign na tion. The question of a treaty for reciprocity between the United States and the British provinces on this continent has not been favorably considered by the administration. The advantage of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the British producer, ex cept possibly a few engaged in the trade between the two sections. No citizen of the United States would be benefitted by reciprocity. Our internal taxation would prove a protection to the British produce, almost eqi il to . the protection which our manufacturers now receive from the tariff. Some arrangement, however, for the regu lation of commercial intercourse butweon the United States and the Dominion of Canada may be dosi ruble. The 00m mission for adjusting the claims for the Hudson Bay and Fnget's Hound Agricultural Company upon tho United States has terminated its labors. The award of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars lias been made, and all rights and titles of the company on the territory of the United States have been extinguished.;. The deeds for the Dronertv of the comnaav have bnen received and au appropriation by Congress to meet this sum is asked, The commis sioners for determining tha northwestern land boundary between. the. United Statrs and tho British possessions under the troaty of 185G have completed their lubors; and the com mission dissolved in conformity . L- ji .1 . 1 : . - ' Vim ma xouuiiiuiuuuuijuu ingress. . A proposition was early made to the British Government to abolish the mixed conr-ta created under the treaty of April 7, 1SG2, for the suppression of the slave trade. The subject is still under negotiation. it having come to my knowledge that a corporate oorapaoy, organised under Brit ish laws, proposed to land upon the shores of the United Btatea, and to operate there a submarine cable, under , a concession front His Majesty, tba Emperor of the French, . , of ; an 1 exclusive right for twenty years of telegrnphie communication Detvefcn ; the shores of France with the. very obiectiouable feature of subjecting all messages conveyed there by to the sovereignty and control of the Fronoh Government, I caused the. Trench and British legations at Washington n be made acquainted with the probable policy of Congresson the snbjoct ns foreshadowed ay ine pin wnicu passed me bodhh in March lust. ' This drew from the represen tatives of tho Company an agreement to accept 'as the basis of their operations tus provisions of tbe bin or or sunn otbef enactment of the subject as might be pass ed during tho approaching sossiqn of Con gress; also, to use their influence to secure from tho French government a modification of their concessions, so as to permit the landingnponFrenohsoilof any coble be. longing to aa- compapy-laciorparai the authority of the United States, or of any State in tha Union, and On their part not oppose.. the estab lishment of any suoh cable. In considera tion of this agreement, I directed the withdrawal of all opposition by the Unitod States authorities to the landing of the (ta ble, and to the working of it until the meeting of Congress. I rogrot to say that there Las been no modifications made in tbe oonipuny'i concession, nor, so far as I oau learn, have they attempted to secure on their conoeesion the exclusion of the oapital and citizens ot the United States from competition upon the shores of France, I recommend legislation to proteot the rights of oitirens of the United States, as well as tho dignity and sovereignty of the nation, against such assumption. I shall also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an abandonment of the principle of monopo lies in ocean telegraphing cables. Copies of this correspondence are herewith fur nished. The unsettled political condition of other countries, less formnute than cur own, sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of becoming natural ized Having secured this they return to their native country and reside there with out disclosing their ohauge of allegiance. They accept oflkinl positions of trust or honor which can only be held by citizons of their native land; they journey uudor passports describing them assuch citizens, audit is only when civil discord, altor, per haps, years of quiet, threntous thorn or threatens their persons or their property, or when their native states draft into its military Bervice. That tho fact of their change of allegiance is made known; that they reside permanently from the United States; that they contribute nothing to its resources; that they avoid duties of its cit izenship, and they only make themselves known by a claim of protection. I have directed diplomatic and consular oiTloors of the United States to scrutinize carolully all such claims of protection of the citizens of the United Btatei, wlietner native or adopt ed, who disoharoes his duty to his oountry is entitled toils complete protection. While I have a voice in the direction ot anairs I shall not consent to imprint the sacred right by conferring it upon upon fictitious and fraudulent claimants, On the accession of the present adminis tration it was found that the Minister for North Germany had made propositions for negotiations for a convention for the pro tection of emigrant- passengers, to which no response had been given. It was con cluded that to be effectual, all the mari time powers engaged in the trade should joiu in such a measure. Invitations have been extended to the cabinets of London, Paris, Florenoo, IJerlin, Brus sels, Tho Hague, Copougagen, and Stockholm to order their representa tives at Washington to simultnneouBly en ter into negotiations and coincide with the United States conventions, identical in form, making uniform regulations as to the construction of the ports of vessels to be devoted to the use of emigrant passengers as to quality and quantity of food, os to the medical treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be observed during thu voy age iu order to secure ventilation, to pro mote health, to prevent intrusion and to protect the females and providing for the establishment ot tribunal in the several countries, for enforcing such regulations by summary proocss, Your attention is respectfully called to the law regarding the tarm on rrnssian hemp, and to tho question whether to fix the charges on Itussinn hemp higher than thev arc fixed upon Manilla is not a viola. tion of our treaty with llussia placing hor products upou the same looting with those ol tae most ravoroa nations. iur manu faoturcs are increasing with wonderful rapidity under tho encouragement which they now receive. With the improvements In machinery already effected and still increasing, causing machinery to take the place of skilled labor to a lurge extent. our imports of many articles must fall off largely v, ithin a very low years, rortu nutely, too many manufactures are not con fined to a lew localities, as formerly, and it is to be hoped that they will become more and more dinused, making the inter est in them a general 0110 in all sections, aud thus give employment and support to hundreds of thousands of people at home, and retain with us the iusuun which other wise would be shipped abroad. The ex tension of railroads in Europe and the the East is bringing into competi tion with onr agricultural products like products of other . countries. Self-interest if not self-preservation, there fore, dictates caution against disturbing any industri 1 interests of tho oountry. It tenches us a'so the necesdty of looking to other markets for the sale of onr surplus. Our neighbors south of us, and China nud Japan should receive our special attention. It will he the endeavor of the administra tion to cultivate such relations with all these nations as to entitlo the United States to their confidence, find make it their interost as well as ours to establish bettor relations through agen cies. A more enlightened policy than has heretofore been pursued towards China is largely due to the industry and efforts of one of our own distingushed citizens, and the world is about to commence largely in creased relations with that populous aud hitherto exclusive nation, As the United States have been the initiators in the now policy, so they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a success. Ia this connection I advise such legislation aswill forever preclude the land ing of Chinese upon our soil under the name of Coolios, and also prevent Amer ican vessels from engaging in transporta tion of Coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also recommend that the mission to China be rimed to one of first class1. On my assuming the reiponsibility of Chief Magistrate ol (he United States it was with the conviction that threo things wero essential to peace, prosperity, and fullest development. First among these is strict integrity iu fulfilling all our obli gations. Second, to secure protection to the person and property of the oltizens of our common country wnerever tie may ohoose to move without referenoa to origi nal nationality, religion, oolor, or politics, demanding of him only obedionce to the laws and proper respect for the rights ol Others. Thirdf, Union cf all cf the States with eqmd rights indtstructubls by any unconstitutional means to scoure. First ' of these Congress has taken two essential steps ons by declaring that the public debt should be paid, prin cipal and interest, in coin; second, by pro viding means for paying; providing tho means, however, could not secure the ob ject desired with a proper administration of tbe laws for the collection or revenues and an economical disbursement ol thorn. To this subject the administration has most earnestly addressed itself, with results, I believe, satisfactory to the country. There has been no hesitation in changing officials in order to neon re efllcit-nt execution of the laws sometimes, too, wherein a more party, view an Indescribable political remit were likely to follow for any hesitation in sus taining ffllcient officials nfralnst remon strances wholly political. It may bs well to mention here the enubarrascmont possi ble fo arise from allowing on the statute books the so-called tonnro of office act,niid to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the intention of the framers of' the constitution,.: When providing . ' that appointments made ny ' tho ' President should ' rec6lve tha consent of .the Senate, .that tba latter should have the powor to r tain ' in office .persons placed there by fednral appoint inents against the will cf the President. The law is inconsistent' with the faithful and efficient administration of tbe govern ment. What faith can an executive put in officials forced npon him, and those, too,, whom ho has suspended for good reason 7 Bow will each oflltfald be likuly to serve; an administration wbioh they know does trust them for a second? ,Jt Is requis ite to our grpwth and , prosperity. 1 , Time, and a firm but humane administration of existing lawi, emended from time to time, as they may prove ineffectual and nnneceg wiry, is probably all that are rsqulr-" ed. The third cannot be attain ed bv spocial legislation, but by .tha rmn. stitutton i soil, nnd gradually aoquiesoea in by force of publto opinion. From the foundation or tne government to me pres ent the managenaeut of the original inhab itants of this continent, the Indians, fcar been a subjeot of embarrassment and ex pense, and hnB been attenaed witn con tinuous .robberies, murders and wars. From ' iny -own experience upon the frontiers and ia the Indian countries, I do not hold either legislation or the oon duct of the whites who oome most in con tact with the Iudians blameless for these hostilities. The past, however, cannot be undono, nnd the question must be met as we now find it. I have attempted a new policy toward these wards of tho nation, aud thoy oannot bo regarded in any other light than as wards, with fair results so far as tried, and which I hope will be attended ultimately with great Biiccess. TheBooiotv of Friends is well known as having succeed ed ia living at peace with tho Indians in the early settloraont of Pennsylvania while their whito noighbors of oth.r sects in other sections were constantly embroilod. They tiro also known for thoir opposition to all strife, violonoe and war, ana are gen erally noted for their strict integrity aud fair dealings. These considerations in duced me to give the management of a few reservations of Iudians to them, and to throw the burden of the selection of agents upon the Society itaolf. Tho result has provon most satisfactory. It will bo found more fully not forth in the report of the Commissioner of ludian Affairs. For su perintendents and Indian agents, not on reservations, ofllcers of the army were eleoted. Tho reasons for this are numerous. When Indian argents are sent there, or near there, troops must be sent also. Tho agent nnd the commanders of troops are independent of each other, andure subject to orders from difl'orent departments of the governmont. Tho army oiticor holds a position for life, the agent one at the will of the President. The former is personally interested in liv ing iu harmony with the Indians, and in tho establishment of a permanent peace, to the end that some portion of bis Jif'e my be spent within tho civilized section. Tho latter has no such personal interest. Aud theie is an economic one, and still another hoi I which the government has upon a life officer, to secure a faithful dischargo of du ties iu carrying out a giveu policy. The building of roilroads, aud tho access there, by given to nil agricultural and mineral regions of their country, is rapidly bringing the civilized settlements into contact with all the triors of Indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and aborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other has to give way. A system which looks to the extermination of a race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom nud engendering iu the citizen a disregard for human life and tho rights of others and dangerous to society. I isee no substitute for such a system, ex cept iu placing all tho Iudians on large res ervations as rapidly as can be dono and giving them absolute protection there. As hooii as they are fitted for it they should be iuduced to take their lauds iu severally or to set up territorially for their own protec tion. For full details on this subject I call your special attention to the reports of tho Secretary of tho Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Tho re port of Ihe Sccretury of Wur shows tho expenditures of the War Department for tho year ending the 30th of June, 1800, to be $80, Gil, (MS, of which $23,882,310 was disbursed iu the payment of debts con tracted during tho war, and is not charge able to current army expensts. The c.tti niato of $31,531,031 for the expouses of tho army lor tho next fiscal year is low as it is believed . can bo 'relied on, Tho estimotes of bureau officers have been carefully scrutinized wherever it has been deemod practicable. If, however, the condition of the eountry should be such by the next fiscal year as to admit of a greater contration of troops, tho appropriation asked for will not be ex peuded. The appropriation estimated for river and harbor improvements and fortifi cations nru submitted soperately. What ever amount Congress may deem proper to appropriate for these purposes, will be ex pended. The recommendation of the Gener ul of tbe Amy that appropriations be made for the forts at Boston, Portland, New York, Fhiladelshia, New Orleans and San Francisco, if for no other, is concurred iu. I also call special attention to the recom mendation of the General commanding the imlitarv division of the PaciUo for the salo of the Seal Islands of St Paul and St. Goorgo, Alaska Territory, and suggest that it either bo complied with, or that legislation be had for the protec tion of the seal nsuerioB, trom which a revenue should bo derived. Tho ronort of tho Secretory of War oon tains a synopsis of the heads of bureaus, of commaudeirs of military divisions aud of the districts of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas. The report of the General cf the Army in lull, aud tho recommendations therein contained, have been well consid ered and are submitted for your action. I, however, call special attoution to the re commendation of the Chief of Ordnance for the sale of arsenals and lauds no longer of use to the Government; also to the recom mendation of tho Secretary ol War that tho act of 3d of March, 1800, prohibiting pro motions and oppintmenis in stuff corps of tbe army, bo reoealud. Ths extent of country to be gmrisoned, nnd the number . e -1 F 1 . . . 1. 1 1 i . .1 01 military posts 10 uu uccupicei is 1110 some with a reduced army as with a large ono; the number of staff ollicers rcqnired is more dependant upon the latter than the former oondition. The report of the Secreloiy of thu Navy acooinpauying this shows tho condition of the navy when this administration canio Into otllce, and enanges made since : Strenuous efforts are being made to place as many vessels in commission or render them fit for service, if rcqnired, as soon as possible, and substituting the pail for steam whilo cruising, thus materially re ducing tho expenses of the navy and ad ding greatly to its efficiency. Looking to our future, I recommend a liberal, though not extravagant, policy towards this branch of publio service ... The report of the postmaster general fur nishes a clear and . comprehensive exhibit of . the operations of the postal service and of, the financial condition of this part of 'the Post-ofllce Department. The ordinary postal reve nues lor the year ending the 30th of June, 18(19, amount to $18,4-15,510, and the ex penditures to $23,680,131, showing nn ex c!hs of expenditures ovor recoipta of $5, 35 J, 020. Tho excess ot expenditures over the receipts for the previous year amounted to $0,4:17,9!2. The increase of revenues for 1HU9 over those of 18C8 was $2,051,1)09, and tho increase of expenditures was, t'JG7, $907,538. The increased revenue in 1809 exceeded the increased revouue in 18C8 by 890(5,330, and tho in creased expenditures iu 18C9 was wits $'4,27,C70 loss than the increased ex penditures in 1807, showing, by oompprl aou, this gratifying '. feature . of , improve ment, that while the increase of expendi tures over the increase of receipts in 1 808 was $2439,530, the increase of receipts over thetiioreuso of expenditures In 1808, win $1,084,371. .Your attention is respectfully called to recommendations made by the Postmaster. Genor.d, for authority to ohangetlio rate of compensation to the main trunk' railroad lines, for their services in, tarrying the mails; for having post route maps executed, iirfe-oraiiizing and increasing tha ciHciun cy of the special ogonoy servloo, for increase of Iho mail sorvice on tho Paaifto nnd for establishing a jimil servico under the flag of the Union on tha Atlantic, and monies neciallv do I cull vour attention to, his re- cotlitnohdatiou for a total abolitibn of the franking priyilcgct his is an , abuse rm Which no one receives a commensurate ad vouUge.. It reduces the receipt lot hohUI service from tweuty-five o thirty per. cent, nnd lurgely increases the iorvloe to be per formed,, The method by which postage should be paid upon piiblle matter Is set forth fully In tbe report ot the i'ostuiastur General, Th report of the Seoretary of the Inte rioi haws tba ik qaatityfHpWw lands'tiriqiosed'oT tlurlhg"" thTear' e ndlfig" 30th of June, 1869, was 7,6(50,152 aores, ex ceeding that of the previous year by 1, 010,409 acres. Of this amount 2,890,644 acres were sold foi cash, and 2,737,3(13 sores entered under- tbe homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid in the construction of the work of internal im provements, approved to the states as stamp lands, and located warrants and scrip. Tne casn reoeipts irom an sources were $4,472,885, exceeding those ot the previous year $2,840,140. s uunag tne last usoai year sj,j.uo names were added to the pension rolls, and 4,870 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,953. The amount paid to pensioners, including the compensation to disbursing agents, was $28,422,884, an inorease of $441,192 on that of the previous year. The munifloence of Congress has been con spicuously manifested in its legislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the reoent struggle to maintain that unity of government whioh makes us oner people. The additions to tho pension rolls of each succeeding year sinoo the conclusion of hostilities result in a groat degree from the repeated amendments of the uot of the 14th of July, 1802, whioh would extend Its provisions to cases not fulling within its original soope. Tho large outlay whioh is thus occasioned is fuither Increased by the more liberal nl lowancA bestowed since that date upon those who, in the line of duty, were wholly or permanently disabled. Publio opinion has given au empnatio sancuon to mess measures of Congress, and it will be oon coded that no part of our publio burden ia more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by this branch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, in addition to the amount just chargeable to the naval pension fund, an appropriation of thirty million dollars. During the year ending the 30th of Sep tember, 1869, the Patent Ollice issued 13, 7C2 patents, and its receipts were $633,289, being $213,920 more than the expenditures. I would respectfully call your attention to the reoommendation of the Seoretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of super vising the education of the freeduien with the other duties devolving upon tne uotn- missioner of Eduoation. If it is the desire of Congress to make the census which must be taken during tho year 1B7U more oeimpleile and perfeot than heretofore, I would suggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress at the last session appointed a committee to take into consideration such measures as might bo deemed proper in reference to the coming census, and to report a plan, I desist from saying more. 1 recommend to your lavorauie consider ation the claims of the Agricultural Bureau for liberal appropriation in a country so diversified in climate and soil as ours, and with a population so lurgely de pendent upon agriculture, the benefits that can be conferred by properly fostering this bureau, are incalculable. I desire, respectfully, to call the attention of Congress to ths inadequate salaries of a number of the most important ofllcers of the government. In this message I will not enumerate them, but will specify only the Justices of the Supreme Uourt Mo change has been made iu their salaries for 10 years. Witbln tuat time the labors of the Court have largoly iucrcused, and tbe expenses of living have at least doubled. During the same time Congress has twioo found it neeossary to increase largoly the compensation of its own mem bers, and tho duty which it owes to another department of the government deserves, aud will undoubtedly receive, its duo con sideration. Th6reare many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with propriety be introduced, but I abstain, believing your patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and legislation most conducive to the interests of the whole people. On my part, I promise a rigid adheronce laws U. S.
