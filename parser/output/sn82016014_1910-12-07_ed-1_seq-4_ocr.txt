The State Journal la a member of the Associated Press and receives the full day telegraph report of that great news or ganisation for the exclusive ateroooa jrabllcation in Topeka. Tha newa la received In The State Jour nal building over wires for this sola pur pose. Joplln, Mo., can afford to toss a smile or two in the direction of her sister, Kansas City. Joplln has a new union depot in working; order. That proclamation Issued by Mr. Madero declaring; himself to be the president of the new republic of Mexi co does not appear to have been very effective. ' Oklahomans are now talking of fix ing: on a compromise site for the loca tion of the state's capital. That's busi ness. Why not place it half-way be tween Guthrie and Oklahoma City as the crow flies?' " Some of the "big battleships which have been planned cannot be built be cause eongrese did not appropriate enough money for them. Stingy old congress. It set aside only $ 6,000,000 for each of these ships. At least one Roosevelt presidential record has been beaten by President Taft., His message to congress yester day Is much longer than any of the many which were penned by the col onel. There will be no doubt now in the minds of many that China is not pro gressing and progressing rapidly to wards a higher civilization. The Ce lestial Kingdom has begun a reorgan ization of its army and navy on mod ern lines. - If anybody hereabouts thinks that Topeka has not grown and developed wonderfully during the fifty-six years of its life, he ought to take a trip through the smaller cities in the New England states which have been in existence for more than a hundred years. Isn't it pretty near time for Walter Wellman to announce that he will at tempt some other impossible featT Presumably, though, he will have to be in Washington during the present session of congress to see that the af fairs of the United States are conduct ed In a proper fashion. Governors of the other forty-five states of the union are apparently most derelict in their duty to their con stituencies. They have as yet failed to advise the president of the United States as to whom he should not ap point to the vacancies on the bench of the federal supreme court. Colonel Roosevelt Is to make his first public statement as to the causes which led to the recent political up heaval at a dinner to be given by the New Haven Chamber of Commerce on December 13. Mark the date. It's to be wondered for whom this statement Will be unlucky. China may e only partially civilized in the eyes of occidentals but it seetns to have a pretty effective idea for wag ing a successful crusade against the use of opium by its pig-tailed inhabit ants. It has decided not only to pro hibit the importation and smoking of opium, but also to prohibit the culti vation of the weed from which this drug Is made. Things are coming to a pretty pass before long. The opinion was express ed recently that woman is becoming more masculine all the time and that man is becoming more effeminate. This being true there will .be a period when, in these Journeys, man and woman will reach the same stage. Than the kiddles will be compelled to guess and let it go at that as to which is pa and which is ma. Attorney General Wlckersham has given out a letter from Colonel Roose velt in which an alleged offer of a big campaign contribution ' by electrical interests is termed an attempt at open bribery. And electrical interests are one of the corporation specialties of "Blue-eyed Billy" Sheehan whom Tammany proposes to ' send to the United States senate to succeed Chaun oey M. Depew. - Congress will have to work overtime if it has any disposition to enact any considerable portion of the president's recommendations into law. Nor is there a single one of them which is not worth while. But the chances are that congress will chiefly concern - itself during the short session with passing appropriation bills. No reluctance is ever shown by congressmen in taking up for consideration any - legislation that provides for an expenditure of 'public funds. , . . - . ; 

ESTIMATES NEEDED CTTTTTVG. James A. -Nation, the .state auditor, appears to have used - much excellent discernment in his handling of the estimates of the moneys - which the heads of the three large state educa- i tional institutions think they will need during- the next couple of years for the conduct of these institutions. He has slashed these estimates right and left and pared them down to the bone. But he does not seem to have so re duced the material items in them in any way that will interfere with the management of these Institutions along desirable and progressive lines. ' His knifing has been more concerned with a weeding-out of , ' the "extras" that each of these institutions would like to have,' but which they can get along very well without for the present. Kansans have been exceedingly lib eral with their appropriations for the State university, the State Agricultural college and the State Normal college during the past few years. They have been glad to develop, these institutions to a high plane, where they will rank favorably with similar institutions in other states. They are proud of the success in this particular which has been achieved by the men to whom the management of these Institutions has been entrusted. And they would pro test loudly against any effort on the part of state officials or the legislature to make money allowances to these In stitutions which would cripple them in any way. But they are not disposed to have these institutions extravagantly con ducted or developed. There is no need why unusually large sums of money should be expended all in a lump within three or four years to provide these institutions with every possible educa tional adjunct that some of the older educational institutions of the country have been a generation or two in ac quiring. It would appear that the less haste' the most speed rule would be a good one to apply in this particular. These institutions should be developed and enlarged but the development and enlargement should be gradual. And Kansans may well be pardoned for arriving at the conclusion that the. ever increasing demands from the heads of these Institutions, for money with which to do ' this and that, are stimulated by a rivalry between these same institutions to get ahead of each other. Such a rivalry should not exist. Unfortunately, it does. The only way to wipe it out will be by putting the supervisory administration of all of the educational institutions supported by the state in the hands of one educa tional board. CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR COUNTRY. There are some gifts this country needs, and that woman pan put in its Christmas stocking, says Harper's Ba zar for December. If she does not, America will go without them, day by day, throughout year after year, and suffer for the lack. One is the gift of pure food, in every home pure food which never will be reached until the women of the United States insist upon its manufacture, its presence on the grocery shelves, its , safe-guarding by adequate law. Another gift needed is that of the right of every American child to live, to be educated until its fourteenth year, to be protected against the forces of greed and of evil. Christianity means this or it means nothing; and yet ba bies all over the land die by the thou sand, poisoned by stale milk or mur dered by tenement conditions; and lit tle children toll, dwarfed and exploit ed, in American mills and mines and sweatshops. Not until every woman helps to give every child its life and its rights in our land has she come into the true national spirit of Christ mas. A third is the gift of health. It rests with the women to create the home, the school, the municipal conditions of wholesome living in each community. Pure air in every room, cleai surround ings, sanitary laws these are no mys tery beyond any woman's learning, or beyond the power of woman's concert ed action to gain Inside and outside their homes. All men agree, all doctors repeat, that woman alone can confer this gift of public health in all its de tails and its fullness. - There are others. But Just these three If 1910 saw them given, what a ChriBt mas Uncle Sam would have, and how he would rise up and call the givers blessed! MONEY FROM SOME WEEDS. Any weeds on your place? asks the Kansas Industrialist and it continues: One year's seeding, the old farm prov-. erb says, is seven years' weeding. Bet ter get busy and do something. The big stick in the weed industry is to prevent the seeding no royal road, noJ easy task, but mighty Important to every farmer. You Just have to ge down and work hard if once you get a fine stand of weeds. Watch all your seed, know it is clean; send it to the Kanras State Agricultural college, .de partment of botany, if necessary, and have it analyzed. Of course if you're going into the weed business it's different. Some of the most noxious weeds that thrive today are the sources of crude drugs now obtained wholly or in part from abroad. The plants from which medi cines are made, burdock, dandelion, couch-grass, pokeweed, tansy, catnip, jimson-weed, etc., can be collected and sold as crude drugs. The nrices paid are not high. Yet, if in getting rid of weeds and thus increasing the value of the land the farmer can make the weed a source of a small income in stead of a loss, it isn't a poor idea after all. - - Korea's Real Name. Most of the newspapers and ' many of their readers have, denounced the Japanese not only for annexing Korea, but for changing its very name. It is only fair to the Japanese, who have tried to deal very gently with Korean susceptibilities, to point out that they have done nothing ot the sort. In the treaty of annexation Korea is called Cho-sen, which has been the name of the country for the last 500 years and more. Surely every writer and news paper reporter who has traveled in the east has referred to Korea, with a graceful, literary touch, as the Land of the Morning Calm, which is a po eticaj translation - of Cho-sen. ; How comes It, then, that no one in the edi torial rooms recognized the title in the treaty? The name Korea is one of those most strange bastard titlea that Europeans have given to eastern coun tries whose language they could not read or speak. The ordinary Chinese name for the people of Cho-sen Is Kao-li, which in vulgar parlance be comes Ko-ri (1 and r being interchange able in all the far eastern languages). Travelers from the west found the word Ko-ri in common use and dubbed the country Korea. Metropolitan Mag azine. . . , JOURNAL ENTRIES li a whole lot of people were not egotistical, you'd never hear anything about them. Too manv men and women don't ap preciate the value of money until they've exhausted their supply. What has become of the old fashion ed boy who wanted to be a pirate when he grew up ? Very often a baby can be kept quiet only by its relatives making all kinds of boisterous noises. " An artist can paint a sunrise in any way he pleases. Not many folk are at all familiar with the real thing. J A YHA WKER JOTS Mr. A. F. Kiddo is among the resi dents of Larned. A good way to catch cold, advises the Clay Center Republican, is to run af ter it from a hot room. "Mash the Mashers," explains the lat est crusade which is being carried on by the Emporia Journal and it insists that Emporia is full of them. Vest's Eulogy on the Dog is making its annual round of the weeklies. And it's well worth reprinting and reread ing, too. In an unpronounceable name contest Mr. Paul Pflughoeft, the village black smith of Ellsworth, ought to stand a good chance of winning first honors. There seems to be a church Janitor trust at Santa Fe. Atleast, the Has kell County Republican reports that Ed Metz is now the Janitor at both churches. The, poet has said: "Into each life some rain . must fall," remarks the Colby Tribune, but it calls attention to the fact that he never lived in west ern Kansas. Time may be money, remarks the Smith County Journal, but it points out that the average man would rather give you two hours' talk than lend you a quarter. A gentle hint to visitors from the Manhattan Republic: There are a good many things we don't know, but we usually manage to close the outside door on a cold day. Jeff Wyland, of Pleasantdale, Smith county, butchered an 18 months' old hog last week that weighed 560 pounds. Jeff would like to hear from some one who has a bigger hog. weight for age. Evidently the Norton Champion be lieves in being perfectly frank. It re ported recently: A bucking broncho yesterday put Sherm Moore's face to the ground,, but he never was handsome. , - "Devoted to the Interests of Harvey County in General and the Publisher in Particular." is the frank announce ment which appears on the front page of each issue of the Halstead Independ ent. The Clay Center Times thinks the population of Clay county as given by the new census 15,251 ought to be easy to remember, because, as the Times points out, it reads backwards the same as befrontwards. Kansas likely has a candidate for the longevity record among mules. L. Whitzel. a farmer living at Reams ville, Smith county,-had one of these critters that died the other day which was 46 years and 3 months old. Evidently the editor of the Belleville Telescope has not a very high regard for one of his rivals in the newspaper business in that town. He styles him as a character assassin and tosses in this general remark: "Nearly every community is afflicted with some viper, who like the buzzard, lives off carrion and revels in the atmosphere that ap peals to the lower instincts of human ity." GLOBE SIGHTS. From the Atchison Globe. Every prodigal knows the fatted calf storv. Some people insist on being fooled all the time. Aiman who has one new idea a month is a genius. Enthusiasm often takes first money in a race against brains. Do you know you are right, or do you only think you know? It is said that every housekeeper has at least one dirty habit. . A gossip usually knows mora on himself than he knows on other peo ple. Every man believes pain hurts him worse than any other man in the world. Some people can defend a friend in such a manner as to start a new story on him. - The man who said you can't kill a drunk man. wasn't speaking to old John Barleycorn. "If the Lord will save me from eat ing too much, I can take care of pride." Drake Watson. When a man gets down, he is nearly as hard to get on his feet again as a horse with a broken leg. It is a rare husband and wife who can look at each other without feel ing ashamed about something. After a boy gets in a three base hit, it takes his mother a long time to get him under control again. Nearly any man can get enough to eat. but it is a rare man who can keep from eating too much of it. You may think that in the confusion, a bride will not notice it if you do not send a present, but she, will. A good many men have been disap pointed because of the failure of a col lege diploma to make a living for them. REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR. From the New York Press. A man can be most proud of his fam ily for being proud of him. You can get a very keen appetite for a food Just by having it costly. - Tact is letting somebody step on your toes Instead of your stepping on his. When a boy has sense you may be able to lick him into using it; when he hasn't any you can't lick it into him. The more a girl knows the less she will let on she does; the more a woman knows the more she will try to make out it is. KANSAS COMMENT PENSION MOTHERS? WHY NOT? Dr. Anna L von Sholly, of New York city, a member of the babies' hospital staff, sai-s: , "The state should support mothers for two years after the birth of each child." Of course, Dr. Sholly is advocating more paternalism, at which the dear conservatives shudder but that's about all they can find to do: shudder. Why not pension mothers especially the wives of poor men who become mothers; and there are decidedly more poor mothers than rich mothers? Dad, the common worker, Is the busi est man on this earth about the time he finds out there is going to be anoth er mouth to feed. He saves and saves to pay the doctor and the trained nurse, and to take care of mother while she is sick. And it Is a certainty that he can't save enough so that there is much left after the new one appears on the Bcene. If mother and baby are not at least fairly well taken care of. one or both of them will die and good citizens are lost. - So why not pension the wife of a poor man each time that she becomes a mother? Why not make it possible to give the youngster a proper start in life, as well as to preserve mother's health, for she is tha real bone and sinew of the land. 'Tis not Mrs. Clarence Van Dusen, blueblood. who makes the country great; but .it is Mrs. John Smith, who produces the babies who grow into brawny-armed men and stout girls, and who must be (produced if the work of the future is to be done. And there will always be work, for this is a workaday world. Wichita Bea con. -- BETTER BUTTER NOWADAYS. Farmers have received fully two and a half cents a pound more for their butter fat this year, in proportion to the selling price of the butter, than ever in the history of the state. This has been largely "due to the informa tion disseminated by the 'office of the dairy commissioner at the Kansas State Agricultural college. The cream buy ers and cream station operators through instruction, now conduct their tests for butter fat more accurately. Fewer com plaints are heard from farmers. More than 1,800 cream buyers have been in structed and examinations given as to their proficiency in making cream tests and in their knowledge of the ordinary sanitary regulations required of dairy men. Where competent, these men have granted permits to buy cream. The number of creameries in the state is increasing. The quality of the butter is better, and its reputation abroad has improved. Through the ef forts of the dairy commissioner's office, the sanitary conditions of the cream stations have been greatly improved. Atchison Champion. FROM 07 HER PENS THE HUMAN ELEMENT. The subject of American agriculture is receiving general attention. There are obvious reasons for this. The ratio between supply and "demand is chang ing unfavorably for the consumer. The balance between the producer and the nonproducer through migration from the country to ,the city, and particu larly through .'jriimigration from Europe, has been"abnormally altered. The railroad president; the college pro fessor, the politician, the law-maker, the plain consumer and the agricul turist himself, each from his point of view, have contributed to the sym posium on this momentous subject. A state commission is now seeking sug gestions as to what may be done to turn men back to the soil. We are realizing the fact that in the last analysis the very existence of a nation depends upon its supply of physical nourish ment. In the course of the discussion many ways of stimulating the landward movement and of Increasing our food supply have been suggested. All who have offered "hints," whether or not they stopped to analyze its nature, have found themselves confronted with an impalpable, but, nevertheless, a real wall. It is that self-evident fact that a man is not an ox. He cannot be driven as one drives the beast in the field. He is a creature possessed of volition. The pursuit of happiness is his right. Lib erty of opportunity is bound up with our institutions. It is existent, for in stance, in the foundations of whatever immigration policy we have. New York Tribune. o
