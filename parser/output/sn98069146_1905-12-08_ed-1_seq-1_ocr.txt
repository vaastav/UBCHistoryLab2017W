AN NUAL MESSAGE DELIVERED. F.deral Control of Corporations En gaged in Interstate Business Strong ly Emphasized His Recommenda- tions Campaign Contributions. The 69th congress met at Washing ton at noon Mondiiy, Dec. 4. For the flrwt time In yenrs not a flower adorned the dosks, orders having been Issued forbidding bringing them In. The new members of the senate were sworn in; Speaker Cannon was elected in the houHe Hnd members drew their seats. Tuesduy afternoon, Dec. 5, President Roost velt delivered his annual mes sage. It first and most strongly em phasized tho matter of federal con trol of corporations engaged In Inter state business. The president admits the natural and proper pre-eminence of great corporations In our modern economic organization and their ln dispensubleness to our-further pro gress. He points out. however, the fact that some leaders of great corpo rate Interests employ their large powers in ways harmful to the general public welfare, and the further fact that no adequate supervision and con trol exists by which abuse of corporate power can be checked. State control, n antra th. wtnlnil et (Via .nVPrpl?ntV by which these corporations have been created, has proved steaauy more il lusory with the accumulation of Judic ial decisions. There remains then only federal supervision, which Is amply nmvlilerl tnr hv the interstate com merce clause of the constitution. The defect of past national laws on this matter has been, he says, that they have been negative or prohibitive, and have not distinguished between what should and should not be allowed. The great efforts of the department of Justice during four years past have shown that laws of this sort cannot be adequately enforced. Not every restriction of competition is bad. What Is needed, therefore, is not sweeping prohibition, but such supervision as win otrlUa nl th rent evils not onlv In the direction of harmful restraint of competition, but the other abuses at tached to corporate eroed. such for instance as uverL-apiiJiiiaaLiwii. x ..c prevention of unjust and unreasonable .... ,1. ..In.

The Itlillouu .duo .11 jut........ v. ... f.i,triir,a ovftrvthttiir In the nature nf re bates, Is declured the most Immediate anil nresxina- need. To this end the president recommends the creation by congress of an administrative board ollhorl tvllh Biifhnrtlv to tnke Dositive action In regard to rate abuses. Upon complaint, and after due investigation, he would have this board empowered, when it finds a rate to be unjust or unreasonable, to fix a maximum rea sonable rate, to go into effect after proper notice, and to be subject to re view later in the courts. He makes the suggestion, already offered by At- HAnafal lUnnrlv thnt in the natiA nf a Irtw mtfi in A filVOred SniDOer the board would have the right to de- clare this minimum the reasonable maximum rate, a tew hucu ucunsimw v. kntin,.aa nrr.nl1 rmt nn r.nrl tn rntp discrimination. He emphasizes the fact that he does not propose to give ine kn.rj Vt iaar nf nriirlnatlnir rates. but merely of regulating them on the basis put rorwara oy tne muruuua themselves. He would have the de cisions of the board enforclble by heavy penalties: Ultimately the presi dent would allow the board to sanc tion such agreements between rail roads as are clearly for the public good. Commenting on the evils of pri vate car lines and similar schemes, the president advocates federal exami nation of railroad accounts, similar to that of national bank accounts, the railroads to keep only such books, ac counts and memoranda as should be prescribed by law. He urges speedy action by congress, vas delay is the chief weapon of the resisting railroads. He remarks on the opposition of fed eral regulation to government owner ship, the undeslrablllty of the latter, and the need of securing nrst-ciass. well-paid men to carry out federal control. The president refers to the insurance investigations as showing that such corporations have outgrown the state control, and by their inter state operations have become proper subjects for federal supervision; and the attention of Congress is asked for the devising of such control as may be possible. Connected with this general topic Is the matter of corporate participation in federal elections. The president would ' have congress prohibit cam paign contributions from corporations, and compel full and verified publica tion In detail of all moneys contributed to and expended by candidates and committees In federal campaigns. Tariff revision, he thinks. Is not at present clearly demanded by the needs of revenue or by the requirements of Industries, nor is thexnature of possible revision evident. He suggests the con sideration of maximum and' minimum schedules when revision may seem necessary. He advocates for tne pres ent a greater development of trade with the other peoples of this conti nent. The Panama canal wors; is briefly reviewed.

The chief eyl, U. . and that thrquesTlon of Immigration, the president asserts the necessity of excluding coolies, or laborers, but con tends that other classes of Chinese should receive the same treatment as like classes of other nntlons. He de clares that such treatment would not only not harm this country, but Is ne cessary to our good business relations with China. Stricter nuturallzutlon laws, and reform In procedure are ad vised.

As was expected th.,pn u'nu a niHliirfiv mill n. minority report, E. C. Crosby differing with the other members of the committee on several Important points as will be seen from reading the reports pub liuhDl in full In thin tinner. Rnth re ports were discussed at length, but no net Inn was taken indicative of the sentiment of the meetinc. An mi iireiiipted municioai owner ship was recommended, the majority holding that the village should own the system and the minority that it uhm.ll ho rinff tn Ihn Inurn l no matur ity further recommended that the vil lage purchase the present system, known as the Chestnut Hill system, without any alliance with the Sunset Lake water company, at the price nnmnil hv the engineer, the aKureitate sum paid not to exceed the bonded debt of the company, in event 01 failure to do this an independent sys tem was recommended. Mr. Crosby dissented with the majority of the committee as to what Bhould be paid for the Chestnut Hill system, claiming that Its cost should be taken Into con sideration in making the price. He also held that It would be useless to attempt to discriminate between the Chestnut Hill and the Sunset Lake companies as the stock in both corpo rations Is all owned In the Crowell family. When the meeting was called to order by Bailiff John Gatvin at 8 o'clock nearly 600 people were In the hall. The report of the majority of the committee was read by E. W. Gib son, who stated at the start that the word committee had been used in the report before it was known that there was to be a minority. Mr. Crosby read his report when Mr. Gibson had finished. When this was completed Clarke C. Fitts took the floor and as counsel for George K. Crowell gave a very concise statement of Mr. Cro weil's position. In the beginning he gave a brief history of the foundation of the Chestnut Hill system, saying that it had been started by Mr. Cro- h.u11 tt- tYia tinrnnfl. nf SlinnlvinS' hlS own houses with water and had been enlarged as the demands of the vil- lage required.

Mr. Fitts """Lf ' Mr. Fitts further stated that it had been Mr. Crowell's ultimate Intention from the first to use the water or AiariDoro North pond and Stickney brook for .vraiT tir ovatom fl nit P.RI Pfl tO miHU the survey of that source which was made for Mr. Crowell by Engineer Wolontt of Greenfield. In reuard to the wHter rights now held bv the Sun set Lake company Mr. Fitts showed conclusively tnat tney were an con trolled before the village committee onnnlntarl tn Mnslnff MP. FIttS stated that it did not seem fair to Mr. Crowell to ask him to sen nis system for Just the amount of the indebted hut thnt Mr Prnwell was will ing to leave the appraisal to a court's commission and woum aoiae dv any such decision: he was also willins to hat. tha mipctinn of water rates de termined by county court at any time. To take such action as is- recom mended by the majority of the com mittee would avail the village noth ing." said Mr. Fitts, "and would re sult only In punishing Mr. Crowell and for what r n u novontinrt then snnke at some length as to what action the village ought to take, the gist of his argu ment being that Mr. Wesson, holder of the Chestnut Hill reservoir bonds.

"We cannot help feeling," suld Mr. Gibson In conclusion, "that the minority report was not dictated hv Mr Prnuhu hut hv Mr Fltta ns a special plea in behalf of Mr. Crowell." J. L. Alartln men inquirea or Air. Gibson if the committee had ever con sidered the suggestion of getting at the value of the Crowell system by a court's commission. Mr. Gibson was taken back at this question and hesl- ta.aii hffnr-A DnoU.tl.lll. that hi. thought It had been casually consid ered. He then held a whispered con versation with other committee mem ha.a milt nn M thev werp nf the opin ion that the plan had not been con sidered. At this point Mr. Crosby arose and cqM thpra appmait tn ha a fpeiina- Oil the part of the majority of the com mittee to belittle the value of the present system. He also said the com mittee underestimated what a system that would satisfy the village would cost, giving as his opinion that the figure would be about $350,000. He then went on to say that he was not In favor of the village putting in a system for the purpose of crushing a man who had taken care of it for 25 years. In answer to air. uioson s insinua- tinn Mr Fitts said Mr. Crosbv did come to him as counsel and ask him about several points of the minority eport, saying that as long as the ma jority of the committee had had a lawyer working on Its report for sev- Qll ha thrnifrht hp Wfla entitled to the help of an attorney for an hour or two.
