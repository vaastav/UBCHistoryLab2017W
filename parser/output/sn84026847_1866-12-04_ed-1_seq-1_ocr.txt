His enemies, too, who expected ..\erawe him by a verdict of popular . and divert him from his course t ';r eats and force, will find little en- 1 igement in his dignified statement, ? upon this question (of Southern .citation) so wholly aftecting the -? lation of the Union and the per- 1 . v of our present form of govern- , tit, his convictions heretofore ex- 1 *? ?.? d. have nndergolift no change; but tin- contrary, those convictions have . ? it continued by reflection and time, j Hi- synopses of tbe reports of the v? ius Secretaries will also be found able id interesting. Particularly will the ?..pie be glad to believe with the Pres nt that "there seems to be no goodj .i- >u why taxes may not be reduced as ( ? ? on u try advances in population and uth. and yet the national debt l?e j ^uished within the next quarter of i ? Miry." The preliminary steps to a j <?? and more advantageous pwUil sjs- , <ia l>vt ween Great Britain aud the ' i:t>vl States, the admission of a del- j the*4Iouse of Representatives ' . the district of Columbia, the sue v. .f the Atlantic, and the prospects i a Pacific telegraph cable are also tlio subjects of special remarks. While the President would like to re i?r>l the general aspect of our foreign "UtiotH as measurably serene, he makes ^ Waited reference to two or three cases he evidently considers as excep tional. ^ ith regard to the Mexican question, intimates very strongly that the ifruch Emperor is disposed to act in faith. The immediate departure f"'tii Mexico of the stipulated instal- ! ?f French troops is very firmly 5 as a uecessary condition of bar ony, aud some plain English used in ?Uting that "the traditienary friend ,a>l? between the two countries might, 1 "'t;iat case, bo renewed and perina u'atly restored." ^"ntion is made of the fact that the bill has been again presented ] ^*eat Britain, and its colloction is safely insured by inainrating ^ without a prompt liquidation j r^l-wUl and friendship between the two countries cannot be established.'' i The iuference is also clcar that uuless the British Government is willing to redress such grievances, as we have re joeived at the hands of her citizeus, she . has no right to expect our Government ? to bo excessively careful of her iuter | ests. : The Fenian ''enterprise against tho I British North American Colonies" is re ferred to in language that admits of no | doubt of the Executive intention to pro tect, as far as possible, all of our eiti | zens engaged therein, from unjust or j excessive punishment. The President believes "in the maxim of government, I that severity of civil punishment for ? 1 i misguided persons, who have engaged in revolutionary attempts that have disastrously failed is unsound anil un wise," and in stating it, furnishes a very distinct guide for Congressional action in relation to our Southern citizens who have "disastrously failed" in a "revolu tionary attempt." The President oon | eludes the Fenian branch of his mes sage by reminding the British Govem ' wunt of cuiupiatnTS of misgovernment in Ireland, and modestly hinting to her as well as to Congress that tho feniedy for disaffection on the part of the peo ple is wisdom and decency ou tho part of their rulers. Mr. Johnson next considers tho American doctrine on the subject of ex patriation and very properly suggests the propriety of "au assertion by Con gress of the principle so long main tained by the Executive Department, that naturalization by one State fully exempts the native born subject of any other State from the performance of military service under any foreign gov eminent, so long as he does not volun tarily renounce its rights and benefits." The message concludes l>y counselling harmony between the different Deparfr ments of the Government, and expresses the wish "that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing the maintenance of tho Con stitution, the preservation of the Union and the perpetuity of our free institu tions.'' To all of which the nation says, Amen ! 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. F, Uow Citizens of the 8e*ate and House of lteprescH tatives : \fter a brief interval tlio Congress of j the 1'nited States resumes its annual legislative labors.

Ten States ? more than one-fourth of the whole number ? remain without repre sentation ; the seats of fifty members in the House of Representatives and ol twenty members in the Senate are yet vacant ? not by their own consent, not I by a failure of election, but by the re i fusal of Congress to accept their creden tials. Their admission, it is believed, ; would have accomplished much towards ! the renewal and strengthening of our | relations as one people, and removed se ritlus cause for discontent on the part ol i the inhabitants of those States. It i would have accorded with the great ' principle enunciated in the Declaration I of American Independence, that no peo ple ought to hear the burden of taxa tion, and yet be denied the right of rep resentatiou. It would have been in cou sonancc with the express provisions of the Constitution, that "each State shall have at least one Representative," and '?that no State, without itsconsent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate." These provisions were intend resentation in each House of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the frame rs of the Constitution that the equality of the States in the Senate should 1m* preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution, can ! any State, without its consent, be de nied a voice in that branch of the Na tional Legislature. It is true, it lias been assumed that the existence of the States was termi nated by the rebellious acts of their in habitants, and that the, insurrection having been suppressed, they were t henceforward to imj considered merely as conquered territories. The Legisla tive, Executive, and Judicial Depart ments of the Government have, Low ever, with great distinctness and uni form consistency, refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itselfapparent, that these ten political communities aro nothing less than States of this Union. At the very com mencement of the rebellion, each House declared, with a unanimity as remark able as it was significant, that the war was not '! waged, upon our part, in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made In pursuance thereof, and to preserve the I'nion with all the dig nity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects were accomplished the war ought to cease." In some instances. Sena tors were permitted tocontiuue their leg islative functions, while in other instan ces Representatives were elected and admitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, and were en deavoring to maintain that right by force of arms. Allot' the State* whose peo- : pie were in insurrection, as States, were included in the apportionment of the ilirecttax of twenty millions of dollars mnnallv laid npon tho United States by the act approved 5th August, 1*61. Con-! Tress, l?v the act of March 4, 186'i, and ' in the apportionment, of representation | 'hereunder, also recognized their pres- ' Mice as States in the Union ; anil they lave, f.>r judicial purposes, been divided J j)t <, districts, as States alone can be di vided. The same recognition appears in , lie recent legislation in reference to i'einiessee. which evidently rests upon| :he fact that the functions of the State ivere not destroyed by the rebellion, but ner.ly suspended; and that principle s of course applicable to those States ?vliieh. like Tennessee, attempted to rc lonnee their places in the 1 uion. Tin' action of the Executive Depart ment of the Government upon this sub ject lias been equally definite and uni form, and the purpo.se of the war was Specifically stated in tlic Proclamation issued by ltiv predecessor on tin' $2d day of September, 1H& It was then j solemnly proclaimed and declared that ! ?'hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of practi- j cally restoring the constitutional rela- : tioii between the United States and each of the States and the people thereof, in | which States that relation is or may be j suspended or disturbed." The recognition of the States by the : Judicial Department of the Govern- ' ment has also been clear and conclusive j in all proceedings affecting them as I States, had in the Supreme, Circuit and j District Courts. In the admission of Senators and j Representatives from any and all of the ! States, there can be 110 just ground of apprehension that persons who are dis loyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation; for this could not happen when the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant ami faithful Congress. Each H?use is made the "judge of the elections, returns, audi qualifications of its own members," and may, "with the concurrence of two- 1 thirds, expel a member." When a Sena- i tor or Representative presents his cer- | titicate of election, he may at once be j admitted or rejected: or, should there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred for investi gation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a member, that j he j>ossesscs the requisite constitutional | ami legal qualifications, it retuscu an- t mission as a member for want of duel allegiance to the Government, and re turned to his constituents, they are ad monished tha* none but persons loyal to the United States will l?e allowed a voice iu the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus j effectively exerted in the interests of j loyalty "to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this j question, so vitally affecting the j restoration of the Union and the j !>ermanency of our present form j of government, my convictions, hereto- 1 fore expre.ised, have undergone no change ; but, on the contrary, their cor- j rectness has been confirmed by reflec tion and time. If the admission of loy- j al members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress was wise and exped- j ieut a year ago, it is no less wise and I expedient now. If this anomalous con-j dition is right now ? if, iuthe exact con- 1 ditiou of these States at the present j time, it is lawful to exclude them from representation, I do not see that the question will be changed by the efflux J of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of repre sentation will be no stronger? the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to recommend to the consideration of Con- j gress "such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient." I know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every consideration of national in terest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members! from the now unrepresented States. This would consummate the work of restora tion, and exert a most salutary influence J in the re-establishment of peace, har mony, and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the American people in the vigor and stability of their institution*. It would . t ' bind U9 more closely together aa a y - ? tion, and enable lis to snow to the wt?l - the inherent and recuperative power- 1 ? a Government founded upon the ul , 1 of the people, and established ? i on the principles of liberty, j? ; ! tice and intelligence. Our increajl ? ' strength and enhanced prosi?erfc> i would irrefragably demonstrate te f fallacy of the arguments agaitt ; free institutions drawn from our recet : national disorders by the enemies i republican government. The adml sion of loyal members from the Start now excluded from Congress, by alia) [ ing doubt and apprehension, woulu ? turn capital, now awaiting an opportu : nity for investment, into the channel " of trade and industry. It would allevi ate the pfeMent troubled condition o those States, and, by inducing emigra tion, aid in the settlement of fertile re ' uions now uncultivated, and lead to ai increased production of those staple! ; which have added so greatly to tin ! wealth of the nation and the commerc< of the world. New tields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon the devastations ol war would be repaired, and all traoes oi our domestic differences effaced^ from tho inuiiii ftf p"*; Tqnvftnw1 I dffeovernment which constitutes us one people," by restoring the States to the condition which they held prior tho rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, baring rescued our nation from perils of threatened disintegration, we resort to consolidation, and in the eml absolute despotism, as a remedy for the recurrence of similar troubles. Thenar having terminated, and with it all .occa sion for the exercise ol powers of doubt ful constitutionality, we should hasten to bri-?" legislation within the bounda ries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to the ancient landmarks es tablished by our fathers for the guid ance of succeeding generations. I he Constitution which at any time ex'sts, until changed by an explicit and au thentic act of the wholo people, s sa credlv obligatory npon all. It, in tni opinion of tho people, the distribution or modi licat ion of the constitutional pow ers be, iu any particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment 111 the way in which the Constitution designates.

During the fiscal ycarenuing rne .win oCAnc, 1866, the receipts Merc $55*, 0;*|reo, and tha expenditures $520,750, 940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1867, will he $475, 0(51 ,386, and that the expenditures, will reach the sum of $316,428,078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For j the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1868, it 1 is estimated that the receipts will amount to $4:16,000,000, and that the ex- ! peuditures will he $350.247,641 ? show-j ing an excess of $S5.752,359 in favor of the Government. These estimated re- 1 ceipts may be diminished by a reduc- 1 tion of excise and import duties; but 1 after all necessary reductions shall have ! been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a j large annual surplus to be applied to; the payment of the principal of the | debt. There seems now to be no good | reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in population j and wealth, and yet the debt be extin- [ guished within the next quarter of a j century.

It ? is estimated that thirty-three million dollars will be required to meet the ex igencies of this branch of the service i during the next fiscal year. Treaties have been concluded witn the Indians who, enticed into armed opposition to our Government at the outbreak of the rebellion, have uncon ditionally submitted to our authority, and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations.

As a subject upon which depends an immense amount of the production ami commerce of the country, I reeoinmenu to Congress such legislation as ma\ be necessary for the preservation of the levees of the Mississippi river. It is a matter of national importance that ear ly steps should bo taken not only to add to tho efficiency of these barriers against destructive inundations, but for the re moval Of ?J1 obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. The District of Columbia, under e\ 'isting laws, is not entitled to that ren ' resent at ion in the National Councils ' which, from our earliest history, has been uniformly accorded to each terri tory established from time totime witli 1 in our limits. It maintains peculiar re lations to Congress, to whom the Con stitution has granted the power of ex Lreising exclusive legislation oyer the ' seat of government. Our fellow-citizens residing in the District, whose interests ?ire thus confided to the special guar dianship of Congress, exceed in 11 r the population of several of our Ferito ries, ami no just reason is percei ved w h> a delegate of their choice should not t>e admitted to a seat In the Hoimo ?<f K"p- I resentatives. No mode seems so appro priate and effectual of enabling them , to make known their peculiar condition and wants, and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I "'"re* | fore recommend the passage of a law authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a delegate, to l?e j allowed the same rights and privileges i as a delegate representing a Ierritor>.l The increasing enterprise and rapid progress of improvement in tho District j are "highly gratifying, and I trust that , the efforts of the municipal authorities ( to promote the prosperity of the nation- , al metropolis will receive the eflicient , and geherons co-operation of Congress, j The report of the Commissioner of I Agriculture reviews the oj?crations ot < his Department during tho past year, land asks the aid of Congress in its et : forts to encourage those States which, ( scourged by war, are now earnestly en- , gaged in the reorganization of domestic nidustrv. , . i I n is a subject of congratulation tliat no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety, or our legiti mate influence among the nations, have lK-en formed or attempted. \N bile seiiti linents of reconciliation, loyaltj, auu patriotism have increased at home, a more just consideration of our national character and rights has been manifest ed hv foreign nations. ... .. The entire success of the Atlantic Telegrap'i between the eoast of Ireland ,?d tU Pro,i??? ?f Nc?f?mwll#nd. is an achierement which has been justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the opening of an era in the progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal success will attend, and even , creater results follow, tlie enterprise) for connecting the two Continents , through the Pacific Ocean by the pro- 1 jected line of telegraph between Kam chatka and the Russian possesions in i America. The resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign Governments of persons convicted of infamous of fences, on condition of emigration to oar csuntry, fans hem communicated to the States with which we maintain in-j tercoarae, and the practice, so justly the subject of complaint on our part, lias not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, have been presented to that humane an?l enlight ened ruler, and revived by him with expression* of grateful appreciation. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish-American adventurers to induce the emigration of freedinen of the United States to a foreign country, ! protested against the project as one j which, if consummated, would reduce ! them to a bondage even more oppres sive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assurance has been received from the Government of the State in which the plan was matured, that the proceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. It ie a question worthy of your cssodm tiou, whether our laws 'ope* this (ab ject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus med itated. In the Math of April last, sm Congress is aware, a friendly *qmngemtut was made between the Emperor of France ?nd the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. 1 Tbis withdrawal was to t three detachment*, the first ofT^.C^,i ! was understood, would leave Mexico in November, n.w urt .the ?*ond n March next, and the third and last in November, 16*57 .

Deeply interested in the cause of liberty and hnmauity, it aeeui ' e?l an obvious duty ou our part to exer cise whatever influence we possessed lor the restoration aud permanent e* ! ublishmeut in that country of a domes i tic and republicau form of government. Such wL the condition of affair. ?n regard to Mexico, when, on the ?d of ' November last, official information was ;receiv?Nl from l'aris thatthe Emperor of I France had some time before decided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the month of I according to agreement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of withdrawing the whole of those torcea | in the ensuing spring. Of this ?let? mination, however, the Lnited States had not received any notice or intima tion; ami, as soon as the information was received by the Government, tare was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. .. I cannot forego the hope that I ranee will recousider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the eviu - nation of Mexico which will conform as nearlt as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus meet the just ex pectations of the United States. The papers relating to the subject wi be laid before you. It -Ttv the with the evacuation of Mcxico by the expeditionary forces, no subject for serious differences between France and the United States would remain. H o expressions of the Eniperor and people of France warrant a hope that the tr.i ditionary friendship Wtween the two countries might in that case be renewed and permanently restored. k claim of a citizen of the United, States tor idemnity for spoliations coin mitted on the high seas by t,"c 1 "j"/*!1 1 authorities, in the exercnw of a bellig erent power against Mexico, has been met bv the Government of 1- ranee with a proposition to defer settlement until ,i mutual convention for the adjustment of all claims of citirens and subjects ol both countries, arising out of the recent wars on this Coutinent, shall beagreed upon by the two countries. The sug gestion is not deemed unreasonable, but ft belongs toCougree* to direciib?^o ner in which claim" for indeimntv J foreigners, a? well as by citl?*n? of the United States, arising out of the late civil war, shall be adjudicated and de termined. I have no doubt that the sub Set of all such claims will engage your | attention at a convenient and proper '"it is a matter of regret that no con siderable advance has been made to wards an adjustment of the diflerences between the 1'nited States and, Great Britain, arising ont of the depredat ions upon our national commerce aud other trespasses committed during our ciul war by British subjects, in violation of international law and treaty nbliga ! tions The delay, however, may be be- 1 1 lieved to have resulted in no small de-| icree from the domestic situation of, I lirvat Britain An -ntir- of ??? istry occurred in that country during | the last session of Parliament. 1 ne at- ) tention of the new ministry was called , to the subject at an early day, and then ( in some reason to expect that it wil now bo considered in a becoming and i friendly snirit. The importance of an J early disposition of the question cannot , be exaggerated. Whatever might be the wishes of the two Governments, t, is manifest that good will aud friaud- i ship between the two countries caunot be established until a reciprocity, in the ? practice of good faith and neutralitj, shall be restored between the respective | nations. On the 6th of June iast, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military ?x i >edition and enterprise sgainnt the British North American Colonies was projected and attempted to be earned on within the territory and Jurisdiction of the I'nited S ates. In obedience to the obligation imposed npon the Exec-j ntive by the Constitution, to see 'hat the laws ar?* faithfully executed, air citizens were warned, bv proclama-l tion. against taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, au? I the proper civil, military, and naval officers, were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of the laws. The exj?edition failed, but it has not been without it* painful conse- j onences. Some of our citizens who. It . was alleged, were engaged in th* expe- , dition. were raptured. and have born brought to trial, as for a capital offence, iu the Province of Canada. Judgment ^ and sentence of death have been nro nonouired ajainat wine, white otuw* have been acquitted. Folly l*li?ving in the maxim of government, thatseven ty of civil punishment for misguided per- , sons who have engaged in revolu tionary attempt* which have die-, astrouslv failed, is unsound and uuwise, I ; such representations have beeu made to jt the British Government, in behalf of the convicted persons, as. being sustained by an enlightened and humane judg- 1 inent, will, it is hoped, induce m theur ( rases an exercise ?f clemency, and a ju dicious amnesty to all who were engaged iu th* movement.

The attempt was under stood to be inadt> in sympathy with an insurgent parly in Ireland, and, by striking at a British Province on fhw Continent, was designed to aid in ob taining uttass for paMtkal grievances which, it waa n?niusd. the people of Tnrlt>m^ had saffered at the hand* of the British Government during a period of aevtcai centuries. The persons engaged hi It were rhielljr natives of that coun try, aoine of whom had, while others had not, become citizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization. Complaints of miagevernment iti Ireland continually engage the attention of the British na tion, and so great an agitation is now prevailing in Ireland that the British Government have deemed it nectcsary to suspend the writ of kabtm corpus in 1 that eonntry. Timm circumeUee* mast necessarily modify th?
