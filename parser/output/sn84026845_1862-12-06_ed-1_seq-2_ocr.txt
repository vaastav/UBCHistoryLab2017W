When I When will the Wheeling Pre? publish the President's Message ? We published it last Wednesday morning, but it has not yet appeared in the Preaa, except in a few ex tract*. Give Abraham a chance to be beArd, Mr. Editor. He is President you koow, and that much respect is due to his position even if it was not a matter of justice to yonr readers. ? ? Aa We Expected. On Thursday we asked the editor of the Preaa to tell us with a plain yea or no wheth er he did or did not endorse the Carlile bill for the formation of a new State. He re fuses to answer, fie dare not say yea or no? We call public attention to this man's tactics. He denounces the Willey bill, and hai bad article after article io bia paper, both from bis own pen and Carlile'g, ap pealing to the people to tefase to endorse it, and yet when brought to the test be dare not say that be endorses the Carlile bill. Now we desire to ask him two other questions in order to put bim fair and square where be belongs. Do you or do you not endorse the Wheel ing Convention bill for the admission of West Virginia? If so, do you condemn Carlile's abrogation of its provisions? The Governor's Message. Governor Peirpoint'a messages have al ways one quality that pre-eminently recom mend thefb, and that ia their unfalteriog and fervent loyalty. Of this character is the message submitted yesterday to the Senate and IIous*, and published this morning. Aside from the gratifying sum mary concerning the fiscal condition of 'the State, and the recommendations touch ing the Stay law, there is not much in the doenment of & strictly municipal character, to attract the attention of the reader. We have no doubt but that the Legisla ture will adopt the recommendations, or their equivalent, in the matter of the Stay law. We do not see that a better plan is likely to be devised. A proper medium between debtors and creditors these times is hard to bit. Some amelioration of the condition of creditors is imperatively de manded. The Stay law, excellent in so many instances, affords too much of an escape in exceptional cases, and the excep tions are too many. The re-districting of the State at this time ia of doubtful importance. If West Virginia is admitted, of which we have lit tle doubt, she will necessarily be re-dis tricted, and for ns here to district Eastern Virginia and the Valley, taking the popu lation by counties to be the same as in 1860, would seem to be a work of questionable propriety. \\ hen the new State is admit ted a legislature will have to be called out side its boundaries, at Alexandria or Stan ton or Richmood, and the most natural work for it wonld be the reorganisa tion of Congressional districts. Another and opposite view of the matter is, that those districts should be all ready for the loyal people to elect congressmen from, as soon as they are freed from the presence of the rebel armies. This is a good argu ment as far as it goes. The question is, does it offset the objections ? The bilk of the Governor's message ia devoted to the troubles of the State and Nation as connected with the Rebellion. It gives a hearty endorsement to the Presi dent's proclamation of the 22d of Septem ber last, and the argument, upon which the endorsement Is based, we would especially commend to our readers. Gov. Peirpoint more than any Executive in the border States, save, perhaps, Gov. Johnson, of Tennessee, has stood firmly and unflinch ingly by the Administration in its efforts against the rebels, and especially in regard to its slavery policy. Had Magoffin done . so in Kentucky, or Price in Miss juri, those 8tates would never have been overrun as they have been. We commend the Governors message more for its spirit than its letter. It bears evidence of baste, as most Governors' mes mages do these times. Bat it 13 sound and loyal to (be core, and iti influence, on our people, and wherever else It may circulate, will be to inculcate and strengthen more and more of a spirit Of determined pa triotism. 

VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE. Senate. Friday, December -6. The Senate was opened with prayer by the Rev. R V. Dodge. Mb. Hootks, from the House of Dele gates informed the Senate that the House was organized and ready to proceed to business. , Mr. Bcrlet offered the following : Resolved, As the deliberate judgment of the General Assembly of Virginia, that the Hon. John S. Carlile, Senator of the United States from Virginia, by bis failing to give to the Administration h warm and cordial support iu its efforts to crush the rebellion, and his constant and persisteut efforts to defeat the admission of the new State of West Virginia into the Union, has wilful ly and wickedly misrepresented tbe loyal sentiments of his constituents and ought not longer to hold bis seat as Senator. Be it therefore Retolved, By the General Assembly of Virginia, that tbe Hon. John S. Carlile be and is hereby respectfully requested forth with to resign bis seat as Senator of tbe United Slates. % Xrsolred, That the foregoing resolutions be signed officially by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Dele gates of Virginia, and that the Governor of tbe Commonwealth be requested, after hav ing first affixed the seal of tbe Common wealth thereto, to transmit tbe same to the President of tbe Senate of the United States with tbe request that the game be read and eutered at large in the journal ot tbe Sen ate. Mr. Bublky moved to suspend the rales that tbe resolutions might be adopted at once. Mr. Flbsher said be would offer a sub stitute for the resolution. The motion to suspend the rules was lost by a majority of one. Hou?e of Delegaten. The Bouae of Delegates met, at 2 o'clock P. M. Upon the call of the roll 22 mem bers responded to their names, A quorum being present, the f.rst busi ness was the election of Speaker, to fill the Tacancy occasioned by the resignation of Speaker Frost. &tR. Patrick nominated George McC. Porter, of Hancock. Ma. Smith nominated James G. West, of Wetzel. The vote was taken and Mr. Porter re ceived sixteen votes and Mr. West seven.? Mr. Patrick received one. Mb. Porter having been elected was con ducted to the chair by Messrs. Boreman and Patrick, whereupon be addressed the House as folllows : 

STRIKER POBTEU'S ADDRESJ Gentlemen of the Uotue of Delegate* : I thank you for entrusting me with this responsible and difficult position. It is certainly a great honor to occupy any pro minent place among the loyal people of Virginia. No people have suffered more, made greater sacrifices, contributed more liberally of their men and cf their meann, to secure, if possible, the unity of our coun try, and maintain the great charter of our liberties, than the loyal people of Virginia. Gentlemen, we cannot fail to notice the fact that some of those who have met with os heretofore are not with us to-day. Some of them have been taken prisoners by the enemy and have not yet been released.? Some of them have f'eft the halls of leg islation to enter the army ; and one of our member?, the warm-hearted, patriotic dele gate from Mason, is no more of earth. I trust that the vacant seat and silent desk of Lewis Wetzel will teach un a lesson. Gentlemen, we hare met together again to legislate for the State of Virginia. The people expect us to provide for their wel fare without changing loo much the an cient usages and forms to which they have been accustomed. They expcct us to avoid the two extremes of hasty legislation and of protracted unprofitable discussion. I hope gentlemen that we will all discharge our duties faithfully; and if any other stim ulant are wanted than patriotism and our interests, I trust that we will not forget the memories of the herots who have made this country and government, and that we will nol forget that when hereafter the histo rian shall describe the eventful scenes which now aurrotiod us, he will not negltct tojex amine our own transactions. I shall enter, gentlemen on the discharge of the duties to which you have assigned me, with a determination to do as far us I can justice to all. 1 hope you will assist me. A messngo from the Senate Announced the readiness of that body to proceed to business. On motion of Mr. Hootox, a committee of three (Messrs. Hooton, West, Logan) was appointed to wait upon the Governor and inform bim of the readiness of tbre House to receive any communication be rnigbt be pleased to send in. A motion of Mr. Patrick to appoint an additional doorkeeper was not agreed to. The same gentleman moved when the House adjourn, it adjourn till to-morrow at ten A. M., and it was agreed to. Mr. Cbothkbs offered a resolution, which was agreed to, granting leave to withdraw from the files of the House the paper touch ing the residuary fund of the estate of Pe ter Currain, deceased, of Brooke county, and referring the same to the Committee on Schools and Colleges. Mr. Kramkb offered a paper setting fortb that the Auditor bad publicly charged that A. S. Trowbridge, State Printer, bad on the 3d of June last presented an ACCOQQt of $1,250 to him, (the Auditor,) which was paid, for binding Qve thousand copies of the Acts of Assembly,at which time he had delivered but 1200 copies of the book, and thus procured money not earned; and pro fiding for * Committee of the House to enquire into the charge, and also to examine the accounts presented by the Public Printer to the Auditor upon which money has been drawn, and report to the House the result of the investigation. Mr. Smith offered a substitute providiog for a Committee of five?three from the House and two from the Senate?to en quire into the manner in which the Public Printer had discharged bis duties; whether he had done all the public printing, and if so how much and in what manner; whether any part had been done for the State by any other person, if so at what price, in what manner and by whom authorized, and report to the House upon these and such other matters concerning the same as they may deem proper. Mr. Wilson moved to amend it by a joint atandiog Committee, but withdrew the motion, and Mr. Smith's substitute was adopted. Mr. Crothrbs offered a resolution that pending the inqsiry aa to the pnblic print ing, the Speaker appoint a committee of three whose dnty it shall be to cause the printiog of the House to be done where in their opinion it ckn be most favorbly done. Mr. Vakcb objected and the resolation laid over. Mr. Looax offered a paper setting forth tbat at a meeting of tbe city Council of Wheeling held December 3d, 1802, a reso lotion.bad t>een adopted declaring it ex pedient to establish two branches of tbe Council of the city of Wheeling, and re questing the Legislature to enact tbe legis- [ lation necessary; and also a resolution requesting tbe Legislature to amend the 5th section of tbe act of incorporation rf the city Wheeling so as to relieve from dis qualification of voting such persons ns have failed to pay taxes assessed on real estate, j and moved that the subject of the Brat reso- j lotion be referred to tbe Committee on j Courts of Justice, and of tbe second to the Committee ou Finance. Tbe motion was agreed to. The came gentleman moved a resolution of inquiry in reference to the incorpora tion of tbe Franklin Insurance Company of Wheeling. lie also moved a similar reso lution in regard to amending the 8th sec tion of the act "imposing taxes for tbe support of the Government," so as to make the tax upon di vidends of savings institutions and insur ance companies upply to all dividends de clared by such companies and institutions. Mr. Farkswobtd moved a resolotion of inquiry into the cxpedieucy of repcrtiug a bill repealing the act #of 12th of March 1862, incorporating the town of ttuckbau non, Upshur county. Mr. Crothers moved a similar resolotion concerning tbe remission of Military fines imposed on tbe members of the Wellsburg Union Fire Company. A communication wns received from tbe Governor transmitting his message which was read as follows: governor's message. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Constitution of the State makes it the duty of tbe Executive to convene the Legislature, "when in his opinion, the in terests of tlie Commonwealth may re quire it." In obedience to that require ment I have convened you at this time. I regret that I cannot congratulate you on the existence of peace and prosperity ip all our borders, but we have cause of profound thankfulness to the Great Dis penser of all blessings for so much, of the State as lias been held from^Jie hand of rebel spoiler. The Constitution make5 it the duty of the Executive to "communicate the condi tion of the Commonwealth to even* ses sion of the Legislature." I regret that there is a portion of the State still held by the rebels in arms against both State and Federal authority, the condition of which I cannot fully place before you. RK-M8THICTING THE STATE. By an official communication from the Department of the Interior, a copy of 1 which will be found among the accompa nying documents, "the Commonwealth of Virginia is entitled to Eleven (11) mem bers in the House of Representatives for the 38th Congress, and until another appor tionment shall be made according to law.'? The Constitution places the duty of re districting the State upon the General Assembly, and in order that justice may be done and the interests of the people consulted, it is essentially necessary that the districts be formed" of contiguous counties, cities and towns, that they be compact and include, as near as may be, equal numbers of inhabitants. I com mend this subject, gentlemen, to your candid consideration, feeling confident that you will exert yourselves to promote the general welfare of the people. T1IE REBELLION. With such ample means of information I as von all possess, JdyemJt unnecessary! to enter into details as to the progress of! the rebellion since your last adjournment. The people of Virginia have suffered more in the loss of life and property, than any State in the Union. T he rebel regiments of the State now number about 15# in the I Confederate service. The rebel troops ! of Virginia and Louisiana, from rej>orts of prisoners captured, have done the greater part of the hard fighting of the rebel army in the east. Vast numbers of them hare been killed, and have died from diseases contracted in camp. The Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missis sippi troops, who were so boastful of their prowess in the commencement of the re bellion, claim to be the aristocracy of the army, and too refined to do the fighting, but "desire the posts of Honor and ease. The inferiority of troops from those States fully appears when brought into conflict with the Federal troops in the west. Vir gininia has, in fact, been the chief sup port ofthe rebellion, both in men and I supplies, down to the present. As a re sult, her people are suffering for tllO neces saries of life, on and beyond the Confed erate lines. It has been the policy of the Confederate leaders, to gather* through out the StatCj within their lines, all the stock and grain for the use of the army, leaving no subsistence for the old and helpless; and now whole districts arc in a suffering condition for the necessaries of life. If the present winter should be an inclement one, the suffering of these peo f>le will be beyond a parallel in the listory of this country. The only hope that exists in their case is. that the rebel army will soon be driven from the State; and that the samo spirit which prompted the people to send supplies across the ocean to feed the starving mil lions there, may prompt the wealthy to sympathise with tne starving and impov erished people of Virginia, who have been robbed to sustain the ambition of the demagogues who inaugurated this rebel lion. A military necessity required a part of the army to be withdrawn from the Jvan awha Valley, in August last, thereby re ducing our forces so that they were una ble to resist the rebel army which occu pied Charleston aud that Valley for about six weeks. During that period, they car ried away about 2,500 barrels of salt, and completely robbed the people of every thing they had of a movable character. They murdered a number of men for no other cause than that of their adherence to the Union. Many of these people, thus robbed, have not the means of sub sistence. Some have gone the State of Ohio, others cannot get away. Some measures should be adopted by which the poor, at least, of that district, can be furnished with supplies during tne com | ing winter and spriug. Gentlemen, why all this suffering aud ! violence ? What have the people of Virgin ia done, that they should drink to the very dregs, this cup of bitterness and woe?? I When did the people bcoome dissatisfied j with the Federal Government? What acts of oppression did the Government ever im I pose on tbern? We cannot disguise the E trnth from our minds, that ibe slave oligar chy of the South has forced all this misery on the people icithovt giving them time to coruid | rr, to choose and to act for themselves. In the bUtory of the world we tind that re bellion has generally been tbe resale of ty ranny, oppression and suffering; but ia tbe present instance, it is tbe result of pride and arrogance, begotten by the accustomed dominion of the master orer tbe slave.? Tbe great masses were contented and hap py. The leaders, wealthy and overbear ing, tired of republican institutions and tbe equality the people enjoyed in the ex ercise of the right of suffrage, knew they could saeceed, only by breaking up the Government and by re-modelling the Con stitution under the power of a military des potism. The mode by which the/ succeed ed, is too familiar to all to need repetition. That thej were tired of republican insti tutions and inteuded their overthrow, is ap parent from their own declarations. Their prominent statesmen were constantly im pressing on the public mind, in Congress and through the press, that "free institu tions! free labor and free schools were a failure;" "that no government was stable where labor w.?a represented in the law making department; that it was necessary to stability that capital should own labor; that the working classes of the North were no belter than the slaves of the South ; that slavery aud democracy were incompat ible; that the laboring man was only on an equality with the slave, and ought not to vote because he hid not sufficient intelli gence." The Southern States bad enjoyed repub lican institutions since the adoption of the Federal Constitution. Not a single right had been infringed in any State. If they were satisfied with republican institutions, why inaugurate the rebellion, as they do not propose to secure any additional rights to the people. Their object cannot be to diminish taxation, for they abolish no offi ces, nor decrease any salaries. It will cer tainly cost more to maintain two Govern ments than one. There can, then, be no other object than to tob the people of their rights as freemen, and impose on them heavy burdens of taxation. These facts must be patent to every thinking man ; and yet we have thousands in our midst, who are sympathizing with the rebellion, and many of them among the laboring class es. TI1E 

PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION OF SEP TEMBER 22d. I do not know any of the peculiar rea sons of the President for issuing the proc lamation of September 22d, which has called forth so much discussion throughout the country Tbat proclamation declares *lall persons held as slaves on the 1st of January, 18G3, within nny State or desig nated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the Uui ted States, shall be then, thenceforward urn? forever free;" but it also declares, "that if any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress ot the United States, by mem bers chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voter* of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States." 1 endorsed tbat proclamation at the meet ing of the Governors of the loyal Stntes at i Altoona, held ou the 24th of September and it is due. you that I state the public reasons which caused my endorsement.? The Cbnfoderate States had formed their Constitution, based on the declaration that "Slavery teat its chief corner-stone," and upon that they inaugurated the rebellion and brought ou the war. Nearly sixteen months had passed since the war was corn* menced. Little progress had been made. Six hundred and fifty thousand men bad been brought into the field by the Federal Government. That army had* been greatly reduceffby battle, sickness and desertion. In consequence of the large addition to the Confederate army by their conscription acts, it was deemed necessary to call for Six hundred thousand more. The people responded with great zeal in furnishing the required number. The leaders of the rebellion had Impress ed (he oiinds of the slaves with the idea that the Federal Government would take aud sell them to the sugar planters of Cu ba, to defray the expenses of the war. ? Thus the slaves themselves, to a great ex tent, became active partizans within the Confederate lines. They were everywhere engaged in doing the scrvilo work of the camp, and, in many instances, in perform ing the duty of the soldier. All other business than carrying on the war, was suspended. Their whole energies were directed to the prosecution of the rebellion. Their slaves number more than four roil lions; nnd they were engaged, in addition to the duties before nlluded to, in raising supplies of every kind for the maintenance of the army; while ut the North, all our agricultural, commercial manufacturing, and educational pursuits, being carried on by while men, it may be safely estimated, i that the four millions of slaves engaged in | the production of the sinews of war. are equal to eight millions of men at the North carrying on the pursuits before mentioned. This state of facts stood out in bold re lief to all candid observers. It was appar ent that while slavery is the atrenyth of the confederates and afforded them the great est assistance, it was, also, their weakness and could be easily turned to their over throw. It was evident that all the indus trial pursuits of the loyal states must be stopped, the army increased from one mil lion to fifteen hundred thousand, or the confederates must be stricken at their wenkest point and an end put to the war. The President chose the latter course, and placed before them the alternative of re turning to their allegiance, or universal j emancipation in all the states and districts , which refused compliance with the require- ! meuts of the proclamation. Subsequent events have shown that as far as the sue- < | cess of the Federal army Is concerned, it has had a happy effect. Our armies in the I Southwest have been successful, equal to oor most sanguine expectations ; and, con ' sidering all the circumstances, we have nothing to disoourage ns for want ol suc cess in the East. It is objected to the proclamation that it is a mere declaration on the part of the President, that it could not reach beyond our lines, and, therefore, could have no effect on the slave. The rebels do not re gard it in that light. They prohibited its publication in their papers, (although it found its way into several of them before the prohibition,) fearing its effect among the slaves ; yet it is a well-ascertained fact that the slaves are fully aware of its exis tence, and of the change it proposes in their status. It is also objected that the proclamation will produce insurrection, and the helpless will fall victims to slave violence. This is equally a fallacy; and the objector should remember that the rebel soldier would be belter engaged in protecting bis wife and children from servile insurrection at home, than in slaughtering hig brethren of the North upon the battle field. The only question tor the President to deoide was, wnether it woul<^ hasten the close of the rebellion,?re-establish the integrity of the Union and save the lives of the Union sol diers, by iseuing the proclamation or with holding it. It was his business to look after the saving of the lives of the soldiers who bad patriotically gone to the battle field to put down the rebellion,?to return them, speedily, to their parents, wives and children. The slaves are the strength of the rebel lion. If the master has the right, uninter ruptedly, to use bis slave for the overthrow of the Government, it cannot be shown that he has not the right to have all the South ern porta opened through which he can furnish himself more thoroughly with all the munitions of war. It is further objected, that it is an aboli tion measure, and infracts the Constitution of the United States. So far from its being an abolition measure, it is the reverse. If they return to their allegiance, slavehold era will have all the guarantees thai they ! shall be protected by all the laws of the land io the possession of the slaves. The Abolitionist's idea i?to free, unconditional ly, all slaves, whether they belong to loyal or disloyal masters. Nor is it an infrmc tioo of the Constitution of the United States. The President is Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, and it Is made bis du ty "to suppress rebellion and insurrection." These rebels have rights under the Con stitution. or they have no rights. If they have rights, the Government is already re sponsible for every slave that has escaped, from his master; tor every horse that has been taken, for every bushel of grain, pound of hay and rod of fence, whether for the use of the army, or destroyed hy IL? According to this proposition, it Gen. Burn side should bombard and burn Fredericks burg, every rebel property owner in that city would be entitled to compensation.? The Emperor of Russia burnt the city of Moscow to prevent his enemy from using it as a shelter from the rigor of winter in that iohospitnble climate. Two hundred thousand men have been slain in battle and by diseases incident to camp life,?thous ands of fathers and mothers mourn the loss of sons,?widows are4:lotbed in weeds of mourning.?children are rendered father less and left penniless; yet no one raises the cry of constitutionality at this; but when the President sees clearly that the strength of the rebellion is in their slaves, and issues a proclamation to deprive tbein of that source of power, it is declared to be unconstitutional! and *bese objectors place the right of property in slaves above that in every other species of property, and even over the right to life itself. The President was bouad, as an honest man, it in bis judgment he could shear the rebels of their strength and shorten the war. thereby saving the life of the Union, to i-sue the proclamation, even if it should bring the rebels to beggary. It is a re markable fact, but one well attested, that those who are loudest in their objections to the proclamation, have done the least to sustain the war. It is our duty fi3 American citizens, the guardian* of the liberties purchased by our forefathers and transmitted to us, to look ibis subject fairly in the face, and de cide between republican liberty, and Afri can. or any other kind of slavery. We have bee 11 taught to believe, that God, by His Diviuc Providence, had established republican freedom in this country, to show the world, that man is capable of self government. I embrace that great fact with every faculty of my nature. The revolution of '76 was not a vain thing. The leaders of the rebellion, after a trial of 82 years, are satisfied that slavery and re publican institutions are incompatible. Many of them are eirnest, sincere men. Th% think the masses are incapable of self-government; and as an earnest of their faith, have inaugurated tbis rebellion to deprive the working classes of their rights. They being the judges, choosing between Demociatic institutions and slavery, have chosen slavery, and have sought to break up the Government We are simply try ing to preserve the Constitution and the Union, and to enforce the Laws The Constitution guarantees to every State a republican form of government, and it is our duty as freemen to stand hy our char ter of liberty. We know that republican government has bestowed such blessings on the free States as no other people ever enjoyed; and supposed the tame blessings had been enjoyed by the slave States. But those beat acquainted with the facts (the rebels,) have decided differently. They are naked by the Presideut to return to thek allegiance under the Constitution tcith I slavery. If they return, slavery is gnur anteed to them; if they refuse, a republi- j c m form of government will be given to j every State, without slavery, and every r;gbt any loyal man has in the South will be guaranteed to him under the Constitu tion. But if, perchance, a loyal man in the ! South should suffer. it onlv ad-is another I one to the thousands of cases of good men suffering by their associations with,or prox imity to, bad inen. To consent to a di vision of the Union is to consent to the de struction of Constitutional liberty; and to treat with rebels on any terms short of un conditional submission, 13 trifliogwitb the lives and happiness of the thousands who j have been rendered penniless by this re bellion. To estimate, properly, the enor mity of the crime of this war against our liberties, you should visit the army, the hospitals fur the sick and convalescent; you should hear the wail oftbe widow and orph an, bereft of their protector slain upon the battle field, or who yielded up bis life in the hospital. It is only by being brought in contact with such scenes ot mtsery and woe, tho natural consequences flowing from the unholy ambition of the leaders of the rebellion, thai you can form a correct idea of the baseness of the crime attempt ed to be perpetrated upon our people. Nor is the proclamation in conflict with the declaration of the President and the resolution of both houses of Congress, in the commencement of this struggle, viz: "that the prosecution of war against the rebels w*9 not to abolish slavery." It was a necessity, forced upon the Commander-in Chief by the pertinacity with which they waged the war for the destruction of the government. The idea, too, that its pro mulgation would increase the desperation of the rebels and protract the war, is equal ly fallacious. Their desperation culmina ted in their conscript laws, be/ore the pro clamation was issued, and since its issue, dismay and despair are visible in the tone of their press and army, and in the innu merable desertion of their soldiers. Gentlemen, it only requires unanimity of action and determination of purpose, such determination as is felt by freemen, alone, in fightiog for constitutional liberty, to crush out, speedily, the rebellion and re store peace to our distracted country. At one period during the past season, our cause looked dark, and it seemed as if victory would perch upon the banners of treason and rebellion. Cotemporaneous with the call for six hundred thousand troops to re plenish our army, a school of politicians sprang up throughout the country, advising | the people to wail and see wbethcrthe war was conducted constitutionally before they j enlisted. This advice prevented thousands from enlisting, and, for a season, our cause looked gloomy, but, with a patriotic ardor, the people came to the res | cue and our ranks were rapidly fill ed with fresb troops. If the ooansel of that : miserable class of politicians who assumed to be the special guardians of the CooBtitu I lion, had been followed, Lee wonld have gone triumphantly to Philadelphia, instead | of stopping in Maryland; Bragg would have I captured Louisville and Cincinnati, and | Loring would have succeeded in complete ly overrunning Western Virginia. But for | the timely assistance rendered by the fresh I troops raised under the first and secood | calls of the President, our beautiful Na | tional Capitol would bave fallen into the hands of the Despoiler; and we owe a debt | of gratitude to those stout hearts and strong arms that resisted so successfully I the northward march of the rebel hordes and secured the salvation of the nation.? Yet I am inclined to the opinion, that these amiable, constitution-loving gentlemen tneant only, that they did not desire their particular friends to volunteer until after the election, In prder that they might have the benefit of their votes; aod bad the pa* triolic volunteers, who rushed to the bat tle field in the hour of danger aad peril, taken their advice, all would have been lost.

I have conversed with many In telligent gentlemen, holding different views as to the propriety of re-eoacting or per mitting it to Expire; but ?s you are fr?b from the people, and can form a more cor rect judgment of tlteir sentiment upon the subject than I am able, I leave it to your candid and careful consideration. I may be allowed to suggest. however, that it baa occurred to me, a law might be parsed which would, lo maoy instances, be o. great advantage to both debtor and creditor.? Let tbe creditor require tbe debtor to pay twenty-five per cent of the debt, loterest and cost in ninety days after the pats ace,of the act, and twenty-five per cent, nl tbe end of each ninety days until tbe whole debt is discharged; and on fail ure to pay the specified amount at the ex piration of time proposed,let execution issue sue for the balance of claim unpaid, includ ing interest and coat. I would except the officers and soldiers io tbe army from the provisions of this law ; nor should any e,vU process be issued against them until ninety days after their discharge from the serriee. sanum. I desire to call your attention to an Act of tbe General Assembly entitled "An Act to provide for tbe extension of time for Sheriffs of thii Commonwealth lo execute writs of fieri facia t on certain judgments, passed February 13, 186J. That act de clares "that the present Sheriffs In tbe Com monwealth shall be allowed twelve montbl after the expiration of the present Stay Lhw, to execute any writ of fieri faciat is sued on judgments in any of the County and Circuit Courts of litis Commonwealth daring tbe present terra of said SberifU And this Act further declares, "that it shall be the duty of the Clerks of the sev eral County and Circuit Courts lo direct all such writs lo the said present Sheriffs, as if the same bod been issued during their S lid term as aforesaid." Tbe term for which Sheriffs are elected, is fixed by tbe Constitution at two years. Their bonds are taken in accordance there with, and their sureties are held, only, for their official acts during tliat period. The effect of this Act is lo prolong the term of tbe Sheriffs; and that period being fixed by the Constitution, cannot be changed by legisUlixe enactment; nor can tbe sureties be responsible beyond tbe pe riod for which tbe Sheriff was elected. I respectfully request that tbe act be re pekled. 

LOYAL VOLl'STESBS. That portion of the State wbieh resisted the tide of secession, deserves great credit fur tbe Dumber of soldiers it has furnished for the suppression of tbe rebellion. It il gratifying to me to be able to report, that we have famished nearly nineteen regi ments of infantry and cavalry, besides 6 re batteries of artillery ; but it is more espe cially gratifying to know that oor brave troops stand second to none in tbe armies of the Onion. They are earnest men,? men who have experienced tbe mnltitnde of evils flowing from tbe rebellion; and many of them have sealed their devotion to the Union by offering up their lives as sacri fices on many a well-contested field. auditor's eipobt. I transmit, herewith, a copy of the An- j ditor's report. It shows the financial oper ations of the Government for the fiscal I year ending the 30th of September last.? | Tbe receipts from all sources during that | period were two hundred and five thous and two hundred and fifty-one dollars and eighty cents; and tbe expenditures, one hundred and sixty-five thousand four hun dred and fifty dollars and seventeen cents; (including a large sum expended on ac count of tbe United States,} leaving in the treasury one hundred and twenty thousand one hundred and fifty-seven dollars and forty-seven cents, on the 1st of October.? When it is remembered tbat tbe revenues cannot be collected in but very few conn ties, and tbat a large portion of tbe expen ditures have been for extraordinary purpo ses, this exhibit is tbe more gratifying, and is proof of the signal ability with which this branch of the government has bean conducted. I beg leave tocallyour atten tion to the suggestions found in the re port, commendingtbem to your wisdom and candid deliberation. XMAXCIPJLTIOX or 8LATKS. Whether, under existing circumstances, it woold be proper to legislate upon the subject of the emancipation of slaves, par ticularly on the conditions proposed in the proclamation of the President daring the last session of Congress, I leave for you to determine, with the remark, however, that you represent constituencies baring bat little interest in that nnfortonate class. I hope, in a short time, to see a fall delega tion of loyal men in the General Assembly, (including those portions of the State large ly interested in slaves,) when that serious and thorough consideration can be given to this 8abject which its importance demands. cosrcLceias. Gentlemen, it is oar fortaae to lire in these times of fearfal responsibilities and duties. We are makiog history to be read by, and exert its influence apoa,eom!ng generations. If there be a time when our legislator*, both State and National, have need of <(that wisdom which cometh down from above," it is now, when hosts of bad men have conspired to destroy the fair fabric of government founded by oar fathers.? Without unanimity and determination of purpose our cause is lost; aod not oura only, for the down-trodden of earth every where, are anxiously awaiting the result of this contest between Liberty and Despot ism. If we succeed, brave hearts and stout arms, elsewhere, will be nerved to throw off the fetters that have so long bound them; if we fail, our failure will bat serve to bind them the more securely. With a deep sense of onr responsibility, and with an earnest supplication to the Great Source of all strength for assistance in the discbarge of oar respective duties daring this momentous crisis, let as enter upon the work before us.
