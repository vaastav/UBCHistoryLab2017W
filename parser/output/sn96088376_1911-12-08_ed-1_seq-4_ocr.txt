CIVIC IMPROVEMENT ' IN STREET LIGHTING. Ornamental Globes and Pelts Are Big Factor In Beutifioation, Since man must of necessity spend considerable portion of his time un der mime sort of artificial Hunt out of doon It would seem appropriate that something ho siild here concerning ilvlc Improveuient lu street lighting. We are sometimes prone to rvslgu ourselves to our present eoudltloa with no thought as to what we niliiht ac complish alone certain lines It we merely received the Impetus. This state of affairs Is only too manifest lu the street lighting equipment of the average city. As a rule the citliens of even a large city are satisfied with a poorly arranged system of glaring, sputtering arc lamps lu the business districts aud rows ot gas taiups sur mounting unsightly wooden or metal AN

Nothing is more er roneous thun this Idea. There Is now a street lighting sys tem in use In many cities of the coun try which Is attracting widespread fa vorable comment This modern form of street lighting Is known undt-.r sev eral names, but poeslbly the most com mon Is "ornamental street lighting." In this system ornamental cast Iron or concrete posts, surmounted by tung sten lamps with Inclosing glass ball globes, are placed at short Intervals along both sides of the street. Such posts when properly selected and placed mid equipped with suitable lumps and globes will furnish a street light which Is exceedingly efficient both In illumination results and In appear ance. The decorative value of the orna mental system Is one of Its most Im portant features. One who has never seen a city street bounded on each side by a long row of ornamental posts, each surmounted by several clear white ball globes, such as those known as "alba," can scarcely realize the decorative effect produced. The re sult Is not to be compared with that produced by the old fashioned gas lamps, the so called "beautiful" arch system of Incandescent lamps, or the Inartistic arc lamp. . The daylight appearance of any street lighting system should also be con sidered. A well designed post when carefully set and equipped with alba ball globes Is a thing of beauty by any as well as by night Its appear ance Is Infinitely better than that of a blackened wooden pole supporting a mnze of wires and an ngly arc lamp. The Illuminating result produced by any street lighting system Is of prime Importance and Is certainly a matter for the consideration of any one who Is interested In civic Improvement. In this respect the ornamental system Is unexcelled. By employing the proper spacing of posts nod the proper size of lamps and observing a few other contributing factors the Illuminating results obtained from such n system will be eminently satisfactory. The illumination will be amply sufficient, well distributed, comfortable to the eye. cheap to produce and at the same time ornamental. Asphalt and Wood Laid Parallel. Running parallel with each other and only one block apart, two streets, one Just paved and the other about to be. will furnish on interesting experi ment test of the durability of the dif ferent materials used. Harrison street, from Adnms street to Jefferson nve nue. In Peorln. III., bus been paved with asphalt and was thrown open fo traffic recently. Liberty street next to Harrison, is about to be paved with creosote wood block, and the work will be done under the supervision of an expert, who will see that every block contains the required amount of creosote. . Town Has Filtered Watsr. Citizens of Durnnt, Okln.. are now supplied with filtered water from the new filtration plant ntly construct ed for the city waterworks system. The plant cost about $18,000 and has been in course of construction for more than a year. The work of Con tractor Erlckson was twice stopped by mandamus proceedings. U ) u ? 1 -1 1 1 1 1 62ND SESSION OF CONGRESSGONVENES Regular Session Opened Mon day With Prospects of Pro tracted Meeting. Washington The first regular ses sion ot the Blxty second Congress Opened Monday. Having perfected us organisation when it met In extraor dinary session lust spring, Congress waa ready to begin work. Investigate Anti-Trust Lesgut. An investigation of the operation ot the so-called AntlTrUst League was demanded by Republican Leader Mann In the House at the opening session, after a remarkable speech by Repre sentative Martin W. Littleton, ot New York, who charged Henry II. Martin, secretsry of the league, with attempt ing to defame him. Mr. Littleton as sailed Martin and others as In con spiracy to use the Steel invest gating committee to depress the value of stocks In Wull Street , President Upholds Sherman Law. President Taft in his message stat ed that, owing to the number of Im portant subjects calling for comment, It was Impossible to Include a discus sion of them In one message ot rea sonable length and, therefore, he would transmit a series of messages between the opening of Congress and the adjournment fur the Christmas holidays. 1 His first message dealt with anti trust legislation. The President stated that he was strongly opposed to the repeal or amendment of the Sherman law, and suggested that the law should be strengthened by supplemcn tal legislation. He Urged the enact ment of some sort of federal Incorpor ation act and the creation of a federal corporation commission. Must Do Over Extra Session Work. Much ot the work ot the extra ses sion which President Taft called In order to pass the Canadian reciprocity agreement, must be done over again. The President vetoed the tariff revi sion bills passed by the Democrats and the Republican Insurgents, and both factions are armed for the tray once more. The Democrats have a good work ing majority in the House, and the Important bills on their program will be passed quicsiy. Tariff and constructive corporation legislation are the two items of gen oral Interest standing out from the rest in the line of serious business. As soon as President Taft sends In his tariff message, following the report made to him by the tariff board, the Democrats of the ways and means committee will shape their program. It is practically assured that whatever the ways and means committee puts forward, whether wholly en rapport with the tariff board findings or not, will pass the House. Many Tariff Bills Coming. The probability Is that there will be a series ot measures revising vari ous schedules In conformity with the plan followed last summer. The real tariff fight will follow In the Senate with the result uncertain now and with the Impending complications wearying to contemplate In view of the balance of power held by the In surgents and the lack of harmony in the ranks of the Senate Democrats The corporation legislative prob lem la even more vexing than that pertaining to the tariff. The rresl- dent and his friends are hopeful that non partisan public sentiment will force the parties to co-operate and place a federal corporation' law on the statute books. Panama Canal Legislation. The coming session Is expected to develop the first legislation for the operation, maintenance and govern ment of the Panama canal and the canal zone. Everything that Congress has done In the past regarding the great artificial waterway has been dl rected toward construction. The question of tolls tor use of the canal and ' its permanent fortification are two of the big subjects that it Is ex pected will be embodied In legislation Introduced during the session. It Is not believed, however, that much leg islation will be passed on the future of the canal, It being attempted large' ly as a formative precaution to test the sentiment toward the different plans suggested. 1 Will Do Little Before Holidays. But little constructive legislation Is expected before the Christmas holt days. After the reading of the Presi dent's annual message both houses settled down to the introduction of bills and preliminary skirmishing In advance of the real' battle that will begin after the Chiistmas recess. The House Democrats will then plunge at once Into the consideration of the tariff revision bills and the an nual appropriation measures. The re port of the tariff board on the whole schedule "will be submitted shortly after Congress convenes.
