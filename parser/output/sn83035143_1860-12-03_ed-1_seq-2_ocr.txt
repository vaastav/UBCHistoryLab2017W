Such a man wonld be an honor to any Cabinet.' And h would be eminently right and proper for ifr. Lincoln, should he see fit to do to, to inTite Mr. Clay to be oae of his adviser. The more so, because Mr. Clay is a ciliren of the South, and it is but right and just for the President to select men from that section whose views, so far as the principles of the Republican party are concerned, are iu .uni son with his own. The appointment of Mr. Clay to a st in the Cabinet wonld not b more objectionable. to the South, than was to 'be North the a? pointment by Jaces K.
