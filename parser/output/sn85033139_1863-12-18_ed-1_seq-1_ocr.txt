It will puz z'e the country to know what to make of! this p! in—especially to reconcile the in-j consistencies and contradictions it,voiced | in its birth. Assuming the prerogatives j of imperial power, the president defers to congress and the courts. Asserting the 'mrnulabtliff of h a emancipation decree he declares hrure obligation to obey it to be a matter fo> judicial determination. — A ■-sliming rebe' states to have ex ingu'sh e l themselves b' a SOM oi political s utcide, he getierou-lv indii ale* a purpose to recog nize old sta’e boundatie*. Alleging a right in him-elf to organize *'a e govern meiits upon his own conditions and to fix the terms of their admission to the Utii'n, he admit* that congre-* on'y can deter mine their right to rcpre-eu'atton in that bod v. Denting Ida right as a civil magis irate to abolish s'averv, he iusi-ts upon his right a- an armv officer to abolish -li very and tit legislate for ii during all time to tome. Professing adesi e'to restore the Union, he affirms his pet-onal deter mutation to accept no reconstruction not based upon the freedom of the negro Talking as commander in chief of the fed eral armies, he proceed* lo make law ! k* a whole leg'slamre Talking as the chief executive of the government, l.e intimate* hi* independence of obligati -n to cot solu tion aid law.
