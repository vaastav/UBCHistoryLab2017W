I did so in language which I caunot improve and which, there fore, I beg to repeat. One section of our country believe slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it to be wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substan tial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law, for the sup pression of the African slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the the Iaw9 itself. The great body of the peo ple abide by the legal obligations in both cases and a few break over each. This I think cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worae in both instances after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperftctly sup pressed, would bo ultimately, revived with out restriction in one section, while fugitives now only patially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all in tho other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate, we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassible wall between them. A husband a^d wife mav bo divorced and go,out of th* presence ana beyond the reach of each other. But the different part of our country cannot do this. They canno.t Uut remain, face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible then to n:ake that intercourse more advan- ®r more satisfactory after separation before. Can aliens make treaties eat ier than freinds vm make laws Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends Sup pose you go to war, you cannot tight al ways, and when after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fight ing, and the identical old questions as to'in U 1 are upon us. There is no line, from east to west, upon a line be The fact ot separation if it comes, gives upon the part of the seceding section, the fiugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations, upon the section s ceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place.

Our national life springs not from our permanent past, not from the lands we in habit, not from our national homesteal There is no possible swerving of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its applications and attitudes it i I o n s n i o n o w y er n||]c[| of ,ood ,n(f [rt .„ure tho separa­ tion might cost. Our strife pertains to our selves, to the passing generations of men and it cannot, without convulsion, he hush ed forever, with the passing of one genera tion. With this view I recomn end the following resolution and articles amendatory to :he Constitution of the United States Resolved. By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, that tho follow ing articles be proposed to the legislatures or Conventions of the several States, all, or any of which articles when ratified bv three fourths of the said Legislatures or Conven tions, to be yalid as part or parts of the said Constitution, namely ARSKM.B—.Every State wherein slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the first of Jauuary, in the year of our Lord 1900, eac'1 may be called compensated emancipation.— *',e ^'^^h census of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such States, by in stallments, or in one parcel, at the comple tion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same nhal! have been gradual or at one time within srch State, and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid and afterwards. slave shown to have been therein by A-iy h*vin^ received bonds a* afore-' said, and afterward* introducing or tolera ting slavery therein, shad refy/id to the United Stateg the bonds *o received or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon

ARTICLE Congress may appropriate money or otherwise to provide for colonizing free colored persons, with their own consent at any place qe pUoea within tfco United Stat I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion should never have existed vithotU slavery it could not continue. Among the friends of the Uuion there ia gncat rhversreyof sentiment and policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation and some would abolish it gradually and with cempensation. Some would remove the free people from us, and some would retain them and there are yet other minor diversities. Be cause of these diversities we *aste mach strength in struggles amongst ourselves Bv mutual concession we should harmonize and act together. This would be a compromise among the friends and not the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to en body a plan of such mn tual concession. If the plan shall he adopted, it is assumed that eman cipation will follow, at least in several of the States. In the first article the main points are First. The emancipation. Second, The length of time for consumatiug, in years and, Thiol. The compensation. The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual, slavery, but the length of time should greatlv mitigate tbeir dissatisfaction.

This future we relinquish by the folly and evils of disunion, or by long ex hausting war springing from the only great ele ment of discord among us, while it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, bringing lesser ones, would indefi nitely retard the population, ctyiluetiou aud prosperity. No one can doubt that the extent of it wou}d be verv great and injurious, The proposed emancipation would shorten this war, perpetuate peace, insure the increase in population, and proportionably the increase in the wealth of ti^e country. With this we should pay all that emancipation would cost, without our ulber debU. easier psy bar other debts without it, /'•. V 11 to 6 per cent, tier annum, pimple intercft, from tho end of our revolutionary struggle till to day. without paying anything, either princi pal or interest, each man of us would owe lese upon that debt now than each man owed upou it then, and thus because our increase of men through the whole period baabeen greater than 1 per cent, and has run (aster than the inter est upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation so long as its population increases faster than un paid interest nccumulates on its dsbt. This fact would be no excuse for delaying the pay ment of what is justiy due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection, and the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000, 000, what by a different policy we would have to now when the number is 1,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay lor the war, than a dollar for emaucipa {tion-on the proposed plan, aud then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving ofbotli. A» to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to Icud^e the classs of pardons therein contemplated.
