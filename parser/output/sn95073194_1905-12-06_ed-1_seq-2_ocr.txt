LINCOLN James Brady, of Al bion, one of the ofHcers of the State Co-Operative Elevator association, who has been in the city, predicts that the state meeting to be held in Lincoln January 17 will be large and enthusiastic. He stated that tnere are now 135 co-operative companies in the association and he looks to see the membership considerably aug mented because of the fact that many of these concerns have been doing a proGtable business recently. In this connection, it is pointed out that at the time the attorney general filed his suit for an injunction against the Nebraska Grain Dealers' associa tion it was believed that the result would be to Increase the number of independent associations which had been kept down because of the price cutting tactics of the old line com panies. Under the temporary injunc tion secured by Attorney General Brown that species of attack on the new concerns would invoke the wrath of the supreme court in the shape of contempt proceedings, and there is, in consequence, an absence of interfer ence.

HIS SPEECH OF ACCEPTANCE Returns Thanks for Honors Conferred Refers to Forthcoming President's Message and Touches on the Rebate Law Question. 

WASHINGTON The republican members of the Fifty-ninth congress met in caucus in the hall of the house of representatives and renominated all of the elective officers of the house who served during the last session. William P. Hepburn was again chosen chairman of the caucus. The princi pal feature of the evening was the speech of Joseph C. Cannon, who was for a second time unanimously chosen for speaker. The nomination of Mr. Cannon and his speech of acceptance created hearty enthusiasm among the republican members and his remarks were generally approved. In accepting the nomination, Mr. Cannon said: "Gentlemen One year ago, after full consideration, the people under the lead of the republican party elect ed its candidate for president and vice presdent, continued a strong majority in the senate and gave a republican majority in the house of representa tives of 112. The congress will be or ganized on Monday next and will promptly receive the annual message from the president. 1 will not specu late as to what may be the contents of the message, I have no doubt it will be both wise and patriotic in its rec ommendations. "The cnanges in the methods of pro duction and commerce so salutary and beneficial, involving as they do the ex traordinary use of combined capital, emphasizes the necessity for prevent ing agreements in restraint of trade, and the regulation of commerce among the states and with foreign nations. The congress, within the limits of its jurisdiction under the constitution, has therefore enacted legislation touching these subjects. In the fullness of time it may be, under the law as it now is and by the operation of competitive forces, that matters of difference be tween the corporations, the carrier, and the people they serve, would be adjust ed in justice to all. "The consensus of opinion of the people, however, is that congress has the power by amendment to the law to provide better remedies for real abuses existing, so that the producer and con sumer can find a more speedy and less expensive remedy than we now have. In this opinion I for one concur. T.e burden is upon congress and our party having power is primarily responsible. Let us go forward. But it is our duty to see that legislation is wise in the premises, just to the corporation, just to the carrier and to the people. We cannot oppress one by foolish or un just legislation without in the end bringing disaster upon al'. We should be especially careful to not unduly in terfere with the operation of the com petitive forces, for atter all, our very civilization rests upon it; each indi vidual living in the sweat ol his lace. hustling to promote his own interest. We may regulate commerce among the states and as an incident thereto we -may regulate the competitive forces. We dare not destroy them." The officers of the house were re nominated as follows: Clerk, Alexander McDowell. Penn sylvania; sergeant at arms. Henry Cas son, Wisconsin; doorkeeper, F. B. Lyon, iew York; postmaster, Joseph C. McEiroy. Ohio; chaplain, Rev. Henry N. Couden, Michigan.

One In Ten Citizens Over Ten Years Old Cannot Write. WASHINGTON According to a bul letin issued by the census bureau, about 106 persons' out of 1,000 in the United States over 10 years old are unable to write, which is equivalent to about 1 in 10. Of the native white population only 46 out of every 1,000, or fewer than 1 in 20; of the foreign born white, 128 out of every 1,000, and of the negroes 445 out oi every 1,000 are illiterate. International comparisons, restrict ed as far as possible to corresponding classes of the population, are on the whole favorable to this country, indi cating that in most European coun tries illiteracy is much more prevalent than it is here, although the United States is still far behind Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Switz erland. There is also ground for satisfaction in the statistical evidence that illiter acy is steadily being, reduced. In 1890 the number of illiterates per 1,000 was 133 for the total population, 62 for the native white population, 130 for the foreign born whites and 156 for negroes, Indians and Mongolians. The female sex is shown to be more illiterate than the male, the illiteracy for females being 112 per 1,000, and for males 101. But the contrast is less marked than it was in 1890, when the illiteracy for the two sexes was 144 and 123, respectively.
