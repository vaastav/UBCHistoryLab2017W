I presides t'$ JMessacje Wnahlncton correspondence: President Roosevelt's message to Congress is a very long one, aggregat ing over 20,000 words. It covers an Immense variety of subjects, Internal and external, and has some straight tanartlcularly on the subject of fiitmd rate legislation and Federal supervision of corporations, which will appeal to the country. The President has not minced words In his various recommendations. The feature of the message which will attract the most attention, be cause It litis been made by the Presi dent the "paramount issue" in Ameri can politics, is that devoted to the dis cussion of the railroad rate-question. The President points out in great de tail the evils now existing and the ..necessity for their eradication. As a remedy he proposes that the Interstate Commerco Commission Bhall be au thorized in declaring a rate to be un reasonable, to declare at the same time what is n maximum, reasonable rate, und to make an order requiring the of fending railroad to reduce Its rate to that maximum. He further recom mends that in order to insure obedi ence to the order, the law contain a penalty, but that opportunity bo re nerved to the company to appeal to the Federal court, whose decision shall be final. The President also Bceks the regulation of the private car and terminal interests so that discrimina tion or rebates in any form shall be impossible. The President In his direct recom mendation stands almost where he stood a year ago, but not exactly. Then he said that, while It was unde sirable to clothe the Interstate Com merce Commission with general au thority to tlx railroad rates, he did be lieve that the. commission should be vested "with the power, where a given rate has been challenged and after a full hearing fouud to be unreasonable, to decide, subject to judicial review, what shall bo a reasonable rate to take Its place, the ruling of the com mission to take effect Immediately aud to obtain unless and until reversed by the court of review." In his message this year, the Presi dent takes the position that this pow er should be vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission or some other lZiiS created by the Federal govern ment' and that It should have authority to tlx a maximum rate, that Is to say, a rate above which the carriers shall not go until the matter has been reviewed by the court. Hut the President still stands out for a law which would put the rate in effect and keep It there, and to all Intents and purposes his position is the same as last year, because there would seem to be no likelihood of agreement on some rate regulating body outside of the Interstate Com merce Commission. The message is a very elaborate dis cussion of the whole transportation problem. There are suggestions that private car linos, combined rail and wntrr lines, other auxiliary transporta tion companies, elevators, etc., tie brought within the control of the In terstate Commerce Commission. The President also devotes some attention to the necessity for preventing ruin ous rate wars and unfair competition, and pays it might be a good thing if the different trunk linos were allow ed to meet and consult about rates. Neotl of IiiMiiriiuci' Itcforiu. The President 1ms handled the sub ject of Insurance without gloves, re ferring to the revelations made during the Inquiry In New York as evidence of the great need of Federal super vision. He says that the only com plete remedy for the present deplor able state of affairs will be found in an aroused public conscience and a higher sense of ethical conduct among business men. lie thinks that this country should follow the policy of other nations tiy providing national supervision of commercial Interests that are clearly national in character. He also believes the work of the bu reau of corporations In Investigating corporations Is having a good effect. The President's language as usual Is very strong in dealing with the ques tionable phases of modern tinance, and especially with the recent life insur- ou".e disclosures. rilivli fflv- PniifinrnKniiu. Corporations Is a subject which has been given serious consideration by the President. He believes corpora tions should be managed with due re gard to the interests of the public as a whole. He has expressed this belief and lias recommended proper legisla tion by Congress. In this connection, attention is called to prosecutions which have been conducted by the De partment of Justice. He declares strongly against overcapitalization and Jnllatlon, and favors a certain salutary control over the big corporations en gaged In Interstate commerce by the Federal authorities, though expressing in unmistakable terms his belief that work that can with propriety be left In private hands should be so left. In discussing the relations of capital and labor the President takes a con servative position. He tells why it would bo unwise to deprive the proper courts of the power to Issuo injunc tions, but suggests further regulations to hedge about that power. He speaks for equal Justico for employer and em ploye and hopes for the coming of the day when both will recognize that "they are properly partners nnd not enemies." The message strongly denounces the corrupt use of money at elections. The President would make it unlawful for any corporation to contribute to the funds of n political committee. lie would require the publicity of all con tributions of all individuals. He leaves Congress no excuse for falling to meet this growing evil. ITrKe DomtnHTn Action. The President has much to say and nothing to conceal on the subject of our relations with Santo Domingo. He tollB the whole story. An arrangement was entered Into under which the 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT. United Stntes was to bo the custodian of a percentage of tho customs duties collected, which were to be applied to the extinguishment of the debt of the Island. Tho foreign creditors required us to do so. If we had objcctcU we could not have complained If some Eu ropean country had seized tho custom.- houses of tho Island and administered tho customs for nn Indefinite period against the spirit of the Monroe doc trine. Immediately after the adjourn ment of the Senate without having ratified the treaty a foreign war ship appeared In Dominican waters, de termined to take n hand In the col lection of the customs for the bene fit of the Italian creditors. The Pres ident asks tho approval of the Senate for what he has done and requests the ratification of the pending treaty. Kulth In the Ciiiiul Project. There is a full discussion of the Pa nama Canal. The President gives an account of everything that has been done since Congress failed to give him legislation last winter. He describes the present financial situation as to tho canal showing that the money Is all exhausted and that more must be appropriated at once If the work Is not to halt. Two points regarding tho canal tho President regards as no longer open to debate: It Is to be built upon the Isthmus of Panama, and there Is no question of the entire feasibility of the route. The report of the advisory hoard of engineers on the unsettled point of whether a lock canal or one at sea level Is more practical will soon be presented to Congress. Ilcform In Connulnr Survlcp. The President tells of tho reforms he has ordered In the consular service and recommends that Congress enact legislation In order that this service may be placed upon a sound business footing, which will enable it to give satisfactory and adequutc results for its cost Ho earnestly commends the encouragement of the merchant ma rine by appropriate legislation. Tho President hns had a commission rnnko a careful investigation of the subject of citizenship and naturalization. Ho reports its findings, showing the terri ble abuses it has found, nnd recom mends appropriate legislation for their euro. Condemns Grnft. The gross extravagance nml even graft which have been found to flour ish are subjects for especial condem nation, nnd tho difficulty the national authorities encounter in prosecuting cases against prominent nnd wealthy companies whose lawyers light their battles upon legal technicalities comes In for mention. The President finds considerable saving can be made In tho administration of the government, and refers to the necessity of making appropriations in such manner as will enable purchases of government sup piles In large lots rather than by each department as In the past. 1'roitronn In (lie Philippine. The President Is Bntlslled that real progress Is being made in the Philip pines. He regards the government as more efficient nnd more economical, and Filipinos are replacing Americana In official positions. He recommends strongly legislation for lower tariff rates on Filipino exports to tho United StntoB, while he suggests the granting of n reduction in the schedule on Im portations from tho Philippine Isl- nnds. Tho President refrains from urging n revision of tho tariff. l'rldo In (Srnwtli or Nuvy. The President Is gratified at the sub stantial Increases which have been made In the navy, and believes this work should not stop. He refers to the lessons of tho Uusso-Jnpaue.se war as vindicating the battleship and con curs in the recommendations of tho general hoard of the navy that threo new battleships be authorized. C'Ik-oU for Immigration. Immigration, as usual, Is discussed fully. There Is an argument for re stricting immigration to a more desir able class, and for the safeguarding of American citizenship. The President wants laws which will prevent tho United States from serving as a dump ing ground for Europe. At tho same time he wants fair icallng with nil na tions, nnd has devoted considerable space to the question of the amend ment of the Chinese exclusion lnw. IIo favors continued exclusion of the la boring classes of the Chinese, but op poses the exclusion of the Intelligent classes. There Is also a full discussion of our relations with China on the question of the exclusion of Chinamen. Tliero has been much ground for complaint on the pnrt of the Intelligent Chinese against the enforcement of the exclu sion laws, and Congress is counseled to act wisely In order to prevent re prisals similar to those attempted In the boycott of American goods In China. The President discusses tho encour agement of tho merclinnt marine, tho fostering of relations between labor nnd capital, the necessity for economy In government expenditures, tho Im provement of public lands through Irri gation and through tho enre of the for est reserve nnd many other subjects which are discussed at length in tho reports of tho different heads of the departments.

This dispatch is sent al the request of the Jewish comuiunitj which fears a fresh massacre by thf local garrison. It is asserted that 1 proclamation is being circulated ii lilmost every regiment, calling on I he soldiers to exterminate the Jowl ami to destroy the newspaper ollicei in revenge for groundless accusations ntraitist the troonsof their narticina tion in massacres and pillage and in tin protection of rowdies. This is exciting the population against the army. The Jews assert that the ollicen delivers anti-seinit ic speeches in t lit barracks after removing the Jewish soldiers and that. Governor General Knulbars himself has confessed that the ollic.ers are burning for revenge in the Jews and that he is unable tc guarantee the preservation of order. In view of the fact that this city it jnt irely cut off from St. Petersburg aud thus is altogether in the hands af the local authorities, the Jowisl, community implores all civilizeu tuitions and their governments tc take all possible measures at St I'etersburg to prevent a catastrophe ivhich may exceed anything that hug vet occurred.

Deplores Recent Fatality Pint Fight nt Acmlcmy 011 I'rtr- nllM With Ourllntr unit Not to llu I'litintanuticru Adtlt Hon to Navy WASHINGTON. Tho report of Sec retary Honnparto of tho nnvy was inbinitted to tho presidont. Discuss ing the recent fatal prize light nt tho academy the secretary says: 'A very painful incident has recently attracted public attention to the naval aciidemv and caused grave concern to the department. One of the midshipmen there died, early in tho month of November, as the result of injuries received in a 1st light with another midshipman. riie department felt bound to order the trial of the latter by court martial, nnd in viow of this fact I refrain from any further comment on this particular occurrence; but it may be well to make perfectly clear the attitude of the department with r sport, to similar prearranged en counters between midshipmen, Binco this attitude has been apparently misconstrued and therefore unjustly criticised in certain quarters. "There maybe something to bo fairly paid in favor of permitting Biich conllicts, just iib tliero may have icon something to bo fairly said In' favor of permitting dueling, but such' considerations, ir they exist, address themselves properly to tho legislative branch of tho government. As the law stands now, an encounter of this character is a crime, nnd this do- mrtment must and will enforce tho law. If the congress shall soo lit to change the law, of courso this will alter the attitude of tho department, but while the articles for tho gov ernment of the navy remain un changed all participants in such pro ceedings must be punished with a severity corresponding to tho grnvity of their offense. "The estimates submitted for tho expenses of tho department and tho service for tho liscal vear endinir Juno HO, 11)07, oxcecd by some eleven aud a half millions the amount ap propriated for the same purpose for tho current ilscal year. While tills additional expense is, of course, to bo regretted in itself, it can hardly bo deemed unreasonable, in view of the steady growth of tho navy. In fact those estimates have been reduced by more than $15,000, 000 from the aggrogato..of those sub mitted by the several chiefs of bureaus and T think any further re duction will be made at the risk of diminis.ing tho elliciency of the navy. "It will be observed on examin ing th sin that there is a largo reduc tion in the amount asked for tho increase of the navy, the aggregate of the sums requested for this pur pose being some $18,000,000 less than what was asked for the present liscal year. On the the other hand, there is a very heavy increase in tho esti mates of tho bureau of ordinances and considerable additions to the appropriations asked for those of equipment and steam engineering, besides the increased amounts re quired for pay and maintenance ot the navy and marine corps. "A considerable amount has been also asked for public works at tho naval stations, although very heavy reductions wero inude by the de partment in the estimates submitted for this purpose by the bureaus. The last item is explained by tho fact that a number of improvements, which for reasons of economy hnvo been postponed once or oftenct already, are now indispensable in the interest of the service. It ii further explained in part by the necessity of making provisions fo tho advance naval basis at Guanta namo and Olongnpo, although tho amounts nlloted for theso purposes have been kept as low as was con sistent with nvoiding delay in the final completion of this work. "Within the past two years very impressive Icsboub as to naval prob lems of the highest importance have been afforded by tho bloody war in eastern Asia, now hnppily concluded. As to some conclusions to be draws from this experience, we may fairly say that everyone is agreed, Sucb are the paramount importance to a belligerant of thorough preparation, drill, discipline, target practice, and proximity to a well supplied bast at the moment of decisive conllict.",
