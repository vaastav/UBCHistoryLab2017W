METCALF, former sec retary of the navy, ln discussing San Pedro harbor, said: "We must work together on matters affect ing our common interests. This part «of the country Is far removed from the centers of population in the middle west, and must work out our own prob lems. The harbor, for instance, should be a matter of pride to all sections of the state. We cannot afford to let triv ial differences make us lose sight of paramount issues. The government Is taking an active Interest ln San Pedro harbor, and I understand the war de partment has a special report covering fortifications for the port." This kind of talk rings true. It is to the point, and expresses the senti ments in the minds of a large majority of our fellow citizens who are not aware of the existence of anything re sembling "sectional differences" ln Cal ifornia, although they know South Cal ifornia has many natural climatic ad vantages, and in San Pedro possesses a most admirable harbor— which, they . think, should be recognized by our northern friends in an apprecia tive way. And that Is the common sense of lt. The development of San Pedro har bor la of the utmost importance not only to Los Angeles and the southern part of California, but to all of Cali fornia, to all of the American Pacific coast, and to all of the United States ■ of America, Every addition to the seaport facilities of a nation Is an addi tion to the power and wealth of that nation, and is a matter of national con cern. : . A '• If the nation is to be regarded as one- family, living in a big house, the harbors are the principal doors of the house, and such a huge house as this is should have plenty of doors. We have not nearly enough. The develop ment ot the export market of the United States will help solve many social | problems, and will make money more plentiful and wages better. It cannot be developed satisfactorily un less every producing and manut'actur- ing district has its harbor city and Its seaport. Nothing will curb the arro gance of rate-making railroads more effectually than the growth of the mer cantile and commercial sea power of the United States. San Pedro harbor and the Panama canal will free South ■ crn | California commercially, and, in good old eastern phrase, will make it "mighty independent" of any particu lar form of transportation; although glad to do business on a reasonable basis with all competitors for freight service by land and by water. .Fate has been unkind to the old Chicago man and woman who have been ; lif ted from poverty to riches by the discovery of valuable stock certifi cates. ,' For years they have lived _n dire poverty, and now, when one Is over 90 and the other almost 90, ' they find they are millionaires. They would have been happier if they had been allowed to die peacefully without making the discovery. ' Fate sometimes acts ;' like a practical joker. . PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE PERHAPS the most significant part of President Roosevelt's message —all of which Is significant. Im portant and in some respects remark able, and will bear close perusal—is his statement: "Both the preachers of an unrestricted Individualism and the preachers of an oppression which would deny to able men of business the just reward of their Initiative and business sagacity are advocating pol icies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole country. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law-defying corporation, to take any action, no matter how iniquitous. In the effort to secure an Improper profit and to build up privilege would be ruinous to the republic, and would mark the abandonment of the effort to secure In the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing. On the 1 other hand, to attack these wrongs ln that spirit of demagogy which can see wrong only when committed by men of wealth, and la dumb and blind In the presence of wrong committed against men of property or by men of no prop erty, Is exactly as evil as corruptly to defend the wrong-doing of men of wealth." In this passage the president of the United States recognizes plainly, ex plicitly and in a manner so pointed that.it will attract the attention and comment of all foreign nations, the existence of that unhappy class jeal ousy which divides America, and which is far worse than the old-fashioned sectionalism which made two families of the citizens of this republic. The conditions recognized and deplored by the president and by all observant citi zens have brought discord Into the family circle of the United States, and divided the country not Into two sec tions, but into many Jarring, warring, clashing interests. While we recognize and admire President Roosevelt's great and unusual ability as a preacher, and look forward with sorrow to the time when the country will no longer And in his messages food for thought and discussion, at the same time we think his statement of the facts Is clearer and more impressive than any sug gested remedy which might be applied to the entire, grievous case, and stop the discontent which undoubtedly exists in the United States. There is evi dently something wrong with the sys tem. The president's message shows this very clearly. 

SCHOOL TEACHERS' TOUR INTEREST in the teachers' contest is constantly increasing. Los An geles Herald will give a fortnight's vacation-visit to the Alaska-Yukon- Pacitlc exposition at Seattle to twelve school teachers. Three of them will be chosen from Los Angeles, three from Los Angeles county outside of the city, one from San Bernardino county, one from Orange county, one from Santa Barbara county, one from Riverside county, one from Kern county and one from Ventura county. The terms which must be observed before the privilege of voting can be exercised are simple. They are described in our advertising pages, where complete particulars and details relating to the great contest will be found. We think our readers will be glad to show their appreciation of the school teachers by taking part In this contest. School teachers as a rule work harder for less money than any other class in the community, and certainly among our public servants there are none from whom more Is expected. They are the moulders of the nation. "As the twig is bent the tree's inclined," and the school teachers train our young hope fuls, the twigs, in the way they should go. If all the teachers of Los Angeles could be sent on health-bringing trips every year, It would bo a benefit to the community, which depends on the good health of the teachers for the progress of the children. But since that would be Impractica ble, we must make the best of the opportunities within our reach; and as The Herald cannot think of arbitrarily picking out, "without rhyme or reason," twelve teachers, it will leave to sub scribers the pleasure of sending dele gates to the great exposition. As ln every other undertaking, hard work and organization will probably result in placing candidates at the head of the list. Friends of teachers should get together and make plans by which the conditions of the contest can be car ried out, ar_d they may have the pleas ure of seeing the names of their friends or favorites among the fortunate dozen. ASSAY OFFICE LOS ANGELES is the mining capital i of South California. Why should it not have an assay office? Perhaps the deficiency Is merely the result of an oversight, for if govern mental officials in Washington are as well posted with regard to Los Angeles as are most of the eastern newspaper writers, they are certain an assay office has been long established in this metropolis, and that Main, street and Broadway are haunt ed by red-shlrted miners who think it disgraceful if they are com pelled to die with their boots off. The Merchants and Manufacturers' associ ation and chamber of commerce are actively interested in agitation designed to make Washington realize the neces sity for the establishment of an assay office here. The organizations named have sent letter^ to United States Senators Per kins and Flint, asking their aid in se curing one. We think there will be no difficulty on the part of anyone in Washington in acceding to the request, and we believe the assay office will be established. Mining and miners flrst made California world-famous, and it is not to be wondered at that some of the good people back east and most of the people of Europe continue to associ ate the entire state with mining inter ests. Certain lt is, mining Interests should never be slighted, and when men representing the mining interests in Southern California express a de sire to have a long felt want supplied citizens in other walks of life should back them up loyally LOS ANGELES HERALD: WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1903. RATES RAID AGAINST the proposed raid on the prosperity of Southern California by a raise in freight rates It Is the duty of every citizen to protest. United action may convince the "mag nates" who regard Southern California ln a cold blooded manner— merely a piece on their board at the big game of money making—that there Is some pub lic spirit behind the rates protest, and that public spirit will not permit the Industrial growth and activity of our flourishing section of the state to be Interfered with at the despotic and unreasonable will of "magnates." It Is no doubt pleasant to make a discovery that lean proflts, the result of lean years In the east, may be fat tened up at the expense of the pros perous Pacific coast, but we must not allow the railroads to be guilty of the eccentricity of robbing California Peter to pay the eastern Paul. Apart from all other considerations, the proposed rate-gouge should be denounced be cause it Is immoral. It Is yellow rail roading of the worst kind, and most outrageously unfair to California ship pers and importers, for California is to be mulcted both coming and going. "We will receive smaller returns from the products sent out of the state, be cause the railroads will require a larger amount for hauling them, and we will have to pay out more of our California earnings for goods freighted into the state. Threatened with this raid, are the citizens of California to sit quiet and passive? It Is useless to assume a Mlcawber mental attitude and hope "something may turn up," for nothing will turn up. If any results are to follow the various expressions of discontent with the new rates which are being uttered, these expressions must be put Into the form of definite protests, and the aid of the interstate commerce commission and every other possible agency of-relief must be invoked. To expect any coun tenance or support from the state rail road commission ln a fair rate agita tion Is of course out of the question and absurd. No more strenuous sleep ers were ever allowed to snore through a prolonged siesta of office holding than the hebetudlnous aggregation of talent whose powers and scope of mas terly Inactivity and chronic do-lessness are about to be enlarged if the attorney geiftral and the legislature are allowed to perpetrate on this long suffering community o Gargantuan joke which is said to be contemplated by them. NATIONAL RESOURCES GOVERNORS and their advisers as sembled in Washington to receive and discuss the report of the na tional executive committee of the con servation commission appointed by President Roosevelt. Truth to tell the conservation com-, mission Is the result of natural alarm over the depletion of resources once regarded and written of as "practically exhaustless." There are unfortunately only too many examples of the ease with which the "Inexhaustible" may be exhausted. In the years Immediately preceding the War of the Rebellion, who would have dreamed that the "lordly bison.'' better known as the buffalo, would almost disappear from the plains? When the overland trains would plow their way (sometimes at great risk) through immense herds of buffalo, ani the astonished and somewhat scared passengers would view from the car windows the billows of a ' boundless black sea, who would have dared to say, "Such a sight as this to our chil dren will be only a memory, and to our children's children a tradition?" Only the diminution of water flows and the shoaling up of once navigable rivers called the attention of the coun try to the national peril caused by the reckless waste of timber, and to. the urgent necessity of reforestation. Sin gular Imprudence has marked the na tional history. If America is not to pay the prodigal's price for the reck lessness of youth, it Is time to be up and doing; and let us rejoice there Is a multitude of capable and wise and experienced counsellors in our great country. President Taft's brother's paper is in a . controversy with the New Tork World over the Panama canal scandal. My, what a newspapery administration the next one will be! The president will be able to hurl invectives and things with the aid of his brother's paper. Ex-President Roosevelt will perform in thorough-bass roars in the Outlook. Mr. Bryan will hand out com pliments all around In the Commoner. And with all these distinguished ama teurs to deal with, mere professional writers for the daily papers will surely have the time of their lives. Dr. Powers, the health officer, calls attention to the fact that there are not enough accessible dumping grounds in Los Angeles. In consequence, the of ficials find it difficult to keep people from making dumps in the city. On account of a defect ln the state law it la impossible to abate a nuisance and make the expense a lien on property. It is advisable the state should pass a law making It as easily possible to abate nuisances in Los Angeles as In New York, which in its health depart ment la the model city of the United states. A.y'S'A lAyy^AA A university professor and a naval offlcer will form the somewhat re markable combination at the confer ence of the powers called by Great Britain for framing a code of laws for naval warfare, and for the formation of the international, prize court recom mended by The Haghe congress. After having adopted a nice set of new ruled we hope the powers won't think it nec essary to put them in operation "just to see how they work." With indifference which we are com pelled to call characteristic as well as arrogant, eastern railroads have sub limely Ignored the appeal of the slip pers for 1 a conference regarding in creased freight ; rates. Imperialism seems to be the basis of railroad man agement in the east. 'THE 

ONLY WAY' IS MASTERFUL DRAMA "A PARISIAN ROMANCE" HOLDS BOARDS AT BELASCO Harry Glazier Strong in Role of Baron Chevrial — Dorothy Bernard Makes a Delightful . Ballet Girl LEMUEL PARTON Just why a man should be so much more fascinating, especially to women, because he is a bit devilish is a ques tion which only the Society for Psych ical Research may answer. If Sidney Carton were not such a gay dog, with all his tragic heroism, he might be merely Quixotic. Why is lt that the unfortunate Villlon, and all the rab ble of vagabond! who have come after him—singers, players, poets and adven turerssearch out the springs of joy and the fount of tears when the truly good and great, "the pillars of society," move only to awe and cold admira tion? We love to drape the gaunt framework of our work-a-day life with the vesture of heroism and the drapery of dreams, but we weave ourselves into the imagery, and in this we find fel lowship with frailty, especially when redemption Is found in some gieat act of self-sacrifice, as In Sydney Carton's giving of his life -for his friend. Freeman Wells' "The Only Way" Is a masterful dramatization of "The Tale of Two Cities," and the production of the drama now on at the Auditorium is fully as masterful In tire playing. It is easy to understand why Los Ange les has the best stock companies in the country; so far away from the play shops it must .have, but the weekly Stone productions, rivaling in many cases .the originals, approach the phe nomenal. 'Mr. Stone's Sydney Carton Is characterized by almost photograph ic faithfulness to the minutes of the character, and a strong, vitalized, but withal Stoneized, conception of the, springs of actionimpulses, if you choose—which point Carton's way to the one great sacrifice. '/ Charles Ruggles at Auditorium Charles Ruggles appeared for the first time with Auditorium compa ny in the part of Charles Darnay. The fact that Mr. Ruggles' resemblance to Mr. Stone is not so close as the part requires detracted somewhat from the effectiveness of his acting, and alto gether Mr. Ruggles did not seem to be so well cast as he might have been. Mr, Stone's; support was so uniformly good that there is little opportunity to make. distinctions or comparisons. It Is possible that Miss Florence Oakley and Miss Beatrice Noyes might have appeared to better advantage if their roles, those, of Miml and Lucie Manette, had been interchanged. James Nel son, who appeared as Dr. Manette, Is proving a valuable addition to the Auditorium company. In point of staging the production could not have been Improved upon. Seldom is a more "grotesquely horrible and altogether thrilling scene put on the stage than the tribunal of the re public ln the third act. *v, * • The Los Angeles offers an unusually good bill for the week, with a diversi fled list of first-class attractions. The Leanders, pantomimic wheelmen you get —head the program. They are all to the good in their pantomic specialty. Al Coleman, a dialect story teller, has a good assortment of yarns, some old and some new, but all amus ing, 'and Harry Thornton tears off a few bars of piano music, his "Suwanee River" as Sousa would have composed it being one of the best features of the bill. The Newsomes, a man and a woman, present a clever equilibrist act. Sam Holdsworth's picture ballad makes a good finish. ■*, . . . Harry Glazier has scored a second time ln the role of the devil. When the proprietor of hades became 111 he evinced a tendency toward self-abne gation. But the old devil in "A Paris lan Romance', la game to the last. It Is this unwavering conslatency ln evil doing, with the pronouncement of the material creed at the end that makes the role of Baron Chevrial artistically strong. The least sign of wavering with the approach of death would do violence to the part. Mr. Glazier achieves an admirable bit of acting in the piece, which has begun a week's run at the Belaaco the ater. As the very apotheosis of sensu ality, with the Machlaevelllan gloat ing over the prospective ruin of the women whose downfall he sought to accomplish, Mr. Glazier approached at times, be it said without blushing, tho Immortal Mansfield. He has spent weeka in preparation for the role, and the results of his work show in every line. As the remorseless old schemer, the utterly soulless hedonist and con scienceless voluptuary, the character Is truly and faithfully drawn and as tru ly and faithfully acted. Here Is where we register a proph ecy. Although it would not require a Solomon, with his enviable record of past performances, to dope out a daz-""" zllng career for Miss Dorothy Bernard, we are ready to make it a bet that she Is heard from within the next five years. This small person Is not merely pretty. She "savvies." Watch her, and above all see her as the Irresisti ble Rosa Guerln. <v" A. H. Van Buren was far better in "Old .Heidelberg" as a German than he Is as a Frenchman —naturally. But he is there with all his manly beauty, and his mellifluous voice, and he is by no n_*fTns negligible ln "A Parisian Ro mance." Ben Graham as Dr. Chesnel is almost too true to life. It makes you think that you have something the matter with you and you wait for him to step down and ask you to put out our tongue. Mr. Graham has been good In every role in which he has been seen at the Belasco, and the doctor's part is one of his best. . .-.-'..-* • » .

JOHN HASTINGS HOWARD (Hgl_EN VALENTINE CHAFFEE) t . .■._...._-.. . Society News DISTINGUISHED by much of the splendor of appointment attending a post military weddln, and marked by the sdlemnlty and ceremonial characterizing the marriage office of the Episcopal church, the wedding of Miss Helen Valentine Chaffee, youngest daugh ter of Lieutenant General and Mrs. Adna It. Chaffee and Lieutenant John Hastings How ard, Eighth United States cavalry, was cele brated last night in St. Paul's Pro-cathedral ln the presence of nearly five hundred guest*. The company assembled to witness the nup tials was composed of people prominent ln the social life of Los Angeles and San Francisco, while here and there like high light* on the brilliant picture formed by the • exquisite gowns of the women, which were thrown into relief by the dark coats of their escorts, one caught an occasional glimpse of mlltary gold braid and buttons. % The stately edifice was never more fittingly decorated for a wedding, Wolfskill having arranged a picturesque setting of Kentla palms and Japanese foliage plants with wild smllax brought from Alabama, which, starred with white carnations, hid organ and choir loft and _ reached from chancel rail to altar. Lengths 'of yellow Chinese silk festooned along the chancel rail furnished the touch of yellow, the cavalry color, that was everywhere com bined with bridal white throughout the wed ding decorations. The center aisle was out lined with potted Kentla palms, clusters of white carnations being fastened by smllax at the head of each pew with the exception of those In front, which were reserved for the family and special guests, and were desig nated by big ragged yellow chrysanthemums, held ln place by bows and long ends of tulle of the same color, ' From pillar to pillar the entire length of the nave swung ropes of smllax. Bridal Procession '-.':_■ While the guests were assembling Ernest Douglas, organist of the pro-cathedral, played softly a happily chosen program, and as the strains of the Lohengrin "Bridal Chorus" pealed forth under the arches, the bride and her attendants advanced down the aisle. Brother officers of Lieutenant Howard, who served with Messrs Carl Klokke, James Page, Volney Howard, Dr. Bernard Smith and Lieu tenant Charles Dravo as ushers, were Lieu tenant James, Lieutenant Ralph Jones, Lieu tenant Frederick Cruse and Lieutenant Earl MacFarland, and led the procession, followed by the maids, Miss Anrris Van Nuys and Miss Marion Mac Nell, Miss Rena Scott of Alameda and Miss Katherine Clark. Miss Lucy Clark entered alone, preceding the bride, who was escorted by her father. Awaiting tho party at trie altar with Lieu tenant Howard was Colonel John Blddle, chief of engineers, department of California; Right Rev. Joseph H. Johnson, bishop of Southern California, and Rev. William A. MacCormack, D. D., dean of the pro-cathedral. Dr. Mac- Cormack had charge of the betrothal, assist ing Bishop Johnson, who Imposed the mar riage vows and pronounced the benediction. Lieutenant-General Chaffee gave.his daughter th marriage. \ Schubert's "Serenade" was softly played during the service, and the triumphant notes of Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" sounded as the newly wedded pair turned from the altar. A pretty feature of the service was ths grouping of the ushers and bridesmaids, who formed In line on either side of the chancel as tha bride and her father and maid of honor advanced to meet Lieut. Howard. As the bride and groom left the altar the ushers formed an arch of their uplifted swords for them to pass beneath. ., Tunic Gowns and Muffs For her marriage the bride had chosen a white embroidered crepe over heavy white satin with trimming of rose Venetian point. The conventional tulle veil, which fall to the foot of the long court train, was fattened with a spray of orange blossoms, and over this was worn a veil of old rose point that has been In the family generations. Her ornaments were pearls and diamonds, and she carried a shower of white orchids and lilies of the valley. Miss Clark was attired In a beautiful dlrec tolre gown of yellow satin, over which was worn a tunlo of handmade lace of the same color, heavily embroidered with I white and gold. The four bridesmaids were In dlrectolre gowns of white chiffon cut In tunlo style over shimmering ivory satin, the edge of the chiffon being effectively outlined with hand « em broidery of gold thread. Each of the young women wore the pretty English half veils of tulle and carried huge muffs of yellow cor reopsls, with many single blossoms pendant by long ribbons nearly to the floor. i The full dress uniform of the groom and his brother officers added distinction to the ceremony. Among the most beautifully gowned women present was Mrs. Chaffee, mother of the bride, who was ln lavender crepe and white lace and wore a pearl tiara. Mrs. William, Bingham Clarke 'of Kansas City, ' Mrs. Chaffee's sinter, wore white crepe embroidered with sliver. Her ornaments were diamonds. Mrs,. James R. Edwards of Banta Rosa, a cousin of the bride, was a picture ln eale blue crepe - embroidered in silver. _ and woee~ diamonds. Mrs. Chaffee and her two guests each carried bouquets of lavender . or chids and lilies of the valley. Among the special guests was Miss Chaf fee's godmother, Mrs. William F. Edgar, widow of Colonel Edgar of the medical department. V. B. A. Mrs. Edgar wore white silk and diamonds. -i The only members of Lieutenant Howard's • family now resident in the west are his brother and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Vincent How ard of this city, who were present. Ensign Charles Woodruff, N. S. N-, Is among the out-of-town guests who are being enter tained by Lieutenant General and Mrs. Chaf fee, as is also General Fred T. Smith, com manding the department of California, and Lieutenant Christie, aide-de-camp to General Smith, and Miss Smith. Reception at House An informal reception at the Chaffee home on Magnolia avenue followed the church ser vice, the company of seventy-five comprising the members of the bridal party and their families, and a few of Miss Chaffee's young friends. American Beauty roses were In all the rooma with the exception of the dining room, where Bride's roses and lilies of the valley were used in graceful profusion. The front veranda was inclosed and converted into a Japanese parlor. , , Many trophies and souvenirs of Lieut. Chaffee's long years of service in the army, in the form of beautiful oriental draperies, adorn the walls of the rooms, and there is little need for decoration, but for this I occasion long stemmed American Beauty 'roses had place ln all the rooms except the dining room, where Bride's roses and lilies of the valley were used In graceful profusion, forming the center jjlece on the round table and being utilized for the wedding bell that was pendant from the chan delier above. To Attend Son's Wedding Lieutenant and Mrs. Howard left last night for a bridal trip that will terminate at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming, hern ihe groom has been recently stationed with the Eighth cav alry. Lieutenant Howard has already . made a brilliant record for himself with General Chaffee's command •In China In the cam paign from Tong Ku to Peking, with the famous Sixth cavalry, with which General Chaffee served thirty years, and there are not lacking friends who prophesy that his advancement in rank will not be long de ferred. The wedding trip will Include a visit to Fort Riley, Kansas, where Lieutenant How ard and his bride will arrive in season to be present at the marriage of Lieutenant Adna R. Chaffee, jr., Fifteenth United States cavalry, and Miss Ethel Warren Huff, daugh ter of Mrs. John C. Dodson of Atlanta, Ga., which will take plac£ ln . the post chapel December 15, and will be celebrated with full military appointment. Lieutenant General and Mrs.' Chaffee are leaving tomorrow for Fort Riley and will be present at their son's wedding. Lieutenant Chaffee and his bride will pass a part of their honeymoon In Los Angeles, and will be the guests of Lieutenant Chaffee's parents from December 19 until the new year. A brilliant reception at the home of Miss Huffs uncle, Captain Kennlngton, will follow the marriage, and will be attended by relatives of the bride living In Tennessee and Ken tucky as well as by many relatives of the groom.

First Vice President Richmond Plant presided, and many of the orld guard as well as new faces were present. Attorney George C. Martin took up each amendment, showing what Its tenor as well as Its language Implied. The address was a lengthy one, ami special interest was shown in several of the amendments. . *, _ y Proposed charter amendment No. 1, If car ried, Involves the addition to the powers of the city, already granted under the old charter, of the power of Supplying electricity to the city and the Inhabitants. The city now only . has the power to supply water and gas. / Sequel to Aqueduct The production of electrical energy Is esti mated to be equivalent, at Its maximum, to more than 90,000-horse power.

The obvious purpose of these two subdivis ions last mentioned Is to enable the city to dispose of its surplus water supply and elec trical ; power to the greatest advantage of the community generally, as well as the city, and at the same time to prevent any part of it from being capitalized by private parties or corporations for private gain.

' Utilize Water Power The aim of these amendments is to enable the city to utilize the enormous powar which it will be able to generate from the wat brought down In the aqueduct, and to use It when the time comes as a motive power for a transportation Una to the coast. Adop tion of 'these amendments will make it pos sible for the city to regulate rates between seaports and the upper city, and to give the inhabitants. of this city and county the bensfits which should follow the cheap water transportation. It Is estimated that at least $20,000,000 are annually paid to the railroads in freight charges which could be saved if we possessed a free harbor. *'~rv'."* .._■'-•' Subdivision 26 prohibits the sale or disposal by the city of any wharf, dock, seawall, rail road, • electric railroad, traction road, canal, subway, conduit, etc., water, gas or elec trical system or plant, or any other publ'o utility, now or hereafter owned by the city, except upon the favorable vote of two-thirds of the duly qualified electors at any election, and places the same limitation upon the sale of electrical power, except that the city may have the power to sell to Its Inhabitants Ha electricity and except that It may sell sur plus power, and provided, also, that whyn surplus power is sold outside of the city it must be done by the authority of -the board of public works, and no power may be Bold, under any circumstances, to any person or corporation for resale, rental, disposal or dis tribution to consumers without the consent of two-thirds of ths qualified voters voting at any election.
