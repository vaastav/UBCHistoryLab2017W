Captain Bolton's Dilemma By George T. Partly (Copyright, 1907, by Daily Story Pub. Co.) "No," said the cook, thoughtfully. In reply to a query I hazarded regarding the strange beliefs of those who "go down to sea In ships," "I don't know as saiiormon 011 the lakes is given to superstitions very much. Co's why? They has hard work to do and wants to enjoy themselves when they gets ashore. I only knowed one case where a skipper bothered about such things, and that was old Ezra Bolton —as T sailed with on the steam freighter Monteagle. "Some one got hold of the old man and loaded him to the hatches with queer ideas about stuff called theos ophy, reincarnations and such junk, and he became a regular convert to the game, attending niet»tin's 1 'gular whenever we lay in port. Well, one trip to Buffalo we had a passenger aboard, young fellow named Edgerton, and the cap began on him with his theories right away. Thisyer chap seemed to like the dope, and 'peared to make the skipper nuttier than ever bv encouragin' him. We was all fair knocked out when the word was passed that the old man ordered par ticular respect paid to an old dog he owned, account of the brute bein' an incarnation of Andrew Jackson. "Everybody thought it a big joke but the mate, and he kicked when the cur jumped on the cabin table at dinner and grabbed a chunk of meat off his plate. The mate made a bolt at him and the captain roared like a bull, said he ought to be ashamed of himself for insulting a animal that contained the spirit of a great man. The mate al lowed that he hadn't signed articles to eat with dogs or pal with the spirit Jackson, but the old man wouldn't listen to him, and he left the cabin, mad as blazes. "Young "Edgerton was chucklin* to himself all the time. Then the skip per calls all hands together and gives 'em a lecture on spirits and theosophy. He tells how the world has been in darkness all this while and is only wakin' to the true light and that for all he knows, some of the crew lias lived in the past ages and used to be pretty swell guys. Most of us thought it. a slushy spiel, but there was others said there might be somethin' in it, and what with the arguments as came on, there was cne scrap come up right after another all the way to Buffalo. "When we tied up, we heard how Edgerton was goin' to take a trip back on the Monteagle, and had promised the skipper to bring along a lady who was one of the shining lights of the theosophy bunch. Sure enough, lie showed up with a might) pretty girl in tow. " 'Capt. Bolton,' ses he, 'allow me to introduce Miss Maitland, a high priest ess of the great belief!' "The old man bowed very polite, but she stands lookin' at him kind of wild; then all of a sudden throws both arms around his neck and screams: " 'At last I have found my affinity!' "'What does this mean?' roars the old man, taken all aback. "'I see it all,' ses young Edgerton. 'She has known and loved you in a past life.' " 'Sure thing,' ses the priestess; 'this here is my third time 011 earth, and twice we have loved each other through the cycles of the ages.' " 'But, blast it,' roars Bolton, 'l've a wife and six kids in Chicago, miss!' " 'Cruel man,' ses she, 'to greet me thus. What has the sordid present to do with the ideal, mystic past? I've found you and now we'll never part.' " 'But the boat leaves to-night,' ses Bolton. " 'Me, too,' ses the priestess. 'May be you'll learn to appreciate my de motion durin' the voyage.' "The end of it was that we had two passengers le'avin' Buffalo. That girl ■ spent part of her time witli Edgerton, but she never missed a chance of hanging onto the old man's arm, whenever anyone was around to see, and smilin' up in his face as if he was the darlin' of her heart. It made him feel more than uncomfortable to have the crew pipin' him off and grinnin', but there was no help for it. "The first, day out the mate reports that Jim Adams, one of the deckhands, had it revealed to him in a dream that he was the reincarnation of Admiral Paul Jones. I see thisyer Edgerton talkin' 011 the quiet to Adams just be fore we left, port, but that wasn't any of my business, so I kep' my mouth shut. " "Send Adams aft,' ses the old man, 'fix him up a berth and we'll have him 'eat. in the cabin. It'll never be said that the spirit of Paul Jones had to swab decks on any hooker commanded by Ezra Bolton.' "That night Mick Flaherty was re ported as bein' possessed of the spirit .of William Shakespeare. " 'Poets are a bum lot,' says Bolton, 'but for the principle of the thing, J suppose he must be let double up with Adams.' And back goes that shanty Irish dock-walloper to eat good grub : aft with the cabin bunch. "That last deal was a bit too strong, „nd .there: t or the crew held an indig nati< 1 meet in*. SBfißoysV ses old Loorais, 'l've .sailed the lakes L' • years, and allers managed to get my piece of anything good as was goin.' These here reincarnations -Is fashionable, and I allow that we'd all better get in the swim.' "We see his drift at once, and Billy Layton, who'd been a college guy in his day before he started drinkin' and took to sailin", drew up a list of rein carnations that we judged would sur prise the old man. We gave the list to the mate and he took it to Bolton as he was paciu' the bridge. "'Mere's the last bunch of spirits reported aboard,' ses the mate, and the old man took a look at the paper. There was Horace Greeley, Gen. Grant, James tl. Blaine, Ben Harrison, Long John Wentworth, Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Abe Lincoln, Jesse James, Admiral Farragut and Xathaniel Hawthorne. " 'And that aint' all,' ses the mate, 'for I feel it comin' over me that I used to drill around as George Wash ington, the father of our country; so it' it's ,tll the same to you, I'll eat alone after this, seeiu' that I'm the top notcher of the crowd.' "The old man turned red in the face. 'That's so,' ses he. 'Well, let me tell you somethin'. I'm through with this theosophy gag for good, and the first son of a skuuk I find on this boat with a sign of reincarnation about him, I'll make him wish he was never born. Go tell those fakirs what I said. Throw that dog overboard and kick Adams and Flaherty hack where they belong.' "The mate hacked away and the old man hustled to the cabin and started to lay down the law to Edgerton and the girl. She only laughed. " 'That's all very well,' she ses, 'but maybe your wife won't be wild when she hears how you've been makin' love to nie. And I've got witnesses, too.' "Bolton was staggered, for his wife was fierce jealous, and that girl had nerve enough for anything. " 'What'll you take to keep quiet?' ses he. " 'Let Mr. Edgerton decide,' ses the girl. "'I guess 

SI,OOO 'ud be about right,' ses Edgerton. 'You know you told me on the trip over how well iixed you were. Anyway, seein' that you've gone back on your old love, I've de cided to take a chance with her my self and we need something to start housekeeping with.' "Bolton made an awful kick, but he was sure up against it, and the end of it was that he gave them his check for the money. When he found out afterwards that the girl had eloped with Edgerton from her home in Buf falo and that they framed the game up for his benefit, he nearly went crazy with rage. And there never was no more theosophy foolishness on board the Monteagle, long as Ezra Bolton was her skipper." DIG AND BE HAPPY. Spadework Advocated as a Cure for Ills. Mr. Stephen Gwynn, an English member of parliament, claims to have discovered an infallible recipe for health. Taking as his text an alleged dic tum of President Roosevelt: "Sweat and be saved," he declared that if per spiration is the acme of physical cul ture, an analysis of the means by which it may be obtained is not to be sneezed at. The Frenchman perspires with ef fort. Germans are "even more ad mirably porous,' and your professor, sitting tranquilly beside his beer, can drip like a laborer in a hayfield." Among English and Americans of the higher class this result "can only be attained through elaborate machinery, generally disguised as a game." The objection to salvation by games is that they cost too much in time and money. Fencing and golf are iai stances. A gymnasium is "a des perate expedient." Mr. Gwynn had rather break stones than beat the air with heavy dumbbells or light ones. We must rule out running, because a man who made a habit of running half a mile a day would be counted a lunatic —"for he could not always pre tend to be catching a train." But if you have only a plot of ground in a suburb you can dig. Mr. Gwynn wonders that the doctors "have never discovered digging." An enter prising specialist should find that newly turned-up soil has a medicinal quality in its exhalations. Those who reject fosso-therapeutics might try wood chopping. Mr. Gwynn has visions of lean, athletic men in a warm glow of health, bringing home neat, bundles of logs. But Mr. Gwynn's pet idea is digging, which, he observes, has also an educa tional value. No one after two hours' spadework will be quite so pat with denunciations of the "idle working man," who thinks two dollars little enough for eight hours' digging. He stigmatizes as blasphemous the idea that devotion to athletic rites generate a kind of "morbid craving to perspire." Man, he avers, has a con stitution arranged on the assumption ' that he will perspire daily. If he does in : the constitution will go wrong in ways familiar to all brain workers.— Cornhill Magazine.

LINCOLN AND A SOLDIER. Great-Hearted President Gave Latter Chance to See His Wife and Child. Instances of President Lincoln's kindly thoughtfulness for the soldiers are almost numberless; yet from time to time a new one is brought forth from (he recollection of those who knew him in war days. On liis way to the telegraph office early one morning, says Mr. David 11. Hates in the Century Magazine, Lin coln observed in the hall a young woman who seemed to be in great dis tress. Klie carried a baby in her arms, and was pacing to and fro, and crying. The president asked Maj. Eckert. Togo out and see the woman, and learn the cause of her trouble. This was done, the major reporting that the woman had come to Washington thinking she could get a pass to the front to enable her to visit her hus band, and let him see the child, which had been born since the father @T?\ TTfp Asked Her Where She Was Staying. enlisted; hut she had learned that she would not be allowed togo to the army. "Major, let's send her down," said Lincoln. Eckert replied that strict orders had been issued not to let women goto the front. Secretary Stanton entered the office at the time, and seeing the evident sympathy of Lincoln for the woman in her trou ble, said: "Why not give her husband a leave of absence to allow him to see his wife in Washington?" "Well, come, let's do that," replied the president. "Major, you write the message." Hut Eckert said the order must be given officially. "All right, major, let Col. Hardie write the message and send it by telegraph so the man can come right up." Col. Hardie wrote the message, which was promptly telegraphed to the Army of the Potomac, and when 1 he sorrowing woman was informed of what had been done, she came into ths office to express her gratitude to the jiresident. Lincoln then asked her where she was staying. She said she had not yet found a place, having come direct from the railroad station to the Whit© House, and from there to the war department. Lincoln then directed Maj. Eckert to obtain an or der from Col. Hardie to allow the young mother and her baby to be taken care of in Carver hospital until her husband arrived. This was done, and the soldier was allowed to remain with his wife and child for over a week before return ing to his regiment. A 

LIVING MONUMENT. Lumberman's Handspike Grew to Be a Tree After He Enlisted. "There is a river birch tree on the banks of the Pond Fork branch of the Little Coal river in Boone county, West Virginia," said M. C. Eldred of Madison, W. Va., to a New York Sun reporter, "and it would go hard with any man who put an ax to it. That tree has a story. "When the Mexican war began, in 1846, a recruiting officer visited a lumber camp in the vicinity of Madi son seeking enlistments from the sturdy woodsmen who were at work there. Among them was a giant lum berman named Jim Martin. "He was using a handspike made from a river birch sapling recently cut and still green. Eager togo to the front, he thrust his handspike deep into the soft soil of tin; river bank and went away with the recruiting officer. "The handspike Jim Martin used was too big and heavy for any of his fellows to handle, and it was left sticking where he had jabbed it into the ground. The next spring it was noticed thai it was putting forth green shoots, showing that it had rooted in tho ground. "It was left undisturbed, and it grow to be a great tree, and it stands to-day on the spot where the patriotic Jim Martin thrust it into the earth its a battered handspike 61 years ago. Jim Mait'u was killed in battle, and his bon"-s lie somewhere ou Mexican ground, but he has his monument in this still sound and vigorous tree, which is a revered landmark in all that country."

C. ilarbaugii. THE MATTER OF PENSIONS. Progress Made in Effort to Provide for Old Soldiers. The United States pension office has had ati especially busy year, by reason of the age and service act of congress, passed February 6, 1907. There were not many entirely new applications for pension under this act, but there was a tremendous rush of claims for increase of pension, the applicants de siring to be transferred from the lists tinder former laws so as to receive the benefits of the new law. This law, which provides for the payment of a pension of sl2 a month to honorably discharged soldiers of the civil war who served 90 days and who havb reached the age of 02 years, sls a month to ihose of above service who are 70 years of age, and S2O a month to those of the same service who have reached the age of 75 years, has added to the annual disbursements by the pension bureau, although the number of pensioners decreased by 18,000 dur ing the last fiscal year. According to the annual report of the commissioner of pensions, 350,000 applications were received under the above-named law up to June 30, 1907, and 120,0U0 certificates had been is sued upon these applications up to that time; without doubt a large num ber of certificates have been issued since the close of the fiscal year. As few of these claims are entirely new, the military service of the claim ants has already been fully assured, an, no medical examination being re quired, and in many cases the age of the claimant having been already shown to the pension bureau under former claims, the government is en abled to pass expeditiously upon these cases, and give to the old sol diers immediate benefits under the new law. Considering that the claimants un der this law are all aged men, and many of them in need, it is matter of congratulation to the country, writes Ada C. Sweet in Chicago Journal, that the pension bureau has been prompt in settling claims of this class. The indications are that by the close of the present fiscal year all pending claims under this act will be adjusted, and the bureau will then have only to issue the certificates for increase, which will have to be made when the claimants reach the age to entitle them to increased pensions. The annual value of the pension roll now, that is, the amount that would be required to pay the pensioners on the roll at the close of the fiscal year for one entire year, provided there were no changes by death or otherwise, is $140,850,550.60. There are under all laws antl special acts of congress now on the rolls 967,371 pensioners, to whom the above amount will be paid, or would be paid if they all were to live and remain upon the pension list. The bureau is still active in the prosecution of offenders against the pension laws. One hundred and eight convictions were secured last year upon cases presented to the depart ment. of justice. "it is gratifying to state,"says the pension commissioner, "that of the 10S convictions only 16 represented cases against persons who rendered either military or naval service, again demonstrating the fact that the de fenders of the government are not in clined to become offenders against the pension laws." The convictions were secured large ly for such offenses as the making of false affidavits, impersonating a pen sioner, conspiracy to defraud, perjury, etc. In the special examination division of the pension office, where cases are taken up for searching examination by the agents of the bureau—each case at the home of the applicant and involving the personal cross-examina tion by an agent of the government of the claimant and ills witnesses— -9,77."» were taken up and disposed oJ during the year.
