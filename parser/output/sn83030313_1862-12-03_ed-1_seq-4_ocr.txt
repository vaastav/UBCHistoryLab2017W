Hew York, Wed lit ?rtajr< December 3, WCI. THE SITUATION. Wc have received the reports of the National Departments in Washington, excepting that of the Secretary of tite Treasury. We have on hand:? 1.?The War Report. 2 The Naval Report. 3.?The Interior Report. 4.?The Post Office Report. 5.?The Indian Report, 6.?The lmnd Office report. These reports, embracing a history of the events Of the past year, contaiu only iuiormation that has already been given in the columns ot the IIkrald, derived from our special correspondents; but as matters of record, and bearing unofficial stamp, we intend to give tlicm, as space permits, till they are all published. The President's message indicated the policy and measures of the government. The Secretary of War in his report states that ?*?< portion of the United State# which is now, 31 has be* u during the lH?t year, the scene of mili tary operations, is confined wiihin ten military de partments; that the armies operating in those de partments, acoording to recent official returns, oonstitute e force of seven hundred and soventy Cvc thouaand three hundred and thirty-six officers and privates, fully armed and equipped: that Bince the date of the returns this number has been increased to over eight hundred thousand; that when the quotas are filled up it will number a million of men; and that the valor of our troops has bean displayed on mnny occasions, and the skill and gallantry of their officers have been dis tinguished at York to wu, Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Gaines' Mill, Malvern Hill, (Too., Keys, Cedar Moun tain, C-tiatitilly. and other places. Anlictam and Hontli Mountain are included, probably, in Mr. Btantou's "other places." In connection with these documents we give to day a summary of General Hslleek's report to Becretary Ktanton concerning the progress of the war, which also forms a portion of cotcmporary history, though tiot comprised in the regular re ports of the departments. A rcconueisaancc was made on Sunday by Gen. Averitl's cavalry up the Rappahannock as far as Barrett's Ford, but saw no enemy. The batteries hare been silent for the last two days, but the works of the enemy continue to be increased day by day, and everything indicates that the rebels intend to maintain their position at Fredericks burg. A portion of General Backs' expedition left this part yesterday for "the Bouth." Tli* vessels c0n suited of the United States transports New Briina Wick, Illinois, Northern Light, North Star, J. S. Green. Rase, Salvor and otbeis, with troops and provisions. Our news from the West is not important. It is ?tated on the authority of a Washington journal that General McNeil, who ordered the execution Of the Confederate prisoners ?t Palmyra. Mo., some time since, sod whose surrender is now demanded , by Jeff. Darls, is rei-poosiblc for bis cctiou to the Missouri State authorities, under whom he bold* his cotnrai**iou. The Leavenworth Enquirer of November 21 state- that he lias been surrendered to the rebel authorities, first having been put in Irons, but the statement is probably premature. ( We give to-day an interesting resume oi Boutb grn news, embracing extracts from the journals of Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and other Elates.

Mr. Powoll, of Kentucky, ottered a reeduttoh calling on the Prooldent for information in regard to arreaU of cUisena of Kentucky by the miUtAry authorities, also a preamble and reeoluLon - daring that many cKi?na of the United Statea have been arrested and imprisoned without any charges being preferred against them what ever, and that all euch arrests tvre un authorized by the constitution and laws of the United States, and are usurpations of the power delegated by the people to the President; and that all such arrests aro hereby condonteod and declared palpable violations of the constitu tion of the United States, and it is hereby de manded that all such arrests shall cease hereafter, and that all persons so arrested shall have a prsmpt and speedy trial, "according to the provi sions of the constitution," or be immediately re leased. These resolutions were laid over. Mr. Havls, of Kentucky, offered a joint resolution declaring that it is hereby recommended that all the States choose delegates, to meet in couvention at Louisville, on the first Monday of April next, to take into consideration the present condition of ihc country and the proper means to be pursued for restoring the Union, and that the Legislatures of the diff-Tont States take suoli action as they may deem fit for this purpose at the earliest posm ble date. This was also laid over, and the Seuate adjourned. In the House of Representatives a bill was passed providing for the payment in gold and silver of all judgments recovered by the United States. The Military Committee were instructed to inquire into the propriety of increasing the pay of soldiers to fifteen dollars per month, and mak ing reductions in the pay of officers not aotively engaged. The Secretary of the Navy waa called on for information respecting the appointment of Acting Midshipmen during the recess of Congress. The Committee of Ways and Means were instructed to inquire and report as to the propriety of admit ting cotton brought from foreign countries free of duty. The Committee on Tublic Excnditures was instructed to examine iuto the expenses of the General Lnnd Office, and to report what reductions con be made. A bill was introduced for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian outbreak in Minne sota; also to abrogate all treaties between the government and the SiouX Indiana. A bill to re duce the tax on whiskey was brought forward, but objection was made to its introduction, whereupon the House adjourned. 

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. By ths arrival of the steamship Union at this port yesterday we have later advices from Havana and Mexico. The news from Monaco is not imme diately important, but the intelligence goes to show that the French are about to have a rough time with the Mexicans. According to alt ac" counts there lias been a fight, in which the I* rench have been victorious; but this must have been some small skirmish on the outposts of the two armies. The Mexicans, north, south, east and west, are beating upVecruita for the aimy to op pose the French invaders, and it is said that the army is increasing with great rapidity. Both French and Mcxicnns were intrenching and forti fying themselves. The news from Havana is un important. To-morrow will he observed in Canada as the annual Tlienksgiv ng day. John B.Norman, proprietor of the New Alba ny (Indiana) L*dgc>', who has been arrested and imprisoned by order of General Rosecrans, for publishing a detailed acc ount of the strength and progress of tin- Mississippi river expedition, pi a republican aud a strong supporter of the ad ministration. The Memphis Appro', which skedaddled from that city when the Union gunboats appeared be fore it, and took up quarters at Grenada, Missis sippi. is again on the move, and intends locating Jackson. 1 With a large decrease in the receipts of beef cattle?comprising about 1,400?the market was decidedly more aerfive and buoyant this week, while prices experienced an advance of full} half a cent per pound, snil many were quoted three-quaitcrs of a cent higher. The range whs from 6c. 1o 9c. a 9*/,c? and whole droves were sold at ?y,c. to 9e. Only extras sold St 9V?e., however, and the number sold at that rate was accoidingly small. Common cattle Bold quite freely at from 6c. to 7c. Milch cows were quiet at *25 to HO a *50, according to quality. Veals were steady al Itom 4c. to Cc. a CV?c., the latter rate for choice, fchecp and lambs were ac tive, ard about 25c. per head higher, varying from to It 50 a IG. Extras sold still higher.

The lota receipts were. 4.0G6 beet cattle, 8G cows, 110 veals, 9,121 sheep and lambs, and 52,6'iG swine.

"8ave ur from our friends 1'' Their organs in New York do them Infinite da" mage. They attribute to tbem the entire dis grace of the failure ol our arms on the Rappa hannock. They say Burnniue has done his duty but Meigs and the War Department have failed to co operate. Hence the sudden halt in the j advance of the army to Richmond. The chief ! share of the indignation is visited on General j Meigs, and we have ao doubt it is justly due. Let , hint ba removed, and (Jen. Van Vleit, an able j and efficient officer, take his place. Cut let not j the work of reform stop there. Let the whole ! War Department be cleared out, frem Secretary Stanton down, and then perhapa we may have I the business done in a proper manner. Certain i it is that any change must be for the better. Tor Citt Elections Yrstouut.?As might ' be expected, tbo city of New York went demo era tie yesterday in the charter elections, with 1 the exception of a few of the school officers. The democrats have ejected Baennan for Comp troller and Devollo for Corporation Counsel. The Comptroller ie elected hy over thirteen thousand majority. The majorities are not so great as in the .State cleotlons In Novetaber,^le interest not beiog so general or involving im portant political considerations. Yet such is the force of the revolution that it has extended to eflloes which in their nature have no politi cal significance. Any man celling biineelfcon ?ervatfve would. In the present temper of the people, be elected to any office in the gift of the gftigeo* B*?Uca1? and Clue PrttUltnCi KM Sag*. The radicals do not like the PreetdeoCa Moe eage. They try to take it down nicely; b^t tbe plU ia eo exoesaivoly bitter that they cannot restrain themselves from making a few wry faoee and muttering a few half suppressed cureeo not very loud, but moet heartily deep. Tbe THbune endeavors to satisfy Itself with the it;flection that the President admits that if there had been no slavery there would have been no war, but adds that, while ''agreeing with hiin on the main question, we differ ou subordinate points, without reserve and without feeling." The Wriinoie's consolation is very weak. If there bad been no slavery there would have boon no war, says poor Greeley, and, therefore* slavery ought to be abolished. Yes; but If there had been no Yankees, if then had been no Boechers, Garrisons and Choevcrs, 11 there had been no powder, if there had been no big guns, little'guns or pistols, there would have boon uo war; aud must we, therefore, abolish the Yankees, the Beschers, the powder and the guD6? The Times, less hypocritical and loss cautious than the THbune, bluntly declares that the President's statements " will not command universal assent, and we deem it very doubtful whether Congress will enact tho laws necessary to carry his recommendations into efl'cct." That silly old grandmother, the Commercial, finds fault with tho President for not mentioning the army and navy in detail, an A refers its readers to the Message for any further opinions. Tho stubborn Post strains and strains to be mild and pleasant, but finally blurts out the assertion that " to free men gradually, or by instalments, is like cutting off a dog's tail by inches, to get him used to tbe paiu." This is the style in which the radical republi can organs endorse the Message of the President whom they have elected. This is the support which President Lincoln receives from his dear political friends. If tbe radical journals go so far as Ibis on-.the day after the reading of the Message, how far will the radical orators go in a week from now ? Wendell Phillips used to call the President a tortoise; but now the simile will i certainly be changed for the woiBe, and Honest Old Abe will be stigmatized as a clam. Brud der I'cecher used to pray for the President once in awhile; but wc should not be surprised if the Chief Executive were solemuly excommunical. ed in Plymouth Church next Sunday. Cheever( who never prays for his enemies, but always damns Ihom incontinently?soul, body and boots?will rave like a maniac at the idea of postponing emancipation until 1900, and mak ing it compensatory after all. As for Garrison and Gcrrit Smith, their indigation will know no bounds, since tho President calls slaves ''pro. perty acquired by descent or purchase, the same as any other property," and proposes to tax us all, conservatives and abolitionists, in order to buy up and free this " property" on two legs The emancipation proclamation was a sop to the abolition Cerberus; but this message is a red hot iron in the rear, and the Cerberus will soon be wide awake and howiiug. It is all very well to quote the Scriptural truism that'? one generation passeth away and anotbor generation cometh," and to coolly state that those who would be disturbed by the President's ariange* meut " will have passed aw ay before its con summation, and will ncvei seo it;" but that docs not sat isfy the radical abolitionists. They do not wanPto "pass away." They want to ?'see it" now. They desire the political power and the political plunder which abolition will give them. What difference does it make to them whether or not immodiate emancipation is good for the negro? They do not care for the negro; they have been working for them selves. Promising the abolition of slavery to the rudict.ls after their death is like offering to free all slaves if the abolitionists will allow themselves to be bung. But are we, then, in favor of the President's plan? 'Certainly we are. We are in favor of any plan for the good of mankind, including the plan for planting the Central Park with those trees which bear roast pigs for fruit, and the plan lor build'ng a railway across the At lantic, with a branch road to tbe moon. Let Congre.^ paas tiie requisite acts immediately, and make the President's projects effective. It is a long time from 18Vi to 1900. There will be a great many changes before these thirty seven years aad one month are over. We ex pect to cany every State by a conservative majority before that period. Wo expect to elect several conservative Frosidonts and Con gresses before the emancipation tnllleniuui dswns. If anything is bndiv legislated nowa days we rely upon these future rulers to repeal it and straighten matters out. Iu 1900 the war will be almost forgotten, and little boys and girls, yet unborn, will be studying its history in their school books. In 1900 Greeley will have graduated at, the almshouse or the lu natic asylum, and bis very name will be lost in oblivion, or remembered ouly with those of .Tu das Iscariot. Benedict Arnold sod Jeff. Davis. In 1900 BeecLer and Cbeover will be tasting the truth of some of their sermons. In 1900 Phillips, Garrison and Gcrrit Smith will be' atoning for the misery they have caused. In 1900 Ibo nation will be greater, purer and more i powerful tfcau its present condition would indi cate. If any one wishes to wdd that in 1900 all the slaves will be froe, we have not the slightest objection. Hnlf of them would have been freed thirty years ago if the fanatical abolition ists had not chosen the negro as a back upon which to ride into high political places. All that is necessary to end this rebellion and re store the Union is to set the negro aside and settle treason by bard knocks. If the Presideut's idea is to accomplish this bv postponing Suinbo until 1900, we think it an excellent scheme, and will suppoit It loyally. We have always ad mired tho President as a joker, but we never imagined that he could so ap'iy bleed exqui site humor and practical common sense in an official document, lie knows that the agitation about slavery hinders the war, and he is right in desiring to postpone fhis agitation. In fact, a truce on the nvgro question until 1900 is a mili tary necessity. As such the abolitions tfewill be obliged to submit to it with iheir customary grace. We see no reason, in'deod. why the whole country should not be unanimous upon the subject. None of the pre?"nt generation reed object to tbo Plesldcnt's plan; for. as the Message says, wo shall not have to pay tho taxes to carry it into operation, and shall all be in onr dotege or in our graves before it is con. snmmated. Tbe future generation is in no condition to object now. and we arc not aware that anybody?except, per liape, one of the spiritual mediums -can claim to be their representative, and object for them. It ia our business te secure a country for the future generations to dwelt in; and aa [ they must pay the emancipation taxes, certainly they ought to be allowed to arrange the dar key's etalua for themselves. We repeat, there fore, that Congress should immediately adopt the President's aEggestioia, and then, having dis posed of the inevitable African until 1900, we can direct our whole attention to the vigoroua prosecution of the war for the Union and the constitution. Thk London Times' Richmond Coruespon dcnt.?When the London Times announood with a groat flourish of trumpets that it had secured the aervioes of a regular correspondent at the rebel capital, sever A of our journals hazarded conjectures as to whom this correspondent was. The New York 2tones was sure that John Mitch ell was the man. The World was equally cer. tain that Mr. Vitzelly, the artist of the London Illustrated Knot, had dropped the crayon and taken up the pen for the Times. Another paper asserted that the letters were written by Mr. George Brown, formerly connected with the Journal of Commerce, and now the rebel Assistant Secretary of State. The He rald, however, expressed the opinio^ that Mr.. Frank Law ley, the dishonest private secretary of Mr. Gladstone, had retire^ from Baltimore to -the more congenial society of Richmond, and was the author of the Times' epistles. The following ad, ertisement, from the Richmond Dispatch of a recent date, Bhows that our cotemporarles were as mistaken and the Herald as correct as usual:? I Wanted, by an English gentleman, a parlor and bed roun, or a bedroom, large and well furnished, with writ ing table, with fireplace, corI and gas, in some private family, near tbo Capitol squaro. Apply to Mr. Lawlay, room 66, Ballard House. It seems, then, that this Mr. Frank Lawley, driven out of Baltimore by our expose of his an tecedent*, has retreated to the rebel headquar ters. and, having probably made himself wel come by revealing all he had learned of our af fairs at Baltimore, he 1b about to settle dow.i comfortably iu "a parlor and bedroom, or a bedroom, large and well furnished," and write up secession stories for the Lon don Times. Just how much credence should be given to bis stories may be judged from the character of the man himself Mr. Lawley dishonorably revealed and specu lated npen the contents of the English budget, with which ho became acquainted while acting as private confidential Secretary to the Chan cellor of the Exchequer. He lost heavily on 'Change, his perfidy was discovered, Mr. Glad stone disowned him in Parliament,, and be was forced to leave his country for his country's good. After a short stay in Chicago, the London Times selected him as au admirable person to lake the place of Bull Run Russell, and stationed him at Baltimore. From thence he has levanted to Richmond, where he will mingle with persous of the same stamp as him self, and do this country all the harm he can We suppose that his brother, who has just been detected in a swindling bet in England, and who is represented as having expressly contradicted his own written testimony, will shortly be attached to the Times corps and join Frank among the rebels. IIow much reliance is to be placed upon the letters of such correspondents, or tbo comments of the stock gambling journal which employs such knaves, may be readily surmised. The Illegal Imprisonments and the In quiry in Coxoress.?Two or throe different attempt?, made by members of Congress to inquire into the unconstitutional arrests made under the authority of the administra tion, were voted down on Monday by two to one. It seems t hat the voice of the peo ple, or expitssed in the late elections, have had little effect upon Congress. Had Ibis rump par liament been guilty of such contempt of tbe popular will before the elections, the vote against republicanism would have been ten times great er than it was. Do the party in power "love the darkness rather than the light because their deeds are evil ?'' If what has been done is right, why do they fear to lay the facts before the couotiy ! If the acts of tbe administration cannot bear scrutiny, the remedy is not to .con* coal their dark deeds from tbe people, but to get rid of the perpetrators and put better men in their places. In no government in tbe world, claiming to be constitutional, could such a course be permitted. In England, for instance, whose system is so much less free, the adminis tretion would not dare to oppose so reasonable nn Inquiry. If it did. Ibnl would be the last of it. IIow much more is it the right of the peo ple, through their representatives, in such a dbuntry as this, to demand au investigation into all matters of public administialien, particular ly those which affect t he liberties of the oitiaen? The bare fact of refusal is prima facie evidence j of injustice or foul play. As well might tbo magistrate of a district insist upon a murdered tnau being interred without a coroner's inquest. To refuse inquiry in the strongest admission of guilt Those who are conscious ofinnocence al ways court investigation. But there is a good time coming, in which investigation will become in evitable. and well w ill it be lor those who now attempt to throw a veil over black deeds if they escape the public wrath by a mere expo sure of their career. Stern justice may demand a greater sacrifice, and the voters against in quiry may then fihd themselves on the wrong side. Nothing is more certain on earth than that a reckoning is to be made before this civil convulsion is ever, and that every man will be rewarded according to his deeds. Thin is but the beginning of the end. Let tbe fanatics and knaves in Congress beware. j Is Sf.AYERY 1HE (JaOHB OP 

DISUNION AND THE War?- There is one poiot in the President's Message in whichlt is very clear that Mr. Lin coln is entirely mistaken, sad that is, that, slavery is the cause of disunion and the war. and that till the cause is abolished the cfTeets will continue to exist. If negro slavery is the cause of tho w r, why did it not produce war for the lasl/ighty years' This in-tit nt ion prevailed In every State In the Union at the foundation ot (ho government, and is recognized and protected by the constitution To say that it is the caiMe of the war is, there fore. a grave error. The cause of tho war is the antMavery propagandist which has sprung up at the North within the last thirty years. By its proceedings and Its thresienings it h?H given the secessionists on excuse for their revolt, and has enabled tiem to sediio* from their alle giance to the federal ^overntueat the great body of the Southern people. Bo far from Southern slavery being a cause of war and dis union. it would have been a b< nd of union nnd peace if the fnnutical abolitionists bad let it alone; for its toleration by the Northern States, as the constitution provided, would bo the strongest kind of inducement to the Houth to remain in the Union. Tn the event of the so. paratlon the chances of the preservation of tbq institution would not be so rood-. ? ? i ?^M>w???mmm??mm among other reason*, booow? U* fugWe# ?laves would not be returned- Abolish slavery end the South therefore hae no great control" ling motive to continue its connection with the North- Negro slavery produced cotton in great abundance, aa it oould not be produced under any other system; and the South being wholly an agricultural country, and the Eastern States chiefly manufacturing, the interests of both sec tions wore mutual. To attempt an inroad upon the Southern system of labor is to destroy the re ciprocity and the bslanoe of interests by which the whole country has hitherto prospered General Phelps classed "popery" and slavery together, as standing in the way of human pro gress, and it wotild be just as rational to wage a war against the Catholic Church as against the domeetio Institutions of the South. The President's Messaob and the War.? Very general are the complaints of the silence of the President, in his annual Message, on the paramount and all-absorbing question of the war. Even the old Commercial Advertiser, of this city, which is seldom given to violent emo tions, cannot restrain its intense feelings of dis appointment. It says that "iu one respect the Message disappoints us, and is, indeed, unsatis factory. It is entirely silent ou the domestic condition of the country. Except from incidental mention, the reader of the document would have no idea of the mighty and exhausting conflict through which the country is passing, and which has been so fruitful of events during the past year." That the Message "is without a word of commisseration for the brave wounded and dead, or a genial paragraph for the living;" that "it i3 strangely barren of every word or idea that could lead one to suppose that war had slain its thousands and disease its tens of thousands since the preceding Message wa3 penned;" that this one "has not a word of sym pathy for the past or cheer for the future, and yet we all know that a more patriotic heart and a more kindly nature has no man than Abra ham Lincoln." But President Lincoln is entitled to the bene fit of bis explanation of the remarkable omis gloirwhiek is the subject of this complaint. He refers the two houses of Congress to the accom panying reports of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, and says that "these reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the vei y numerous and exten sive transactions and operations conducted through these departments; nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore con tent myself with laying the reports before yom and asking your attention to them." This covers the special object of the Message, which is the presentation to Congress of the transactions of the departments referred to dur ing the past year. But still, an undesirable gap in the Message remains, which might have been filled up with some general conclusions from the prodigious balance of substantial victories and solid conquests achieved during the year by the fleets and armies of the Union. Worried, however, as Mr. Lincoln has been, day aud night, by tffc abolition fanatics representing the majority in both houses of the present Congress, and with the consequences of this war upon the negro rooe constantly before bis eyes, in the swarms of vagrant ' contrabands" with which the city of Washington is overrun, it is not sur prising that he left all observations upon the progress and prospects of the war to bis Secre taries, Stanton and AVelles, in order that he might have free swing to discuss mis ever pre sent and torturing question of slavery.

TDK MESSAGE AND TUB ARMY AMD HAVY. The omission on the part of the rrcsldont to oomtuond or oondemn the conduct of the army aud navy during tta? past year has boeu the subject or considerable ommuont As be was aware that those matters have been troatod at length by the heads of the departments to which they particularly .belong, It may Uavo been bis iniention to ab breviate his Message by ostitUoi any allusion 10 them, but it is thought strange that the Commandoi in-Chiof of the army and navy should have failed to spoek ol either at the conclusion of a year of war in which there have been so many stirring events. RUMORED CABINET CHANGES. It seems to bo settled that Caleb B. Smith will shortly resign his position as Bed rotary or the Interior, to accept tho vacant District Judgeship in Indiana; and in somo circles It is assorted that Senator Browning will suooeod to the vacancy thus created. Nothing is known here confirmatory of tho report ttaag Gen. Buruside has been relieved of tho command of tbn Army of the Potomac. TBE WANTS OP TUB ARMY OP THE POTOMAC?WHA? HAS RKTARDBD ITS ADVANOH. Tho correspondents who are writing that tbo army Ran been without vegetables for some weeks, that pontoons are lacking, (hat tho enemy are in great force, are only stating what has beou long known, yet baa boon strenu ously doniod by them. Officers who came up to dav from our army say that tho roads are In execrable condition. Tho shoes that are furnished the army go to pieoes almost immediately in cold, wet weather. One or the organs here oontinues its opposition to an advance of the army, and questions the competency of General Burnsido to command. It seems that Major Spalding, of the New York Volun 1 teers, is made to suffer for the delay in tho transit of tbo pontoou hi idgo train. ARREST OF ARMY OFFICERS OK THE CHAROB OP PKTAININQ A PONTOON TRAIN. Tho War Department has caused the arrest of Major Spauldiog, of the Fiftieth New York Rngtucer Volunteers, and the other officers who were with him, in the rooont transportation of tho pontoon train from this point to Falmouth, Va.

WU AT WILL CONGRESS DO?THE RADICAL PRO GRAMME FOR NEORORS?THE MESSAGE- KTO. Mr. Feesrtiden, of Maine, was earnestly talking to-day to several Senators, which is not his practice. He is for a business session, in order that an extra mooting may not be required whoa the popular branch will bo to the hands of the democrats. It has beou a common In quiry here, what will be done at Ibis sossion? But it is answered that the miocbioi has been all done, and what is now wanted isa"black code," or something of that sort,whereby tho emancipated slaves may bo employed, led, clothed, sheltered, schooled, and provided fcr as a class in the way of hospitals for tho deaf, dumb, blind and aged, orphaus, AC. Measures for alj these purposes, as well as for author.sing blaoas to hold olltce, vole, sit on juries, dd military duty,^m., are requ'isilo toconiplote the programme. The radicals are very abusive ?f the President about compensated emancipation aud deportation Tho coasec* vatlves gav, let the nigger alone aud push on the column. It is in mookory to talk of compensation for slaves when the bulk of them wo to bo made free by the proclamation iu a month. THE 

PRAYERS OP THE ABOLITION CHAPLAINS OP CON GRRSS. The prayers lliat wore offered yesterday aud to-day In the Senate have boon no offensive to somo Senators, who do uol think all loyalty oonsista in abolitionism, tbni they do not intend again to listen to pm tiaun supplloa I Ions to the I*etty. THK PROCEEDINGS OP CONGRESS. Nothing of iinporUnco was done iu Coutrress to-day. In the Senato a similar scene to that enaoted in tho Honoe yc~lerday occurred u, on the introduction of a resolution rr<m Nenalor Towel!,condemning th? arroat by military authority, without charges prefoi red or trial recorded,aa unconstitutional. .The question appears so Inr to be the only oue that is to be preeaed as a par(y measure,and the shrinking of ouc party from iie invert igaiion Indicates# consciousness that the arrests a- e ir.detourible. BxpreestonB h-.ve been uttered to-day of surprise thi^thc moods of the administration fhould not promptly defend them, selves by punishing those who have exposed them unnecessarily to these a*s mils. The Kaiwual Convention propoee.l by Mr. Davts, o* Kentucky, is regarded aa simply a resurrection of the Peace Convention which met In the earlier stages of the rebellimi and fail to accomplish anything. The notion, North nud South, does not yet seem lo have suffered suf ficiently to be cured of |iollticsl partisan proclivities, aud look only with a patriotic view upon questions or publio policy. Mr. Davis' national convention would not, in the estimation of the 81 congest Uuioti men here, be able to accomplish any beneficial result. Neither House remained in session to-day mere than half an hour. The Con gross local roach oery is notystm complete working order. Tbo committees are being called, and Ibe unfinished busineos Of tho last nesaloo re viewed. It is not probable that much will bo dono during this week excelling lu tho way of preparation. The Bankrupt bill, which Ilea over from the laat sea. alon. was made the order or llioday for aext Monday. If the friends of Ihc measure wore present to naaeifeat aw iutorest in its passage it might be passed, but in the sb senco of aoy movement on Ibeir pwt it may be placed ia such ? position iu the calendar that it will again (ail Into tbs unfinished business of this rest loo. Tbo recommendations of ibe President in regard to emancipation have boon lbs principal topic in poliitaal circles here to dsy. While Ihc radicals profess to believe that it Is an amendment of ibe proclamation of Septem ber ?, they manifest mnch chagrin at Its preseatatloa and promineuoaln the Presidential Message. Many of tbn conservatives express tho opt a ion that the simple propo all ion that slnvory shnll-coose In 190fi, would be accepnbie to all the border slave Slates without Ibe promis* of eom p?Dsatlofl, which is regards* as a dangerous precedent. The Ore eailng radicals prouounee the whole affiilr as only ? second edition of the pjsvlous abolition proclamation.
