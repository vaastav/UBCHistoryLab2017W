Mo DANIEL ACQUIT? OF M Jury, After Hour and Fifteen Minutes, Finds Him Not Guilty of Slaying Wife. COURT ROOM CROWD CHEERS THE YERDICT He Thanks Counsel, Friends and Shakes Hands With Men Who Freed Him. THREE BALLOTS TAKEN Five of Twelve Men Voted for Conviction of First fcailot, Then Yielded. St. Joseph, .Mo., Dec. 5. After one of the most sensational trials in the criminal history of St. Joseph, Oscar D. McDaniel, prosecuting attorney of Buchanan County, was acquitted early thi.s evening of the charge of having beaten his wife to death. The jury reached its verdict after deliberating one hour and fifteen min utes. McDaniel, who was at home when the jury announced that it was, ie:uiy to report, hurried to the Court house in an automobile, and was seat ed beside his attorneys when the jur ers filed into the room. There was a slight demonstration, which was promptly squelched by the court. McDaniel sat motionless as the foreman of the jury announced: "We, the jury, find the defendant not guil ty." McDaniel and his attorneys faced each other and then shook hands hearti ly. The prosecuting attorney's friends, who were seated in the rear of the courtroom, rushed to the front of the building to congratulate the acquitted official. He smiled and thanked each one. McDaniel then shook hands with each member of the jury and express ed his gratitude. "There was no other verdict," he said. "It was a case of unparalleled persecution. My enemies look advan tage of my calamity to attempt to de stroy me. They introduced testimony that had no foundation in their efforts to convict me of a crime that was committed by criminals whom I prosecuted." He walked out of the courtroom with a crowd of friends following. He entered an automobile with his attor neys and was driven to his home, where the members of his family, who had been notified of the verdict, wait ed to receive him. It was announced tonight by a mem ber of the jury'thfit three ballots were taken before the agreement was reach ed. On the first vote, seven members were for acquittal and five for con viction. Ten voted for acquittal on the second ballot and the twelve men vere unanimous for exonerating Mc Daniel on the third vote. John T. Darker, Attorney-General of Missouri, for the Stat?, this afternoon closed the argument before the jury. Following Barker's address the case was given to the jury. Judge C. F. Strop, McDanicl's chief counsel, fin ished his argument this morning. A large crowd attended the last day's session of the trial. "I came here unknown to you men, and when your verdict is rendered I may go away, never again to see you on this earth again. There is no. word nor act I have spoken or done but that I believe is honest and fair and patri otic to my country," said Barker. "When I came here, gentlemen, I ex pected to find a prosecuting attorney who would come and lay bare his troubles to me. It was the Attorney General and he was your prosecuting attorney. I expected, if he were inno cent, to sec him come to me and tell mo all, so we might try him honestly and openly. "But when I came here I found the scene and plot all set. I pund the background and the stage prepared. They were all fiked. I had no co-operation'. I found this defendant playing the same game as all criminals play. There was nothing left out. It was r.,,1.1 cof the as every common iciuu wvwu. stage." . As the Attorney-General got into his talk his voice trembled and he stepped closer to the jury. As he told the story , of the murder, he crouched and his. voice broke and he whispered to me "I found this defendant sitting here day after day beside all his people the same old criminal game. I found him sitting here, his little children on his lap the same old gae. X found him trying to bring sympathy to him self from this jury behind the heads of those sweet little children the chil dren that are now motherless as a re sult of that awful crime for which their father is on trial." j Barker declared McDaniel had Hilt j up about himself "the very sprt of r.n alibi and plan of defense that has been in vogue among criminals throughout all these years." Helen McDaniel looked up at the face of her father, in whose lap she sat. He looked down at her and smiled. "I find this man defended, gentle men, by two of the most prominent criminal attorneys in Northwest Mis souri, men who are always on th side of guilty criminals. They are the sort of men criminals must have. "I have had no winks for jurymen, jurymen had no smiles for me. Had I come here each day, winking at you men, I would expect you to believe I thought you fools." Barker went over the State's evi-1 dence and attacked McDanicl's story. He dcclai-ed McDaniel went to the sa loon where he said he was caWed and bought drinks and told his name to impress on the men that he was there. When he started back home, he said, he picked up a police officer to impress on him that he was away from home at the time. He said Mrs. Me-1 Daniel was not found on the door as the defendant testified. The Attorney-General attacked the defense attorneys and McDaniel for not introducing the threatening letters the prosecutor said he received. "They would not have convicted him alone," said Barker. McDaniel did not attempt to prevent an inquest to determine the cause of the death of his wife. Strop told the jury, in concluding his closing argu ment this morning. It was grief that caused McDaniel to tell the Coroner an hour after his wife had died tha the did not want to talk! of an inquest then, and it was com mon sense, said Strop, attorney for McDaniel. "McDaniel was in perfect accord with the Coroner when he finally de cided to hold an inquest," Strop said. The Coroner had testified for the State that McDaniel requested that he tell the newspapers he had called for an inquest when finally the Coroner concluded to hold one. Impressionable, easily convinced per sons, who used their imagination, was the way Strop characterized the neigh bors who have testified they heard Mrs. McDaniel's voice in a scream at 10:30 o'clock the night of the murder. McDaniel sat, brushing the hair of his little daughter, Marion, with his hand for an hour after court opened. During argument of his counsel about screams of cats in the McDaniel neigh borhood, humorous situations caused the defendant to laugh aloud. "See here," said Strop, holding an advertising booklet showing Hartley and his bloodhounds; "Hartley's eye doesn't look into yours, does it? No. It looks to one side. He can't look to one side. He can't look straight at you. But look at the dogs. Why, men, they've got more honesty in them than Hartley.' They look at you." "We don't know who kiilod Mrs. Mc Daniel; we can't account for this hor rible crime; neither can you fix the responsibility," Strop said. "After this trial is over Oscar D. McDaniel will go out of office and he will do everything within his power to find the murderer of his wife. But we must not try to do it now. We must try to pave this man from the clutches of an awful framcup." Strop tried to show the regret of juries that have in the past convicted innocent men. "Great God, gentlciv.cn of the jury be cautious, be cautious," he said. 'A human life is at stake. Do you want upon flimsy circumstances, the work of known liars and crooks, to send this man to the hangman's noose?" "If Gard told the truth, this prose cution is ended." Strop declared. He also said the State's theory that an other woman "was about to break up the McDaniel home" had been proven false by the evidence adduced. "Gossiping neighbors" were charged by Strop with having been the cause in part, of the prosecuton of Mc Daniel. Strop declared that "if the Moss family had been allowed to move upon McDaniel after the murder," Miss Ailene Moss, sister of Mrs. McDaniel, would not have testified against her accused brother-in-law.

THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE AND CAPE COUNTY HERALD, FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 116. JIM WATSON OF INDIANA GIVEN SEAT IN SENATE Efforts (o Oust Republican Member Elect is Defeated by Vote of 44 to 32. CORRUPT PRACTICE ACT GETS HEARING May Limit National Campaign t xpenses to $400,000-Wilson Reads Messacc. Washington, Dec. 5. Efforts made in. the Senate to prevent the sealing of James E. Watson, Senator-elect from Indiana, bv a motion to refer al! I oemuors eiect to tnc committee on Privileges and Elections was lost by a voce of 44 to "2. Before the motion was put to a vote, Republican and Democratic members engaged in a heated debate. Several Democrats, however, joined the Republicans in killing the move. After listening to the President's message, the Senate took up the cor rupt practice bill, which is designed to limit the National Campaign Com mittee's expenditures to $400,000. Senator Owens of Oklahoma, demand ed an e:i"'v vote on the measure. Senator Penrose, Republican, of Pennsylvania, introduced what is known as a "force bill." its ob.uvt be r j i . .i - ... ing to break up the Democratic con trol of the South. This was an amend ment to the Corrupt Practice bill. The measure was laid over until tomorrow on account of the absence of many Senators. Senator Martine's resolu tion, urging an embargo on war ma terials and food products, was refer red to the Foreign Relations Commit tee, of which Senator Stone of Mis souri is chairman. The Missourian is said to Lc opposed to an embargo. The Senate adjourned to reconvene u'c noon tomorrow. The appearance of President Wilson, who delivered his annual message, overshadowed a!! other business in the House today. Tiie body adjourned soon after he delivered his message. Two measures, bearing on the high cost of living, were introduced and were introduced and were irferrr-'! to the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committees. Wishington, Dev. .3. President Wil son wants his original railway legis lation program completed. He also wants a Corrupt Practi.-es Act "with teeth" passed by Congress before March i. The President made this plain to day when he outlined his v;ew- to a jeir.t session of Co"gre.-.;. He did net touch upon preparedness other than to ask that Congress be guided by the reports and rc'.-onr.Yieno.atnms o. the secretaries of War and tr." Ncvy, following out the policies laid Kw. at the last icssion. Mr. Wilson asked that action on the big supply bills be guided by the annual reports of the heads of the executive depart ments, the members of his Cabinet. Following his custom, Mr. Wilson addressed the joint session from fie clerk's desk on the speaker's rostrum in tlSb House chamber. The first three rows of seats were occupied by mem bers of the Senate, the balance of the seats and the pace at the back of the chamber accommodating the members of tho House. Every available inch of space in the galleries was crowded, many having occupied their scats for hour? before the formal opening of the House. Ad mission to the galleries was entirely by card, and thousands were turned away from the doors. Every" seat iu the diplomatic gal lery was filled. In his address, how ever, President Wilson made no ref erence to the country's foreign re lations and did not, even by infer ence, touch upon the Mexican situa tion. He likewise refrained from any comment on the suggestion of an em bargo on foodstuffs. Touching the railroad situation. President Wilson asked speedy action on all but one cf the reconiuienda tions made tot Congress in .August, last, and which have not yet been enacted into law. He declared that, tho Congressional approval asked by him when he last addressed the Con gress, to give authority to the Inter state Commerce Commission to grant an increase in freight rates if it found necessary, is not needed. If the eight-hour basis of work and wages under which the railroads are operating necessitates additional rev enue for the operation of the roads, Mr. Wilson declared, it i "indisput ably cllar" that the Commission has the power to grant the increase in rates. Early action by the Senate on the bill passed by the House authorizing two additional members of the In terstate Commerce Commission, was solemnly urged by President Wilson. He appealed to Congress to act favor rbly and quickly on the pending measure corresponding to the Cana dian Industrial Disputes Act, designed to make unlawful strikes or lockouts before full pubiic investigation has been made of all disputes between em ployers and employes, and on the bill designed to give the President power, in times of "military necessity," to take over the railroads of the country, their rolling stock, and to draft into the military service for operation of the roads such employes and officials as are necessary. In his message, lie said: (Jfii lieiii -a of the Congress: t In fulfilling at lliis time the duty laid iipon me by the Constitution of com municating to yon from time to time information of the state of the Ciiioti and recommending t.' your considera tion snob legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedient I i shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you. of I leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which it seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which von will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there were some tlrngs left undone at the l ist session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public ro do at once. In the tirst place, it seems to me im liative!y necessary that the earliest 7ossible consideration and action should be accorded . the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your las! session in view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated ditlieulties which then existed, and which slid unhappily continue to xisf. between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductor, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended : First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of she interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and how awaiting action by the senate; in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a prompt ness ami t lioreiiL'hni ss which arc. with its presriw constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Sec. ml. tie- establishment of an ight-hot:r day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employees who ar actually engaged in the work of oper ating trains in interstate transporta tion. Third. the authorization of Hie ap pointment by the president of a small body of men o observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of 'lie eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the r.filroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in-, terstafo commerce commision of :.n increase of freight rates io meet such additional oxpendi! ures y tie- rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption i,f the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economics, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, incase tiie methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or loefcotit may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of tne power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may bo required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the Failed States such train crews anil adminis trative officials as the oirctmistatiees require for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted on: it established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work anil wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon tho practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clcnr and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a mutter might seem to draw' i- question the scope of the com-liiLJe::'.- utlrritr or iu iavliujtioa to tio Justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the increase !n the interstate commerce commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its matiif Ul duties, the provision for full public investigation md assessment of industrial disputes, und the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary iu time of war r other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have intruded us with the responsibility md duty cf serving and safeguarding them in such matters would timl it hard. I believe, to excuse a failure to net upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now tind it practi cally Impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed l to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily ami promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of i lie railroads for the con centration of the milititry forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative eilicieney which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regarjl to one of its items, the increase in the effi ciency of the interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say - he congress would hesitate to a-t upon (he suggestion should I make it. that any man in any occupa tion should be obiiged by law to con tinue iu an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to aili.pt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared j to introduce. lint the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall m.t be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any sin h principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted tit stop the in-du-iria! processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi trarily and an justly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of ali concerned as well as for the permanent interests of .society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance awaif tiie action of the senate which have al'-eady been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by sonic io be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly: the bill amending tiie present organic law of Porto Pico; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into hivv. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Fven delay would seriously jeopard the interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg alnte thejespenditure of JUoc.ay.'" -ttons may seem to he less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at iea:?t two years will elapse before another election in which fed oral otlices are to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further Tery se rfous disadvantage of ixistponing ac tion until another election was at hand ami some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand io the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of buildiny up our sipcrt tra'.!v. That ectfrpriss Pole Cat Hides Made Valuable By Dame Fashion One Black Pelt Worth $4, and Skin of Old Brer Pos sum Now Brings $1 Mink Hides Sell for $5. Cape County and Southeast Missouri trappers are reaping a harvest this year, due to milady's demand for furs. The war has paralyzed the importa tion of furs from Europe and the sup ply from Canada has been reduced one half. The United States, therefore, is called upon to supply the demand of its women, and Southeast Missouri is contributing its quota. Barrett Cotner, who has been hav ing furs from the lower counties of .Missouri and the northern tier of Ar kansas for many years, informed The Tribune last night that the urices Were higher than ever before. "The quality of pelts is exceptionally good," said .Mr. Cotner, "especially in view of mild winter. Furs are priced according to grades, just as every other commodity is. "I am paying as high as $4 for a single skunk hiele, but this calls for the best pelt, or what is known as black fur. Mink hides are worth from S4 to $,, if they are good. Possum skins, which a few years ago sold for five and ten cents each, are now worth as much as $1 each. Coon pelts are worth from $2 to $3, the latter price being paid only for what is known as extra dark furs. Muskiat skins bring fifty cents each. "In view of the fact that the fur season is so young, I have bought more hides ami of a better quality than ever before. The warm autumn and early winter would lead one to believe that pelts would be very inferior, but I have found the fur exceptionally heavy. During extremely cold win ters furs are always best, and trap pers, who judge season by the grade of furs, naturally suppose that the coming winter months will be severe." Mr. Cotner said few wildcat and wolf hides were brought to the Cape, although lie buys some each season. These beasts still inhabit certain sec tions of Southeast Missouri. In establishments, where the raw hides are transformed into expensive raiment for maids and matrons, the polecat not only loses its aroma, but it sometimes is labeled otter, beaver or silver fox. The fur is dyed and treated until not even a mamma skunk woul.l recognize the pelt of her son. 01' Br'er Tossum, which in former years was considered only flavor for sweet potatoes and gravy, is now traveling in polite society. A 'possum skin can be dyed and reshaped until it resembles a lynx skin or Alaskan fox. The musk rat is frequently sold for mink, and it is difficult to distinguish between a real and imitation fur. The gradual decrease in the supply of fur is given for the increase in price as well as for the deception practised by fur experts to deceive the ladies. presently, will Immediately assume, has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unpreced"!ited in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution; it is deemed to b douhtflil whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under oar present laws. We should clear awuy all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will srive freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because tne opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Kico is brief aud conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights aud privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extetided privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the ponding measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not uecessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is. gentlemen, prob ably, the last occasion I fhall have to address the Sixy-fourth congress. I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have en-opera t eel with you in the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have 'enriched the legislative annals of th country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upou the compieiiou of a record of rars serviceabltuess aud iitttic'icii. MRS. G. H.

DIVORCED FROM ONE, HE REWEDS THE SAME DAY A. L. Thompson Tells Court His Trouble, Gets Decree, Then Takes Bride. Three hours after he had obtained a divorce from his first wife, A. I.. Thompson of 12 South Spanish street, was married yesterday afternoon to j Mrs. Koxie Hostettcr of the Capo by Justice of the Peace Joseph Putz of Jackson. After the marriage tiie coupie came to the Cape in the automobile of a friend. They were received a I the outskirts of the Cape by a party of . friends, who had been told of the marriage, and the newlyweds were brought to town under the ntclodio i strains of songs, jangling of cow boil. and other tinware that would jvodure a noise. The rev. ly weds were driven t'.ro'!,-,!i the streets under the shouts and har monious songs of their frie-i ls and taken to the homo of the bri!eri -;ii. and then 1o the home of the bride, where thevi enjoyed their wedding din ner. While Thompson was attempting to induce his first wife to return to him. he met his present bride and fell in love with her. Put the fact that ': was married prevented him from woo ing to a finish. Tuesday aftcrnoeri, Thompson called upon Attorney Wil son A. Pain, and told his troubles to the lawyer. "Why, man, you ought to be di vorced," said the lawyer. "That's wlv I came here said the client. Mr. Pain took his pen in hand and soon i ;i the petition drawn up. It was file'! in the Common Pleas Court. Thompson's petition was not con tested by his first wife, w ho waivercd service, and for that reason, the Judge dil not delay his decision. Thompson set forth in his petition that his wife had deserted him shortly after then marriage. He saie e tried to do eve ry thing in his povvvr to induce her to re turn, but words and letters failed, an I he concluded that a separation was necessary. Immediately upon announcement of the verdict. Thompson hurried to the home of his bride and told her that he was ready to make her his wife, and the couple motored off to Jackson. After obtaining the license thiy went to the office of Justice Putz and he "hitched" them.
