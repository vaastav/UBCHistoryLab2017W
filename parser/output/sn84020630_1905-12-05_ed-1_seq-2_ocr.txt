PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The message of President Roose velt, delivered today to the 5!th Con-1 Kress Is u remarkable document, de-1 pictlng in strong and easily under stood language, the conditions of the I country and demonstrating that the' united states is the greatest and freest, country on earth and has, ev erything considered, the best govern ment, so far devised and put into op eration by human minds. The mes sage contains about 30,000 words and is in the President's usual strenuous style and incisive sentences. Nearly one-fourth of it is devoted to a thor ough discussion of the great problems what, he says. There can no po".!.v ble mistaking of his aims and desires It is truly patriotic and Us vMlity and beneficial purposes stand ton li as i iig gedly, as powerfully and as well marked as does Pike's Peak when one sees it ten or fifteen miles ott in the clear atmosphere of the Centennial State. The country and the President rfiy justly be proud of this ndmlnibte message. 

FAIR TREATMENT ACCORDED MR. HAGERMAN. Republican papers in New Mexico are certainly saying nice things of Governor to be Herbert J. Hagerman. The Albuquerque Yellow Journal and a few of its ilk are trying ro damn him with faint praise, and are endeav oring to stir up strife for the future. It is therefore all the more refresh- rnlC!d..WltVhe.ailryfyst?msof erfy and fairly towaris the new an- the country. Careful attention is paid to every other important Question pointee.

Quite a number of the offices are what might be called "pre empted" and in others the people do not take much interest. Even in this Territory the question of officials Is not nearly as momentous as it once was. The voters are very apt to act as they see fit in primaries, in con ventions and in elections. GRIP QUICKLY KNOCKED OUT. "Some weeks ago during the severe winter weather both my wife and my self contracted severe colds which speedily developed Into the worst kind of la grippe with all its miser able symptoms," says Mr. J. S. Egles ton of Maple Landing, Iowa. "Knees and joints aching, muscles, sore, head stopped up, eyes and nose running, with alternate spells of chils and fev er. We began using Chamberlain's Cough Remedy, aiding the same with a dose of Chamberalin's Stomach and Liver Tablets, and by its liberal use soon completely knocked out the grip." These Tablets promote a heal thy action of the bowels, liver and kidneys which is always beneficial when the system is congested by a cold or attack of the grip. For sale by all druggists.
