David S. Mauch attempted to murder his wile at Washington, Ind. Stealing upon her In the night with an ax, he mangled her in a horrible manner and then fled, supposing he had killed her. " She lay for weeks betwixt life and death, but finally r covered, though in a frigid fully disfigured condition. The husband was not louud by the apath tic otlkUls. A few days ago Mrs. Mauch quietly set out to join him somewhere In the Wrst. "Dave was always loud of me," she said, "and I don't believe he really meant to take my lite.

Tlie President's Message.' Mr. Ilayes sent in his annual message to Congress Monday. It is a volumi nous document and would be mighty poor rending if a man had anything else to peruse. lie begins by charging the South with fraudulent practices at the late election in denying voters the right of "freely casting their votes," and goes on with this sort of fol de rol regardless of the fate of Ananias and Sapphira. lie is caretul, however, to make no allusion to the systematic co ercion and bulldozing practiced by his own party in the Northern states. The message recommends the sup pression of polygamy in Utah'and sug. gests the dUfranchisment of all who practice it; it reports favorable rela tions with foreign powers, and referring to the development of foreign com merce suggests "modifications of our regulations of trade and navigation" and subsidies to steamship lines as helps to secure that trade. A summary of the finances is given showing surplus reve nue to the amount of $90,000,000, and the message recommends the applica tion of this amount to the reduction of the public debt. It also urges the com pletion of tho refunding operations and reduction of interest; the retirement of the greenback circulation and the coinage of silver dollars "of equiv alent value as bullion, with gold dol lars." The latter proposition is, of course, in the interest of the National banks. After recommending with some degree of warmth the improvement of the Mississippi river and tributaries, as an imperative result of the success ol the jetties, and touching upon a multi tude of minor matters, the gentleman who is drawing Mr. Tilden's salary brings his last annual message to a close. It is Mr. Garfield's turn next Key. Richard Beard, D.D., one of the most eminent divines of the Cumber land Presbyterian Church,died at Leba non last week at the advanced age of SO years.

Some Crows. Lexington (Kv.) From. A gentleman who resides near the elegant premises of Mr. Inskeep, about six miles north of our city, reports what is probably the most stupendous tiling in the way of a crow roost that has ever been seen sinco Noah's crow went to roost in the olive tree. The roost is in the magnificent woodland of Mr. l.iskcep, and our informant esti mates the number of birds at 150,000, uoo. lie says the lSrgest oak trees have been uprooted, and smaller ones crushed into kindling wood by their weight; that the noise made by them is so great that the people tor three miles around have to stutl" cotton in their ears, and are only enabled to communicate with each oilier through speaking trumpets alter the crows begin to assemble. Cat tie weighing 1,500 pounds have been killed by the birds and their bones picked clean, and the skeletons ot hogs and shuep t hich weighed from 150 to pounds are dangliug from the tree wlieto tlu crows have carried them, and the whole eountry is strewn with bones. as in the prophet s vision ot "the valley ol Jeh s.iphat." Shooting at them is exceedingly dangerous. A gentleman in the employ ol Mr. Inskeep tired two shots into one ol the trees and narrow ly escaped sufl'ocation lrom the tailing birds. A Cute Itascal.
