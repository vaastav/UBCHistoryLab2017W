Friday Maraiag, • • December 5, 1890. The Meeting of Congress. The second session of the fifty-first Con gress began at Washington on Monday. In the Senate the galleries were crowded. After prayer by the chaplain,Casey and Warren, the new Senators from Wyoming, were sworn in and took their seats. The President’s mes sage attracted bat little attention, the Sena tors, probably, having been made aware, in advance, of its contents. No general busi ness was transacted. Tbo House bad a mournful and funereal ap pearance. The defeated Republican con gressmen shook hands silently or at times ex changed condolences, and sighing said, “it might Have been.” The Democrats, from motives of pity, perhaps, forbore from ex pressions of exultation or indulged in them quietly. It was noticeable that while admir ers of many of the Democratic members had adorned their desks with flowers there was a scarcity of floral tributes on the desks of Republicans. Precisely at noon Speaker Reed rapped with bis gavel and the House came to order. What his thoughts were when in his own mind be contrasted the present condition of affairs with what existed a few weeks ago, can only be imagined. He gave no outward sign of his feelings, however. After prayer Mr. Clifton B. Breckenridge, of Arkansas, who was unjustly deprived of bis seat at the previous session, came forward and was sworn in, amid loud clapping of bands. Mr- Breckenridge, it will be remembered, was tamed oat, with no pretext of reason, and the people.of his congressional district tri umphantly re-elected him for the unexpired portion of the old term and for the ensuing term as well. It is evident that the Republican members will adhere if they can to the programme they laid down at the close of the last session, which was to uphold the McKinley tariff and endeavor to push the Force Bill through the Senate. Republican Senators held a caucus, on Monday afternoon, and decided to press the Force Bill. They can only do this by changing the rules of the Senate and intro ducing gag-law similar to that which Speak er Reed enforces in the House. It remains to be seen how far they will be successful. The temper and spirit of the American people are, apparently, entirely misunderstood by the dominant party in Congress, and the ef fort to enact partisan legislation will strength en the feeling against the Republican leaders and ensure the election of a Democratic Pre sident in 1892. In accordance with the dictation of the Republican caucus, on Tuesday Senator Hoar called up his Force Bill, and his de mand was sustained by a strict party vote. It was evident that even those Senators who had expressed their opposition to the iniquit ous measure, have yielded to the party whip and will vote with their colleagues to fasten this measure upon the Southern States. The Democratic Senators, feeling that they are supported by the conservative sentiment of the country, will contest every inch of the ground. On Wednesday Senator Turpie, of Indiana, made a strong speech against the bill. He showed that the law was unjustly aimed at the South alone, and that, although in Penn sylvania, Ohio and Illinois there are about 250,000 colored people, no colored man has ever been elected to any State office. They are not barred by any constitution or statute but by “the law of race and blood.” The supremacy of the white race, he said, was not peculiar to any portion of the United States but is as firmly established iu Illinois and Ohio as in Texas and Arkansas. He added: The kernel and purpose of the pending bill was that the law of the land must be su borned to set enmity between the white man and the black man. The effect on the colored constituency of the South would be most unfortunate. The negroes, stripped of all motive for further self-exertion, would become perpetual pen sioners on the national treasury. Facile and venal representatives would be ready for any assault on the pdblic coffers; taxes would be levied on the labor of the white men and wo men of the North for the support of the negro constituencies, who, abandoning every thought of self-improvement, would idly wait for their annual dole. The South bad bad a period of years rest. It had made great industrial progress and invited North ern capital. This has been the result of the re-establishment of the normal ascendancy of the white race. Should this bill become a law the investor would find in many places in the South not shares, dividends and in come, but chilled furnaces, idle mills and smoking ruins. The President’s Message. On Monday President Harrison transmit ted bis message to Congress. It contains the usual dry facts concerning departmental reports, but the pith of it is in what he says concerning the McKinley tariff and the Force Bill. On these important subjects President Harrison appears to have entirely misinter preted the voice of the people of the United States as expressed in the late election. He clings to the idea that the rise in prices which followed the passage of the McKinley bill were not due to that act of legislation, but to ihe enlargement of the currency by the silver bill. President Harrison also calls upon Con gress to pass the Force Bill. Instead of being warned by the over whelming verdict ot the people against an increase of taxation on the necessaries of life and against federal interference with elec tions, he rushes boldly forward and demands a continuance of the policy which is oppress ing the farming industries and offering favor ed classes an opportunity of enriching them selves at the expense of the mass of the peo ple. He under-estimates altogether the in telligence of the American people when be asserts that they did not understand the Mc- Kinley tariff bill and mistakes their credulity in pleading that the bill sbould have several years’ trial before judgment is pronounced npon it. The people became painfully aware that the conditions of life were made harder by the McKinley bill and by their votes they condemned it along with tho Force Bill and other arbitrary and tyrannical acts of Reed and bis followers. The McKinley tariff was intended to raise prices and give manufactur ers the opportunity of reimbursing them selves for their liberal contributions to the campaign fund, otherwise it would not have been passed. The interests of the farmers and other toiling classes were entirely ignor ed in response to the demands of party exi gency, and it was against these things that the people revolted. The President also advocates subsidies to foreign steamship lines, urging these appro priations as necessary to make reciprocity ef fective. On the last named subject heap peers to be In accord with Secretary Blaine, overlooking the fact, however, that the Pre* aident and Mr. Blaine seem to desire reci procity with South American countries, to which we send comparatively little of our ag. rlcultnrsl products, overlooking countries like England, France and Oermany, which are our farmers’ best markets. If reciprocity would be s good thing for the manufacturers, if applied to South America, would It not be a good thing for farmers to extend the prin ciple to localities where it would benefit them T If we could arrange with England to take more of our wheat, corn and cattle, giving as such articles in exchange ss we need, it would be of vast benefit to our peo ple. A distinction, of coarse, could be made, by which American industries which need fostering care would be protected. The Philadelphia Time In criticizing the message says: The one fact clearly taught by the message is that the President makes the old Bourbons of France comparatively respectable by learn ing nothing and forgetting nothing. The people have declared against the increase of already exacting taxes on the necessaries of life in time of peace; against the oppression of the masses for the benefit of the classes; against the profligacy that has created the first Treasury deficit since the war, and against a Force Election bill that no business man, North or Bomb, Republican or Demo crat, is willing to approve. In the face of a popular revolution entirely unexampled in magnitude, the President demands the con tinuance of taxes which the people have re volted against; demands additional profliga cy by steamship subsidies to speculators at home and abroad when free ships would at once establish our commerce without a dol lar of loss or outlay, and demands that the Force Election bill shall be passed for the special reason, as he states it, of enabling ir responsible Federal officials to certify all elec tion returns for President and Congressmen. —Voting in the Methodist Episcopal churches of the United States on the admis sion of women as delegates to the General Conference closed on Saturday last. The result will not be known for ten days or more. The vote cas't, it is stated, does not exceed ten per cent, of the membership, and this is held by some to be an evidence of the unpopularity of the proposition. The result of the voting, as far as reported, shows Ihst in the conservative Middle States there is a slight majority against women as delegates. In the great West aud in New England, however, the progressive tendency has been followed and majorities have probably been cast in favor of the women. The Philadelphia Methodist thinks that enough of the returns have been received to show that the women have carried the day. —William J.

THE TOWSONTOWN Bel aifl Wife Fence tan, of Baltimore, Carroll and Harford Counties, WILL GUARANTEE YOU The Cheapest. Best and Prettiest Fence Ever Made. We claim the following advantage over all other systems of hedging: We turn our stalks at an angle of 30 degrees, commencing to plash in the centre of fence. — Therefore as they try to grow straight it gives us a backward pressure of 2 lbs. to the stalk, which makes our combination of Hedge and Wire substantial, by which we neither fasten the stalk to the wire or the wire to the slala—one supports the ocher. All this we give you AT THE SMALL PRICE OF SI Per Rod. The farmer prepares his ground and works the plants as he would corn, (or the Company will prepare the ground for 10 ets. per rod extra,) and will keep said hedge trimmed for one cent per rod afterwards, for any number of years. Made Easy. Twenty-five cents per rod at the time of setting plants; 25 cents pet r od the following spring when replanted and side-trimmed, if necessary; 10 cents per rod the next spring, when side trimmed, and 40 cents per rod, the largest payment you hold until your fence is plashed, wired and stock-proof, giving you a fence one year sooner than possibly can be done by stapling. further information address EDWARD RIDER, Presidenf.
