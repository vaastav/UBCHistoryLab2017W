STRENUOUS FINISH. It's a quiet day these times when President Roosevelt does not figure in some new sensation. There is no slacking of the pace as the end of the strenuous executive's administration draws near. Just now the president is sitting back after his latest appear ance In the arena and is waiting for the heads he has hit to bob up again. There is a suspicion lurking, too,, that the president will have a new club ready, when the. heads get .within 10There was• the president's reference'^ to the editors of the New York Sun and Indianapolis News and his scourging of Publisher Pulitzer of the World when he was drawn into the controversy. Pulitzer is back with a spirited rejoinder and meanwhile the senate is preparing to investigate part .of the president's message rela tive to congressional interference with the work of the secret service, and to investigate another part, of the mess age referring to the Brownsville casa. The publishers who have bumpe.l into the big stick and the ant.io-Roose velt members of the senate are declar ing.that the president has violated ev ery precedent in the game, and that even the king of England would have to quit the throne if he went to the Roosevelt limit, but it is plain that the Rooseveltian critics are trying to keep out or range of the big stick when they make their talks. President Roosevelt has organized an Ananian club and has stocked w-ell witi. members. He has been at tacked before, but usually he has had the last word. Most people will wait until they see just what the president has concealed up his sleeve before they venture the opinion that the pres ident will come out second best in any of his latest battles now pending. On past performances he is easily the one best fret" and-his backers will continue to play him as the favorite until a head is found that he can't crack. Jt*.--. A 

RAILROAD MAN'S VIEWS. Melville E. Ingalls. chairman of the hoard of the Big Four railroad, is an advocate of the profit sharing plan between emloyers and employes as a panacea for industrial troubles. Mr. Ingalls is not. prepared to say just "what plan would give the best re sults, but one method he advocates Is for the railroad companies and large corporations to take the cost of the property, then the amount of wages paid, and, after the wages are paid and the interest on the prop erty is paid, to divide the balance among the employes in proportion of the earning power of each as told in manifold. The employe becomes more careful of his own account., strikes are eliminated, while labor agitators are bowled over by the advance in mg of his mild plan of prac-:*!.:« tical socialism. Trade agreements. Mr. Ingalls ad mits are an acknowledgment of the popuiarity of.this, mild plan of pracjnavlgatio„( rights and obligations of the workers, but',, he eaya, capital owes its labor mor(e than 'a mere bow. The profit sharing plan, he believes, is a warm, friendly outstretched hand and is going..to supplant the trade agree ment.. "Make .every man your partner," he concludes, and then there,is the perfect relation we should have between employer and employe. POPULARIZING PSYC O LO GY. Thus far the study of psychology has-been confined largely to the high ^.brows. Most of us have heard somo 'i ^hing about' it just as we have heard Kof archaelogy and several oth flogies. without being moved out of jie "what's'the use" frame of mind. [Ow, however, Professor Hugo Muen jterberg, the Harvard psychologist, JKas made the matter a little clearer. He says, for instance, that applied psychology could determine who would play a good game of poker. The pro fessor did not elucidate, as he evident ly.did not feel the need of fessing up the extent of his knowledge of the ime. He rather implied, though, that psychologist., sitting in a game, ould know when innocently sizing up jiis flush whether his opponent's con fident expression indicated that he had a full to beat or just a measly I Btraight, or a punk set of threes. If the professor just goes a little further In his efforts to popularise psychology, he will make it the popu lar fireside study. If a little delving into the pschyics would put Mary wise to the fact that John is about to pop the question, she would have time to prepare herself for the proper look of surprise, and she would know just •when the psychological moment arriv ed to give Brother Johnny a dime and get him out of the room. Right at Christmas time, too, Grace would find Ig&| It handy if she could give Mabel the IjjJfl psychic size up and learn that Mabel only intended to give her a box of I W& ior Christmas. Grace could then give that hand painted dish to Clare and let Mabel down with a hand kerchief. 'J There is no end to the alluring av •'tiues of pleasure and profit opened up to traffic for the travelers in psychic land, but the professor must first make shall lie no more.' it plainer just how every be his own psychologist. FARM LOSS ENORMOUS. Ihe farmers of the I'nited States lose eacli year in soil washed from their land enough to pay the entire expenses of the national government at Washington, declared Congress man J. I. Atkins of Louisiana in an address before the Congressional Red River Improvement association at Deu ison, lexas. Mr. W atkius made a stroug plea for forest preser vation and waterway improvement and advanced some start ling figures regarding the rate at which the national resources are being exhausted. Iiom the soil which is washed from tlio land and the caving of the river banks one billion tons of silt accumulate in our river beds annually," he said. '"This soil is the most tertile part of the land and it is worse than wasted. It is not onh lost lot all practical purposes, but forms an impediment ot navigation in making sand-bars, catching logs and filling up the channel of the stream often causing it to go entirely dry. ""While millions of dollars' worth of levees have caved and waslied into the livei, this does not constitute the main expense ot this soil wash. It is usually the virgin soil which first washes into the streams. This virgin soil usually produces more abundantlv than commercial fertilizers. If commercial fertilizers are worth .$20.00 per ton and we should estimate this soil which is washed off of the land at the same value, we see that there is lost twenty billion dollars every year. If the value should be divided by twenty the loss would still I* one billion eminent, including the executive, the eial departments. Paf tho entire expenses of our national «ov- When a man puts a tun ol commercial fertilizer on apiece oi land and it is washed away by a single freshet, he realizes Ins loss and begins measures to ciivunivent a recurrence. But wnen the surface of his soil is Iwing gradual Iv destroyed by erosion, he neither plants shrubs or terraces his 'land to prevent it There has been a time when he could mow his new ground from field to field simply by clearing- it, hut that time lias passed, ft becomes necessary for each land owner to conserve every possible way all the land which he owns. One ot the great pioblems before the .American people today is the 'Conservation of Our National Resources.' In solving thes-.' problems the quesfioii of reservoirs at the head waters ot our streams will play an important part. When these reservoirs are constructed the ativam flow will be so regu lated as to enable the marsh lauds to be the in or*' readily drain ed. That these lands will eventually lie reclaimed there can be 110 doubt, as it is eviJmt that our population will increase to two hundred millioj within fifty years and enterprise of all Kaids, having for their object' i.he development of our natural wso-ivees, will be inaugurated and tin?** lands, when redeemed will dd millions of wealth to ouv naf r.ra! resources. I he water courses of this i-o mtu are capable of produc mg energy sufficient to generate thirty, million horse, power of electrical force. This force can distributed over the entire area of this country. When our amber is exhausted for the purposes of fuel and cur coal we mu-t look to our streams to supply our motive power in the form of electricity with which to propel our engin and furnish light and heat, and while our forests are being renewed we must look to our vanishing supply of iron to perform manv of those function* now performed'by wood. iHs cvident Xo individual, no local or stite ^'ovormnftnt can utilize P™"' to the detriment of navigation: The national government, will not improVc them except for pur poses of navigation, and as the growing of .forests, the build ing of levees, drainage and revetment* will tend to imr levees, drainage and revetments will ernment to protect our streams from destruction. As an inci dent to this protection, locks and dams are necessarv, and Hi rough them' the electrical power will be generated^ 'which generations now unborn will enjoy when the oil, gas and coal body is to The Illinois supreme court has up held the legislative act which "indem nifies the owners of property for dam ages occasioned by mobs and riots," and this decision may prove costly to the city of Springfield, the scene of the race riots of several months ago. Following the riots, damage suits ag gregating $100,000 were filed against the city by property owners who sus tained loss through the work of the mobs. Th° supreme court decision will doubtless be made much of by plaintiffs in these cases as going to prove the city's liability. Springfield's debauch is likely to have a gloomy morning after. Prob ably there were few property owners in the riots that resulted in lynch ings, arson and bloodshed, but if damages are proved against the city by the residents whose properties were wrecked, all ihe property owners will be taxed their share of the sum necet-sary to make good the property losses.- Dr. C. W. Losh, the Des Moines health physician, says the towels used by the school children are reeking with disease germs. He advocates in dividual towels for the pupils in the public schools. Wonder if the doc tor's professional vocabulary would be adequate if he encountered the aver age print shop towel. 11 was not to be expected that the newspaper paragraphers could over look the capture of that Venezuelan guard boat, "23 de Mayo" by the Dutch cruise re. Even the head writers could not resist it. A glance at the ex changes shows that the popular head for the story was: THE 23 DE

Adver tiser. —"It is reported that one of Harvey's Tastidious newly married ladies kneads bread with her gloves one. The incident may be somewhat peculiar, but there are others. The editor of this paper needs bread with his shoes on: he needs bread with his shirt 011 he needs bread with his pants 011, and unless some of the de linquent subscribers of this 'Rag of Freedom' ^ay up before long, he will need bread without a dam thing on, and North Dakota is no Garden of Eden in the winter time either."
