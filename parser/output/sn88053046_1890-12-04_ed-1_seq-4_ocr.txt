! GAZETTE AND JOURNAL PUBLISHED EVERY THURSDAY t N. E. COR. FIFTH AND SHIPLEY STS. EVERY EVENING PRINTING COMPANY PRICE $i PER YEAR IN ADVANCE WIL M I SO TON, TU f l RS D A Y, A Force Bill Message. The Chicago Tri bune ^perhaps the most influentialRepublican organ of the north west, in a recent reference to " Casabl anca," (the name is suggestive of the White House) wanted to know if that in tractable boy was going to be foolhardy enough to insist on standing " on the burning deck?" It was rough on the President and other headstrong Repub licans, but the message of yesterday and the Senate caucus of last night show that it was deserved. We cannot think of anything to fit their case better than the old Latin aphorism: "QuosDcus vult perdere prius démontât." If an in ability to comprehend that to push force bill legislation is to sign the death war rant of the Republican party be not conclusive proof of political ihsan ity, then there tion at the polls in November. These are not the days of reconstruction j and the southern states are no longer in the status of quasi conquered provinces. 1 Neither can a desperate party, repudi ated at the polls, hope to climb back into power through force and fraud; through military elections and partisan returning boards. By a change of 650,000 votes the American people have just given notice that they will not sub mit to placing the control of federal elections in the hands of such corrup tionists as Quay and Foster and Dudley; that they will not hack up higher taxa tion for the benefit of fat-fryers; that they condemn the distribution of offices as spoils; that they are not in love with the extravagance which has converted a surplus into a deficiency; that they do not mean to permit a party to entrench itself in power by stolen seats and by changing sparsely settled territories into states. "This is a country where the will of the people is the law of the land," said President Grant. Are President Harrison and the would-be bosses of the Senate mad enough to im agine that they can thwart that will ? Wild as it is, that is the impression the President's message and the caucus seem to convey. A cartoon in the Balti more Herald represents the President in the act of writing his "message boiled down" and what he has put on the paper before him runs as follows : The force bill should be passed without delay. We are in a hole und fhut's the only way to pull out of it. Y bet your last dollar I'm right, on that proposition. Push the force bill through and then if I'm lucky enough to get another nomination I'll capture at half of the southern states. There few other subi and the like « to in this révolu - can just such as foreign allai rs I will incidentally refer ssage but really the force bill is the milk in our cocoanut. mich The President wears "grandpa's hat" in the cartoon, but, as the Herald re marks, "it doesn't cover grandpa's brains." The elder Harrison would have known when to take 111 sail. One of the hoodie aldermen of New York, after the inadequacy of the law or the evidence, or both, had enabled him to return from his Canadian exile, had the unblushing impudence to at tempt to Institute suit for the recovery of his share of the boodle. The Presi dent's argument in palliation of the hill iß very much in He pleads that it largement of fed the same is merely eral election laws that have been existence f. nearly 20 years— the laws which provide for the appoint ment of deputy marshals, supervisors %nd the like. But "the present law-," ie urges, "stops just short of effective teas, for it surrenders to the local horities all control the ccrtifica *ion which establishes a prima facie right to a seat in the House sentatives." That is to say, that oven with deputy marshals and supervisors at the polls, the local election lu still permitted to designate the candi dates for Congress who have received a f Rcpre majority of votes, lican party lease of power until this has been rem edied ami the election of members of Congress from Democratic states made dependent upon the certification of Republican returning hoards. And, since laws enacted in the reconstruction days of 20 years ago still stand statute books, laws which have 1 that the, Repub long !Vt*r he s ,il1 ' ! 'V'T j b. applied save by Republi. !

The New* York Tribune admits that it at is *'the last election has brought out into broad daylight a tendency toward class legislation, toward government for the benefit of which "there is part and not of the whole" room for doubt that the people resent and will surely re buke." Having gone thus far in the di rection of grasping the meaning of the political revolution, the Tribune , koop eye open and the other closed, adds: "Whoever brings an open mind to the reading of the returns can that multitudes resented what they deemed excessive grants of pensions. Even the mistaken hostility toward the tariff was proof of a conscientious opposition to provisions which were rep resented as burdens ing to the many and conferring unreasonable favors on a special class." Just here it appears that the Tribune's other eye had struggled half open for a moment, hut with the next sentence it closes again, as follows : "When experience and better informa tion shall have taught the people that this great measure is for the benefit of all and burdensome to none» their ver dict need not he feared." Just so. When the skies fall we may all catch larks. And then the Tribune proceeds to warn the Farmers' Alliance against blunder in reading this warning it is difficult to avoid feed ing that the dosed class legislation. e is reopening again and that the Tribune is admonish ing its party hy proxy.

Now President Ilarrison has spoken again apd has supplemented his prior promises to respect the merit system in the minor offices by the declaration in his annual message: "The law' relating to the civil service has, learn, been executed by those having the power of appointment in flic classified service with fidelity and impartiality." Is the president juggling with words or does he really know as little about the real working of the spoils system in his party as he seems to know about the popular condemna of Force hill legislation? And it be that the truly good Postmaster General has been so absorbed in his Sunday school labors of wluit is going offices of the land ? that the sweep here is to be a clci and that not a man holding Demo cratic sentiments is to he left in the post office building. Would it not l»ê in order for President Harrison to "lift up (another) hearty prayer" in recognition of the prevalence of "that other frank and bold, if brutal, method of turning and women out simply for political opinions?" Of course the superseding of experienced letter carriers by green men, besides being a violation of the spirit at least of the law, works for the time being, if not longer, injury to the public servi ist rat h letter writing women as it has recently •mber shopping women, lie sides it is a had example to sot coming Democratic administration.
