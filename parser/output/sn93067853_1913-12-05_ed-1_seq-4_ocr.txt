FRIDAY, DECEI ELECTION BY PRIMARIES President Wilson further urpes in his messape the nomination of presiflpntinl nonrli/lnlAr. :? 1 * vuuuiuoics uy primaries, DUl would retain conventions for the purpose of framing platforms. He expresses the view that there is a wide tendency towards the direct vote. In this he is certainly correct. The age of true democracy is at hand. In the next few years this will be seen by the blind politicians as it is now seen hy the seers of the nation. 

PRESIDENT WILSON WOULD HELP THE FARMER President Wilson in his recent message to Congress, urges measure of currency reform that will prove of lasting benefit to the farmers of the country. He urges that special provision be made for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers. He sees in the currency bill, now before Congress, a measure which puts the farmer upon an equal footing with other business men.

WILSON'S PHILIPPINE POLICY President Wilson's Philippine policy is in line with his other utterances going to emphasize the principles of democracy. He would lead the people of the Philippines upward to self government. He urges that they be given more and more control of their affairs and ultimately that they be given complete self government. This also is democracy. Then too. this policy will not keep us in constant turmoil with the other nations. The land-grabbing policy is the policy that leads to wars and rumors of wars. Our country is so great in area that we have no need of adding new territory. Development of our vast resources, not new conquests, should be our aim. \ 

NATIONAL HONOR AND OBLIGATIONS President Wilson in his first annual message, says: "There is only I one possible standard by which to de termine controversies between the A United States and other nations, and V that is compounded of these two eleI ments?our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world." This utterance is the utterance of a statesman far removed from the plane of the demagogue. It is just this high idealism in President Wilson that is so confounding to his enemies and harsh critics. The general lack of sincerity and the presence of no little hypocritical cant are too often the chief elements in the utterances of our public leaders. The straightforward utterances of President Wilson are so astounding that they utterly disarm the carping critics, and carry conviction to the hearts of the people. Honesty, not falsehood, is and will always he the foundation upon which a nation can build permanently. I > N
