Til E ANTI-S LAVE11Y BUGLE. 'flr.9 slavery lo its prcioot limits. Enough of tor titory is now open to slavery, to preserve U two tiundred Tears. Twentv generations of slavef. allowing ten years to goneratiu'n, will thus havej to live and die in bondage. This cannot he glnd tidings of salvation. It is cold comfort to the young man nod woman of to day, to be told that in two hundred years bis race shall bo free. Tho Republican party propose to preserve tho compro mises of the constitutionhave they considered the nature of these compromises? It is ono thing to compromise our own interacts for tho tuko ol the Union, and quite another, to sacrifice tho rights of the black man for '.he benefit of tho Uni m to ourselves. Yet northern men boast of their ac commodating spirit in this matter. All the South ever meant hv Union, is her rieht to crush nod hold the negro in bondngo to make use of the North as her body guard her blood hound and to hold our territory free to plunder. Tho gloiious Union has been cemented with the blood and brains 'of the slave. Its formation at first was cruel, nnd violent, againut right. Its founders excused them selves, because of tho allogcd necessity of tho ... . rinrnnfiA mrainst foreicn foes. No uumunui ' i - . i m. r urn n no dnntrcr mm' 'foreign nations, on the contrary they have much to fear from us, from the spread of our coirupt morals. Abraham Linooln was elected by two 'millions of male white citizens. Count them by 'souls and how many men voted for him? It takes 'gomethinff to ma'ke a man. Ono must have a soul Wore ha can claim an immortal Foul. Most dido 'do not Vot, they are vctcd. Though the Repub licans have elected their President, they bavo to sneak off the fugitive to Victoria's dominions and ask her to expand her crinolino to protect him from the bloody beak and talons of tho American ' Eagle. The Republicans as men, are unwilling lo hear 'of tho compromises of the roturn of the fu gitive of the suppression of insurrection for lib erty. They accuse us of injustice when wo judge them by their,party platform. They honor Juhn . Brown. Let them como out honestly and tell the elaveholder that he has no rights which they are bound to respect tell the South that if another Nat Turner a black Kossuth, should arise, they . will render him aid in the spirit of LnFayette and of John Brown ; that if the slaveholder comes iier after his fugitive, they will welcorao him to a 'hospitable grave. Abraham Lincoln eays the fu gitive must be returned; the Republicans say he ehall not be roturnod: Let them provo their faith by their 'works', and we will. believe. Divided from Slavery we shall stand, being free from the most dangerous element to freo institu 'tions. Every nation which has planted it has found it the viper which has poisoned its life blood. The Anti-Slavery Society has 1 jng labored to prove this, and tbo voico of the ages concur in its testimony. "But who hath believed rur re port?" We are weak in numbers, but weighed, ' with -justice in the scale, we are mightily stronger 'than party, than church, than state. Who shall 'take our census ? "One shall chaso a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight," Tho old 'castles stood for ages, but tho Httlo ivy planted by God's hand ovcroame their strongth. "The Lord was in tho still small voice." The Resolutions wore carried without dionon - voico. 'ting

CONVENTION IN BOSTON. On last Monday, the third of December tho Sunday previous being tho anniversary of John Brown's execution a Convention was called to moot in Boston to examine the all important ques tion: ,-IIow can American Slavery bo abolished? No filter place and no fitter time could have been eeleoted for such a gathering. There roll the Waves of Boston harbor into which on outraged people rebelliously emptied the British tea chests, which, for the time, represented British taxation and oppression. There stands the Cradle of Lib erty old Faneui! Hall whose name will outlast the granite pile whioh marks the spot where War ron and his companions successfully defied the .power of the British troops. There too, linger yot tho remembrance and the influence of the testimo nies borne to the cause of freedom by the Hun. occks, the Otiscs, and the Adams, the latohets of whose ehoes the citizens of Buson are to-day un worthy to unloose "How can American Slavery bo abolished?" John Brown discussed that question at Harper's Perry in hi own peculiar way, albeit the discus sion was conducted in precisely tho same manner that the patriots of other days discussed at Lex ington, and Concord, and Bunker Hill, and iu the streets of Boston a question of similar import: How can British Oppression be abolished? It may bs that John Brown and the fathers were mistaken, tut they certaiuly were sincere; and it was no wonder that such men as he and they living out thoir own convictions of right, and attesting thoir faith by their life's blood, should be put down iu the category with fools, and rebels, and traitors. " We apprehend that a solution of the great pri mary difficulty heretofore found, and hereafter to be experienced in the abolition of American slave ry, may be extracted from the fumiliar proverb' " Where there ii a will, there is a wat," for it ii a lamentable fact that the American people have not now, and nover had, the will to abolish slavery, else the way would have been found, and the deed done. Having an unregenerated public opinion to deal with, the way by which tho hand ful! of workers can abolish slavery is to so change1 publio sentiment that from cities and villages.from cross roads and by-ways, from prairies and forests, I (here shall oome a Toioe domandiug that this crime shall cease; the voico of the people echoing tho : voice ef God. And to effect such a chango is ojore work of time. Tho crimo of American slavery h so outrageoup, tho insults it offers to God and tlio wrong" it in flieti upon man nro so terrible, it is tin wi.r.d -r that every heart that beats for truth nnd ri,ht N impatient fur lis overthrow, and count cuch line inuct of its continuance as a year, luch year as an ago. But when it is remembered thut the sys- is eutrenchoti bohind two hundred years of popular usuago nud legislative enactments, and that it has tho sanction of tho Church and the support of tho Stato, it is no cause for surprisa that, tho comparatively recent efforts of a moro handfull of opposors have not been sufficient to beat down the mighty forco with which they have to contend. A convulsion in tho government, an insurroc'.ion among tho bondmen, might causo the brcuking of fetters, but would only be a partial success, for ii the Bluvoholdora woro left unchanged in principle, thoir tyrauny and oppression would be come manifest in another form as soon as opportu nity presented. It is tliereforo a re-formation of public sentiment which is Deeded, nnd tho spcedi cut way of accomplishing this is tho constant pre Isentalion of Anti-Slavery truth, and the consistent 1.. . . , fi , lives nt ilioso w no truly lovo irceaom. mere is an abundance of Anti-Slavery sentiment in the land, but little, very li'tlo Anti-Shivery principle. The first, ejmpathizod with John Brown in his gallant strugjj'o against tho opprctsors in the South, and was even moved to tears by thoughts of tho hero iu his prison cell, and of his fato u j on the gallows; but has now forgotten what manner ot man lie wos. The other honors him to-day as it honored him then, for his devotion to tho causo of man, for his fui'.hful and ready obedieneo to God's re quirements as read in tho light of his own convic tions of duly. That fluid sentiment, which is so easily moved to and fro, must to chrystalizcd into liriu and iinperiihablo Principle; and ono of the means of doing this, is for tlioeo who truly hate slavery to so livo that every ono may read thai haired in thoir actions. And so long ns each re tails his own view s as to what constitute! ihc most christian nnd most effective means to wage an ag gressive warfare ngiinst slavery, actions will pro bably diflir; but each one's convictions of ri-)it should bo his 'own guide, uud after having e'eans ed his skirts of Blavcry, wo would say to each and all, act out your own conscientious views of duly, uso that weapon and employ those means that jou believe you can rightfully aud most tfl'eulivoly use. . ! THE BATTLE OF LEXINGTON. Bancroft, in his history of the United States, mentions tho fact that of the seven men killed at the battle of Lexington, ono was a John Bkuw.n, who, it seemed in 1775 dared to tuko his stand with those, who foolishly and fatally to themselves opposed tho power of tho Biitbu government. Tho report of tho old muckct which a Joha Brown fired on the plains of Lexington in '75 was heaid throughout the land, os was the crack of tho rifle of nnothor John Brown at Harper's Forry in '5'J. Bancroft says : "So fell Isaac Muzzy, and so died the aged Rob ert Monroe, the saina who iu 1703 had been ensign at Louisburg. Jouathau Harrington, Jr., was struck in front of his house on tho north of the Common. His wife was at the rvindow when he fell. With the blood gushing from his breast he rose iu her sight, tottered, foil ogain, then crawled on his hands and knees towards his dwelling ; the ran to meet him, but only reached him us he ex pired on tho thrcshhold, Calob Harrington, who had gono into the meeting house for powder, was shot as ho came but. Samuel Hadlcy aud John Brown were pursued and killed alter they bad lett tho green. Ashael Porter, of Woburn, who hud been takeu prisoner by the march, endeavoring to escape, was shot within a few rods ot tho Com mon. " ".Seven of tho men of Lexington were killei' uiuo wou nded-a quarter part of those who stood in ur:ns on tho green, Thoy aro tho villago heroes who were more than of noblo bluod, proving by their spirit that they wero of race divine. They gavo their lives in testimony to tho rights of man kind, bequeathing to their country an assurance of success in the mighty struggle w hich they had bo gun. Their names are held in grateful rcniem. Drunce, ana the expanding miilious ot 11,01.- coun trymen rcnow und multiply their praise from gen eratiou to generation. llicy lullulud their duty not from accidental impulse of tho moment ; their action was tho slowly ripened fruits of Providence and of timo." Can it be true ? A telegraphic despatch, dated Lebanon, Ky., Dec. 1st, states that fifteen negroes aud one whito man, their leader, had been hung by the citizeus of Burkvillc lor attempted insur rection. If tho above is truo, tho proceedings of tho mob must hao beou vjry summary, for the announcement of the punishment precedes the information of the crime. If not al ogether a boux, it is probably greatly exagerated. j MOB LAW IN BOSTON. The telegraph gives information that tho Con vention which assembled in Boslou on tho 3rd inst, was taken possession of by a party vf Union ists, who, with a single eye to tho glory of God und tho perpetuity of tho Republic, trampled un der foot tho rights of Northern men. lo is doubt ful how Boston papers will characterise this act, but out here, we should call it tho triumph of mob law. CRITICISE BOTH PARTIES AND SECTS. Presbyterian Church. The Phe'ident's Message was not roceivod in time to permit our making any extracts. There somo passages wo shall put upon record next week, G. B. Stebbins in his remarks iu the Michigau Convention, said, "Anti-slavery speakers triiicisu the platforms of the political parties, why nut criticise the creeds of tho church?" We should do it, so far as slavery is concerned, but ou an anti-slavery plutform no further. We criticise tho pro-slavery positions of tho Democratic und Re publican parties, but we du not criticise their viows of Tariffs, Bunks, Internal Improvements or Homestead exemption. They may be intensely for or agaiust any or all of theso, but if they be anti-slavery, we must travel out of our path if we attacK t&cm, ao with sects. It they show a clean anti-slavery record, it is not for abolitionists to enquire whethoi tbey are hetrodox or orthodox believers in universal talvation or infant damna tion. If they are pro-slavery, wo should oriiiciso that feature in thoir position; but so long as thore are found faithful abolitionists of all theological opinions, it would seem hardly necessary either to assert that John Brown was not anti-slavory because he was orthodox, or that Parker Pillsbury is not true to tho cause of the oppressed because his theology would not pass as genuine in the u .in this number, tind something to suy nbout tlic prospectuses of same of out oxchanges, f.nd ro tom ferrod to "niauy oilier things too numerous lo mention," all of which wo must lcavo for the Crowded Oct.

ANOTHER BEREAVEMENT. Died, November 27th, 1S-C0, at the residence of her father John M. llolmoB, Mastersvillc, Har rison Co. Ohio, of I'iptheria, Sakau E. Holmes, aged Seventeen ycais ami Five nionlhs. This is the third daughter that within a few months our friend has been called upon to part with, and the fourth, and only remaining ono was lving tick when Saiiih wos buried. Abl y Foster recently Visited Hairison C . on her anti-slavery mission, nud it would seem had deepened tho interest of Sarah iu the cause of the captive, and created in her heart a desire to do more for his redemption than sho had before done. When, for her, Time was about to close and Eieruity open, when sorrowing relatives were standing by her dying bed, she spoke of many of her friends, and especially named Mrs. Foster, and said that when she saw how much that friend freedom was doing, and learned of tho sacrifices she had mado nud was continually making, she w ished that she, herself, could do something for tho cause, and referred to tho gift of his life that John Brown had freely mndo, laying it down for the oppressed slave. Possessing in her own right a buiall humus! ;n Lcr grauuratliei'o estate amounting to about $100 her last request was, that it should be given to the Anti-Slavery Society. Her father assured her that her wish should bo complied with provided her surviving brother, who would be tho legal heir, made no objection. After her decease, her brother, together with all the rest of tho family,- expressed a strong desire that Sarah's wish should bo carried out. When tho legacy is received, it would bo well lo appropriate it iu such a maimer as to make the dying tcstirtinny of ohr young friend dccoinpli.h all, and cvcti more than she hoped. Wo pl.icj the j6'"1''10 fact of llur i"t pon record, f;eliig strong assurance that that record will, of itself, be blest to the cause i f human freedom. From the Logan County Gazette. WHAT WILL LINCOLN DO! Mr. Lincoln is in the unpleasant prc'iicaaicnt of the man in the fable, who had two wives, ono ol whom plucked the black, ar.d the other tho white hairs from his head. GiJdings pills out every white huir he can discern; while Mr. Curwin and Ewing are quite as dili-cnt in plucking out the black ones. Whether tho party by which Mr. Lincoln was elected shall bocomo a white Republican or re main a 31uck Republican organization, depends wholly upon tho dilior.eo and adroituess of the respeotivo hair-pullers. We iaolino to tho belief that Ewing, Curwin, and thut class ol men will give tone to tho admin istration, provided we shall have another adminis trator; aud thut Giddings and his traitorous con federates will bo excommunicated from tho politi cal church, aud couoigticj to tho eternal uumna- tion of publio scorn und detestation. Such is to bo tho political future, if tho late speech of Seuator Trumbull, of Illinois, delivered in Sprioglield, within hearing of Mr. Liuoolo, is not wholly dostitute of significance. It is patriot ic in tono, national in promise und profession, and wholly free from the dirty and trousonablo cant which has hitherto marked tho stump spcechos of tho Republican party. It contains uo denuncia tion of tho Fugitive Law, nor of tho Dred Scott dechion; no lying complaint of southern agress ion, nor despicable caut about the southern slave oligarchy; no encouragement of nullification, judi cial or legislative; but is just such a 6peoch as Senator Douglas might have made, and avows Mr. Lincoln's purposes to bo, just such as Mr. Doug las' might havo becu. If Rcuublicaus had talked hitherto in this spirit, and conformed their acts to such talk, thore would be nunc of tho troubles which so vex and porplex tho people now. Has this speech any real tigniUcauce ? We in cline to believe it bus, and that it was inspired by Mr. Lincoln himself. So think the Whito Repub lican press, so far as wo kuow, wbilti tho Rluok Republican press denounocs Trumbull as an im pertinent meddlesome fsllow, who has epukeu without authority, and of things whereof he is iguorant. lus Negro Suffrage ote.
