We have received the President's Message, but do not propose to tax the patience of our renders with an invitation to read it. Grant's short, oracular sayings h a v e become somewhat proverbial for stupidity. If we imagine them lengthened out into a half dozen newspaper col umns, with an increase of stupidity at every step, a very good idea of the message can be formed. Wheth er Mr. Grant himself wrote it, or whether its incubation is due to the brain of the "venerable sar dine who presides over the State department,' as Don Piatt would say, is a question of very little mo ment, because the people have al ready learned that it is a very dif ficult matter to decide whether Grant or his premier is entitled to the palm for stupidity. ' The Message is taken up with a rehearsal of liadical platitudes on subjects that have long since beern exploded, and Radical promises that will never b; fulfilled. It is1 the weakest document that ever emanated from the Executive de partment. No wonder that, as the telegraph says, it produced no im pression in either this country or in Europe. ' Weather, the past week, has va ried somewhat from its lbng beautiful path. We have experienced about 48 hours real mean and ugly weather, with rain and wind. But since this bad spell all is righted again, and we now enjoy another course of lovely weather. The river is still low and falling, nav igation at the mouth still bad, shutting out our fine Packets. Cotton, sugar and molasses have poured into Town and Pineville. Every Warehouse is crowded, at least, while we write. The Lulu D., specially chartered by Captains Ilaberle and Hienn, came up Sunday night, put out her up freight here and loaded entirely here. This was very considerate and a great relief to shippers. The Rapides, going down this evening, will make a clean sweep of the balance.
