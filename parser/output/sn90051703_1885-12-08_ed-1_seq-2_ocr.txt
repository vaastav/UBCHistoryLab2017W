TUESDAY. DECEMBER 8. Wonder if John Sherman, being tlie second ofliccr in the government, will have any influence with this ad ministration. Col. Breeken and John II.Knaehcl wi re announced to argue tho capital tax case at Socorro, yesterday. Guess there was some mistake. Thkke does rot seem to be sub stantial grounds to believe that there is any serious differences between Governor Hoss and Colonel Thornton, or that the latter w ill make any effort to oppose the confirmation of the former. What docs Kistler know about dull and insipid columns. Is he, whose ideas never rise above a stereotyped local expression, a competent judge He and Wilcox wore hats of the same number and Wilcox's hut was stolen in Denver by a small headed boy be cause it fit him. The president's message, which will be sent to the sena'e today will huye about 20,MKJ words', about twice as long ns the usual presidential messages. It being the first greeting of a democratic president for a quai ter of a century, it is necessary to make it cover much ground, and supply the place of aboui six short messages. Governor Hoar's bill for the pres idential succession is subject to thp least objection of any proposed. It pro vides that after the vice-president the cabinet oflicers shall each in turn he eligible, commencing with the secre tary of state. This, will keep the succession within the party which triumphs at the election and guards against the motive for assassination. If the senate passes this bill the house can liard'y refuse to endorse it this session. The report of Governor I'oss to the necretary of the interior was received at this office yesterday. Some inter esting parts of his report will be found in the extracts from the report of the secretary of the interior in this issue. The governor very judiciously rec ommends the appointment of a com mission similar to tLat of California for the settlement of our land grant questions. Such a commission or court, established with special powers for that purpose, has become an ab Bolute necessity to the further growth and prosperity of the territory. Con gressional legislation reaches no final settlement, and nothing but such a commission will avail anything. No plan is without objections but that plan has the fewest. Colonel Ta vlou, secretary of the International Kange Cattle and lloiegrowers' association has issued ft call for a meeting ol rangemen from the states of Cohuila, Chihuahua, Durango an J Sonora, Mexico; the state of Texas, that portion of Kan sas and Nebraska lyin? west of tho one hundreth meridian; Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, California, and the territories of Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, the Indian Territory, and the northwest territory of British Columbia to meet in Den ver January 27, 18. The basis of representation will be one delegate for every 50,000 head of cattle repre sented in each . association. All stockmen, however, will be wel comed and their ideas will receive consideration. The call concludes: "This meeting is big with hope for the future good of the range industry and should be attcnJed by every cat tle and horse raiser of the region re ferred to." The Lone Star, Newman's paper, reasons thualy on the sta tus of the district tittorneyship contests: "Judge- l&rinker, it is thought, will, if the McComas case is brought before him, decide as Judge Henderson did, and it is also thought that the supreme court will reverse both Henderson and Brinker. This would not be so strange a thing as at first thought it might seem to be. The lower courts are governed by precedents, and if they think in these cases that tho decision of the terri torial supreme court in the case of Fiske is applicable, they will be guided by it in their capacity as dis trict judges, and then when they come to decide upon tho appeal as members of tho supreme court, they can very properly reverse the old de cision and establish a new precedent if they think the former one wrong, Jt begins to look very much as though that will I e about the way the thing will paji out antl that Governor Rw will bt sustained after all. Mb. Gf.orí.e J. Visttv, the well known manager of the Soott'ush Mort gage and Loan Company of New Mexico, u over iron Las Vegas today.
