There was little or no excitement attending tno opening of the 51st congress on the senate side. Public curiosity seemed largely transferred to the house. Interest on the lloor was largely devoted to senators from the new states. They had seats assigned to them a the Republican side. Senator Casey, of North Dakota, took his seat on the end of the second row, against the north wall. Directly behind him sat the Washington senators, Allen and Squire, while I'etti- grew and Moody, ol bourn Dakota, were in the fourth row near the center of the room. Senator Pierce, of North Dakota, has the end seat in the fourth row. On the democratic side are two seats, so far unassigned. They will be occupied by the senators from Montana when they have been chosen. .. At noon yesterday Vice President Mor ton entered the senate chamber. The chaplain opened the proceedings with prayer. The oath of oflice was administered by the vice president to Senators Chandler, of New Hampshire, ana Nathan F. Dixon, of Rhode Island. The credentials of Moody and Petti grew, of South Dakota, and Allen and Squire, of Washington, were presented. Senator Piatt moved that the oath of office be administered. The motion was agreed to, and the four new senators, each escorted by a senator, proceeded to the clerk's desk and, amid cheers from the gallery, took the oath of office. Senator Edmunds and Harris were ap pointed a committee to join a like com mittee from the house to inform the pres ident that congress 'vas ready to re ceive any communication he may choose to make. A resolution providing lor the con tinuance of the select committee on transportation and salo of meat produc ers was agreed to. Senator Aldrich offered, a resolution (laid over) lor tne appointment ot a select committee of nine senators, to be the quadro-centennial committee to which shall be referred all matters connected with the proposed celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Adjourned. IN TUB 

HOUSK. At noon Clerk Clark called the house to order. The roll call showed the presence of 327 members, the three absentees being O' Neal, of Indiana ; Randall, of Pennsyl vania, and Whitborne, of Tennessee. Reed was placed in nomination for speaker by Henderson, of Illinois. The mention of Reed's name was the signal for applause on the Republican side, which was returned with interest by the Democrats when McCreary, of Kentucky, nominated Carlisle. The vote resulted: Reed, 106; Carlisle, 154 ; Cummings, of New York, 1. Reed, having been declared speaker, was escorted to the chair by McKinley and Carlisle, amid applause, and the oath of office administered by Kelley, of Penn sylvania. Randall, of Pennsylvania, paired with Wilbur, of New York. Speaker Reed said : "I tbank you for the high office which your voices have bestowed upon me. It has been impos sible not to be moved by its dignity and honor. Yet you may well imagine I am at this moment more impressed by its re sponsibilities and duties, under our system of government, as it has been developed by these responsibilities and duties, both political and parliamentary. So far as the duties are political, I sincerely hope they may be performed with a proper sense of what is due all the people of the country. So far as they are parliamentary, I hope with equal sincerity that they may be per formed with a proper sense of what is due to both sides of the chamber applause to the end that I may be successful in carrying out your wishes. I invoke con siderate judgment and cordial aid of all members of this house." Loud and long applause. The next step in the organization was the swearing in of members elect, and as they ranged themselves in squads of twenty at a time in the space in front of the clerk's desk. The oath was adminis tered by the speaker. The house then proceeded to the elec tion of other officers. Edward McPher son was elected clerk ; A. F. Holmes, ser geant at arms ; O. A. Adams, doorkeeper, and James L. Wheat, postmaster. When it came to the election of chap lain there was a fight. Rev. Chas. B. Ramsdell, nominee of the Republican caucus, was defeated and the chaplain of the late house, Wm. H. Milburn, the blind preacher, was re-elected. These officers were then sworn in. McKinley, Cannon and Carlisle were appointed a committee to inform the president mat tne nouse naa organized ana was ready to proceeu to ousiness. 

NOTES. The president's message was not laid before the house till late in the after noon. Sec. Windom has transmitted to con gress his estimates for appropriations re quired for the fiscal year ending Jane 30, 1891. lie estimates! tnac tne sum ot 1341.428,977 will be needed. The esti mates for 1890 were $323,407,488. The appropriation for the present fiscal year is $323,495,930. Bills for thejfinal payments on the new cruiser Charleston nave been approved. Arrangements are now being made to put her in commission, one win ne tne nag shin of the Asiatic or Pacific stations. most likely the former and will probably make her nrst cruise in the r.ast indies. Judge Brewer'. Decision. Topeka, Nov. 30. Judge Brewer yes terday rendered a decision that the part ot' the Topeka meat inspection ordinance which provides for the inspection of all meat before slaughter, within a mile of the city limits be made, is an obstruction to the inter state commerce, and there fore void. This opens Topeka to the prod uct of the packing houses in Kansas City and Chicago. J udge lirewer also rendorai another decision by which the Stephens county men under indictmont for the murder of Sheriff' Cross and deputies in No Man's Land, are to be sent to the United States court for the western dis trict of Texas for trial. Judge Brewer de clared unconstitutional the law known as the "Muskogee Act," which places No Man's Land under the jurisdiction of the Texas court. Twelve indicted men will lie at once taken to Paris, Texas, for trial. Scandal at Ogden. Ogdex, Utah, Nov. 30. Chrales S. King, editor of the Evening Union, this city, was shot twice by E. W.-Exum, ex United States Marshal. The wounds are not necessarily futal, although one entered the chest and cut close to the jugular vein. The trouble was over an article pub lished in the Union, a few days ago rela tive to Exura's family, in which it was intimated that Mrs. Exum, who was mar ried five months ago, had welcomed a new arrival at his house and a certain well known young man in the city was the father. It would appear that the chargo is as untrue and wilful as it is in decent and slanderous. No one stands higher in society circles in Ogden than Mr. ai.il Mrs. Exum. Exum called upon the editor, and at the muzzle of a gun forced him to sign a retraction and publish it. This King did in tho most abject terms, then followed it with another scurrillous reference to the case, which left the impression that it was true notwithstanding his denial. King left town for a few days, but re turned this morning to find that the grand jury had indicted him for crimnal libel. This evening he met Exum on the street, and after a fow words the latter drew his gun. King grappled with him and managed to knock the gnn out of range. King broke loose and ran, thus avoiding further shots. Exum gave him self up and was placed under bonds. Democratic Caucus. Washington, Dec. 3. The house Dem ocratic caucus met yesterday forenoon and all tho old officers were re-nominated. The following was adopted without di vision : Resolved, We, the Democratic members of the house of the 51st congress, at the beginning of tho first session, hereby send greeting to the people of the country, and an assurance of our continuous confidence in and a devotion to the principles of tar iff' reform as embraced in Mr. Cleveland's message to the last congress upon that subject, and in the platform of the princi ples adopted at the last Democratic na tional convention at St. Louis. That we hail with delight the emphatic approval of those principles by the people as ex pressed at the polls of the recent elec tions, and pleugo them to renew and continue in congress the contest for a reduction of tho war taxes so ably begun and prosecuted in former congresses by our representatives and senators. Uuestions in relation to the election of permanent officers and the modifica tion ot house rules were postponed. .Ad journed. ' As the gallery doors swung outward there was a wild rush for seats, and in a few moments there was standing room only. On the floor the members mingled together, chatting and laughing. Letter from Sec. Noble. Gi'TimiE, I. T.. Nov. 30. The Guthrie News publishes a private letter from Sec.
