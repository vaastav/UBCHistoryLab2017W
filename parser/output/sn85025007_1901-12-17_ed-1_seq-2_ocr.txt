?*!?iA TUESDAY EVENING, DEO. 17 1901. Thk spfobts of Congressmen Moody, Crumpacker, Dick, et ala, to peas their new fengled force bills, or ?bat tbey term bills to reduce repre? sentation from tbe southern States in tbe lower house of Congress, and a corresponding reduction in tbe vote of tbe electoral college, have already ?truck a anag In the shape of opposi? tion upon tbe part of southern republi? can?. At the late conference of south? ern republican members of Congress decided opposition was shown to tbe ptsesRe of any snob bills. Senator Pritchard.of North Carolina, was out? spoken In hie determination to defeat them, If possible, and among other things said : "Tbe abandonment of the State gov? ernments In Louisiana and other south? ern states In 1876 was in tbe nature of notice to the people of tbe United States tbat the fifteenth amendment was not to be enforced, and everything tbat has happened since tbat time has been i ; harmony with the policy outlined by those who were intrusted with the ad? ministration of governmental affairs on that occasion." This of course is not a pleasant re? minder of the "crime of 1876" to those ?who were parties to tbe grand larceny of tbe Presidency. Many strange things were happening al? most daily in tbe winter of 1876-77 and those were indeed stirring times. But tbe grotesque was presented when President Hayes recognized as govern? ors of the three disputed States?Soulb Carolina, Florida ?nd Louisiana Hampton, Blozham and Nichols, demo? crat?, even though It was known tbat Mr. Tilden received more votes in each of tbe three States than were reoeived by his democratic associates on tbe ticket. All of this recalles tbe time ?when tbe "visiting statesmen" from the North and West went to tbe three States before Congress met, fixed tbe deal, and, as subsequent events dis? closed, made effective the steal. Alter Hayes was safely ensconced in tbe White House a way to get rid of the carpet baggere and scalawags, who bad impoverished these States.was consider? ed necessary, thereupon "congression? al commissions" succeeded "visiting statesmen" and were sent South to see how tbe land lay. Shortly afterwards tbe federal troops were withdrawn, and then the whole republican carpet bag rule was effaced from these States and today they are democratic and their affairs are conducted by white men. In being a party to the fraud Hayes of course pieced a cloud on his title, but ha was President, and tbe lack of a clear oonsclenoe did not worry him any more than the need of a ti le olear. Senator Prltchard's remarks are timely, as they recall things and events tbat should from lime to time be referred (o "lest we forget." Tbreatend reduction in members of Congress from the South will not alarm the people of this section, as they care more for borne rule, com? plete control of tbeir affairs, State and local, than they do for just how many men they shall send to Congress. In their determination to keep tbe first, however, they will not surrender tbe other until they have fought to tbe last ditch and not even then, anlese over? whelmed "with overpowering numbers and resources." Thk sknatb's ratification of the Hay Pauooefote treaty ends all controversy as to the right of the United States to construct, own and manage an Isthmi? an oanal, and concejos, besides, tbe ex? clusive right to afford soob canal ade? quate protection against lawlessness and disorder. The Clayton-Hulwer treaty Is thus modified as respeots certain of its clauses, so as to recognize new cir? cumstances and conditions, while at the same time other clauses, of Item ti to tbe United States, ?re continued in full force. Tbe right to fortify the canal that may be constructed across tbe Isthmus is not explicitly given. The British Government secures, for its part, that the oanal sball be open to all nations alike on equal terme. ?a this point the essential feature of the Clay ton-Balwer treaty is retained, con? trary to the wish of some, who wanted the oanal built for tbe exclusive use and benefit of tbe United States. The Clay ton-Balwer treaty was not the only obstacle to this country's obtain? ing tbe exclusive use of an isthmian canal. There are numerous treaties which bind it to the principle of neu? tralization. Some senators wanted to press a harder bargain with Great Britain, bat the administration decided to be generous with its new ally, so the treaty was ratified without changing a word In tbe original draft as prepared by Mr. Hay and Lord Pauncofote. Thk failubk of tbe Pan-American congress to agree upon a plan of oom polsory arbitration might have been foreseen. Eogland and the United States spent large eu me of money in Bending delegates to the peace conference at Tbe Hague aod these delegates took promi? nent part in formulating arbitration measures, bat these two countries were ?jaick t* go to war with the South African republics and Spain respect? ively ?nd refused absolutely to listen to either compromise on arbitration proposals. _____________ r stUaai >> /i.MuAliiiM (Corraapaadeoc* of the Alexandn? Oaaelt? ] WasbiUKton. December 17. Congressman Wbeeier today intro? duced io tbe House a revolution for ao investigation by toa House committee on naval allaite of the conduct of Ad? miral Scbley before and during the battle of Santiago. He stated tbat bis reason for lutrudncing this measure was tbe persistence ot the Sampson press in declaring tbat Admiral Dewey agreed with tbe majority of the court in most of its Undings and tbat tbe minority report meant nothing. "I desire to have Admiral Dewey go on tbe stand," be declared, "?nd give bis interpretation of bis report." Messrs. Cooper, Mudd, Norton and Vandiver bava also introduce bilie? In defense of Admiral Scbley. U is admtted at the Navy depart? ment today tbat Admiral Sampson's attorneys have notified Secretary Loop of their intention to tile a formal pro tent against Admiral Dewey'? opioion tbat Rear Admiral Scbley deserves tbe credit of tbe victory of Santiago. Tbe opinion prevalle at tbe department tbat Admiral Sampeon's objections will be received this week and will be consider? ed by tbe Secrttary, together with those of Scbley, prior to Mr. Look's expression of approval or disapproval of tbe findings of tbe court of inquiry. Among the law officers of tbe navy some doubt exists as to the nature of tbe Secretary's probable action on that part of the report in which Admiral Dewey gives Sohley tbe credit for tbe defeat of Cervera's fleet. Io law naval as well as civil?Admiral Dawey'j remarks in tbis connec? tion are considered as "obiter dictum," or not pertinent to the subject ululer consideration, and, therefore, requiring, no notice of tbe reviewing authority. This conclusion oo tbe part of the law officers will re? lieve tbe secretary, it ie stated, from muob embarrassment. ?a replying to Admir?! Sampson's protest he will simply call attention to tbe precept of tbe court and to tne faot tbat the quee< tioo of supreme command daring tbe Santiago engagement was never under consideration by tbe court and, there? fore, tbat Admiral Dewey's remarks io that connection constitute officially no part of tbe report. The secretary will aleo be relieved from placing the Navy Department in the position of deciding one way or tbe other tbat question, ?a hie actioo on Admiral Dewey's minor? ? ty views u will be cogently stated by Mr. Long tbat tDe department caunot officially take coguiziuce of any opioion on extraneous matters. It is believed tbat final action oo the report will be announced ty tbe secretary next week. Secretary Long, at tbe solicitation of Senator McComas, of Maryland, has extended tbe time limit for the presen talion of Admiral Scbley's bill of ex? ceptions to Thursday at 4 p. m. It is authoritatively asserted at tbe State department tbis rnoroiag tbat no defioite agreement bas yet been reach? ed wltb Denmark as to tbe purchase by tbis country of tbe Danisb West Indies. Negotiations, it is admitted, are in pro? gress as tbey bave beoa ever since 1871 and perhaps sbow a more encouraging development today tban ever before. It is understood, however, tbat terme agreeable to both sides have been reach? ed and tbat a protocol containing tbem bas been submitted to King Christian aud as soon as be afiixes his signature the document will be submitted to tbe Senate. No admission as to tbe price to be paid is obtainable, bu it is said by reliable people tbat (5,000,000 is very near tbe cost of purchase. The status of the island and tbe inlanders will be left to action by Coogress. Oermany has been peeking from tbe United (?latin eome expression indicat? ing what thia country may do in case Oerminy attempts to collect her claims from Venezuela. Baron Voa Holleben, tbe Germao ambassador, when he at? tempted to obtain tbis information from ibe President and tbe Stste Depart? ment, was referred to tbat part of tbe President's message interpreting the Monroe doctrine and the inciden'/ then closed. Tbe House committee oo rivers and harbors today decided to close hearings on the proposed bill by January 25. Tbentbe bill will be taken up and it is to be ready for introduction February 10. It is not believed tbat it will carry more than tbe bill of last year, in round numbers, 160.000,000. Tbe House committee on the Judi? ciary today took up tbe bills to estab? lish a national bureau of criminal iden? tification at Washington. Wm. Pink? erton aod Chief Sylvester, of this city, were heard in support of the bill, which was framed by tbe association of police chiefs. Tbe House committee on interstate and foreign commerce today took up tbe Pacino cable bills and decided to give public hearings on the same be? ginning January 11. Last year tbe oommiltee by a bare majority decided in favor of private construction of tie cable, the Government to pay a sub? sidy of $250 000 annually. This year tbe Postal cable company is in tbe field, offering to construct tbe cable without aov subsidy whatsoever.

The t me of the visit ef tbe King is not yet de? termined, hut it will be before tho middle of the year, it t* believed. Tbe plan to have Congress condoct an in? vestigation of tbe Santiago campaign and the part taken In it by Betr Admiral bchloy was formally abindoned lut night ?ta conference of the Maryland delegation and other friends of the admiral at ihe New Willard. Another important decision reached by tbe Scbley forcai is tbat an appeal will be made to Presi dent kooeevelt, as commander-in-eblef of the army and navy, should ?Secretary Long refuto to remand the case to the court of icqoiry. A new element is Injected loto tbe present controversy by reason of the reported inten? tion of Admiral Sampson to die a protest with the Department against the minority report of Admiral Dewey, in wbich the latter gave Sshley fail credit for tbe Santiago victory and, by infoiunce, took away from Sampson the eredit that had been given him by the l eaarlmeit. Sampson etili contenti? that ho was within signal distance of the battle and therefore was really in sapremo commend.
