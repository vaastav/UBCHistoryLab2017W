Some of tho large planters have abandoned all hopo of cultivating their lands for the ensuing year, but a majority arc getting their farms ready, hopeful that something may turn up that will enable them to get the requisite amount of labor. At present notwithstanding the speech of Gen. Howard, disabusing their minds upon tho subject of dividing out tho lands the negroci arc not disposed to contract. They arc represented, however, ns in a more destitute condition than those of Middle Tennessee, nnd it is hoped that ns the winter advances they may see the ruin that awaits them unless thev are willing to do something for a support. Such seems to be the condition of affairs, ns a general thing, throughout the Soiithf Iscw and then wc hear of a community where tho people are more hopeful.

Lin: IseunANOli This is a subject of increasing interest. Many who have given it thought regard it as one of tho niot judi clous investments that the head of a family can make to secure an ultimate competency to thoso who may be dejiendent upon him. Jn this connection wc invite tho special at fen I ion of thoc who feel an interest in tho subject to the advertisement of the St. Lotus MtTrAT. Ltm Insukanci: Company, Messrs. Harfield & Stephenson, special ngents at Nashville, Wv. publish this morning a letter from Thos. L. Clingman, of North Carolina, on the condition and sentiments of tho people of that State. Mr. Clingman was originally a Whig, p:id for some years a member of tho IIo'.c of Itcprescntativcs. After the adoption of the Compromise Measures of 1850 ho became a Democrat, and was hold ing his scat as a Democratic Senator in Con gress when tho rebellion broke out. He was always a zealous advocate of the interests of slavery, and served in the Confederate army during tho war. In ono of the later engage ments of the contest, he was wounded in tho foot, and isstill lame. His statements of the manner in which tho country was led into the war, embody his own views, and will lie taken for what they aro worth. Every man has his own peculiar notions on that s:il ject. Mr. Clingman was one of the men who differed vbry widely with Mr. Davis upon tho management of the war. He has nlways exercised a good deal of independ ence, of character, and never harmonized very well with any jtarty. Tun ineiwagoof President Johnson was LoUl forward to with so much anxiety, and wra regarded as of such great international importance by the Canadian people, that it was telegraphed complete to the Montreal newspapers, and appears in full in their is sues of tho morning following the day of its presentation to Congress.

If they were a little more practical we should hold them in much higher estimation. Mr. Greeley lias recently offered to the consideration of the President and Congress some stieucstioiw upon their differences and how to remedy them. He clearly sees that the doctrines promulgated in the message, are very widely different from those acted on and adopted by Congress immediately after the message was read to them, and that, unless something is done by one or the other, or by both parties to this difference, there must be a rupture between the Executive and Legislative Departments of the Govern ment.

The admirable and saving Fpint of com promise may be carried too far. On the chief tonics of difference between the Jt'res ident and Congress the President has planted himnclf on the constitution, and Congress themselves on a wholly different ground, Tho President says the Union has never been dissolved, that no Stato has been out of the Union. This he has always held from the inception of the war. He reprc scntcd Tennessee in the U. S. Senate after her vote of separation, became her milita ry governor and exercised that office for more than two years, and became the nom incc for the Vice Presidency, wa3 elected and qualified all as a citizen of Ten ncssee, a State still in the Union, and only eligible to these Bcvcral positions as the citizen of a State whoso relations to the Union had never changed, whatever might have been the effect of temperaay disturbances. This doctrine is as firmly fixed in the mind of the President as are the bones in his body ; and it is really as neccs sarv to sustain the government now an against future rebellions that may unfortu nately arise in the growth and expansion of the country, as arc the bones in his body to sustain the President's physical life. A hat other lino of policy, therefore, can he " chalk out." Is ho to become a harlequin to be moved hither and thither by the pull ing of a string, or the touching of a spring, by the hands of Congress and yield, witl out rhyme or reason, the cherished convie tionsof his judgment and duty? II. G. is scarcely so well acquainted with Andy John son as the people of Tennessee are. Another prime point of difference is t lie right of Congress, either to prescribe th rights of suffrage in the States, or to make the rulos of suffrage adopted by any Stat for itself, a reason for tho exclusion of sucl State from the Union, or for denying to it its proper and lawful representation in the Union. TUo President denies the power of Congress to go into the States with any sucl authority. This matter was remitted to the States by the frainers of the constitution, and the President will never be nblo to reconcile it with his conscience, or with his inclina lions, to compromise away the provisions in that instrument. Miht it not be well for the Tribune to state fully and succinctly whatconcesMons i wishes to be made on each side, that they may " see cyo to eye " and " be a unit now and to tho end " ? A Noirriiciur c'oxJitr.s.s. The par excellence friend and defender of Southern-rights and State-rights in the city of New York, the Daily JVcuw, recommend: the members of Congress elected from the late Confederate States, since they cannot gain admittance into the Halls of the National Legislature at Washington, to meet together and form a Congress of their own at Richmond. It is, pcrhap, natural that ono cxtrcnio should beget another, and under tho gourding of such measures as aro being introduced into tho Senate Mr. Sumner, and into tho Houc by Mr. Stevens, the Xevs is excited to a de gree but little short of madness, and is pre pared to give almost any sort of advice. Put if the Xetn is sincorclv friendly to our people, wc respectfully suggest that it has an unfortunate method of showing it. The adoption of such a suggestion by the South ern members of Congress would certainly be a mos. melancholy evidence of insanity. "Wc trust that, in all our great and many mis fortunes, wc have not lot our senses. Of whatever else the Southern people may bo justly accused, surely they are not so stupid as that would amount to. No more of that, llonjamin, if yon love us. A company has been organized at S.m Francisco, to build a railroad from that city to a town in San Diego, thence eastward to the State line, and there connect with the contemplated road to the Mississippi river.

Peprieves have liccn granted to cacli until tnc cnu oi your present Assembly, pursuant to the jiower vested in me bv article a, section 10, Consi tution of Kentucky ; and I now lay their cases before yon, to whom the power of par doning is reserved by the article aforesaid, with the recommendation that they be par doned. 2so other applications have been made to me; but there arc doubtless many similar cases within the State. Entertaining the opinion that acts of trea son committed within the State, in aid of the recent rebellion again-t the United btatcs, the structure of our Government necessarily merges the treason against the State in that against the United States; I therefore hold that a pardon from the President of the United States, cither by fpccial pardon or by general amnesty, acquits all entitled to such aninsly or holding such pardon of all liabil- liy lur treason in any ohiu u. uwumv law ruled otherwise, the provisions of the Federal and State Constitution securing the citizen from being twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense, would be nullified. Although tlio act of levying war within a State against the Government of the United States may, if successful, have the effect of overthrowing the State Government, yet it cannot be but the one offeiiMi the crime of treason atrainst the Federal Govern mentagainst which it was levied. In trea son cither the ono or the other Government must have the exclusive jurisdiction, other wise a conflict of jurisdiction would imsue, and the constitutional guaranty against b;ing twice enjeopardized will bo disregarded. If the levying of war be only against the Slate Government, then tho State tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction ; but if tho war be levied against the United Suites, though waecd within tho State as a necessary inci dent 'o such war, the acts can only be trea son against tho Government of the United States, and State courts have not jurisdic tion. Such being the view which I take of this question of constitutional law, contenting mvself with the simple statement of it, without deeming it necessary to cite author ities or elaborate by argument, I rccommenu that you errant a general pardon of all who may stand indicted in tho courts of the State for the crime of treason, based upon acts committed of levying war within this State against the Government of the United States. And in this connection I would recommend the repeal of the 1st section of an act cnti' tied. "An act to prohibit and prevent rebel lion by citizens of Kontucky and others in tho State." approved Ootober 1, 1S01, which provides "That any citizen of this State who. as a soldier or officer of the army of the co-called Confederate Suites, and as part of an armed force, shall invade this State to make war upon it, shall be deomod guilty of felony, and, upon conviction m any court having jurisdiction thereof, shall be confined in the penitentiary lor any period oi rot less than one nor more than ten years, at Uieuis crction of the iury." Since the termination of the war several pardons have been granted to those indicted under this section. Though the power of pardon is full in such cases, yet a repeal of tins section would end. tlio necessity tor Ex ecutive interference The repeal ot this sec tion will give no exemption to those em braced in the second section, and who remain the proper subiects of punishment: nor will it exempt from punishment guerrillas, their aiders and abetters, who waged within our borders their barbarous and uncivilized war fare, and atrainst whom the law should main tain a fixed condemnation, and burn witl the brand of an indelible and enduring stig ma.

Inhcritinc a crcat fortune, he in creased it largely by marriage, and from his profession at the bar had an income ot lorty or fifty thousand a year, and received a single fee of SC0.000 upon a claim of real estate in the lower part of the city. This wealth he scattered with princely generosity and royal profusion. lie was a Lucullus at home, and his hpspitalities aspired to all the magnifi cence of the ancient Roman nobleman. In 1So7 he gave a single soiree that cost $25, 000. which exceeded m splendor anvtliin ever before known here. The very floors over which the dancers moved were covered with scenic paintings, the work of the most accomplished artist then in New Orleans, and in the saloon where gaming tables were arranircu stood two baskets one Idled will bank notes and the other with gold, for the use of those guests who were unfortunate with the fickle goddess.

Here was an opportur nlty which he grasped eagerlv. Immedi ately dropping tho dishonorable purjm.o with which ho had in one week met her half a doien times, Jio sought her hand in marriage, and tho elopement just mentioned was tho result. The couple passed through this city with out stopping, on their way to St, Jiuis, to which point the father has pursued tlicm, hoping to eomo upon them in time to pre vent a marriacre. which cannot fail to wnr-k his daughter's happiness and throw a largo property into worthless hands.
