No Medicine for the cure of Rhenmatium hasever attained to such a high degree of favor ami universality as Johnson's Rheumatic Compound. Although but one year before the public, this medicine has Justly gained an unbounded popularity. When the originator first introduced It he was convineej of Its efllmcy, but he little thought it was destined to prove such an Inestimable hlffKltn; to the afflicted; but true merit can nut Im* suppressed.

The Now York Tribune remnrks that "it is not so much what the President says as what he declines to say" that is ii leading feature, so to speak, of his Message: "The first impression of the Message is that his Excellency is chastened. He makes no allusions to Congress hanging on the verge of the government. This is something from an Executive who has been in the most unreasonable humor for so many months. Mr. Pierce could not have written a weaker Message. Congress would a s readily have heard an essay upon the cause of thunder as this tame ami harmless disquisition. There is much that the President regrets. There are some good words from Washington and Jefierson, likewise Jackson. We marvel that his Excellency neglected the other fathers of their country. For any living fact, for any suggestion,for any helpful thought, we might as well turn to the lust novel of Mr. Trollope as to this Message. Ephraim seems irrevocably joined to his idols." * X ? * "We have no heart to dwell upon this dreary, lifeless document. There is nothing that any \pyal man can read with comfort or hope. Andrew Johnson is us much an enemy as when he menaced the nation from his White House steps ten months ago. He does not mean to aid us in the work of repnnulrnotlnn rrl>" ' "*? * 1 -?ur uuiy uevoiving upon Congress becomes more solemn and respousible, and we look to Congress wilh infinite yearning. Let there be kindness and patience, charity toward all, malice toward none, firmness and devotion; but above all, a singlehearted determination, come well or ill, despite Presidents or Cabinets, to labor without ceasing, until over this land there shall be peace and rest, liberty and protection, and all rights for all." The Herald says that as a mere exhibit "of the working of the several Ex-departments during the last year," the message is "an interesting, instructive and satisfactory State paper," while upon the great issue of Southern Reconstruction it reads like a chapter from "The World before the Deluge." "Mr. Johnson devotes two tedious newspaper columns to a defence of his last year's measures and general ideas of Southern restoration, including some beautiful extracts from Washington's Farewell Address and from Jetfersou and Jackson, in support of his theory of State rights and the power of Congress, and then he drops the subject. It is an argument in the court after the jury had rendered their verdict. It may be compared to a history of France, umittiug the revolution which overthrew the Bourbons?us a trivial matter not worth mentioning in pleading their claims to the throne." The New York Times says the Message has the merit of comparative brevity." Its discussions are "in moderation and good temper, though not with uniform good taste." "It has suited the Democratic Press to belittle the significance of the recent elections; but only something a little short of judicial blindness can have led Mr. Johnson to rely upon the Democratic rendering of popular opinion. He, of all men, should be able to estimate correctly the import of the verdict pronounced at the polls. He cannot complain of having been misrepresented or misunderstood. He was the exponent of his own case?the active, energetic champion of his own cause. He submitted his policy, in contradistinction to the policy of Congress, to the people of the North and West, everywhere avowing confidence in "the rectitude of their intentions and in the sagacity of their judgmeut. When they iecided against him, therefore?when they repudiated his policy and ranged themselves on the side of Congress?it became his duty, not indeed to abandon bis convictions, but to accept the will sf the people as the law of his Administration, and either to withdraw all apposition to the Congressional plan, jr to propose some now basis of adjustment. By neglecting to pursue ono or the other of these courses he has lost the last opportunity of effecting a reconciliation with t lm i?m<it ~ ?? ?- { * "*w \JX l<UC party that elected him, and has furnished a weapon to his adversaries which they will wield to hisdetriment." The World praises the Message for its firmness, "indomitable steadiness,'* und says that it has "the calmness of conscious strength/' It says furtlftthat "it is probable that the Republican members of Congress knew of the President's inflexibility when they held their infuriated caucus, on Saturday evening. But this is a point of no consequeuee. What is certain, and what the country Is most concerned to know, is, that the President remains immovable, and Congress belligerent. The elections have not awed him into any degree of submissiveness, and ho restates his position with a masculine, convincing clearness, which must produce a favorable impression upon all candid men. He does not deign to pay the Constitutional Amendment even the cold compliment of a passing allusion ; nor is there any reason why he abould." The above extracts, coming from the four principal New York morningjournals, are fair specimens of the tone of Lhe Republican and Copperhead press, in regard to the Message, as also of an Intermediate class represented by the Times and Herald. We should say that fully three-fourths of the newspapers of the country condemn the Message as a weak, tame, partisan document. Bwcet Words Tor JefT. Davis from OeorglA. Telegraphic Dispa.ch to Riehmond. Mr. Henderson introduced the following resolutions, Saturday, in the Georgia House, and they were adopted unanimously in both branches of the Legislature:? Whereas, The general assembly would do great injustice to the great heart of Georgia not to give some formal expression of respect for the character and services of the illustrious prisoner of State, Jefferson Davis. All the generous pulastions of that heart are in full unison and sympathy with his suffering and misfortunes. Its warm affections cluster around the fallen chief of a once dear but now abandoned cause. There they will cluster and center while men admire all that is chivalric in nature, while they regard all that is noble Jano virtuous. Therefore the general assembly resolve,. That their sincerest condolence and warmest sympathy are tendered} to Mr. Jefferson Davis in his confinement, and they look forward with anxious solicitude to the day when our magnanimous and patriotic President shall put an end to his confinement, and by the interposition of executive clemency restore him to a people for whom he so faithfully struggled, and on account of whom he endures with Christian fortitude the hardships of a long and rigorous imprisonment.

It is a mistake also to sup- 1 pose work more remunerative here i than elsewhere. The actual wages t may make it appear so, but it must be t remembered that house rent, fuel, pro- i visions and clothing are all up to the I highest figures, with small chance of i decline during the winter months. It I is therefore a dangerous experiment lor workmen to come to New York i without any purpose beyond waiting for such opportunities as may turn up. At the present time such a step is espe- , cially unwise, for every department of labor is full, and likely to remain so at least until spring. luuininrj ?? uuvrrnur i-firjHiinia XcMRffe to tbo Old Virginia Lc?i*? lata re. Richmond, Va., Dec. 3.?The message :>f the Governor of Virginia was delivered to-day to the Legislature, which met at noon and adjourned until tomorrow for want of a quorum. The message, aftqg? referring to the causes :liey had for congratulation audthauks, jays that all the agencies provided for ;he enforcement of the laws were in successful operation, and no serious disturbance of the public peace badocsurred. The financial operations for ;he last year were therewith transmit:ed, as well as the report of the Treasurer. Taking the income of the last pear as a basis of estimate, there would be received for the year ending September, 1S67, the sum of $l,5tf3,2S0 income. He estimated the expenses up to October 1st, 1S67, at $510,000, which would leave a balance of $1,053,2S6. There was nothing so important to devote their surplus money lo, as to the payment of the interest of the public debt, the balance of which interest was to be paid amounting to $-1,100,059 97. An assessment on real and personal proporty of ibout 4(3 eonU on the $100, making altogether GO cents on the $100 income, would be required for necessary exl?enses. There had been some talk of repudiating the public debt. No step could bo more prejudicial to all future interests as the serious discussion of that subject, destroying the outside credit of the State, and preventing the inllux of capital. Should such a step betaken, no gentleman would be anxious thereafter to be recognized as a Virginian. They might hope for a better harvest this year than last, which would banish the idea of repudiation. Wost Virginia owes to-day, by the terms of her division, her fair share of the debt. To wait until the Commissioners would settle the matter would not be good policy. He recommended the sale of the State stock in the James ttiver uanai, turnpikes, bridges. tfco., ami in railroads not completed. Also, that a reform should be effected in the oyster law. The criminal expenses were largely increasing. He pointed out an example how to diminish them, uud how the administration of justice could bo fairly dealt. It was to be regretted that the State could not contribute more liberally to education to make the Ireedman a useful member of society. lie should be educated. Ho was gratified to see that 11 hu ui of money-had been raised in the North for the purpose, and that schools were in successful operation. The colored man labored linger great disadvantages. When he had as many inducements to work as the white man, doubtless he would work, and he was pleased to find that many of the best men seemed disposed to give him a fair chance. It was very desirable, however, to induce foreign emigration. He recommeuded them ,to correct existing abuses in the management of railroad couipauies, so as to reduce the rates to the lowest remunerative standard. The Secretary of State of the United States has forwarded to him a joiutresolutipn of Cougress, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which he submitted to them, the President disapproving of it, and insisting on the immediate admission of loyal representatives duly elected. Some eontroversj' had taken place as to what was meant by loyal, some claiming that it was those who took the prescribed oath. The elections hud,however, resulted in a decisivo majority in favor of the Congressional view. An effort was made to induce the L<ecislaLures in some States to reject l he constitutional amendment, hopingto be more successful in the future contest; but he thought it very unlikely that such would be the result. The people of the South should not be again beguiled by their professed friends at the North. The late election showed that Congress was supported by a large majority of | the people. He thought there were no hopes of better terms. No political status had yet been given to those who had been in itrins against the Government. Congress had denied the assumed right of the President to settle that status. No lisgrace could bo incurred by accepting the proposed terms, they were not nearly so hard as anticipated. Person j and property weresacrea, and the right jf suffrage was left to them. Should hey not accept the Amendment, the I result was uncertain. He left the whole mbject with them, invoking Divine blessings on their deliberations. Tlincf. NtrvooH' Speech at the Reception Banquet Given to the Republican Members of Congress. Washington, Dec. 4. The Hon. Thad. Stevens made oue of [lis characteristic speeches at the banquet yesterday, in honor of the Union neinbers Congress. He attacked the President with vigor, declaring that laving been elevated into power :hrough an unexpected event visited jpon tne nation for Its sins, be now j wished to be King instead of President. Mr. Stevens said the war was not over, j [ts main and final object was pursued Py the enemy with relentless energy. | rhe object had at first been to rule over it least half the country as a nation of j slaves, to introduce free trade hud to luuiiliatethe North lor its persistent) idvocacy of freedom. The object, now | was to rule the^whole nation, bjT means I )f an oligarchy, making negroes and I copperheads contribute to the increased power of the South through the increase I jf the number of its votes, to seize the reins of government, to introduce free ;rade, and to break down the modesty j )f the free people of the North. During | ,he war JetT. Davis was commander-injhief of the rebel army, with Lee as his hief adviser. Now, Andrew Johnson was their commander-in-chief, and poor old Wool was their chief martial idviser, and for the navy they had Semmes aud Welles. [Laughter.] The people were to decide now whether they A*ereto have_Audrew Johnson as Presiient or as King, for they were told :liey had no other choice lelt. [Laugher.*] He wanted the encouragement 3f the soldiers. The enemy had j ,ho vantage ground, having possession of the White House, and | was dispensing with a corrupt hand : ;he vast patronage of the natiou, und yet he had no fears. The ariny consisted of citizens as well as soldiers. It had a few mercenary olDcers like the jteedmaus, the Dixi's, and tho Wools; but if tho government wore to order HJrant, or Howard, or Farragut to do l*s treacherous work, they would break iheir swords rather than obey. With Sheridan for a leader, and 25 or 50,000 ;olored soldiers, they might defy Anirew Johnson aud all who might follow bis lead. But if the time should ever :ome when the conspirators would muster audacity equal to their ambitipn ind, as once happened in Kngland, attempt to turn the regular army igainst the people, Congress would not tiave to rely on the Southern freedmen itlone. The men of the loyal North would spring to their feet and unsheath :heir weapons, as when they beard the irst booming cannon of Sumter. Let Congress be bold, and the soldiers >f the last war would take care of the rest, and the usurper who leads the lostile forces would have time aud eisure to revise his boasted proclamaion in one of the casemates of 1'orress Monroe. [Cheers.] The usurper's ?ead would rest much' more quietly, to )e sure, on a lap-board and goose than vben oppressed with a crow n. [Laugher.] With less than impartial suffrage, he South, with his consent, should lever be-reconstrucled. He would not *e content with such a puerile work as iniversal amnesty and universal suffrage.
