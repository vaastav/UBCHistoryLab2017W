WOOD COUNTY REPORTER. JAS. E. INGRAHAM A CO., Publishers. GRAND RAPIDS. - WISCONSIN. The President's Message. To the Senate and House of Representatives: THE BUSINESS PBOSTRATION. Since the convening cf Congress one year ago the nation has undergone a prostration in busi ness and the industries such as has not been witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this prostration might be in dulged in without profit, because as many the ories would be advanced as there would be* inde pendent writers who should express their own views upon the subject. Without indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call your attention only to the fact and to soine questions as to which it would seem there should be no disa greement. During this prostration two essential elements of prosperity have been most abundant —labor and capital. Both have been largely un employed. Where security has been undoubted capital has been attainable at very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted* it has been found in abundance, at cheap rates compared with what of the necessaries and comforts of life could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of prosperity, therefore, have not been denied us; a third might be added. Our soil and climate are un equaled within the limits of any contigu ous territory under one nationality for its vari eties of products to feed and clothe a people and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less fa vored people. Therefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wise statesmanship at this session of Congress would dictate —ignoring the past distributing in proper channels these great elements of prosperity to any people. Debt abroad is the only element that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affaire to cause any continued depression in the industries and prosperity of our people. THE 

CURRENCY. A great conflict for national existence made necessary for temporary purposes the raising of large sums of money trom whatever source at tainable. It was made necessary in the wisdom ol Congress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of the times, to devise a system of national currency, which it is proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation, involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, and involv ing, both directly and indirectly, foreign Indebtedness. The currency,’being of a fluctu ating value and unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation in itself. These two causes, however have involved us in a foreign indebtedness contracted in good faith by the borrower and the lender, which should be paid in coin and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted—gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government can not be violated toward its creditors at the national disgrace. Our commerce should be encouraged; American ship building and carrying capacity increased; for cign markets sought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine or the manufactory, anew means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people; but in ray judgment the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a currency good wherever civ ilization reigns—one ' which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a mar ket with some other --a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give it value. Gold' and silver are now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system was adopt ed and the debt contracted, there should be no delay, certainly no unnecessary delay, iu fix ing by legislation a method by which we will re turn to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and per manent revival of business and the industries un til a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out, looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to make a so caUcd money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others; but even these, I believe, would be disappointed by the result if a course should be pursued which will keep iu doubt the value of the legal-tender me dium of exchange. A revival of the productive industries is needed by all classes, and by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from the realization upon its sales. But. admitting that the two classes of citizens referred to are to be benefit ed by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his liabilities as to do this? Would it not be safer, for fear of over-issues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debts and obligations are obliterated iu the United States, and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the time free from in cumbrance? These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking peo ple. Every delay in the preparation for final re sumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that s. convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by the posi tive action of Congress or by national disasters which will destroy for a time at least the credit of individuals and the State at large. 1 believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise snch legislation as will renew confi dence, revive all the industries, start us on a ca reer of prosperity to last for many years, and to save the credit of the nation and of the people. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly-to-be-sought-for end. There are other points I may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in value labors under two great disadvan tages: First, having no use for the world’s ac knowledged medium of exchange, gold and sil ver, these are driven out of the country because there is no demand for their use; second, the medium ol exchange iu use being of a fluctuating value, for, after all, it. is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver, metals having an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them, a large margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is mouths from the date of production to the date of realiza tion. Interest upon capital must be charged and risk of fluctuation in the value of that which is to be received in payment added: hence high prices act as a protection to the foreign pro ducer, who receives nothing in exchange for the product ot his skill and labor except a currency good at a stable value the world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of the burden of existing pros tration loi the want of a sound financial system falls upon the workingman, who must after all produce the wealth, and the salaried man who superintends and conducts business. The bur den falls upon them two ways: by the deprivation of employment aud by the decreased purchasing power of their salaries. It is the duty of Com gross to devise the method of correcting the evils which are acknowledged to exist, and not mine; hut I will venture to suggest two or three things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to a return to specie payments—the firs't great requisite in a return to prosperity. The legal-tender clause to the law au thorizing the issue of currency bv the National Government should be repealed, to take effect „ 'to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act. not to apply, how ever, to payments of salaries by the Govern ment or for other expenses now provid ed by law to be paid in currency. In the interval pending between the repeal and final resumption, provision should be made bv which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain'gold as itmay become necessary from time to time, from the date when specie resumption commences. I o thi* might and should be added a revenue suf ficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accu mulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain re demption. I recommepd this subject to your careful con sideration, relieving that a favorable solution is attainable and that if reached by this Con<n*ees the present and future generations will "ever jn-atenilly remejnber it as their deliverer from a tnraheiom of evil and disgrace. With resumption free banking may be authorized with safety, giv ing full protection to bill-holders, which they hate not under the existing laws. Indeed. I 'V* n |4 re S ar d free banking as essential. It v oulct give a proper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for the transac tion ot legitimate business, new banks would be started, and i n tU ru banks would wind up their business when u was found there was a superabundance of currency. The experience and indgmofct of the peop.e can best decide just how'much curr-ncv re required for the transaction of the of the country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement 1 this question to Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury or the Executive. Congress should make the regulations under which banks mav exist, but should not mane banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper cur ! rency that shall be authorized. Such importance I do attach to this subject, and so earnestly do I j commend it to your attention, that I give it'prom | inence by introducing it at the beginning of this ; message. 

FOREIGN' RELATIONS. 1 During the past vear nothing has occurred to I disturb the general, friendly and cordialrelations i of the United States with other powers. The correspondence submitted herewith between this Government and its diplomatic representatives in other countries shows a satisfactory condition of all questions between the United States and the most of those countries, and with few ex ceptions. to which reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of difference to be ad justed. The notice directed by the resolution of Con gress of June IT. 1874. to be given to termina r e the convention of July 17.1858. between the United States and Belgium has been given, and the treaty will accordingly terminate on the Ist day of July. 1875. This convention secured to certain I Belgium vessels entering the ports of the United i States exceptional privileges which are not ac i corded to our own vessels. The other features of the convention have proved satisfactory and have tended to the cultivation of beneficial* commer cial intercourse and friendly relations between the two countries. I hope that the negotiations hich have beeu invited will result in the con elusion of another treaty which may tend to the I interests ot both countries. Our relations with China continue to be friend ly. Duringthe past year the fear of hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of the landing of an armed force upon the island of roimosa by the latter, has occasioned uneasi ness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the -difficulties arising from this cause will be ad justed. and that the advance of civilization in these Empires may not be retarded bv a state of war. In consequence of the part taken bv cer tain citizens of the United Slates in* this expedition our representatives in those coun tries have been instructed to impress upon the Governments of China and Japan the firm inten tion of this country to maintain a strict neutrality in the event of hostilities, and carefully prevent any infraction of law on the part of our citizens. In connection with this sub ject I call the attention of Congress to a generally conceded fact that the great proportion of Chinese immigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily to make their homes with us and their * labor pro ductive of general prosperity, but they come un der contract with head men. who own them al most absolutely. _ In a worse form does this apply to the Chinese women. Hardly a per ceptible percentage of them perform aiiy honor able labor. They are brought for shameful pur poses, to the disgrace of the communities where they have settled, and to the great demoraliza tion of the youths of those localities. If this evil practice can be legislated against it will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforce any reg ulation to secure so desirable an end. It is hoped that negotiations between the Gov vernment of Japan and the treaty powers, looking to the further opening of the Empire and to the removal of various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce the result desired, which cannot fail to inure to the benefit of all the par ties. Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration of Congress the propriety of the release of the Japanese Government from the further payment of indemnity un der the convention of October 22, 1804. and as no action has been taken therein, it be comes my duty to regard the obligations of the convention as in force, and, as the other powers interested have obtained their por tion of the indemnity in full, the Minister of the United Slates in Japan has, in behalf of this Government, received the remainder of the amount due to the United States under the Convention of Simouseky. I submit the pro priety of applying the income of a part, if not the whole, of this fund to the education in the Japanese language of a number of young men, to be under obligations to serve the Government for a specified time as interpreters at the legation and the consulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same time be educated in our own vernacular, and mutual ben efit would result to both Governments. The im portance of having our own citizens competent and familiar with the language of Japan to act as interpreters and in other capacities connected with the legation and consulates in that country cannot readily be over-estimated. The amount awarded to the Government of Great Britain by the commission organized un der the provisions of the Treaty ot Washington, in settlement of the claims of British subjects arising from acts committed between April 18, 1801, and April 9, 1865, became payable under terms of the treaty within the past year, and was paid upon the 21st day of September, 1874. ALIEN CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. In this connection I renew my recommenda tion. made at the opening of the* last session of Congress, that a special court be created to hear and report all claims of aliens against the United States arising from acts committed against their persons or property during the insurrec tion. It appears equitable that oppor tunity should be offered to citizens of other States to present their claims, as well as those British subjects whose claims were not admissible under the late commission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end I recommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of those claims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equitable and satisfactory manner, and to relieve Congress and the departments from the consideration of these questions. THE 

COLONY OF NEWTOUJtDLAND. The legislation necessary to extend to the col ony of Newfoundland certain articles of the Treaty of Washington of the Bth of May, 1871, having been had. a protocol to that effect was signed in behalf of the United States and of Great Britain on the 28th day of May last, and was duly pro claimed on the following day. A copy of the proclamation is submitted herewith. THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY. A copy of the report of the Commission ap pointed under the act of March 19, 1872. for sur veying and marking the boundary between the United States and the British Possessions, from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains, is herew'ith transmitted. lam happy to announce that the field work of the Com mission has been completed, and the entire line, from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains, has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is believed that the amount remaining unexpended of the appropria tion raa.ie at the last session of Congress will be sufficient to complete the office work. I recom mend that the authority of Congress be given to use the unexpended balance of the appropriation in the completion ot the work of the Commis sion in making the report and printing the neces sary maps. THE ALABAMA CLAIMS. The court known as the Court of Commission ers of Alabama Claims, created by an act of Congress at the last session, has organized and commenced the work, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissible under the provisions of the act may be speedily ascertained and paid. UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND REAL ESTATE IN TURKEY. It has been deemed advisable to exercise the discretion conferred upon the Executive at the last session by accepting the conditions required by the Government of Turkey for the privilege of allowing citizens of the United States to hold real estate in the former country by assenting to a certain change in the jurisdiction oi the courts in the latter. A copy of the proclamation upon these subjects is herewith communicated. MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA. Tnere has been no material change in our rela tions with the independent States of this hemis phere which were formerly under the dominion of Spain. Marauding on the frontiers between Mexico and Texas still frequently takes place, despite the vigilance of the civil and military au thorities in that quarter. The difficulty of checking such trespasses along the course of a river of such length as the Rib Grande, and so often fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the. efforts of this Government will be seconded by those of Mexico to the effectual suppression of acts of wrong From a report upon the condition of the busi ness before the American and Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on the part of the United States,* and dated Oct. 23, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017 claims tiled on the part of citizens of the United Slates 483 had been finally decided, and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to be disposed of; and of the 998 claims tiled against the United States 7:16 had been finally decided on, one was before the umpire and 271 remained to be disposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been disposed of, reducing somewhat the number still pending. and others have been passed upon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, in view of these figures and of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire is particularly laborious, that the Commission would be unable to dispose of the entire number of claims pending prior to the Ist day of Febru ary, 1875, the date fixed for its expiration. Nego tiations are pending looking to the the results of the decisions which have Seen reached and to a further extension of the Com mission for a limited time, which, it is confident ly hoped, will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close. The strife in the Argentine Republic is to be deplored, both on account of the parties thereto and from the probable effects of the interests of those engaged in the trade to that quarter, of whom the I'nited States are among the principal. As yet. so far as I am aware, there has been no violation of our neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that respect.' it shall be my en deavor to maintain and observe. It is with regret I announce that no further payment has been received from the Govern ment of Venezuela on account of awards in favor of citizens oi the United States. Hopes have been entertained that if the Republic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years its great natural resources would enable it to honor us obligations. Though it is now understood to be at peace with other countries, a serious in gurrection is reported to be in progre-* in an im portant region of that Republic. This may be taken advantage of as another reason to aelay the payment of the dues of our citizens. CUBA AN I) SPAIN. The deplorable strife in Cuba continues with out any marked change in the relative ad vantages of the contending forces. The insur rection continues, but Spain has gained no superiority-. Six years of strife give the insur rection a significance which cannot be ignored. Its duration and the tenacity of its adherents, together with the absence of manifested power of sappresssion on the part of Spain, cannot be controverted, and may make some positive steps on the part of other powers a mat ter of self-necessity. I had confidently hoped at this time to be able to announce an arrangement of some of the important questions between this Govern ment and that of Spain, but the negotiations have been protracted. The unhappy intestine dissensions of Spain command our profound sympathy, and must be accepted as, perhaps, a cause for some delay. An early settlement, in part at least, of the questions between the Gov ernments is hoped for. In the meantime, await ing the results of immediately-pending negotia tions. I defer a further and fuller communication on the subject of the relations of this coumry aad Spain. EXPATRIATION AND NATURALIZATI**N. I have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the existing laws with reference'to expatriation and the elec tion of nationality. Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and decisions, ii was difficult to exactly determine how far the doctrine of perpetual al legiance was applicable to the United States. Congress, by the act of the 27th of July. 1868, asserted the abstract right of expatriation as a fundamental principle of this Government. Not withstanding such assertion and the necessity of the frequent application of the principle no legislation has been had defining what acts or formalities shall work expatriation, or when a citizen shall be deemed to have removed or to have lost his citizenship. Tne importance of such a definition is obvious. The representa tives of the United States in foreign countries are continually callea upon to lend their aid and the protection of the United States to persons concerning the good faith or the reality of whose citizenship there is at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treaties fur nish some guide; in others it seems left to the persons claiming the benefit of citizenship while living in a foreign country, contributing in no manner to the performance of the duties of a citizen of the United States, and without the in tention at any time to return and undertake those duties, to use the claim of citizenship of the United States simply as a shield from the performance of the obligations of a citizen elsewhere. The status of children born of American par ents residing in a foreign country, of American women who have married aliens, or American citizens residing abroad, where mich question is not regulated by treaty, are all sources of fre quent difficulty and discussion. Legislation t n these and similar questions, and particularly de fining w hen and under what circumstances expa triation can be accomplished, or is to be pre sumed, is especially ueoded. In this connection I earnestly call the atten tion of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization. The United States wisely, freely and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may come In good faith to reside within its limits, on their complying with certain prescribed reasonable and simple formal ities and conditions. Among the high est duties of the Government is that to afford a firm, efficient and effectual protection to all its citizens, whether native born or natural ized. Care should be taken that a right, carry ing with it such support from the Government, should not be fraudulently obtained, and should be bestowed only upon full proof oi a compliance with the law, as frequent in stances of illegal and fraudulent naturaliza tion and of unauthorized use of certificates thus improperly obtained come to light. In some cases the fraudulent character of the naturalization has appeared upon the face of the certificate itself; in others examination discloses that the holder had not complied with the law. and in others certificates have been obtained where the persons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but had not even been within the United States at the time of the pretended naturalization. Instances of these classes of fraud are discovered at our legations, w'here the certificates of naturaliza tiou are presented either for the purpose of ob taining passports or demanding the protection of the legation. When the fraud is obvious on the face of such certificates they are taken up by the representatives of the Government and for warded to the Department of State. But even the record of the court in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Upou the presentation of these for the issue of passports or demanding protection of the Government the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates are not infrequently used in transactions of business, to the deception and injury of innocent parties. Without placing any' ad ditional obstacle in the tvay of the obtaimnent of citizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with us, I earnestly recommend further legisla tion to punish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization made in fraud. TREATIES OF EXTRADITION. Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification of treaties of extradition with Belgium, Equador, Peru and Salvador; also of a treaty of commerce and navi gation with Peru, aud one of commerce and con sular privileges with Salvador; all of which have been duly proclaimed, as has also a declaration with Kussia with reference to trade-marks. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made directly to Congress and forms no part of this message, will show the re ceipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount re ceived from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each of the departments of the Government. It will be ob served from this report that the amount of re ceipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,- 88 ;.30 for the fiscal year ending J une 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated re ceipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt ex isting, and the obligation to add 1 per cent, per annum to the sinking fund, a sura amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether the revenues should not be increased or the expenditures diminished. To reach this amount of surplus and not to provide for the sinking und is a partial failure to comply with the con-t tracts and obligations of the Government. A the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in the rates of taxation aud the number of articles subjected to taxation-—the question may well be asked whether or not in some instances unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from im ports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by a failure to collect, to the direct loss of the Treasury and to the preju dice of the interests of honest importers and tax payers. The Secretary of the Treasury in his report favors legislation looking to specie payments, thus supporting the views previously expressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appropriation; calls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea ana cotfee, without benefit to the consumer; recommends an increase often cents a gallon on whisky, aud. farther, that no modification be made in the Banking and Currency bill passed at the last session of Congress, unless a modification should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measures for returning to specie payments. In these recommendations I cordially join. THE TARIFF. I would suggest to Congress the propriety of readjusting the tariff so as to increase the reve nue and at the same time decrease the number of articles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into our manufactures and are not produced at home, it seems io me, should be entered free, ’those articles of manufacture which we produce a constituent part of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter free also. I will in stance fine wool, dyes. etc. These articles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture of the higher grades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medicines and used in various ways in manufactures come under this class. The introduction, free of duties, of such wools as we do not produce should stimulate the manufacture of goods requiring these. There are many articles entering into home manufactures which we do not produce ourselves, the tariff upon which increases the cost of pro ducing the manufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the direction of bringing labor and capital into harmony with each other aud of supplying one of the elements of pros perity so much needed. THE ARMY AND NAVY. The report of the Secretary of War. herewith attached, and forming a part of this message, gives all the information concerning the opera tions. wants and necessities of the army, and contains many suggestions and recommenda tions which I commend to your special atten tion. There is no class of Government em ployes who are harder worked than the army of ficers and men; none who perform their tasks more cheerfully and efficiently, and under circum stances of greater privation and hardship. Legis lation is desirable to render mere eilicient this branch of the nublic service. All tne recommen dations of the Secretary of War I regard judi cious, and I especially commend to your at tention the following: The consolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage to officers traveling under orders: the exemption of money received from the sale of subsistence stores from being covered into the Treasury; the use of appropriations for the purchase of subsistence stores without wait ing for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made; for additional appropriations for the collection ot torpedo material; for increased appropriations for the manufacture of arms: for relieving the various States from indebtedness for arms charged to them during the rebellion; for drop ping officers from the rolls of the army without trial for the offense of drawing pay more than once for the same period: for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks, and for the establishment of a professorship oi rhetoric and English literature at West Point. The reasons for the recommenda tions are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the report attached. I also recommend that the status of the staff corps of the army be fixed, w here this has not already been done, so that promotions may be made and vacancies filled as they occur in each grade when reduced below the number to be fixed by law . The necessity for such legislation is specially felt now in the Pay Department. The efficiency of the navy has been largely in creased during"the last year, under the impulse of:he foreign complications which threatened ns at the commencement of the last session of Congress. Most of our efficient wooden ships were put in condition for immediate service, and the repairs of our iron-clad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. The result is mat most of these are in effective condi tion. and need only to be manned and set in commission to go at ouce into service. Some of the new sloops authorized by Congress are al ready id commission, and mo-u of the remainder are launched and wait only the completion of their machinery to enable them to take their placs as part of our effective force. Two iron torpedo-ships have been com pleted miring the la-t year: and four of our large turreted iron-dads are uow undergoing repairs. \\ hen they are finished, evervthina that is needful ot our navy, as now au thorized, will be iu condition for sendee, and with the advance iu the science of torpedo war fare the American navy, comparatively small as it is. will be found at any time powerful for the puruoses of a peaceful nation. Much has also been accomplished during the year iu aid of science and to increase the sum of general knowledge and further the interests of commerce and civilization. Extensive and much-needed soundings have been made for hy drographic purposes and to fix the proper routes of ocean telegraphs. Further surveys of the Darieu Isthmus have been undertaken and completed, and two vessels of the navy are now employed, in conjunction with those of England, France, Ger many and Russia, in observations connected with the transit of Venus, useful and interesting to the scientific world. The estimates for this branch of the public service do not differ materially from those of last year, the general support of the service being somewhat less and those for improvements at various stations rather larger than the corre sponding estimate made a year ago. The regular maintenance and a steady increase in the effi ciency of this most important arm, in proportion to the growth of our maritime intercourse and in terests. are recommended to the attention of Con gress. The use of the navy during peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employment of naval vessels In surveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationali ties on this ' continent, especially the trib utaries of the two great rivers of South America, the Oronoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevents, under existing laws, such explorations, except that expenditures must be made iu such expeditious beyond those usually provided for by the appropriations. The field designated is unquestionably one of inter est. and one capable of a large development of commercial interests, advantageous to the peo ple reached and to those who may establish rela tions with them. EDUCATION AND THE POSTOFFICE. The education of the people entitled to exer cise the right of franchise I regard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so in republics, where neither education nor pre vious condition enters into account iu giving suffrage. Next to the public school, the Post office is the great agent ofeclucatiou over our vast territory. The rapidity with which new sections are being settled, thus increasing the cost of carrying the mails in a more rapid ratio than the increase ot receipts, is not alarming. The re port of the Postmaster-General, herewith at tached, shows that there was an increase of revenue in this department in 1873 over the previous year of $1,674,411, and an increase of the cost of carrying the mails and paying em ployes of $3,041,467.91. The report of the Post master-General gives interesting statistics of his department, and. comparing them with the cor responding statistics of a year ago, shows a growth in every branch of the department. A postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange of postal cards established with Switzerland, and the regotiations pending for several years past with Trance have terminated in a convention with (hat country, which went into effect last August. An International Postal Congress was con vened in Berne, Switzerland, in September last, at wffiich the United States was represented by an officer of the Postoffice Department of much experience and of qualification for the position. A convention for the establishment of an inter national postal union was agreed upou by the delegatee of the countries represented, subject to tho approval of the proper authorities of those countries. I respectfully direct your attention to the report of the Postmaster-General and to his suggestions in regard to an equitable adjustment of the ques tion of compensation to railroads for carrying the mails. THE SOUTHERN STATES. Your attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs in some of the Southern States. On the 14th of September last tffe Gov ernor of Louisiana called upon me, as provided by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid in suppressing domestic violence in that State. This call was made in view of a proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating that he was elected Lientenant-Governor in 1872 and call ing upon the militia of the State to arm, assem ble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated the officers of the State Government. On the next day I issued my proclama tion, commanded the insurgents to dis perse within live days from the date thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession of the State House. I'roops were sent by me to support the existing and recognized State Gov ernment, but before the expiration of the five days the insurrectionary movement was prac tically abandoned, and the officers of the State Government, with some minor exceptions, re sumed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State administration of Louisi ana had been the only government in that State for nearly two years that it had been tacitly acknowledged and acqui eeced in as such by" Congress, and more than once expressly recognized dv me, I regarded it as my clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent its overthrow by an armed mob under pretense of fraud and irregu larity in the election of 1872. I have heretofore called the attention of Congress to this subject, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committed at said election, and because it appeared that the returns thereof were never legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen, but from the beet sources of information at ray command I have always believed the present State officers re ceived a majority of the legal votes actually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my special message of Feb. 13, 1873, that in the event of no action oy Congress I must continue to recognize the government heretofore recogi ized by me. I regret to say that with the preparations for the late elections decided indications appeared in some localities in the Southern States of a de- termination, by acts of violence and intimida tion, to deprive citizens of the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions; bands of men masked and armed made their ap pearance; White Leagues and other societies were formed; large quantities of arms and am munition were Imported and distributed to these organizations; military drills, with men acing demonstrations, were'held, and, with all these, murders enough were committed to spread terror among those whose political action was to be suppressed if possible by these intolerant and criminal proceedings. In some places colored laborers were compelled to vote according to the wishes of their employers, un der threats of a discharge if they acted other wise, and there are too many instances in which, when these threats were disregarded, they were remorselessly executed by those by whom they were made. I understand that the Fifteenth "Amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent this aud the like state of things, and the act of May 31,1870, with the amendments, was passed to enforce its provisions, the object of this being to guarantee to" al! citizens the right to vote aud to protect them in the free enjoyment of that right. Enjoined by the Constitution to take care that the laws be* faithfully executed, and convinced by undoubted evidence that violations of said act had been committed, and that a wide spread and flagrant disregard of it was contem plated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecute the offenders, and troops were sta tioned at convenient points to aid these officers, if necessary, in the performance of their official duties. Complaints are made of this interfer ence by Federal authority, but if the said amendment and act do not provide for such interference under the circumstances as above stated then they are without meaning, force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfran chisement is worse than mockery and iittle bet ter than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it due to truth and justice to" ascertain, by means ol a committee, whether the alleged wrongs to col ored citizens for political purposes are real, or the reports thereof were manufactured for the oc casion. The whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina. Kentucky. Tennes-ee. Arkansas. Mississippi. Maryland, "and Virginia at the time of the electious was 4.082. This em braces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico. Another trouble nas arisen in Arkansas. Ar ticle thirteen of the Constitution of the State, which was adopted in 1868, and upon the ap proval of which by Congress the State was re stored to representation as one of the States of the Union, provides, in effect, that “before any amendments proposed to this Constitu tion shall become a part thereof they shall be passed by two successive Assemblies and then submitted to and ratified by a majority of the electors of the State voting thereon." on May 11, 1874, the Governor convened an extra ses sion of the Genera! Assembly of the State, which, on the ISth of the same’ month, passed an act providing for a convention to frame a new constitution pursuant to this act. and at an election held on the 30th of June. 1874. the convention was approved and delegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of last July and formed anew constitution, the schedule of which provided for the electiou of an entire new set of State officers in a manner con trary to the existing election laws of the State. Ou the 13th of October. 1574, this Constitution, as therein provided. w r as submitted to the people for their approval or rejection, and according to the electiou returns was ap proved by a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon, and at the same election persons were chosen to fill ail the State, county and township offices. The Governor elected in 1812 for the term of four years turned over his office to the Governor chosen under the new Constitu tion, whereupon the Lieutenant-Governor, also elected in 1872 for a term of four years, claiming to act as Governor, alleging that said proceed ings by which the new Constitution was made and anew set of officers elected were unconsti tutional and illegal and void, called upon me. as provided in Section 4, Article 4, of the Constitu tion. to protect the State against domestic vio lence. As Congress is now investigating the political affairs of Arkansas I have declined to interfere. The whole subject of Executive interference with the affairs of a State is re pugnant to public opinion, to the feeling of those who from their official capacity must be used in such interposition, and to him or those wffio must direct. Unless most clearly on the side of law such interference becomes a crime; with the law to support it, it is condemned without a hearing. I desire, therefore, that all necessity for Executive direction in local affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. i invite the attention, not of Congress, but of the people of the United States, to the causes and effects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a disposition on the one side to magnify wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to be'- little and justify them? If public opinion could be directed to a correct survey of what exists, and to rebuking wrong and aiding the proper authori ties in punishing it. a better stale of feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner we would have that peace which would leave the States free indeed to regulate their own domestic affairs. I believe that on the part of the citizens of the Southern States, the’ better part of them, there is a disposition to be law-abiding and to do no violence either to individuals or the laws existing; but do they do right in ig noring the existence' of violence and bloodshed—in resistance to constituted authority? 1 sympathize with their pros trate Condition, and would do all in my power to relieve them, acknowledging that in' some in stances they have had most trying governments to live under,and very oppressive one in the way of taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefits equal to the hardships imposed; but can they proclaim themselves entirely blameless for this condition? They cannot. Violence nas been rampant in some localities, and has further been justified or denied by those who could have prevented it. The theory is raised that there is to be no further interference on the part of the General Govern ment to protect citizens within a State where the State authorities fail to give protection. This is a great mistake. While 1 re main the Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution, including the amendments added thereto, will be enforced with rigor, with but a regret that they should have added one jot or tittle to the Executive duties and powers. Let there bo fairness in the discussion of South ern questions, the advocates of both or all polit ical parties giving honest and truthful reports of occurrences, condemning the wrong and uphold ing the right, and soon all will be well. Under existing circumstances the negro votes the Republican ticket because he knows his friends are of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not' because he agrees with the great principles oi state which separate tne parties, bnt be cause, generally, he is opposed to negro rule. This is a most delusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain, and soon parties will be divided, not ou the color line, but on principles. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interferences. 

JUDICIAL AFFAIRS. The report of the Attorney-General contains valuable recommendations relating to the ad ministration of justice in the courts of the United States, to which 1 invite your attention. I respectfully suggest to Congress the propriety of increasing the number ol the judicial dis tricts in the United States to eleven, the present number being nine, and the creation of two addi tional Judgeships. The territory to be traversed by the Circuit Judges is so great and the business of the courts so steadily increasing that it is growing more and more impossible for them to keep up with the business requiring their atten tion. Whether this would involve the necessity of adding two more Justices of the Supreme Court to the present number 1 submit to the judgment of Congress. THE 

INTERIOR. The attention of Congress is invited to the re port of the Secretary of the Interior and to the legislation asked for by him. The domestic in terests of the people are more intimately con nected with this department than with either of the other departments of the Gov ernment. Its duties have been added to from time to time until they have become so onerous that, without the most perfect system and order, it will be impossible for any Secretary of the Interior to keep trace of ail official transactions having his sanction and done in his name, and for which he is held personally responsible. The policy adopted for the management of In dian affaiys* known as the “peace policy” has been adhered to with the most beneficial results. It is confidently hoped that a few years more will save our frontier from Indian depredations. 1 commend the recommendation of the Sec retary for the extension of the Homestead laws to the Indians, and for some sort of territorial government for the Indian Territory. A great majority of the Indians occu pying this Territory are believed to be incapable of maintaining their rights against the more civ ilized and enlightened white men. Any territorial form of government given |thcm, therefore, should protect them in their homes and property for a period of at least twenty years, and before \ts final adoption should be ratified by a majority of those affected. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, herewith attached, gives much interesting statis tical information, which I abstain from giving an abstract of, but refer you to the report itself. PENSIONS OF THE WAR OF 1812. The act of Congress providing the oath which pensioners must subscribe belore drawing their pensions cuts ofl from this bounty a few survivors of the war of 1812 residing in the Southern States. I recommend the restoration of this bounty to all such. The number of persons whose names would be restored to the list of pensioners is not large. They are all old persons who could have taken no part in the rebellion, and the services for which they were awarded pensions were in defense of the whole country. THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, herewith attached, contains suggestions of much interest to the general public and refers to the approaching Centennial aud the part his department is ready to take in it- I feel that the nation at large is interested in hav ing this Exposition a success, _ and com mend to Congress such action as will secure a greater general interest in it. Already many foreign nations have signified their intention to be represented at it. It may be expected that every civilized nation will be represented. THE CIVIL SERVICE. The rules adopted to improve the civil service of the t-iovernment have been adhered to as closely as has been practicable with the oppo sition with which they meet. The effect of it has been beneficial on the whole and has tended to the elevation of the service; but it is impracticable to maintain them without the di rect and positive support of Congress. Gener ally, the support which this reform receives is from those who give it their support only to find fault when the rules are apparently departed from. Removals from office without preferring charges against parties removed are frequently cited as departures from the rales adopted, and the retention of those against whom charges are made by irresponsible persons aud without good mounds is also often condemned as a vio lation of them. Under these circumstances, therefore, I announce that, if Congress adjourns without positive legislation on the subject of “civil service reform,” I will regard-such ac tion as a disapproval of the system, and will abandon it. Except so far as to require examina tions for certain appointees to determine their fitness, competitive examinations will be aban doned. The gentlemen who have given their without compensation as members of the Board to devise rules and regulations for the govern ment of the country's civil service have shown much zeal and earnestness in their work, and to them, as well as to myself, it will be a source of mortification if it is to be thrown away. But repeat that it is impossible to carry this system to a successful issue without general approval ar.d assistsiflce, and positive law to support it. THE EMPLOYMENT OF LABOR. . t have stated that the elements of prosper nation's capital—labor, skilled and un ssi ied, and products of the soil—still remain with us. To direct the employment of these * a . pro’oiem deserving the' most serious attention of Congress. If eniplovment ? an , given to all labor ofiering prosperity necessarily follows. I have expressed the opinion, and repeat it here, that the first requisite to the accomplish ment ot tills end is the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of a fluctuating value. Tni# secured, there are many interests that might be fostered, to the great profit of both labor and capital. How to induce capital to em ploy labor is the question. CHEAP TRANSPORTATION. The subject ot cheap transportation has occu pied the attention of Congress. New on this question will, without doubt, be given bv the committee appointed bv the last Congress to in vestigate and report upon this subject. THE ocean carrying trade. A revival of ship-building, and particularly of iron steamship building, is of vast importance to our national prosperity. The United Stales is now paying over S I.CM >,OOO per annum lor freights and passage on foreign ships, to be carried abroad and expended in the employment and support of °u people, beyond a fair percentage of what should go to loreigu vessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each respectively. It is to be regretted that this disparity in the carry ing, trade exists, and to correct it I would be willing to see a great departure from the usual course ol the Government in supporting what might usually be termed private enter prise. 1 would not suggest as a rem edy direct subsidy to the American steams nip lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compensation for carrying the mails between the Atlantic seaboard cities and the European Continent on American-owned and American-built steamers, and would extend this liberality to vessels carrying the mails to the South American States and to Central America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific. It might be demanded that vessels built for this service should come up to a stand ard fixed by legislation in tonnage, speed and all other qualities, looking to the possibility of the Government requiring them at some time for war purposes; the right also of taking possession of them in such an emergency should be guarded. I offer these suggestions, believing them worthy of consideration, in all seriousness, affect ing all sections and ail interests alike. Ifanything better can be done to direct the eonntrv into a course of general prosperity, no one will be more ready than I to second the plan. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Forwarded herewith will be found the report of the Commissioners appointed under an act ot Congress, approved June 20, 1874, to wind up the affairs of the District Government. It will be seen from the report that the total debt of the District of Columbia, less securities on hand and available, is: The bonded debt issued prior to July 1, 1874, §8.883,840.43; 3.65 bonds, by act of Congress June 20, 1874. S~-088.16-.73; certificates of the Board of Audit. §4,770,538.45; total. $15.- 742.667.61; less special improvement assess ments chargeable to private property in excess of any demand against such assess ment, $1,014,054.37; less Chesapeake & Ohio Canal bonds, $75,000, and Wash ington & Alexandria Railroai bonds, $. r )9,000; in the hands of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, $1,718,054.17: leaving the actual debt, less said assets, $13,094,61 .24. In ad dition to this there are claims preferred againts the Government of the District amounting in the aggregate, reported by the Board of Audit, to §3.147,787.48. of which the greater part will probably be rejected. This sum can with no more propriety be included in the debt of the District Government than can the thousands of claims against the General Government be in cluded as a portion of the national debt; but the aggregate sum thus stated includes something more than the funded debt chargeable exclusive ly to the District of Columbia. The act of Congress of June 20,1874, contem plates an apportionment between the United States Government and the District of Columbia in respect to the payment of the principal and interest of the 3.65 bonds; there fore, in computing with precision the bonded debt of the District, the aggregate sums above stated, as respects the 3.65 bonds now issued, the outstanding certificates of the Board of Audit, and the unadjusted claims pending before that Board, should be reduced to the extent of the amount to be apportioned to the United States Government in the manner indicated in the act of Congress of June 20, 1874. I especially invite your attention to the recommendation of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund relative to the ambiguity of the act of terest on the District bonds, and the consolida tion of the indebtedness of the District. I feel much indebted to the gentlemen who consented to leave their private affaire and come from a distance to attend to the business of this District, and for the able and satisfactory manner in which it has been conducted. lam sure their services wdll be equally appreciated by the entire country. It will be seen from the accompanying full re port of the Board of Health that the sanitary condition of the District is very satisfactory. In my opinion the District of Columbia should be regarded as the grounds of the National Capital, in which the entire peopie are interested. I do not allude to this to urge generous appro priations to the District, but to draw the atten tion of Congress, in framing a law for the gov ernment of the District, to the magnifi cent scale on which the city was planned by the founders of the Government; the manner in which, for ornamental purposes, the streets and avenues were laid out. and whjl was the pro portion of the property actually possessed by the General Government. I think the proportion of the expenses of the Government and improve ments to be borne by the General Government and the cities of Washington and Georgetown and the country should be carefully and equitably deflned. THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI. In accordance with Sec. 3 of the act ap proved June 23, 1874, I appointed a board to make a survey of the mouth of the Mississippi River, with * a view to determine the best method of obtaining and maintaining a depth of w-ater sufficient for the pur poses of commerce, etc., and in accord ance with an act entitled “An act to provide for the appointment of a Commission of Engineers te investigate and report a plan for the excava tion of the alluvial basin of the Mississippi River subject to inundation,” I appointed a Commission of Engineers. Neither board has yet completed its labors. When their reports are received they will be forw-arded to Congress without delay. (8 ued) D. S. Gkant. Executive Mansion, Dec. 7, 1874. A Wonderful Motor. If Mr. Keeley, of Philadelphia, suc ceeds with his new motor, the transporta tion business of the country will certain ly be revolutionized. What it is re mains a mystery to any but the inventor; but if it be all Mr. Keeley claims for it the scientific world has been in ignorance of a very powerful agent or a most po tent combination of agents already known. He says that with two gallons of water he can generate sufficient force to draw a train of cars from Philadelphia to San Francisco and back, and yet he uses no fuel nor does he employ chem icals of any kind, electricity or magnetic currents. It is surmised that the force must be obtained by the rapid decompo sition of water into its constituent gases, but he denies that he uses any of the customary methods to accomplish that result. In the machine he is now con structing he has developed, he as.serts, a pressure of 7,000 pounds to the square inch; and when it is remembered that the pressure to which steam boilers are subjected is seldom more than 200 pounds to the square inch the enormous leap Mr. Keeley claims to make with his new motor may be partially appreciated. It is plain that should such a powerful servant be added to the resources of man steam engines and much of our present machinery would become antiquated af fairs; coal would lose its importance; mountains could be tunneled or leveled like ant-hills, and in fact all the processes of civilization would be changed; unfor tunately, however, for those who would indulge in roseate anticipations of our commercial future, Mr. Keeley’s ma chine, as he calls it, is still unfinished, and it may be a long time ere his dreams are realized. — Albany (N. Y.) Journal.
