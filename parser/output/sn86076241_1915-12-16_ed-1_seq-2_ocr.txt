Turkey 4ias found it difficult to equip 700,000 men. Only complete Teuton triumph in the Balkans will bring in the full quota of fighting Turks. Premier Asquith's statements in the house of commons giving the exact official figures for Great Britain's forces, and information from French, German and Austrian sources, form the basis of this table of estimates. An increase of 25 per cent is made for Russian and Austrian phisoners. . The estimates of forces still available made by Major Mohrat, the military expert of the Berlin Tageblatt, also have been used. Military critics agree the war must end long before the last line of reserves is called to the front. " . . The Allies now undoubtedly have a preponderance of men at war, and they also have the largest reserves of men. It is also true that they carry much the heaviest burden of expense. oo "MIXING PEANUTS AND POLITICS" . To the several Republican papers of Nevada that can see nothing worth while in President Wilson's recent message to congress a careful perusal of the following, from the Goldfield Tribune, an independent paper, with Republican leanings, is suggested: "No part of the president's recent message was entitled to more credit for the courage and patriotism it required to write it than his reference to the treasonable activities of those who, under the broad charity of our naturalization laws have violated the oath of allegiance and loyalty by which they pledged their lives, if necessary, to support the constitution and the laws of this republic; and strange to say that part of his message, more than any other, has brought to him the criticism of those who would turn his language to political account. "Any attempt to make it appear that this language was aimed at all citizens or even those generally of German or Austrian birth or de scent, will be stamped by the American people as a pusillanimous effort to befog the public mind, for the president distinctly stated that in his opinion these 'creatures of passion' were few, and that their acts had neither approval nor sympathy from the vast majority of those in America born under a flag of the Central Empires or descended from those who were. "Those who are guilty of plottings and spying and of the destruc tion of American industries are worthy of all the denunciation the presi dent gave them, but they are a minor fraction of the foreign-born in this country. While they are a menace, the Tribune "believed and still believes that if the supreme test should come these 'unnaffiliated' and 'unamalgamated elements who have resisted the melting pot of cur Western civilization would run down or run out by the assistance of others who also trace their birth or their ancestry to the very coun tries from which these 'creatures of passion' came." j oo IS 

THERE A CONNECTION? ' The last two or three issues of the Reno Gazette have contained articles decrying and criticizing the methods and purposes of the United States district attorney'9 office in San Francisco in sifting the alleged conspiracy charges against the attaches of the German consular office in that city. Can it be explained Jy the fact that Sam Piatt owns the Gazette and has also been retained as one of counsel for the indicted officials? EXTENDING THE INCOME TAX There will be no difference of opinion with Secretary of the" Treas ury McAdoo that the $112,000,000 in new taxation called for by new pro visions for the national defense can be easily raised from internal sources. As the tariff is now largely on a maximum-revenue basis,' most of the $112,000,000 must be raised from internal sources. How ever opinions differ otherwise, public sentiment will largely favor an extension of the income tax as one item in the scheme. - The secretary's recommendations along this line, according to his report sent to congress, are: 1. Reduce the married person's exemption from $4,000 to $3,000, and the single person's from $3,000 to $2,000. 2. Reduce the figure at which the surtax begins from $20,000 to $10,000. - 3. Increase the rate of tax. ,4. Require Teturns of gross income, that deductions for taxable net may be checked up. 5. Substitute for "collection at source" "information at source." -This last change is as important as any other. It has been repeat edly urged by the World. It will end the hopeless confusion now thrown about the collection of the individual tax through corporations without Daily 'Bfrpeal COUNTY. NEVADA Class at the Postoffice at Carson Congress of March 3. If8 ! affiecting in the least the government's knowledge of individual incomes, j - It? will end a divided and unjust responsibility which only makes for in- i. eiticiencv in tne collection. The rate of tax might perhaps be better left as it is until the machin- , 'ery of collection on the basis of the other changes has been made more perfect. These alone will assure a very large addition to the revenue j from taxes on incomes. New York World. 1 oo NOT AFRAID OF THE SEAMEN'S BILL ; j The. American merchant marine is not driven out of existence. It is ' -expanding at an unprecedented rate. Every ship-yard in the United ' States is rushed with orders from American owners for ocean-going merchant ships. The work already on hand will keep them busy for eighteen months. "It is one of the most remarkable growths I have ever seen in. the business," says H. L. Ferguson, president of the Newport News Ship- Building and Dry-Dock company, in an ' interview in the New York Times. "The tonnage of . American-built ocean going ships is , about ! 1,750,000. There are under construction now more than was ever before in the process of being built at any one time in the history of this country. These ships are better and larger than Ameriian firms havt ordered in the past." At Newport News, on the Delaware, at Fore River and at San " Francisco and Seattle on the Pacific coast the same conditions prevail. Of freight and passenger ships for the deep-sea trade .150 vessels arc actually under -construction. This is the reverse of the story to which the American public is usually asked to listen. . And it proves, as President Ferguson adds, "what Americans will do when they get started." Ladies' Aid Sale The Ladies' Aid of the M.
