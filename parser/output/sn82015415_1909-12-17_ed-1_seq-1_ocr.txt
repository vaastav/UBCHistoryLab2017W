S. SWANLEY FELL SHORT OF EX PECTATIONI. Special Agent A. J. Campbell of the Hawaii Board of Immigration return ed from a six and a half months' ab sence, in the S. S. Alameda this morn ing, his cargo of Portuguese families having preceeded him In the British S. S. Swanley by but three days. Campbell arrived Just in time to hear that he was being criticized as making a failure of the expedition to secure Portuguese families to come to Hawaii to work on the plantations, if they desired such employment. "We could have sent sixteen hundred - from the Azores and Madeira to Hono lulu, had we been willing to take all who offered themselves," said Mr. Campbell this morning, "but those who were picked for, emigration were chosen very carefully, both for physi que "and character. We very carefully eliminated the undesirables. As a matter of fact we had about sixteen hundred Individuals selected and book ed for the exodus, but a largo number backed out, so that less than nine hun- "They backed ouTfo'r various causes; there were numerous and various In fluences brought to bear by friends and relatives and business people to keep them at home. Shopkeepers, for ex- ample, thought' of w"hat effect it would have on their trade to allow them to leave the country; and landed proprle tors bethought themselves as to the result, against their interests, If this exodus was permitted to occur. So, many stories were told to keep Por tuguese at home, and many arguments were used. ihey were told that if they ever came to Hawaii they need never expect to get back to their na tive land; and this was an argument Which Influenced many; for there is a large number of Portuguese who go to the United States, landing at Boston,-, and who leave their families at home and who work a while In tne United States and then return to their people. They like this Idea. There are many Portuguese going to the United States, more than ever berore. "Another inducement which kept people from joining our expedition was that offered by the Brazilian govern ment; many are going to Brazil. "I can assure you, however"; that there are plenty of people willing to ' come here to live and to work; we can get all we want. Our conditions are satisfactory and we were unable to hear anything said against Hawaii or the inducements offered, outside of the objections of those people who were opposed to their countrymen leaving for a foreign country, such as tho matter of distance. I regret that we could not bring more in the one ship ment, but there were people dropping out of the lists all the time, and if. we had waited to fill up the lists we would only have had the experience of still others dropping off. They booked, many of them, and never presented themselves afterward. Algaln, there were many who came Into the lists at the laBt moment. .Many begged and prayed to be taken along, but they were largely of the undesirable class. It would have been easy enough to fill the ship had we been willing to pick men and women from the streets. We could have picked up 250 emigrants at Malta, but the vessel was not char tered to stop there. "I shall have an interesting report to present to the Board of Jmmigration and I believe the showing will provo that the best possible was accomplish ed under the circumstances. "I am much surprised to hear that the local Portuguese, or some or them, have tried to influence their country folk from going to the plantations. 1 do not see why. I should think it 1 would be the other way. All the let ters from Honolulu Portuguese to Por tuguese abroad, as far as I saw or was able to learn, were favorable to these islands. Hawaii is spoken of with the highest praise; In fact I heard nothing but good of these islands wherever 1 went. "I believe that the best way to get the Portuguese to these Islands (and, as I said before, as many as are de sired can be procured), is to bring them here by way of Tehuantepec. This route will prove quicker, eheaper and more satisfactory. Bring them here a few hundred at a time, a lot of them every month. There are plenty of ships in the Atlantic; no special boats would have to be chartered. They would bo landed from the Azores, or from Madeira; or from Portugal (and there are plenty on the mainland, in Portugal), who can be brought here, at Coatzacoalcos and so brought across the Isthmus to be shipped here in ves sels of the Mexican-Oriental line which opens next year. "There is absolutely no doubt, In my mind, but that we can get all tho Por tuguese we want, and I do not think the present experiment shows any thing to the contrary. I shall make certain recommendations to the Board of Immigration In regard to systemat izing the work; and, with the proper system, I believe the Immigration of Portuguese will bo highly successful."
