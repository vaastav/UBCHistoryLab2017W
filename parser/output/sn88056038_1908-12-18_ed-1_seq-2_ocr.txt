The leaders in Congress are very indig nant at the President for the implied in sinuation, in his recent message, that Congressmen and U. S. Senators need looking after by the secret service agents. They have prepared a resolution denounc ing the President for insinuating that all members of their respective bodies are not above reproach. An honest man does not worry about being prosecuted for a robbery or some cither crime, that he did not commit. If the shoe don't fit our Congressmen why do they put it on so readily? If they are above reproach and not corrupt, all the se cret service detectives that the govern ment might employ could not honestly convict or injure them in any way. They must have a skeleton in their closet that they do not want brought to light. Truely may it be said, that "a guilty conscience needs no accuser." But now comes the matter of selecting the one who will be brave enough to defy the "Big Stick" and introduce the pre pared resolution in the House and Senate. They are trying to make a "cat's paw" out of the democratic party by getting some democrat to introduce the measure. We do not doubt but that some of the demodratic members are just as corrupt as some of the republican members, but as the republicans are more numerous in both houses they should take the lead in this matter. Our wise law-makers in Washington are holding many consult i tions, as did the mice in the fable, to se lect the proper person to ' 'tie the bell on the cat." The Reception of the President's Mess&ge by Congress. The receptiou of the last message of President Roosevelt by the republican members of Oougress was what might have been expected from a body com posed largely of representatives of Hie trusts and plutocrats. While the re publican party, daring the last cam paign, pretended to uphold the prin ciples of reform as advocated by Roose velt, the leaders of that party knew that such pretense was only for the purpose of securing votes for their can didates, and that their representatives would defy the "Big Stick" and openly rebel at the authority of Roosevelt at the first opportunity. The masses of the citizens believed tbat Congress j would tint daie to turn down these re form principles, but they will learn soon that nothing good can come out of any political parly that, by a long tenure of office, has placed all the power in the hands of its political bosses. It is our belief that these reforms can never be brought about through republican ad ministration. We believe that Roose velt has honestly and faithfully tried to better the conditions of the couutry ; j in ' J but the money power has been too stiong against him; too many of our Senators and Repre sentatives who have succumbed to the influences of the money kings, be trayed their constituents, and lost all sense of honor or patriotism, for the people to even get relief at their hands. The following from the Idaho States man of Dec. I3i h states the facts about tbe mauuer of the receptiou of the pres ident's message: "The valedictory of President Roose velt was to congress a bore; to the people of this country it w„s an inspira tion. In years to come, when the per sonnel of the law-making body of the Uuited States has been altered, through the kindly intervention of the inevita ble, those who have succeeded will re late how the people, responsive to call to actiun thrice ropeated, and there are in of lii a j u is rose l their majesty nod sliuuted the nation's enemies in high places to obscurity. "If the recent message had been a trainload of ice it could not have pro dueed a more pronounced chill in con gress. Representatives and senators were ready with their overcoats, for they wanted to emphasize unmistak ably the frigidity of its receptiou. They would have no doubt left in the public mind as to their impatience with and their disregard for the man who would call them to aecouut for their mauifest 1 : and manifold shortcomings. So they bundled themselves in their great coats of callousness and sneered—pusillani mous pigmies darting arrows of malice at Jove! "The congress of the United States and particularly the seuate has long been the bulwark of the crushing in terests from whose clutch President Roosevelt wou d release this country. There has been two tliiugs only the majority of the members have been in terested in: Continuation of condi tions that further enrich the rich und keep the others in status quo, aud their re-election. Really, the two proposi tions are so closely related they might be combined. "The president iuvoked what meagre law wus available to curb the operations of predatory wealth ; the congress harup ered him at every poiut, either directly or through efforts to discredit his ad ministration by attacks on his forestry or other policies. The president has attempted to improve the couditiou of labor; the congress pigeonholed beuefi cial measures and enacted, if anything, ones; the president urged in the name of civic decency aud of out raged justice that our court pro cedure be remodeled or that the judges get up ou a higher plaue ; the congress told the ju iges to stay down, aud legal process remained as abortive as before. hor years Free idem Roosevelt has carried on this fight for tho people. Practically bis final official utterance was voiced iu bis congress—and unconstitutional recent message to congress sneered and ! gave it a chilly greeting. * "It may be, thougb, that the chill WHS not selt-iuduced and that the tneer may be likened to the whistle of the boy passing the graveyard. The day of reckomug is coming. The demands of the great majority who find they not get ahead under the state of uffairs cau I present who discover the iu- | orease iu the price of those things they ; bny setting the pace for their wages- | are aroused, aud iu time their voice, and not exclusively the voice of mono- I poloy aud corporal» greed, will be heard ! in the halls of congress iu a majority ; chorus. Walter Wellman, iu the Chicago Rec- ! ord-Herald, says in part asfollsws: t j One of the ablest and most vigorous of all the messages of the president the one Mr. Roosevelt has just sent to congress, ft is the last of bis annual communications to rimj, body and the one of his séries thaï is likily to have the least effect upon legislation.

It marks the beginning of, tbe end of Theodore Roosevelt as head ! of the nation, but it is not tbe eud of ' Rooseveltism. A good pari of Ids work 1 as a reformer is to go on after he has re- ; tired to private life. His era, the epoch 1 Roosevelt "Congress was cold enough iu all con science. It treated the message almost with contemptuousness. The docu ment was read in both houses, but re- ill ceived scant attention, not more thau a dozen of the states , men were ou the floor during the read- ! iug, aud few of those listened- In the house at limes only 17 members were in their places, aud the highest number preseut at any lime was 35 Iu the seuate , n deflators and representatives make little effort to conceal their indifference to the words of tbe pr- sideut. They assume that lii tie or nothing is to be done toward carrying out in law Ins rerommeuda- i| lions. They look upon it as the song of the dyingswau. Then »by should they bother their heads about it? Useless is it to ask senators and representatives what they think of the message. They don't thiuk. Almost invariably they reply with a sneer or a smile: "Haven't read it." "President Roosevelt knew congi would give him scant attention. He knew his raoe was run. He knew his 'friends on the hill'would welcome the opportunity to show their joy over the early coming of escape from his insis tency and his repetitious preaching. » "Mr. Roosevelt did not write his mes sage for them, becange he knew it would there assail chiefly unwilling of deaf ears. He wrote it for the country, for history, for posterity. He wanted to complete the record, to show that to the last his brain and hand, his ener gies, his mastery of the details of our complex government, his desire always for better and higher things, were as keen as ever. "Whatever the congress is or may be in its inertia, its lack of sympathetic leadership, its inevitable heavy hang ing back instead of moving progres sively forward, this man who has dom inated the affairs of a great nation for seven years wished to vindicate his character and hit leadership. As a re former aud doer, he came into public 1 life, as a reformer aud preacher he goes : out.
