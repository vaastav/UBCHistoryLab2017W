I MEETING OF THE BOARD Of TRADE i Amendment to By-Laws Affect ing Directors' Terms. PERSONALITIES EXCHANGED Approval of the Reports of Several Committees. CHARITIES AND CORRECTION Various Bridge Projects in the District?Location of Manufacturing Establishments Here. At a meeting r the 'Washington Board of Trade, list evening, at tne New Willard Hotel an ame ment to the by-laws was adopted, making a member of the board of directors ineligible for re-election for more than two successive * Tins. The result was not achieved, however, until after the close of a discussion into which personalities entered to some extent. The original amendment, which was offered by Mr. D. J. Cal ianun, proviaea inai a memDer or me Doara of directors should be ineligible for re-election after serving one term, but Mr. Callahan accepted an amendment, offered by Mr. John Joy Edson. retting forth that a director may serve two terms before being ineligible for further service. Another amendment to the by-laws,^elating to me dues to be paid by individuals, partners >s and corporations was adopted without debate. The annual reports of a number of committees of the organization were read and some of them discussed. The report of the committee on mercantile interests was recommitted, on motion of Mr. F. I.,. Siddons, in order to allow the members of the board opportunity to consider l^ouse bill 1584ti, dealing with bills of lading. Discussion of the report of the committee on parks and reservations was held over until the next meeting, so that the members may have a chalice to look into the matter of legislation on that sub jcv. i |iriiuin^ uviuic iiic in u uiam lie . ui iiic national legislature. A resolution presented by jur M. I. Weller protesting against the chance of the name of Georgia avenue to Navy Yard avenue and of Brightwood avenue to Georgia avenue was adopted. Rotation in Office. The principal interest of the meeting seemed to center in the amendment offered by Mr. Callahan with respect to the length of service of members of the board of directors. Mr. Callahan explained that there was nothing vicious in his proposition. It was not intended to legislate any individual out of office. There are 700 members of the Board of Trade, he stated, and in order to maintain a healthy and proper spirit in the organization every one of these members should be able to entertain hope to at some time serve on the directorate of the forceful and popular organization. In reply to an argument that the amendment would automatically remove good men from the directorate whose services could not be duplicated, Mr. Callahan said that such was a wrong view to take of the matter, and that just as good men would be elected under the new rule as In the past. Mr. Callahan did riot wish to be captious, he said, but he thought it high time for the organization to separate itself from some of its by-laws and get to work heart and ' soul for the rejuvenation of the national capital. There would be a great deal more activity in the Board of Trade if his amendment prevailed, he insisted, than there ever had been in the past. mi. nriiuciaua ui mt; c?ciMiigLUXi v^inztriia Association said he hopes to see a realization of the Greater Washington ideal, and that no one is more interested than he in the present movement to that end. He is glad a movement is under way to make the city what it should be. He wants to see factories here, and announced that he isn't afraid of smoke. Mr. Henderson explained that he opposed the Callahan amendment because it fettered the Judgment of members of the Board of Trade. Merit of System. "We are not hampered," he said. "We can name whom we want under the present system. This amendment says that you shall not exercise your Judgment in selecting your directorate. That Is not right." Mr. B. H. Warner was glad the amendment had been offered, he said, and thought it would serve a good purpose. When the terms of the ten directors of whom he was one, expired, and the other nine happened to be re-elected, he would feel very much mortified, Mr. Warner added. Under the Cullahan amendment such could not be. The entire ten would go out together. He would work just as hard as a private as he would as a director. He spoke of the board of trade as threatening to fall into a state similar to that of the National Board of Trade, which he characterized as in a condition of innocuous desuetude. Several members objected to the characterization and declared that the National Board of Trade Is getting along In surprisingly good shape. Mr. Warner replied that he was mighty glad to hear it as the only thing he had known the National Board of Trade to do lately was to meet once a year and pass numerous resolutions that most of the members did not understand. Robert N. Harper, who said that he is now serving his second term of three years us a member of the board of directors, announced himself as a firm believer In rotation in office. Views of a Director. "I vote in V lrgima, where the governor rannot succeed himself," he said, "and I organized a concern of which three of the seven directors change every year. It has been successful. The concern started in a small way and is now doing a business of $300,000 a year. I don't say there is an inside clique in the board, but there seems to be a general opinion to that effect. Some members think that under present conditions they have no chance to get on the directorate. If under tiiis amendment they Imagine they have a chance, they will aH put their shoulders to the wheel and work for the board and for Washington. There are just as good men off the board as there are on it." Mr. W. H. Singleton characterized Mr. Callahan's amendment as "cowardly," and insisted that nnder the present by-laws new i ropt nr*a />an Wo nnt (n ii n v <ilnpHnn Tf I Is cowardly, he said, to attempt to wipe out of "office by law ten men who have given good service. He wanted to know why the sponsors of the amendment hadn't the nerve to turn the ten out by the regular procedure. "We win, next time," several members remarked from various parts of the hall. "All right: go ahead and do It," Mr. Singleton answered. Opposed to Personalities. Several members deplored the Introduction of personalities by Mr. Singleton and a number of arguments for and against the amer.Jment were made. After further discussion Mr. Kdson offered his amendment to make members of the board of directors ine'.igible for re-election for more than two sut s??i> tr iv i iu?. ."in itiiti'iiuiucui iu llic amendment offered by B. H. Warner, to delay the effect of the Edson amendment until 11HW was lost. After Mr. Callahan had announced himself satisfied with the Edson proposition, it was adopted. On the suggt-stion of Mr. Warner, chairman of the committee on commerce and manufactures, consideration of the report of that committee was on motion postponed until the next meeting of the board. Th i board approved tile report of the committees on charities and corrections, bridges, membership, press, insurance The report of the committee on membership set forth that the active membership of the board is 720 and that an unusual number of deatlis occurred during the year, eighteen names being removed from the rolls by that cause alone. Durin* th< year forty-Are new members were elected. Be port on Insurance. The report of the committee on insurance, H. Bradley Davidson, chairman, contained the statement that "there is still room foi improvement in the flre department, particularly in those outlying stations where the calls are so Infrequent as to naturally result In a feeling of laxity and security on the part of the men: this can be greatly improved by the perfecting of the system of drills now In use. "The only recommendation that we have to make as to the insurance companies Is an increased care In examining the stability of those companies, particularly those that suffered from the great San Francisco fire. "On the subiect of life insurance we are glad to report a greatly improved condition over that of a year ago for the assured: the limelight has been turned on the great companies, and has resulted in the enactment of laws in the great insurance center. New York, which cannot fail to greatly benefit the assured. Great commissions to agent9 have been cut in half, and rebating to the assured forbidden; while this latter maj seem to him a hardship, it cannot fail to improve the situa tion in general and check the demoralization that was existing. Observance of Laws. "If our department will that the laws under which these companies aje operating are observed, we believe that the assured among us will have nothing to fear either as to the stability of the companies or returns from investment. "Your committee took up with the Commissioner of the District having this matter in charge the subject, of diminution of risks arising from accumulation of waste and from defective electric wiring, and found the Commissioners were fully alive to the importance of this subject and were taking increasing care to reduce those risks to a minimum; all that is required to make these precautions effective is an increase In the number of inspectors, who shall be able to examine the old as well as the new electric wiring, and this need only Congress can supply. It is urged, therefore, that the Board of Trade use Its best efforts to obtain this relief." Charities and Correction. The report of the committee on charities and correction, Walter C. Clephane, chairman, set forth that most of the measures of Importance for which the committee had been striving have passed into history as accomplished facts. "We now have upon our statute books," the report says, "efficient laws authorizing the conversion of alleys into minor streets and the condemnation of insanitary dwellings. The Juvenile Court has been established and your committee believes that it will work a great blessing to the community, particularly if additional probation officers and other increased facilities asked for by the judjfe can be furnished. "The compulsory education bill is now a law. Public sentiment is encouraging the work of those having in charge public playgrounds, and a disposition is being manifested among members of Congress to further the development of these muchneeded adjuncts to upbuilding the physical condition of our children. Generous responses have been made and are being made in furtherance of the plan to afford summer outings to the youth and worn-out 

111ULXIC1 O 111 UUi lUllllllUUH}. JTUUIIU lUllt'IUIS and private citizens are .doing much to aid in checking the spread of consumption. Our people are beugming better informed as to the splendid facilities afforded for dispensing charity through the efficient systems in vogue in the organization known as the Associated Charities. The poor are being assisted to prosecute and defend their rights without an undue burden of expense, through the Legal Aid Society and the Prisoners' Aid Society. All of these are matters upon which the community is to be congratulated. Measures That Demand Attention. "The following measures, however, to the accomplishment of which your board has committed itself, still demand the earnest attention of the citizens of the District of Columbia. "Your board has heretofore approved the I enactment of a law forbidding children under the age of tifteen years to be upon the streets unaccompanied by an adult late ! at night, and prohibiting the sending of any child under that age into any disreputable house. "A bill having these objects in view has been framed and its passage urged upon Congress, but so far without success. "The District of Columbia finds itself behind certain other communities in that there is no statutory power vested in our criminal judges to discharge prisoners on probation upon committing their first offense. Your board has approved the enactment of such a 11 w. "Your committee has several times called to the attention of this board certain conditions prevailing at the jail and workhouse, and in the report submitted two years ago, your committee recommended and the board approved the following measures to relieve the existing situation at the jail, to wit: A dining room where prisoners may be served with food as It should be served to human beings. Instead of having them fed as animals are fed. as must be done under the present inadequate arrangement of the building. Sanitary toilet arrangements. Opportunities for bath Ing. l our committee earnestly repeats these three recommendations. Prisoners Who Are "Bepeaters." "The records of the District jail show that 75 per cent of the prisoners are 'repeaters,' which indicates that imprisonment without employment is not reformatory in its tendency, and that a life of idleness, with good shelter and abundant food at the public expense, promotes crime. It is said that the average convict does not know any trade and is not drilled in any kind of labor. We, therefore, recommend that an appropriation be asked to teach trades of different kinds to prisoners in our Jail, and that all prisoners be required to rin some snerifie work. "Experience in work among the criminal classes has demonstrated the wisdom Oi departing from the old method of treating as criminals men who have fallen victims to the drink habit. Your committee recommends that provision should be made for establishing a hospital or asylum to which some of these unfortunates may be sent for the purpose of receiving intelligent treatment and help toward making them more useful citizens." Bridge Projects in the District. The report of the committee on bridges, Mr. A. M. Lothrop chairman, takes up in detail the various bridge projects in the District of Columbia. The report says, in part: "Congress will be asked to appropriate $36,000 at this session for the permanent improvement of the approaches to the bridge across Rock Creek valley on the line of Connecticut avenue. "Congress will also be asked to appropriate money for the purpose of purchasing certain ground abutting Connecticut avenue ^ ^ * l,? I ?l. ui iugc in uiuci iu j^icaci vc lire gcuciai paitvlandscape effect necessary to comport with the dignity of the structure and thoroughfare of which the bridge is a part. The site of the present bridge is very picturesque and properly part of the park system of the District of Columbia. Zoological Park now begins just a few feet east of the bri?__e. The appearance of most of the bridges ol the District of Columbia, and In fact of the country at large, has been sacrificed entirely to the utilitarian point of view, and it appears that there is no logical reason for disregarding the appearance of city bridges, any more than we would public buildings and other public structures. "Four piei . of the new Anacostia bridge are now practically complete, representing an expenditure of $130,000 and leaving a balance in the appropriation for this work of $243,000. i iti>Aee PinAv Di>awnVi TToIIay* n * * n"*-" w hhvj . "The Piney branch bridge, which will carry 16th street acrbss Plney branch valley, is now about one-half complete, and it is thought that it will be finished about January 1. 190T. "Three more timber bridges in the countj are being replaced by concrete ones, th? cost of which will approximately be $3,500, "A contract has been made for the construction of a new bridge on the line ol K street, crossing Hock creek and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. The contract price for this bridge is $32,500, and the wort will be completed by June 1. 1907. It ii going to be made exceptionally heavy, s< as to carry the heaviest traffic. "The bridge across Washington channel, which will cost about $100,000, is about one-half complete. This bridge will consist of three concrete steel, ftfty-foot arches. It is of an ornamental type anc > in accordance with the general park project in this vicinity. "The concrete steel bride* on the lino of New fork avenue, which will carry th* , | sidewalks and roadway across we ?aiumore and Ohio tracks, and which will cost about >360.000. Is about two-thirds complete. The committee reports that at the pres! ent time no decided movement has been made toward the construction of the Memorial bridge, but it is thought that the almost universal sentiment in favor of this bridge will lead Congress to make an appropriation for the construction of the , same." Parks and Reservations. The report of the committee on parks and , reservations, which .will be considered further at the next meeting, says that the pressure of citizens of all parts of the District was so great that the committee found it difficult to bring before the committees i of Congress any proposition which they would consider, "they advising us that we must confine ourselves to a more moderate demand. "It was Anally concluded that our request be incorporated in a bill under the House | committee on public buildings and grounds and bill No. 385 was settled upon. "Afterward a special committee consisting of three senators, chosen by the Vice President, and three members by the Speaker of the House, was appointed, i they to report their conclusions to the Congress at the commencement of the second session of the Fifty-ninth Congress. "It would seem that when nearly every city of any importance in the United States . is making such strenuous efforts to obtain ! breathing space in the way of parks and 1 reservations that the national capital j should not be beehind in this matter. i "Wa havp pnnH hnnps thsit a fnrnrahlp rft- 1 port will be made, and if so, we will then take up the question for other portions of the. District during the coming year." There was considerable discussion of that portion of the,bill which has to do with the levying and benefit of assessments, but the ! board did not commit itself and the matter will be gone into at greater length at the 1 ftext meeting.

RUSSIA AND THE DUMA. Lecture Before the Geographic Society by Wm. E. Curtis. "Russia and the Duma" was the subject of an interesting lecture delivered by William E. Curtis, the prominent Washington correspondent and lecturer, before the Geographic Society at National Rifles' Armory last night. Mr. Curtis defined the good and bad characteristics of the czar, the Russian people and the organization and didssolution of the duma, the members of which, he said, wasted time discussing unprofitable t * t nn/1 nrora (n tnn hi<r a hnrrv t rt auu " V - V- ... stamp out autocracy. During their session of 113 days they succeeded in passing only one bill; but it was a most important one? that of abolishing the death penalty. Mr. Curtis firmly believes that when a new duma is elected, which will be in a few months from now, and reasonable and responsible representatives are chosen, they will accomplish some great reforms. He said to appreciate the present crisis in Russia it is necessary to know that out of a population of 140,000.000 three-fourths are unable to read or write and willing to follow any leader who will promise to better their condition. They have fantastic ideas of liberty, and when aroused they arg a more dangerous class of citizens than those who carried on the French revolution. The question of land is the most Important issue at stake. The Russians, he said, know nothing of politics or constitutions or anything else, except that they need land and liberty. According to the way in which the land Is divided now each peasant has only three and one-half acres, and, according to Mr. Curtis, they need | twice that much to live properly. He said there has been a rapid improvement in education in Russia, but, unfortunately, education has done more harm than good. It has only created more socialism, he declared, as the majority of the teachers are rank revolutionists and socialists. Mr. Curtis stated that the czar was not unreasonable when he ordered the duma dissolved. The members, who represented a great variety of persons of all grades and classes of society and intelligence, not only wasted their time, but indulged in the most disgraceful attacks upon the czar and his ministers. They were led by sank radicals, whose one aim was to change the form of government from an autocratic one to a republic at once. This change, according to Mr. Curtis, could have been probably accomplished by degrees, but never in the manner the radicals planned. Since the body was dissolved one member has been murdered, two beaten almost to death, two have gone crazy, thirty banished and many others imprisoned. Those who were either killed or wounded were the victims of their own constituents, whom they had promised great reforms. Hillsdale Citizens' Association Meets. The Hillsdale Citizens' Association at its last meeting indulged in a discussion of the dedication by property owners of the land necessary to enlarge the streets and add to the sidewalks. Arthur W. Craig, ' the chairman of the committee on streets, made an explanation of what has been accomplished toward ascertaining the wishes ' of the owners of the property in the matter. He stated no difficulty was anticipated in having the land deeded to the District. President Anderson reported that the Dis' trict was having maps made of the Hills; dale section for the signature of those property owners who had agreed to the proposition. Mr. Anderson stated one street will be taken up at a time, and he understood Sheridan avenue will be the first highway 1 along which the property owners will be visited. He said the maps would be ready ' in January. W. S. Montgomery, assistant ' superintendent in charge of colored schools, made an address. He spoke of the value of citizens' associations. The speaker promised to aid the association all he could In securlitg for the town next year a school for elementary cooking, carpenter work and ' sewing. Miss J. F. Smith, the principal of . the Birney public school, on Nichols avei nue, Hillsdale, expressed the hope that the plans of the association relating to the streets of Hillsdale would be successful. A communication was read from W. W. Con' nor, secretary of the board of education, tn s reply to the petition forwarded by the association requesting; the establishment of a night school in the Birney building for the benefit of the residents of Hillsdale, stat' ing the subiect had ben ordered referred to the superintendent for his action. i Dredging Hampton Roads.

NEED FUEL BADLY. Coal Shortage in the Northwest Menace to Life. MINNEAPOLIS, December 15.?With the cold-wave signal flying, the coal shortage In the northwest becomes not oniy a cause ui severe suffering, but an absolute menace to human life. Glenburn, N. D., is seriously considering an appeal to the governors of North Dakota and Minnesota to employ the state military In forcing the moving of coal trains. Eveleth, Minn., faces darkness and suffering through deprivation of coal, and apprehensive reports have come from numerous other places. The Glenburn situation is summed up in a statement from the Glenburn Commercial Club, as follows: "The dealers wire us that the situation is entirely up to the railroads, as shippers are unable to obtain cars to load with coal. Today we will wire Gov. Searles requesting him to take up the matter with Gov. Johnson of Minnesota and if necessary call out the militia of the two states to run coal trains. "The situation all through this section is desperate, and, with the liability of blizniQnv HlflV frf?P7P tf? death if fuel is not available soon. Farmers are already coming to town with reports of burning sheds and other outhouses for fuel. We have notified the farmers that if the worst comes they can bring their families and bedding and camp in our .ourroom brick school house. We nave sufficient coal to heat the building for three j months at least, and it will go farther in , this way than it would if distributed among . those who are out of coal, as it would not . make a bushel each. , "We will also wire our senators at , Washington today asking their interest . with the federal government. We cannot put our words strong enough to convey to , you the importance of getting railroads to j haul special trains of coal into the section < that is suffering. Lignite is unavailable, , as the same handicap is met there. We teleDhoned the Burlington mines and asked ; if they could not let us have five cars If we sent men there to load them. They replied they were sixty cars or more bark in orders and could not obtain cars to load. * armers cannot go to the mines and haul more than 1,000 to 1,200 pounds, as the roads are almost impassable." GOULD IN GREAT STORM. t His Yacht Atalanta Weathered a Heavy Gulf Hurricane. NEW YORK, December 15.?It was only after George J. Gould, Mrs. Gould and their guests had left the yacht Atalanta, after her arrival in port yesterday, that the story came out that this costly yacht had passed through a tremendous storm in the Gulf stream. Capt. Tod said it was only by the grace of God and good luck that Mr. and Mrs. Gould and their guests reached New York in safety. T The Atalanta left Southampton for Ham- j ilton, Bermuda, November 19. During the t trip there was rough weather all the way t and two lifeboats were smashed. At Ham- c ilton Mr. and Mrs. Gould and four guests got on board and the yacht started for New York. Everything went well for twenty-four hours, and then came the Gulf stream and 3 trouble. The wind set in from the northeast and seas came tumbling down on the yacht like avalanches. Mr. Gould, clad in oilskins, stood on the bridge with Capt. ^ Tod. , "I want to see how she'll stand the racket," he said-to Capt. Tod. Twice the bridge was swept by icy water, i but each time Mr. Gould and the captain j seized the rails, ducked their heads and the waves rolled away to leeward without doing damage to anything more than the c HppU fittlnp's Mrs. Gould and her guests remained in , the drawing room of the yacht and did not , seem to feel.they were In danger. "She's the greatest sea boat afloat," said 1 Capt. Tod today. - j The Atalanta is a magnificent sea-going ship, and her fittings are probably the most expensive of any craft afloat. The main 1 dining room is furnished in mahogany, with l a ricli red carpet and dark red curtains over i the stained glass windows. A solid silver r punch bowl adorns the sideboard, and by Its side are a dozen cut-glass goblets which 1 were presented to Mr. Gould by the German s emperor. Mr. and Mrs. Gould's private rooms are the most elaborate which have ever been ; conceived on an ocean-going vessel. The * bed room, which is finished in quartered : oak. Is nearly twenty feet square. Two : brass beds occupy the center of the room * and bath rooms open from either side. Just c aft of this is Mr. Gould's boudoir, which contains an open fireplace and is richly upholstered in silk. The Atalanta carries a crew or nearly 1 100 men, 21 of whom are in the engineer's * department. She has two steam launches and one propelled by electricity. Mr. and Mrs. Gould expect to leave New York on the yacht next week for a winter cruise in Florida. OFFICIAL BOARD MEETS. Affairs of Maryland House of Correction Under Consideration. Special Correspondence of The Star. HYATTSVILLE, December 14, 1908. Gov. Warfield presided at the meeting of the managers of the Maryland house of correction, held yesterday at Jessups. Dr. Charles A. Wells of this place, treasurer of the Institution, was also present. The most Important matter engaging the attention of the managers was the employment of Inmates on the work of constructing the boulevard between Washington and Baltimore. After considerable discussion It was decided to detail a squad of prisoners to this work. State Engineer W. W. Crosby requested the detail of ten men to begin work January 1. c One of the features of the law making ap- i propriation for the construction of the ( boulevard is that the labor shall be secured . from the house of correction, but this pro- 1 vision has not been strictly observed for 1 the reason that an ODinion rendered bv At tor nay General Bryan was not exactly t clear as to the power of the legislature to ? make such a demand.
