EDITION ! " ' ' Today JR. R. Stocks Jump. Well They May Jump. Public Indignation Will Jump Also. New Haven Eailroad stock jumped nicely yesterday. Sock Island jumped also. Shareholders in these two companies have been robbed in the most artistic manner by railroad "management." Long ago honest, disheartened stockholders sold out. Stocks of these railroads that have been ezpldited, robbed, and gutted by private ownership are suddenly put up in price by the Wall Street gamblers. Do you ask why? Because it is proposed to turn over public money to the railroads, lending them the public's cash, increasing the rate that the public pays, GUARANTEEING PROFIT ON RAS CALLY MISMANAGEMENT. Is this proposition going through as a "war measure?" If it does go through, then any kind of public thieving should thrive in the name of war. The railroads are running at full capacity. Their re ceipts are gigantic. They have shown themselves incompetent and inefficient. U. S. MUNITIONS SHIP RAMMED AND EXPLODES AT HALIFAX; HUNDREDS KILLED AND INJURED Gin SHATTERED BY BUST IS NOW IN FLAMES Why should the public be taxed to lend money to these private railroad owners and their roads, made bankrupt by dishonesty or inefficiency? Why should the public be taxed again to increase the high rate already paid for freight and passengers? And why should the public be taxed to guarantee divi dends on watered stock and on bonds of which the underlying vaiue nas Been stolen? The Government should take over the railroads, of course commandeering them, as the Government has com mandeered ships, human lives, and other things needed. The Government should take the roads and pay at its leisure what they are WORTH not a dollar 'more, regard less of the watered stocks and the watered bonds issued. It is easy to print stocks and bonds. It ought NOT to be easy to make the public pay for the work of the printing press more than the printed paper is worth.. The Government calls a MAN, takes his life and doe3 not guarantee him profit on the business that he is, com-, pelled to leave behind him. The GovernmentymonopoliziBg, as it must and should .do, steel and coal,"will crrpplexnr nrinthoiuds -of Individual manufacturers and perhaps entire industries. But It does not guarantee profits or make loans at public expense to such in dividuals or industries. Why this tender sympathy for RAILROADS, and rail road stocks, and for the very rich men that have bought stocks after dishonest mismanagement had put the prices low? If Congress has money left to spend on sympathy, let the money be given to the thousands of women of New England that were made poor by the thieves that looted the New Haven road. Some of these prosperous thieves are now con spicuous as patriots, riding around in private cars ONE CAR FOR ONE MAN while the little business man can't get a freight car for his product or his coal. Some of these patriot railroad thieves are basking in public favor because they buy Liberty bonds with money stolen from the estates and families of honest men, or because they give a small percentage of their stealing to the Red Cross or the Y. M. C. A. They are conspicuous in Washington; they presume to advise the Government what to do and how to do it. We give them full credit for their cunning and their suc cess, but there ought to be a limit to the success, and there will be a limit. You hear that it is proposed, as a measure of economy, to cut twenty-five millions from the pay of honest servants of the Government, from overworked and underpaid clerks in the departments, from letter carriers, burdened with heavy load of wartime; from mail clerks deprived of rest, ex hausted by long hours. And at the same time comes the official suggestion that railroad incompetency, inefficiency, mismanagement, and dis honesty be rewarded with increased freight and passenger rates, huge Government loans, taken by taxation out of the pockets of heavily taxed citizen, and profits on watered se curities guaranteed by the public. This is, indeed, delightful impertinence. Public servants, faithful, efficient and underpaid, already impoverished by the increased cost of living and the dimin ished value of the dollar, are to have their pay reduced. Incompetent and dishonest railroads are to receive in loans to rebuild their neglected property money taken from the taxpayers' pockets and upon their incompetency, dis honesty and mismanagement the public pocket is to guar antee dividends. If this goes through, the pickpocket and the forger, the slacker and he defaulter should form themselves into an army, march on the Capitol and say, "This is war and we need money; please lend us what we want and guarantee us a profit on our professional activities," The nation should not put a dollar into a railroad unless the nation is permanently TO OWN that railroad. The nation which does not guarantee the honest farmer a profit on his farm or to the honest business man a profit on his business has no right to guarantee any profit to the notori- .(Continued on Page 2, Column 4., ' Scenes About Halifax, and Harbor, Where Munition Ship Exploded This Morning :ll rzrji'ir'rcAT " m,j ji, it ' . j?j At-ifMKSseMKrivsai jH- -p jar Vji PfililHHPi o''j3'e7iSaBMsnPB52s5BsBsBsBsl " sBsBsw'aMBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBVsVT't - e- vm.jj2tSv i3&EKE&&L33kM&&&E25EKKU MESSAGE AIDS JEAGtiOVE IN AUSTRIA GENERAL VIEW OF HALIFAX.

President Wilson's message to Congress, unlike any previous com munication that Washington has ever known, remains even today as live a topic of discussion as if this were the day of delivery. The more it is studied, the more It Is digested, the more it Is explained In quarters where Information from abroad, not accessible to the public. Is received, the more does the ad dress appear to have been designed, not for Its effect on the American people for their confidence In the President is unswerving but for Its Influence In Europe. To All Belligerents. The United States, In other words, haa sent a communication to all bel ligerents, enemy as well as ally, and therefore. Instead ol employing tne free style of expression, explicit and direct In purpose, the President con fined himself to the Implicit, indirect. but nevertheless powerful force of diplomatic phraseology. viewed as a diplomatic document, there were those familiar with the In ternal situation In the dual monarchy who believed the President's message was a constructive step toward peace, something which, notwithstanding the Inclusion of a formal declaration of war would give new Impetus to the rrowlng peace movement In Austria and Hungary. Anstrlana Want reaee. The peoples of the dual monarchy. all renorts agree, are sick and tired of the war. They have been pressing for peace, but tneir i.erman mentors and their own .militaristic leaders have argued that the entente allies planned a dismemberment of the em pire, and that only national unity aaralnit an Imperialistic foe could save their trade and resources from destruction. Particularly has tne Austrian gov ernment pointed In this respect to the Italian effort to obtain Trieste some thing which the allies by Inference heretofore have been in the position of approving. But Mr. Wilson argues specincaiiy for "assured and unmolested access" (Continued on Page 20 Column 2.) bBbBbBbBbvBbBbhbBbBbesbBbBbyS $ zir IfiUpllH attBfttSB'9aVpaBniB sflLi.lJirSBBBBBfc tJ.'f'sH bbbbbKbbbIBBBSsBBBBBBbIe t tBft tSVuiiBBBBBBBBSBBBBBBBS'.SsBBKBlH BBf-"TMBBBBBT & KSBbI THE
