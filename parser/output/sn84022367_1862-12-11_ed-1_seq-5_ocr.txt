A presentation of the general condition of the treasury and the important statistics were embodied in the President's message; and the plan of Secretary Chase for maintaining the credit of the Government, was also briefly argued by the President. Secretary Chase's report is very lengthy, and our space will permit of our giving only the following abstract : , ' - 

ESTIMATES OF THE DEBT. , SSThe estimated wants of the treasury for the year ending on the 30th of June, 1862, were exceeded by the actual expenditures. They were based on estimates for an army of 300, 000 men, and for a naval force quite inconsid erable in comparison with that found after ward indispensable. Congress increased the army to 500,000, in addition to special corps num benng over 50,000. In consequence of this, the estimates for July required correc tion in December. For the reason that the President has callei an add tiona; force of (500,000 men, the estimates for the current fis cal year must "prove inadequate. Themcrease of debt did not, however, exceed the Decem ber citlnuie. Ou tlie contrary, while the esti mate sntK"p!tH a public, debt on the 30th June, 1832, of 317,372,802 93, Its actual amount on tlmt tiay was -314,211,371 92. But the estimate of the debt on the 1st of Jrly, 18G3, must now 1 advanced, in view of the uiMjw.iMii inermn of expenditures, authoris ed and incurred, or likely to be incurred, to 1,122,7,403 24; anion the supposition Dial the war may be continued with, undimin ished disbursements until the lt of July, 1804, the debt likely to have beta then in- umddnust tie estimated at 5l,744,6315b0,- 80. . , .
