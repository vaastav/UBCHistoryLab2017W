THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN cnAPTER xni. The Watcber and. the Warde* THERE was a custom of Canaan, time-worn and seldom honored In the breach, which put Ariel that afternoon in easy possession of a coign of vantage commanding the front gate. The heavy B«nday dinner was finished in silence (on the part of Judge Pike, deafening) about 3 o'clock. and, soon after. Mamie tossed a number ' of cushions out upon the stoop between the castlren dogt— Sam warden having previously covered the steps with a rug and placed several garden chairs near by on the grass. These simple prepara tions concluded. Eugene sprawled com fortably upon the rug. and Mamie seated herself near him. while Ariel wandered with apparent almlessness about the lawn, followed by the gaze of Mr. Bantrr. until Mice Pike begged her. a little petulantly, to join them. She came, looking about her dreamily, and touching to her lips now and then with absent air a clover blossom she had found in the longer grass against the fence. She stopped to pat the neck of one of the cutiren deer, and with grave eyes proffered the clover top first for inspection, then for food. There were those in the world who. seeing her, might have wondered that the <3eer did not play Galatea and come to life. "No?" she said aloud to the steadfast head. "You won't? What a mistake to be made of castlronV She smiled end nodfied to a clump ot lilac bushes near a cedar tree and to nothing else— »o far as Eugene and Mamie could sees — then walked thoughtfully to the steps. •Who In the world were you speaking to?" asked Mamie, curiously. •That deer." "But yt>u bowed to some one. "Oh. that" Ariel lifted her eyebrows— •that was jour father. Didn't you ccc "I believe you, can't from here, after all" said Ariel, slowly. "He is sitting upon a rustic bench between the bushes and the cedar tree, quite near the gate. No, you couldn't see him from here; you'd bave to. go as far as the deer, kt least, and even th«:n you might not notice him. unless >ou looked for him. He has & book— a Bible, I think— but I don't think lie is reading." "He usually takes a nap en Sunday afternoon," said Mamie. "I don't think lio will today." Ariel looked at Eugene, who avoided her clear gaze. "He hts the air of having settled himself to stay for a long time, perhaps until evening." Fhe had put on her hat after dinner, and Mamie now inquired if she would xiot prefer to remove it. offering to carry it Indoors for her. to Ariel's room to Insure Its safety. "You look so «ort of temporary, wearing it, she urged, "as if you were only here for «. little while, it's the loveliest hat I ever caw. and so fragile, too, but I'll take care — " • Ariel laughed, leaned over, and touched the others hand lightly. "It isn't that, dear." -- "What is it, then?" Mamie beamed oat Into a joyful smile. She had felt sure that ehe could not understand Ariel: was, Indeed, afraid of her; and found* herself astonishingly pleased to be called "dear." and delighted with the little familiarity of the hand tap. Her feeling toward the visitor <srho was, so her father had announced, to become a permanent member of the' household) bad been," until now, un defined. She had been on her guard, \u25a0watching for some sign of conscious "superiority" in tMs lady who had been bo long over-etas, not knowing what to make of her; though thrown, by the contents of her trunks, into a jristful ness which would have had something of rapture in It had she been sure that she was going to like Ariel. She had gone to the latter's room before church, and had perceived uneasily that it had become, even by the process of un packing, the prettiest room she had «ver seen. Mrs. Warden, wife of Sam, end handmaiden of the mansion, was ' assisting, alternately faint and vocif erous with marveling. Mamie feared that Ariel might be a little overpow ering. With the word "dear" (that is, of course, with the way it was spoken), end with the touch upon the hafld, it •was all suddenly settled: ehe would not understand Ariel always — tliat was dear — but they would like each other. "I am wearing my hat." answered • Ariel, "because at , any moment I may decide to go for a lone walk!" ' "Ob, I hope not." said Mamie. "There ere sure to be people: a few still come, vren though I'm en onsased girl. I expect that'R just to console me. though," ehe added, smiling over this > trorn quip, of the betrothed 1 and shak ing her head at Eugene, who grew red and coughed. "There'll be plenty to \u25a0day. but they won't be here to see me. It's you. Ariel, and they'd be terribly disappointed if you v.eren't here. I shouldn't wonder if the whole town came; it's curious enough about you!" Canaan fat least that part of It "which Mamie meant when the said "ther whole town") already offered testi mony to her truthfulness. Two gentle men, aged 9 and 111 and clad in white "sailor suits," were at that moment grooving their checks between the round pickets of the gate. They had corae.from the house across the street, -evidently stimulated by the conversa tion at their own recent dinner table ./they wore s» few deposits such as. are left by chocolate cake), and the motive of their conduct brcame obvious when, upon being joined by a person from next door (a starched and frilled per .. eon of the opposite sex but sympa thetic age), one of them waggled a forefinger through the gate at Ariel and a voice was heard in explanation: -"That's her." ; There was a rustle in the lilac bushes iiear the cedar tree: the three small beads turned simultaneously in ,that "direction; somethlnr terrific was'evi dently seen, and with a horrified ."Ooob!" the trio skedaddled headlong. They were but the gay vanguard of 'Die life which the street, quite dead through the Sunday dinner hour, pres ently took on. Young couples with their progeny began to appear, returning p from the weekly reunion Sunday dinner •with relatives; young people medita tive (until they reached the Pike tnan *sion), the wives fanning themselves or shooing the tots-able-to-walk ahead 'of them, while the husbands, wearing long coats, satin ties and showing dust upon their blazing shoes, invariably pushed the perambulators. Most of .theie passers-by exchanged greetings with Mamie and Eugene, and; all of .'them looked hard at Ariel as long as ft was possible. . 'And now the young men of the town, laboriously arranged as to apparel, be sjran to appear on the street in. small "squads, making their Sunday rounds: the youngest working in phalanxes of threes and fours, those somewhat older Inclining to move in pairs; the eldest, . isuch as/were now beginning. to be con sidered middle-aged beaux, or (by the "extremely youthful) "old bachelors,** evidently considered it advantageous to "travel alone. Of all these there, were !~,few who' did not, before' evening: fell, turn In at the 1 gate of th* Pike roaa- \u25a0ton. Coincloualy, shyly or confident ly, according to the condition of their fcouK they made their way between the cast-Iron deer to be presented to the visitor; sat at the top ot the steps and, looking amiably evei 1 thelf heads, talked with such as eotild get near her. There Were roan/ who could not# and Mamie, occupylny the bench below, was surrounded by tho overflow. Tho difficulty ©f r«acbtag and main taining: a position near Mis* Tabpr Wat Increased by tho attitude and behavior of Mr. Flitcroft, who that day cooled the feeling of . friendship which several of his fellow«townsmen had hitherto entertained for him. Ho had been the Qrst to arrive, coming alone, though that was not his custom,* and he established himself at Ariel's right, upon the step just below h>r, co dis posing the great body and the ponder ous arms and legs the gods had given him that no one could mount above him to elt beside her, or approach her from that direction within conversational distance. Once established, he was not to be dislodged, and the only satisfac tion for thoee in this manner debarred -from the society of the beautiful stranger was obtained when they were presented to her and when they took their departure. On these occasions It was necessary by custom for them to shake her hand, a ceremony they ac complished by leaning across Mr. Flit croft. which was a long way to lean, and the fat back and ehoulders were core that night because of what had been surreptitiously done to them by revengeful elbows and knees. Norbert, not ordinarily talkative, had nothing to say; he seemed to find suffi cient occupation in keeping the place he had gained: and from this close van tage he fastened his small eyes im movably upon Ariel's profile. Eugene, also apparently determined not to move, sat throughout the afternoon at her left, but as he was thin, others, who came and went, were able to approach upon that side and hold speech with her. She was a stranger to these young people, most of wl om had grown up to gether in a nicknanip intimacy. Few of them had more than a very Imperfect recollection of her as she was before Roger Tabor and she had departed out of Canaan. She had lived her girlhood only upon their borderland.. with no in timates save her grandfather and Joe; and she returned to her native town ' a revelation and a dream." as young Mr. Bradb jry told his incredulous grand mother that night. The eonvere*tlon of the gallants con sisted, for the greater part, of witti cisms at one another's expense, wlilc.i. though evoked for Arlel's-benefit (all eyes furtively reverting to her as each shaft was loosed), she found more or l«ss enigmatical. The young men. how ever, laughed at each other loudly, and seemed content if now and then she smiled. "You must be frightfully en nuled with all this," Eugene said to her. "You see how provincial we still are. She did not answer: she had not heard him. The shadows were stretch ing themselves over the grass, long and attenuated; the sun light upon the trees and houses was like a thin, rosy pigment; black birds were calling each other home to beech and elm; and Artel's eyes were fixed upon the western distance of the utreet where golddust was beginning to quiver In the air. She did not hear Eugene, but she started a moment later when the name "Joe Louden" 'was pronounced by a young man. the poetic Bradbury, on the step below Eugene. Some one immediately eald "Sh! 1 But she leaned over and addressed Mr.- Bradbury, who. shut out, not only from the group about her, but from the other centring upon Mies Pike, as well, was holding a - private conversation with a friend in like misfortune. "Whatwere you saying of Mr. Lou den?" she asked, smiling down upon the young man. (It was this smile which inspired his. description of her as "a revelation and a dream.") S "Oh. nothing particular," was his em barrassed reply. "I only mentioned I'd heard there was some talk among the \u2666• He paused awkwardly, remem bering that Ariel had walked with Joseph Louden in the face of Canaan that very day. "That is, I mean to say. there's some talk of his running for Mayor." "What?" '\u25a0 ! - There was a general exclamation, fol lowed by an uncomfortable moment or two of silence. No onepresent was un aware of that noon walk, though there was prevalent a pleasing notion that It would not happen again, founded on the idea that Ariel, having only ar rived the previous evening, had prob ably met Joe on the street by acci dent, and. remembering him as a play mate of her childhood and uninformed as to his reputation, had, - naturally enough, permitted him to walk home with her, Mr. Flitcroft broke the silence, rush ing into words with a derisive laugh: "Yes. he's 'talked or for Mayor — by. the. saloon people and the niggers! I ex pect the Beaver Beach crowd would be for h!m. and If tramps could vote he might — " "What la Beaver Beach?" asked Ariel, not turning. "What is Beaver Beach?" he repeated, and cast his eyes- to the sky, shaking his head, awesomely. "It's a place," he said, with abysmal solemnity — "a place I shouldn't have mentioned in your presence. Miss Tabor." '"What has it to do with Mr. Louden?" The predestined Norbert conceived the present to be a heaven-sent oppor tunity to enlighten her concerning Joe's character, since the Pikes appeared to have been derelict in the performance of this kindness. "He goes there"' he proceeded, heav ily. "He lived there for a ' while when lie first came back from run ning away, and he's a friend of Mike Sheehan's that runs it: he's a friend of all the rifC-raft # that hang around there." "How do you know he goes there?" "Why, It was In the paper the day after he came back!" He appealed for corroboration. "Wasn't It, Eugene?*' "No, no!" she persisted. "Newspapers are sometimes mistaken, aren't they?" Laughing- a little, she swept across the bulbous face beside her a swift regard that was like a searchlight. "How do you know. Mr. .Flitcroft?" she went on • very rapidly, raising her voice; "how do; you know that Mr. Louflen is fa miliar with this place? The news papers may have been falsely informed; you must admit that? Then how, 'do you know? Have you ever met ; any one who has seen him there?" ; "I've seen him there myself!" The words skipped out of Norbert's? mouth, like so many little devils the instant he opened it. She had spoken so quick- j [ ly. and with such vehemence,, looking, him full ; in the eye. that he. had for | gotten everything in the. .world except making tho point to which her in: ' sistence had led, him. Mamie looked horrified: there was a I sound of smothered -laughter, and Nor bert. overwhelmed by the treachery of ! his own mouth, sat gasping. ; "It can't. be such a terrific place.. then, '\u25a0 after all." said Ariel; gently, and turn ' ing to Eusrene,;.

Mamie had risen, and skirting 'N'orf bert frostily, touched Eugene upon the shoulder as she went; up the steps.
