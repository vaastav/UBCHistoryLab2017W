Congressman Far well was called to tbo stand and ques tioned upon tho 6tnto of feeling between the factions of tbo Republican party Just previous to tho shooting of President Uar tlcld. Judge Porter objected to tuUlng up tho tluioof tbo court by this kind ut cvideneo, and the nlluess wns then questioned ns to his acquaintance with tbo prisoner, nnd stated that bo never thought tbo prisoner a sane man, hut did not think tho prisoner so tnsiiuo but that ho could distinguish between right and wrong. Slov file said he had made every ef fort to procure tho President's attendance as n witness but without success, it was abso lutely essential to obtain bis testimony. Aft er some discussion tho counsel for the pros ecution agreed to allow bcorlllo to prepare Interrogatories to bo submitted to the Presi dent, and to allow bis evidence in this form to bo put in later, with this uuderstandlngbco vlllo announced tho close of tho doteno. 1 be prosecution will follow with evidence in reouiiai.

Tho expert testimony was not called at llrst. the nrueecu- LjUoa producing a.lurgo number of. witnesses who una been early lrienus and neighbors ot tho Gulteau family. Tho unllorm testimony went to show that whllo Guitenu's fHtborvas ccccntrie In sonio things ho wns n man of un usually bright lutollcit and was trusted wltb important positions with tho fullest confi dence of the peoplo of Kreeport, III., whore ho lived. Other relatives wcro eccentric, but very fow enscs of ncttiul insanity wcro .found in tho rurally. Di'.cbmuku 8. Mrs. Julia H. Wilson, of Lcadvillc, Colorado, was called as the first witness by tbo prosecution. She said sho know L. V. Gulteau, tho pris oners father, from her earliest recollec tions. Ho was her uncle. The witness gave an account of tho llfo and churactor of her mother, Mrs. Muynurd, who, it bad been al leged bv tbo defense, had died insane, but who really died from pneumonia tn ItSl. lbe wit ness it as questioned lu regard tu v arlous mem bers uf tho family und stilted positively that she never saw indications of insanity fn nuy of them. The witness was subjected to a closo und critical cross-oviimliiatloii. She wits asknl II sho cntertulnod iiuyprojudlco against hu lui hcreditury insanity ulleged In this do leuse, und replied: "1 object to any unfair statements being made upon that subject. Pcrbiipstor tho sake ot my children, I might dlsllku to buva It set up. For myself, facts tun mako no difference,'1 Howard Dunham, of Huston, of whom tho pnsonor secureddesk room in lotu, testllled that In all his conversa tion wliatho prlsonur.tbrough alibis relations aud his observation ot his conduct, bu uover suspected any Insanity In tho prisoner. Tbo witness then gaioibo substance of conversa tions ho bud had in Huston with J. W. Quit cam brother of tbo prisoner. In which bo had said: " '1 bo dlsgrnco of thlj crimo is enough tor thu family to beur without endeavoring to prpvu hereditary lnsauitv, for there lsnoau ibeutliattdcusooiiwhlchto base It." Gulteau, greatly excited, shouted out: "That's tho wny e feels, and I dcslio to repudiate hliq pn this businsss. Huhus uover been a brother torn, in any sense, and that Is Just tho ridiculous vlewho takes on this Insanity business." A moment after lie tboutod angrily: " That's false. Thorn are two nf my cousins In lunatlo asylums now, und that's where I'll probably be very soon," President Artbiir'sansworto Sou. vllle's Interrogatories were reoeiv ed nnd read.

To the question as to what liolltlcal services the Drlsoner had rendorcd tbe Republican party during tba last Presidential curaimlgn. the answer Is; "Nona taut Ikuowof," The tilth ouestlouvf us wheth er theio was anything In tbo prisoner's rela tions tu, himself, or Ocueral (lruot. or Senator Cunkliug, orany otberof tho 1U publican party, socially or politically, to furnish him wltb any grounds for supposing bo would rtcelvo uny political preferment. Tbo answer Isi "No. Tho luat quoitlon was. "Did you over glvo bltn any roition to think be could tattvo uny pol(tca) or personal muucpnn wjjb you' Ihti answer U : "I never did." Itor.lt. A.

DucKMiiEit 0. Ilov. MoArthur was again culled to tho stand. Scovlllo Im mediately arose and objected to tho char acter of tho evldcnoo which had been given by the witness on the ground that ovldenoe as to any othorcrlmcs rould not bo introduced when tho prisoner is on trial for a particular offense, lie desired all such evidence to bo stricken out. (Itiitcait here broke in excited ly, and shouted out: " it Is purely In tho na ture of a confessional. McArthur is not an expert or n lawyer, nnd I object to his telling the Jury and tho A merlcnn peoplo facta which I told him years ago In regard to ray history." Tho court ruled that tho cvideneo could bo admitted as showing tho general character of tho prisoner. The witness said ho never saw anything to indieato insanity. A number of other witnesses were examined, all of whom testified thntthcyhndiievordctcctcd anything in tho prisoner's conduct that indicated un soundness of mind. Tho prisoner frequently interrupted tbowitnesscs, declaring their tes timony falso nnd nbuslngthcm in unmeasured terms. D.
