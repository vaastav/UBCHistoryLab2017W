WITHOUT WARNING Vf. C. Brown, a Citizen, Falls Upon Onr Streets of Apop lexy. W. C. Brown a well known and respected citizen fell in front of Rochester store on Monday after noon last, and when picked up was found to be in an unconscious condition. Ho was immediately carried to tho office of Dr. Camp bell, but died in a short timo. The deceased was a member of tho Mason's and Oddfellows lodges, the latter order having charge of the funeral which took place from the M. E. Church on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Brown had a stroke of par alysis some timo ago, and while the opinion of the cause of his death was some-what divided, a post mortem examination! held by Drs. Cambell and Pullen before Coroner 6. G. Gage, left no doubt as to tho real cause. The deceased leaves a wife and five children. Embezzlement. On Wednesdny afternoon Chris Hnrtmnn was arrested on a war rant sworn ,ou,t by Mrs. Waltz charging him with embezzlement tojtkjp, amount of'$J00.00. Mr. Hart man was tried 'before Esquire Brehm, waived examination and was bound over in the sum of $500 which was furnished. For some time ho has been running a grocery storofor Mrs. Waltz in furnaco town. elected land tho foreign relations of tho country, but It is striking dovoie of specific recommendation. Ho asks the attention of Congress to tho condition growing out of tho fall uroof tho Fisheries treaty, but mokes no now suggestions for tho dissipation of tills only sorious dis agreement with any foreign couutry. no opposes tho negotia tion of treaties reciprocity except with Moxico and Canada, whero a common border lino makes reci procity expedient, becnuso such treaties inlcrfero with tho control of our revenue system. Tho un profitable expedient of purchasing unmatured Government bonds Is laid bare to tho eye of tho taxpay er. Tho suspicion of further coin age of silver dollars is earnestly recommended. Tho general rec ommendations of tho heads of de partment aro approved, with special emphasis -in referenco to public lands and pensions. But tho dealing with these topics Is formal and customary, and in the nature of a leave-taking. Tho force and fire of tho message are expended In tho exordium. Tho President generalizes upon tho paramount question of tho reduc tion of tho revenue an d tho revi sion ana reform or our revenue system witn a strength or reason ing and a patriotic omphisis of con viction which will make their way to the intelligent considlration of his countrymen. He inveighs elo quently against any scheme of tax reduction which would not bring equivalent relief to to tho tax-payer, and gives his party a battlocry in declaring that "there should be no cessation of the strugglo until a plan is perfected, fair and conser vative toward existing industries, but which will reduce tho cost to consumers of the necessaries of life, while it provides for our man ufacturers tho advantngo of froer raw materials and permits no in- Jury to tho interests of American labor." The dignified appeal to the country for a return to tho simpler and better methods of administra tion in the earlier days of the Re public, whon the citizen's "tribute to tho support of his Government was measured by tho cost of its economical mnintainance," and when "he was secure in the enjoy ment of the remaining recompense of Ills steady and contented toil," wp are satisfied will not have beon made in vain. President Cleveland's courageous stand for Revenue Reform will fix him permanently in a high place among our statesmen and patriots. Dead Go to C. P. MOhfgtimory lor hot coffee and lunclt, N. J.
