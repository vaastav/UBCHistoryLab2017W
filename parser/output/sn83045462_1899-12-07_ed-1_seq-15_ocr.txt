Although the uvcertainty as to what form of government they are going to have keeps the Porto Ricans guessing as to "where they are at," tpkey will soon have the satisfaction of knowing how many "they be" when Mr. Dingman. the' newly appointed chief of the Pbrto Rican census. shall have obtained the returns from his ads. who are peering and prying into every Porto Rican home and causing no Ond of wonder in the minds of the natives as to why Uncle Sam is so anxious to know so much about their "age. sex and previous condition of servitude." Now wide of the mark some of their conjectures have gone was shown in the recent reply of the San Juan News to an "anxious Inquirer" as to .'whether the collection of all of this Infor mnation was merely prelimihary to the Im position of taxes. The reassuring nature of the reply, by the way, must have been largely annulled by the recent aprlaranceI of the order providing for the internal revenues. Nine hundred and forty census enumera ters are hurrying over moor and mountain in the endeavor to get in all the returns within the prescribed time, that Is. by Do comber 20. It is probable, though, that several days of grace will be allowed them, as the difficulties of locomotion in this island have presented unusual problems. I was Informed by one of the office em ployes in San Juan that the only Instance of a reftsal to answer the questions of the enumerators was presented by an Ameri canized German, whose tonrue had to be loosed by force of law. Sometimes the question of age has to be decided rather approximately when the time of birth is Rut down as the "great storm" of about such and such a year. The Tax Question. In regard to the imposition of taxes, all male adults. owners of property, agricultur al, city, commercial or Industrial. and all members of the liberal profession, trades and arts pay $1 to the insular school fund. Taxe are also levied on certificates of gov 'rnment hureaus, or of internal revenue of fices: also on manufacturers of matches and alcoholic beverages; on playing caris and billiard tables. Th's. "the white man's burden." fall also cn his beasts of burden on horses. asses and mules. Coaches, pri vate and public. ate vehicles of taxation. Falling- on the Just as well as the unjust, it attaches to street posters and to public halls (which latter are allowed only at the d'scretion of the alcalde). It is added to the load of the peddler's back and Increases the debts of the pawnbroker. It takes from the profits of the money changers and skill fully extracts half dimes from the "nickel in the siot machine." The sons of Mars and Neptune enjoy certain exemptions. The recent elections held in towns of the .Island have been attended by a considerable amount of dirorder at some points, notably at Ponce and Penuelas. Most of it seems to have been due to a want of discretion on the part of the police. The republicans had the first inning in Mayaguez, and had 't23 to their credit at the end of it. Their root ers were whoop'ng things up when the fed erals came 'o the bat, and piled up a score of Pf00 for their side. Both parties acknowledge that the differ ences between them are more of persons thar. of princ!ples. Recent conversations with reprerentatives of both parties have convinced me that neither side wants home rule-not yet, at least-candidly ac knowledgink their unfitness for it. The man who has probably enjoyed more than any other the diversion afforded by the late unpleasantness connected with the elections is the director of ports in Porto Rico. who until recently was drawing the fire of both parties as a result of an order emanating from his office by which several towns in the island were enjoying daily malls will be reduced to a tr-weekly ser vice, while others will be deprived of their Sunday mall. Storm of Protests. The ordcrestirred up a perfect storm of protests. which, however, disappeared be fore the political tempest which has been raging recently. The charmber of commerce at San Juan has just added Its voice of pro test against the proposed order, and also demands the re-establirhment of several telegraph offlces recently closed, and longer hours in those now in operation. If the roads of Porto Rico do not become ways of pleasantness it will not be through neglect, as the department of public works, it is said. will spend 860,000 in mending our ways in the next year.- The United States government has recently appro priated from the "emergency fund" $2III.f0,4 to be uced in the repairing of the roads on this island. and will cut off "storm ra tions" from those towns where such money is spent. The orphan asylum, heretofore under the same roof with the insane asylum, and un der the Spanish regime supported by the lottery. will soon be moved to our suburban town of Santurse, where the boys and girls will occupy the buildings formerly used as school houses by the Escolapian fathers and sisters of the Sacred Heart. respec tively. This change will no doubt result in the removal to more suitable quarters of many of the inrane now confined in the various jails of the island. Educational Matters. Matters educational still continue to ab sorb the efforts of many and the interest of all. The "model school," whose growth has been much retarded by lack of lumber, is now tinder roof, and it is hoped will be ready for occupancy January 1. It will be formally presented to the public about that time. The town of Tagardo has taken the final steps necesrary to secure the location of the normal and training school there by the deposit of bonds and other collateral as its part of the contract with the insular government. The high school at Ponce re cently opened with an enrollment of forty, which will no doubt grow rapidly. The private schools also seem to be thriv Ing, The Congregationalists, the pioneers m the establishment of (Protestant) church schools, will soon throw another banner to the breese from the heights of Lares, one of the prettiest of our mountain towns, MACHINE SUPPLAtNTS HAND., German View of Amerlean Iron and Steel Industries. Mr. Frank H. Mason, United States con aul general at Berlin, has written to the State Department at length on the German view of the American iron and steel in dustries, The German press, which, for the mnost part, has until recently regarded with more or less suspicion the purposes and probable results of the commercial exposition at Philadelphia. and applauded the reply of Herr Commnercienrath Julius van des' Zy pen of Cologne, declining his invitation, has changed front very noticeably since the reports have been received describing the opeoing ceremonies, the nature and scope of the exposition itself, and especial ly the cordial and hospitable welcome that was accorded to the German delegates and .the wish which was generally expressed that a better understanding. might be reached- on certain technical questions which relate to trade conditions between othe two countries, It. is now generally recognised that the 'Philadelphia exposition has been a meet valuable object lesson for -merchants sand masiufac'turers of all count.ies; that it'has been organised and maned on broad, lib etal principles, and that it would have been a serious err'or if Germany had fol lowed the lead of its rektonary press and refused to participate in an event from which the general cause of. interilational commerce is certain to derive such Ins po'tgannad tasting advantage. -The-weight ci liewspaper' opion iready favorm the creation of a oossaereial zgusanm for -se' 'many, orgnse an mana=ed on tesi lines as the Institution in Phiade sa which has within so brief a pestedaem -iea ,meh importat uis Not .let sagely read adg dbeu===== le~ivata letters and unomeis at t o a Germna delegites. who, sine irst wie of the exposition, heive traveled over the Uhited States, visitlag shipaa, shoe anetes. tro sand stsal works and other mmqrtaast industrial aemmht..nes* Tiheir apU35id5~ inletaptha thr ae through m thilig that their wed to ee, and, being for th Rat pert seleatino Smports ia the fetds" rhieh thee have nsamined, they have grasped aecurately and promptly the ful mengr of au that they have wee.

Jt Is also true that Amerida 'lar SurpasseS hi in the use f Iron and steel for building purposes. "It is undeniable that the American iron works operate under decidedly inre favor. able conditions of production than dur own. Amn important factor In. these conditions is the fact that the United States possesses rar richer and more widely distributed Iron )re depositesthan Germany. While we are largely 4ddbndent upon Imported ores-. especially Swedish - the American iron works find their raw naterial at home. To this must be added the other Important ad vantage. that the construction and equip rnent of their Iron and -steel works far ex !el those of Germany and, indeed. every >ther European courntry. In America we 5nd what seems to us an astonishing sub stitution of machinery for manual labor. i )nly in the most 4ecRgsary details is hand I abor now employed. Sueh a vast and skill. lul application of machinery offers especial advantage in a time like this, when manual abor Is costly and difficult to obtain. Low Freights. "Finally, comes the enormous advantage which the Americans enjoy through the ligh develdpnent of their rall*ay system. rhe Industries have at their coumand a railway system which far surpasses in :heapnesa and effleiency of service any thing known in Europe. The first sight of the tracks and equipment of an American railroad makes upon a German an -mpos ng impression. Their freight ca-'s of all ,lasses far surpass in size and carrylyig cr iaclty those of the German railways. Their track system is relatively broader and stronger than ours. Special tracks for reight trains 'secure' rapid, almost un roken traffic. A widely developed system if branch and side railways (feeders) sus tains the traffic of the principal lines. The rates for freight are excessively low. While on the German railways the .cost of Ereight per ton kilometer is (excepting some unimportant special tariffs) 2.2 pfen rigs, in America the corresponding rate iS )nly 0.6 pfennig per ton kilometer. "Under these conditions the German Iron rdustry finds in that of the United States its greatest, most important and most dan cerous competitor. Just at present the full Eorce of this competition In not apparent .etause there is an enormous home de. 'nand for iron and steel in America. Sev ral shipments of American foundry pig ron to Germany prote, however, -that we lave in future to reckon ith the competit ion of American ifietbl" here at home.
