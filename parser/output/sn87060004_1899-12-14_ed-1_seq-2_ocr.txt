Time to pay thoso election beta on the "next governor of Kentucky." The echoes of that Madison ville "indignation meeting" have ceased to reverberate among tho hills of Hopkins. GovKRNon Tayloii, tho "next Governor of Kentucky, was in augurated Tuesday at Frankfort with great enthusiasm. Hopkins County's vote was counted and tabulated without a word of protest from even the Goebel attorneys. This tells the whole story. Tiiosk Guthrie, Goebel lire works that were not lighted will probably be held in reserve for another one of those Guthrie hot-time fairs. A good deal isbeing said about proposed improvements to Salt Kiver. Pity these could not have been made in time to give Goebel a more comfortable pas sage. Govkiikor Tayloii will bo the only "next Governor" of Ken tucky until another election in the due course of time, notwith standing the Goebelite threats and talk of contests. It is now Attorney-General Clifton J. Pratt; by appoint ment of Gov. Taylor until tho hour for his assuming this high office for the term to which he was elected by tho people. Thk Courier-Journal now speaks of and denounces "em bittered, partisan agitation, the ready resort of the demagogue and the mountebank." What a shame to thus so quickly go back on its own very recent record. In some manner the Goebolites of Hopkinsville, who purloined precinct No. 1 and disfranchised the voters of that precinct did not profit much by their manipu lation. The Eepublicans man aged to get hold of the knife and cut the pie. Oapt. "W. T. Ellis is quoted as having said it Owensboro after returning from Frankfort: "If they expected me to go to Frank fort and commit a highway rob bery they had hold of the wrong man." Well, it will be best to await the Captain's final action as a member of tho contest board. Tho people had belter "withold judgment" a little while. Thk Goebel rally failed in Hopkins county, albeit tho plans were still ripening when tho first telegraphic news of tho de cision of the State Board was re ceived. Cheer up, boys, this is not the only place that lost its rally. At Guthrie tho fellows have had some ninety dollars worth of fireworks and blank cartridges waiting and they are still waiting. Mb. Poyntz dissented from tho opinion of Judge Pryor and Capt. Ellis. Yet Mr. Poyntz is not a lawyer. He is only Goebel's tool. Judge Pryor and Capt. Ellis said in their decision that "no lawyer and no intelligent citizen" could disagree with their decision. Mr. Poyntz does not claim to be a lawyer and there his fellow commissioners have told the rest. As has been said often of late "In Kentucky it has long been the custom of the people to seat that man in office who has re ceived the greatest number of votes." And as a proof that Keutuckians do not mean to de part from that good old rule at this late day, Governor Taylor was inaugurated Tuesday and Attorney General Pratt took tho legal helm of the State.- Govkknok Taylou said in his inaugural address: "I believe implicitly in tho ultima to tri umph of right," and speaking of the result of tho election said: ''It was the triumph of the peo ple over a merciless, remorseless, partisan machine, erected to en- Cl?e slave them. It had no political significance." The Governor puts tlio credit for the result were it properly belongs. It was the triumph of "right" and "the poo pie." St. Louis, Chicago, KansasCity Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Phila delphia, New York, are among the city that are bidding fast and strong for the 1000 Republican National Convention. Philadel phia has already subscribed lib erally toward $100,000 that city thinks necessary as a fund to litis end. If n vice-presidential candidate is selected from the East, as is probable, tho conven tion will probably come west. St. Louis and Chicago are neck and neck in the race. Dira's Kkvikw for December 2 says : "Business continues won derfully large, prosperous, and healthy. In four weeks failures have been reported amounting to $0,818,590, against $8,110,-175 in the same weeks of last year. $11,010, JUS in 18W, and over $12,000,000 in 1800, and also in 1895. Yet tho volume of solvent trade represented by exchanges at tho principal clearing houses has been for tho month 22.5 per cent greater than last year and 10 per cent greater than in 1802." When Gov. Bradley went into oflico the State Treasury was empty and state warrants could not be paid. At tho close of his administration all outstanding state warrants had been paid more than $1,717,000 and there is in the treasury $1,100,000, moro than enough to pay the bonded debt of tho state. The credit of tho slate is restored and Kentucky hopelessly in debt under tho Democratic long-time rule is now practi cally out of debt and all her ob ligations being mot. Thk United States has a little money left yet, even so long as three years after the time when Mr. Bryan and his followers pre dicted that our money could never increase without the free and unlimited coinage of silver. Since Mr. Bryan made that pre diction tho money in circulation has increased !J3 per cent. On July 1, 1890 tho money in circu lation was $1,509,725,200, and on December 1, 1899 it was $1,9S3,- 030,001, with the promise of crossing the $2,000,000,000 mark by the end of December. Populist Senator from Idaho, Henry Heitfield, in a recent in terview, frankly admits Republi can prosperity. Ho said, "The times nre good in our State. Cat tle, for instance, are selling for just three times what they were two,or three years ago. Wool is in much better demand, and tho gold nnd lead mines of the State are being worked with great profit." Other statesmen nnd citizens besides Mr. Heitfield have also awakened to the fact that "the free an unlimited coin age of silver at 10 to 1" is not necessary to growth and material well-being. "The future government of tho Philippines rests with the govern ment of tho United States. Few graver responsibilities have ever been confided to us. If we ac cept them in a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions, a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot bo aban doned. If wo desert them we leave them at onco to anarchy and finally to barbarism. We lling them, a golden apple of dis cord, among the rival powers, no one of which could permit an other to seize Uiein unques tioned." President McKinley's Annual Message to Congress. Smallpox. Under date of December 12th the State Board of Health issues "another warning against small pox," sending out circulars for publication and urging vaccina tion and re-vaccination. Wo cannot publish tho circular in full for lack of space this week. But we give tho warning briefly. In less than two years moro than 2,000 cases of smallpox have oc curred in 02 of the 110 counties of this State, involving a direct expense to tho afi'ected counties and municipalities of nearly $100,000, and a far greater loss from interference with business and travel. Tho circular says "All of this disease and exponso could and should have been avoided had general vaccination been resorted to when repeatedly urged by this and tho local hoards of health before the dis ease p'gajned such a foothold in the State." In Earlingtou a largo. propor tion of tho people have beenTyac- "It is an III Wind That Blows Nobody Good." That small ache or pain or weakness is the "ill wind" that directs your attention to the necessity of purifying your blood by taking Hood's Sarsapa rill a. Then your whole body receives good, for the purified blood goes tingling to every organ. It is the great remedy for all ages and both sexes. Dyspepsia " Complicated with liver and kidney rouble, I suffered for years from dyspepsia, luiih severe pains. Hood's Sarsapdrilla nude me strong and hearty." B. Emerlon, Auburn, Me. 3(00tC& SwtiajiWiltfa Ural's J'llls cure llTeMHsithe uoti Irritating and only cathartic to talra with IfuoJ'i Sar.apartlla. cinated successfully within tho past year. So have many people in other parts of Hopkins county, but a larger percentage in Earl ingtou than elsewhere. There are some even here who have not complied with the sugges tions of the Board of Health and these should do so at once. 

DEMOCRATIC COMMENT. Caustic Comment on Poyntz Approval of Decision. Mr. Poyntz Issues a dissenting opinion in tho matter of awarding the certificate for governor ami nays lie In suro the commissioners ought to have gone behind tho returns and given the certificate to tho Demo crats. It 1.4 very strange that Mr. Poyntz knew so much, lie admits that ho is no lawyer and no evidence has been produced before tho board and noii(5 was heard by them, ami yet without hearing any eviUeuco at all and without knowing any law, Mr. l'oyutz says ho is in favor of giv ing tho certificate to the Democrats. Mr. Poyntz is small potatoes and few in the hill. Such irresponsible men as ho have no business to bo en trusted with such enormous powers ami duties as devolve upon tho State board of election commissioners. Madtsouvillo Hustler. Ornpcvinc Items.

Mr. Nenl formerly dispatcher on the Henderson division has accented an offer from tho Wabash Jtailroad Company, where ho will go as train dispatcher with headquarters at De catur, Ala. Tho great loss of tlmo to trains, wliilo douhlimr the Emniro hill has caused tho railroad company to put a inn ciiiuu tu itew r.uiiiiro iu as sist trains over the hill.

Falso charges mado against tho Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company did not prove to bo a win ning issue when iu the hands of the bad man, Goebel, and wo venture tho nssertion that it will bo many years before a man can again bo found so weak as to make his main plea for election to tho highest po sition iu the State, n charge against a rauroau company. Representatives of Cotton Com presses In Texas have comnlaincd to the Railroad Commission of that State because railroads have confis cated coal consigned to them. Thev are short of coal and fear a shut down if tho practice continues, but tne commission is powerless nnd they will probably seek relief in tho courts.

Tho Slnughtersvlllo agent for tho St. Rernard Coal Co. speaks in flat tering terms of that company both as to quality of coal shipped and promptness in filling orders. Many of tho Rarnslcy miners spent soveral days this week at Madisou villo attending court, on account of recent troublo there. Tho boy should tako warning nnd hereafter guard against the use of liquor. Mr. Jako MoKucn, manager of the St. Rernard store at St. Charles. went to Evansvlllo last week to lay 111 a supply 01 uoiuiay goons.
