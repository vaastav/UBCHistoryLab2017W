This document, which we are enabled to lay before oar reader) this morning, Li a very con densed, yet lucid, exposition of the detailed workings of the various branches of the Got. eminent daring the pat year. It Is qnlto idle to state tin contents of a paper Hie this, which will be universally read, and almost equally ro, to express opinions upon It to readers, each one ol whom will have already formed opinions cf his own If there is any part of tbla meuKge which we should eelect for especial praise In respect lo point and style, it Is the opening part, In respect to the foreign aspect ot our domestic troubles. It would be Impossible to present, with more clearness, the considerations which should die made the Europe in nations from intervening In favor of the rebellion, and which should Ii -duce them to desire the early and complete restoration of the national aalh rlty. At tie same time, tbe'meesage recognises, with dignity and firmness, the great fact that we must rely, In onr foreign relation, not upon the wisdom or forbearance of others, but upon our strength and preparation for conlingencies. A pervading feature of this m-ssage, is the just purpose of leaving to the legislative branch of tbe Government tint control of great ques tlons of public pulley, too often wrested from it heretofore, by Executive encroachments This Is particularly true of questions relating to slavery, which the Pn ld -nt remits to Con grew wl'.h very few p'e I ecnrnerilill 'ii and with the rxprrs-iou ol only the elugir general view, thit extrem menures should not be hastily resolved upon. The recommendat'on of measures In aid ot the colonization of negroes, including, if found necesry and advisable, the acquisition cf territory for that purpose, will, we trut, be promptly seconded by Congrev. It strikes at the root of the strongest pipular prejudice against the emancipation of slaves, which is the appreheoslou (however unfounded in real ity) of being' ovtrrun," as the phrase Is, by free negroes. If tbe means of colonizing them are provided, thU sort of apprehension will be abated, and perhaps removed. A good deal may be done in this direction, without the de lay and dl-cu'slons lnident to tbe acquisition of territory specially for that purpose. In ad dition to Liberia, and especially to Hayti, both offering Immediate Inducements to colored colonists, th 're are other regions In Mexico and South America where they would now be gladly received. lo what he iays of the Confiscation Act, (so ailed,) passed at the extra session of Congress, the President, In one sentence, epeaka of the slaves tffected by It, as ' liberated," and yet in another, seems to speak of tbem as trans ferred to tbe United States, to be disposed of by the United States. He adds. wbil- taking this view of th subj-ct, that similar legislation may be expected from some of the States, and that the p-nperty which they may thus acquire in confiscated slaves, miy be pur chased from tbem, or accepted from them for taxes, by the United States, with a view to tbe liberation of such slaves. Whatever principles of legislation on this abject may be adopted by tbe States, it Is quite oertain, we think, that Congress provided, at the extra session, for the lib-ration of slaves employed for tbe purpo-ses of tCo rebellion by their masters. It relieved slaves so employed from all claims upon their labor from their masters, and It Is Impossible to nm words which more unequivocally give freedom to slaves. Congress intended preci ely that, and not to transfer such slaves as property to the nation, to be still held as ekvei. by it. The President surprises us somewhat by tbe statement, tbat large Dumbers cf slaves, com ing witbln the range ol the Confiscation Act, are now in the baudt ot the United States to be dispos d of. Ldrge numbers of slaves have come within our military Hues, and still remain there, at Fortress .Monroe, Port Royal, and elsewhere, but we wer not aware that meas ures had been taken to seperate, by proper evidence, such as come within the Confiscation Act, from those-who do not come within it. Undoubtedly, some additional and remedial legislation is needed, on tbal bead, to carry out tbe principle ot the Confiscation Act Even if not extended, tbat act will liberate hundreds of thousands of slaved, with proper measures to facilitate tbe taking and preserva Hon of the proofs of their tmployment In the rul lury tervicu of the rebellion. The vantage ground ibtained in this act, by the friends ol emancipation, mutt be tenaciously held and ira. proved. It is a wedge already set, and only neeas to oe unven by vigorous blows. The President takes a very favorable view of the general progress of the war, and a view eertainly correct In Its main features. He does not exaggerate the unanimity and steadiness of the loyal States in furnishing men aid money lor the maintenance of the Union. As to the condition of things Insome of the border States, especially Kentucky and Missouri, we should be a good deal better eatltfied than we are, 11 It appeared to us precisely as it does to tbe President. The mewage.at Its conclusion, very properly points out that this war is u war for the preser vation of the vital principles of the Govern mint, a-salled by filee theories upon tbe sub ject of capital and labor. The President vin dicates the true American principles In a very bappy, striking, and original maauer. We will hope and believe that, If he had not been re- str lined from the eipressiou of bis personal sentiments by the reserve and caution appro priate to bis official station, be would Dave gono one step further, and pointed out that the opposite theories wbloh he combats with such fnvlnclb)e. power of. reason, spring, and will never cease to spring, from tbe system of chattel levery, and that we'never can become a henr- i-en uus and republican people so long as tbat ysirm diseases any part of the body politic CovniiEO. There was very little done In cither branch of Congress yesterday, beyond the reading of tbe President's message. Ii the Home, as will be seen, a voU for the expulsion of. Mr. Burnett, of Kentucky, was aumnarlly pused, aid an "obituary" of him is promised at an early day, by hl colleague, Mrr WickltHe, who, we trust, will not forget the .maxim, to speak nothing of the dead but that which ii good. Tbe resolutions proposed in the Senate by Mr. Grimes, give prompt and grateful expres sion to the national appreciation of the services of Com. Dupont and his brave associates. 

PORT ltOYAL. The New York Jtoenuw Pott gives the fol lowing Intelligence, brought by the transport Mc lellan: UILTON UK1D. Contrarv to the irenerallv-received oulnlon. mi new fortifications have been made by our troops in me vicinity ol tort walker crat Day Point, but the defences which were already built have been strengthened. It is understood tnat on the side ol tne island towards the main land defences arc erecting. The entire force of General Shvrman'a ex pedltloo, with the exception of less than one tnou-and men, are on Hilton s Head, and Is In good condition. Tne large amount 01 pr..vi- slins of various kinds found there b not yet exhansted. Cattle, sheep, turkeys, chickens, are very plenty ; some of them obtained by foraging parties, which proceed to the Islands in the vicinity, and In some cases, it is said, to tbe mainland, mere Is ana will be, (or a long time, no scarcity ot fresh meat from the sources Dear tne present encampment 01 our troops. uucroRT to de occrriED. There is no longer any constant guard of re-sreis at ueauiort ; ana 11 is tell almost exciu rite.lv in the possession of the negroes, of whom there are many. There is, however, one white man not tbe original Inebriated Indiv.dual a secessionist, who remains in tbe town nights, uid on those days when tbe United rotates oi era are not seen, but on tne unpearance ol dauber, he Instantly retires. He is supposed to oe a spy. Ii was understood, when the McClellan silled, tbal Ueaufort would be occupied, probably the next day, by a force of about five thousand ineu, which could be easily spared even in, ad dition lo the five thousand which would accom pany the expedition. The purpose of the occu pau y was to prevent the secessionists from taking possession, aul also to retain the con siderable amount of property which yet remains fi-ree. The teccssiinisu have come there in the night, in a few cases, and taken away prop erty ; Dut ii ts unaerstooa mat no large noelies i tneir troops are in tne immediate vicinity. TUB

The ' contrabands " occupy Beaufort, IXil- tun's Head bland, and the contiguous islands iu considerable numbers Those who have already separated from their masters, and are only tinder tneir own control, are estimated at live Hundred to a tnousana. These are witbln e y reach of onr forces. ThJ-e at at d around Beaufort are by seme estimated at nearly the tuun s given. A lew ot me latter are supposed tu be looking after the property of their mas ters. But of the great majority it is known 'hat they would be very glad to enter our lines lor tne purpose generally or obtaining employment The men ot the steamer McClel lan, when they were at Beaufort, could have brought away a full load ot them had they been authorized to do so. Tbe "contrabands" crowded around them, begging to be allowed the privilege of getting on board. Quite a number assated in loading the lumber, for wblab tbey asked and received no pay, and worked, the men say, ' like good fellows." Thirteen of them were: finally taken to Hilton ueaa. The story which has beo extensively pub lished that tbe negroes refuse to uork is em- pbatically contradicted. Tbey have neerhad tbe opportunity. About two hundred and fifty are on and around Hilton Head, and labor when they have an opportunity. Tboy even take ooats, going arounu to tie shipping, car rylng men, begs and bundles in faie! taking any ireignt wnicn is given mem.

Oh Monday afternoon, n Rqnadron of rebel cavalry, ISO strong, chirged on the pickets of Blenker's division statioaof on Cox's faro, near Annandale. The vldettes at first supposed them to be the 'Lincoln Cavalry. When their real character was discovered, and the alarm was given, Lieutenant I'urnell.of the New Yotk Mounted Hides, summoned hit force, only thir ty-even men, to the assistants of the pickets, lie dlscove red and captured orfe of the rebels, and one of bis men another. Company A, ol the Fdrty.-flflh Pennsylvania reglrient, sop ported him. A private or tbal company, named Huloenberg, was shot through the base of the neck, and instantly killed. His murderer wan captured while in the ajt of taking the boot off the feet of his viulim. The fleelness of the rebels saved them from coming in con tsct with a strong reinforcement of cavalry, which left Hunter's Chapel npon tho first news o. tbe iklrmish. As twelve of oar men were missing at roll-call, It was thought that they had been captured by the rebels ; but, yester day morning, eight of the missing men had ta turned to camp. The body of private Huloenberg was con veyed to the Blenker Dlvi-lon Hospital, and the prisoners brought to this city, under guard, aud lodged in the Old Capitol prison. The names of the prisoners arc Alexander Max well, of Bectorlown, Fauquier county, Vir ginia, and William U. Dennis, of Salem, sime county. Both of them were members of com piny U, Sixth regiment Wise Dragoons. Lieu tenant Purnell retains the horse of his captive, together with bis arms, which bear tbe stamp of tbe United States, 1816. The rebels, It ap pears, had been sent from their camp, near Centrevtlle, in search of forage. Another de tachment of the sime cavalry regiment were engaged, at the same time, in foraging In an other direction. Farmer Cox and two of bis sons have been arrested, and are now confined at or near Gen eral Blenker's headquarters. Tbe other son, who Is a Union man, entertained the Union men hospitably.

Tbe Reliance, which went down the river on Monday afternoon, returned again yesterday mornlog, bringing Captain Craven, nag-Lfflcer of the flotilla. The commander of the Reliance reports that numerous outward bound schooners bad run the blockade within the past few days, ncne of which, as far as is known, were Injured by the gnns of the rebel batteries. The Reliance passed several small vessels bound to this city, which bad run the blockade on Monday night. Tbe etsamer Mount Washington left tbe yard yesterday morning to join the flotilla. The following gunboats are now stationed off Indian Head: The Murray. Wyandank, Auacostia, Harriet Lane, Jacob Bell, Reliance and M. J. Washington. The only boats at tbe yard now are the Powhatan, Leslie, (never In service), Stepping Stone, acd the Yankee, all of which are un dergoing repairs. Col. Charles It. Doron and his quarter- tnaater,Jobn Boaler, jun.,both of Philadelphia, are now in this city, proposing to furnish the Government with a fall regiment of heavy artillery, which they have recruited at their own expense. These gentlemen have both seen service, CoL Dorun as an officer In the battle of Bull Hun, and Mr. Bosler as convoy of Gen. Fremont's division in the overland route to California. (From the N. O. Crs-coot, Nov. 1!.) Talk on 'Change. Tbe correspondence between a body of mer chants in Liverpool and L-jrd John Russell, an extract of which has been published, took airnt of the habitues of the fUgs by surprise. The general feeling li.ii prevailed that the British ministry would regard tbe restraint on the exportation of cotton as something worthy of their immediate attention, but Lord John coolly replies, as much as to say, tbat ills none of bis business. Although the stock of Ameri can cotton my be nearly exhausted by tbe close of next month. (December.) it miv well be considered that, with the Increase of receipts irnm tdsi mm, tne rnlil-t cn be kept In operation, u.der short time, until tbe first day of May next, or later. The demand (or good falls off each succeeding week, and all the British Government can do to frustrate the starving of the millions of operatives, who are denendlni: on coltnn. is to contribnts fnrthnlr support. In the year 1800, the Importation of coiioo irom me unitea btaies into Ureat Britain was 59,253 bales. In 1410, It had In creased to 310,671. In 1611, there was a slight Increase. In 1812, war was declared by the United States against Great Britain, and ex portation of cotton censed, and were not re sumed until the month of April, 1813. It will thus Be seen tbat England got along altbout American cotton for a space of time of nearly three years. There has been some talk of entirely preter mitting the planting of cotton seed the next season; tbat It will be tbe wisest pol.oy fjr cotton fields to be turned Into corn, wheat, and potatoes. Then we shall have a large over production, and a complete surfeit of produols perishable In their nature, while cotton will maintain Its own without deterioration. A division of plautlng or raiding can be success fully carried out that is, raucb less than usual can be planted, and cereals and esculents In general be largely Inoreased, also beans and peas. Among the most unreasonable and un wise suggestions reoently broached is tbat be fore the Legislature of illaalulnnl. in nmhihi. by statute, any ootton seed from being planted' until the present crop is sold.
