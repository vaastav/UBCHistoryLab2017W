-. . , . ,. , an impartial decision. I regret to inform you that Great Britain declined the ar bitrament, but, on the other hand, invit ed ua to the formation of a joint coni- Siaaion to settle mutual claims between a two countries, from which those for the depredations before mentioned should be excluded. The proposition, in that very unsatisfactory manner; has been de clined. The United States did not present the subject as an impeachment of the good faith of a flower wluoh was professing tha moat friendly dispositions, but as in volving question of public-law, of hich the settlement is essential to the peace of nations, and, though pecuniary repa ration to their injured citizens would hare followed incidentally on a decision against Jreat Britain, streh oemjiensation w.aa nt their primary objeet. They had a higber motive, and it was in the inter ests of peace'and jtftftiee to establish im peetaa principles o iateraational hrw. e,'orrepondenco will be placed before 5au. i?he ground, on which the British MimstBr rests his justification is, sub stantially, that the municipal law of a tfWirj,-TT& the domestic interpretations ifthm kvsf, vtd th measures-of its duty as a neutral; and I feel bound to. declare nay opinion before you and before the World, that that justification cannot be sustained before the tribunal of nations. At she same time I do not advise to any BWek erapt at redress by acts of leg islation. Fe the "future, friendship bp tween the two cobntries must Vest on the basis of mutual justice. From the moment of the establish ment of our free Constitutions, -the civ il Used VorloY has been convulsed by rev olutions in the interests of democracy or of monocracy; but through all those rev olutions the United States- -have wisely and Jirmly refused to become propagan dists' of republicanism. It is trie only gMWa'mejtf 8twtedJto-'Our'6ond'UionbBt we have never sought to impose it on others; and we have consistently followed the adaZWaDgtoo 4o, jertBmend it only by the careful preservation and pWdent Use orf the blessing.

Twice, ejndeod, rumors of the ihvasion of some parts of South - AineaMa, in the in terest of monarchy, have prevailed; twice my predecessors have had occasion to an nounce the views of this nation, in re spect to such interference.

We cannot i&im Wk'jm mviag to .consider what opportunities may present them selves, what combinations might 'offer to protect ourselves against designs inimical to our form of government. The UniWd fiyiWI6 ?V'wjjfrJto9$f the7 five "ever acted" heretofore; they never 'SEmm tie..-oorse -but . by thMmm)1M JW)facowers5 ana we rely on tire wisdom and justice of those Powers to respect the ,non interference which has been so long sanctfobeby time, proved itself trq. both continents. 4irWWWpitn4eBee between tbo lini tosVs&tates and France, in reference to trots, 'wilU at the proper time, be hrW before Cosgasssv': soS IPliea Oti'tBe ttrganrtsatiofa of our Govern -Mtrt, under th'Goaafeitaticn, the Prssident eft tnttSeibad'State delivered his Inaugural Address to the two Houses of Congress, he gid,4 them, and through them to- the coun try, and to mankind, that, "the preservation ofthe sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the Republican model of Government are justly conafEted JUT deeply, parjraps as final ly, staked on the experiment intrusted to the American people." And the House of Rep resentatives answered Washington, through the voice of Afadisbn:, "We adore the invisi ble hand which has led thB American people through bo many difficulties, to cherish a con scious responsibility for the destiny of Amer ican liberty." More than seventy, sis' years glided away Since those words were spoken; the united States have passed through severer trials than were foreseen, and new, at this new epoch in our existence as one nation, with eur Union purVffesi, llyjeosrows, and strength ened by conflict, and established by the vir tue of the people, the greatness of the oeea- lemnity the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable before onr fellow men for the success of the Republican form of Government. Experience has proved its suf ficiency in peace and in war; it has vindicated its authority through distress and afflictions, and sudden and terrible emergencies, which would have crushed any system that had been teas firmly fixed in the hearts of the people, At. the inauguration of Washington, the foreign relations of the country were few, and its trade was repressed by hostile regula tions; now all the civilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce, and their gov ernments profess toward us amity. Thenoui country felt its way hesitatingly along an un tried path, with States so little bound to gether by rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one another, and with historic traditions extending over Very few years; now intercourse between the States is swift and intimate; the experience of centu ries has been crowded into a few. generations, and has created an intense indestructible na tionality. Then our jurisdiction did not ex tend beyond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had aouieved independ ence; now, through cessions of lands, first colonized by Spain and France, the country has acquired a more complex character, and has for its natural limits the chain of Lakes, the Gulf of Mexioo, and on the east and west the tjnc great Oceans. Other nations were wasted bv civil wars for ages before they oo'd establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity; the latent conviction that our form of government is the best ever known to the world, has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years, with a complete vindi cation of the Constitutional authority of the General Government, and with our local lib erties add tate institutions unimpaired. The throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the confidence of all people in our permanence. Hera la the great land pi tee labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled re ward t5, and the bread of the working man is sweetened by the con sciousness that the cause of his country "is his own cause, his own safety, his own digni ty." Here every one enjoys the free use of his faculties and the choice of activity as a natural right, Here, under the combined in fluence of a fruitful soil, genial climes, and happy institutions, population has inoreased fifteen-fold within a century, Here, through the easy development of boundless resources, wealth has increased with two-fold greater rapidity than numbers, so that we have be come secure against the financial vicissitudes of other countries, and, alike in business and in opinion, ate self centered and truly inde pendent. Here, more and hi ore care is given to provide education for every one born on eur soil, Here religion, released from polit ical oonneotion with the civil government. re fuses to subserve the craft of statesmen, and becomes, 'in its independence, the spiritual life of the people. Here toleration is exten ded to every opinion, in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory. Here the human mind goes forth unshackled in the pursuit of science, to ool leot stores of knowledge and acquire an ever increasing mastery over the forces of nature. Here the national domain is offered and.held in millions of separate freeholds, so that our fellow citisens, beyond the occupants of any other part of the each, constitute in reality a people. Here exists the democratic form of government; and that form of government, by the confession of European statesmen, "gives a power of which no other form is capable, because it incorporates every man with the State, and arouses everything that belongs to the soul." Where, in past history ,does a parallel exist to the publio happiness which is within the reach of the people of the United States? Where, in any part of the globe, can institu tions be found so Suited to their habits or so entitled t their love as their own free Con stitution? Every one of them, then, in whatever part of the land he has his home, must wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not bow acknowledge, in the words of Wash ington, that "every step by which the people of the United States have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of Providential agency." Who will not join with me in the prayer, that the invisible hand hioh has led us thtough the clouds that gloomed around our path, will so guide us onward to a perfect restoration of fraternal affection, that we of this day may be able to transmit our great inheritance, of State Gov ernments in ail their rights, 0f the General Government in all its Constitutional vigor' to our posterity, and they to theirs, through countless generations? 

ANDREW JOHNSOM. Washington, December 4, 1865. THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY. Woodsfield, Dec. 13, 1865. Monroe Co. Agricultural Society An Appeal ?or Aid. The Monroe Cbunty Agricultural Soeiety is in debt to the amount of about $1,250, and tbe creditors are demanding payment. The principal part of this debt was incurred for rent, fences and buildings, and tbe obligations are in tbe bands of VV. Askew, at St. Clairsville,and Tallant & Dclaplain, at Wheeling. There are but two courses to pursue: One is to fold onr hands and sit idly by, and let all the property be sold; the other is to exhibit a little enterprise, raise the money, pay the debt, and set the institu tion on a permanent foundation. Once out of debt the institution will be self sustaining. It can hardly be necessary to urge the importance of pavine off this debt. If a ev w the people of this county, and especially the farmers, do net feel interest and coun ty pride enough to contribute this money; it is to be hoped nobody will ever tell out of this conntv why we hare no more Fairs. Tbe Board of Directors has apportion ed the amount to be raised among tbe several townships, and appointed collec tors, as follows: Townships. Collectors. Am't Adams.... Eliel Headley 850 Benton G.
