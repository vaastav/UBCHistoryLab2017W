It is especially incumbent upon those who have plenty of this world's goods to think of the less fortunate at such a time as this, when cold weather and heavy snow have added to the distresses of poverty. There will be much en ferced idleness among the laboring classes in Kansas City as a result of the present storm. Within this class are many who live from hand to mouth. Consequently, unusual demands will be made upon the charitable institutions and upon the charitable branches of the various churches. Those who can afford t give some thing for the relief of the unusual distress re sulting from stvere weather can readily find mediums through which to minister. Kansas City Journal. Is it possible that these conditions exist right in the midst of a great "wave of prosperity," or has the Journal become a calamity howler"? Where is the "advance agent of prosperity," whose election was going to givs steady work, at good wages, to the laboring man? Would it not be well for him to shower a few crumbs of prosperity on the poor souls who have been un able to lay by enough to tide them over a stormy day, and have enough to live "from hand to mouth"? ' What are the facts in relation to the admin ittration of this boasted "advance agent" np to date? Here are some of them: A war, claimed to have been in the interest of humanity, and ended in a scramble for spoils. An additional interest-bearing debt, amounting to hundreds of millions of dolors, piled upon the shoulders of an already debt-burdened peo ple. A restoraticn of the old English system of stamp tax, and tax on tea, under which over three hundred thousand dollars a day is drawn from the people. The flattest wool mar ket known ior years, and cotton lower than ever known in the nation's history. Wool exchange closed, and a general shut-down of woolen mills throughout New England, and half the cotton mills closed, and tens of thousands of operatives left without employment, and foiced to depend largely upon public charity. The greatest strike of coal-miners the world has ever known, ending in murdering many miners and starving the remainder back into the slav ery of such cold-blooded mine-owners as Mark Hanna. A tariff law that gives free trade in saw-logs for the lumber king, and imposes a high tax upon the poor man's lumber. An ad ministaation that has surrendered to the money power the people's option to pay our bonded debt and treasury notes in silver dollars, thus forcing us to get the gold, it matters not at what cost. And this "advance ageut o pros perity" now asks fot a standing army of ioo, ooo men, to be supported in time of peace, mainly by the men who, in the hour of ptril, are the nation's defenders. And finally, after borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars, we are, according to this "advance agent's" mes sage to congress, confronted by a deficit, at the close of the, present fiscal year, June 30, 1899, of $ 112,000,000. All this, and eve more of like nature, has occurred under the rule of this "advance agent of prosperity." No wonder the Journal, when a little flurry of snow comes to give it the slightest excuse, sounds the alarm of approach ing starvation, and tries to put the blame on the Lord, instead of on the prosperity howlers, 

WHERE IT BELONGS: ' THERE are two state treasurers serving the state of Nebraska. One a Republican is serving a term in the penitentiary for appropri ating the state's money to his own use. The other is a Populist, who is filling the treasurer's office faithfully, aud has the entire confidence of .the people.

We publish the President's message in our local edition this week, so every reader can form his own opinion of it. So far as we can understand the message, there is nothing in it aside from a partial resume of the year's inci dents. McKinley. seems afraid to tackle the Phillipine question at any rate, he says not a word about it. He talks favorably to Cuban in dependence with a string to it. In looking over the expressed opinions of prominoat men ot the nation, we hnd very few who are favorably impressed with the message. In fact, the message emphasizes the fact that the President is a weak, willing tool of the fel lows who want to make money at the expense of humanity.
