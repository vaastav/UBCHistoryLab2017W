To those who enjoyed the thrill of a KoosevelUaa message the message of President TaXt la a disappointment It does not ring laud, but it does ring true. It Is in keeping with his quiet and persistent manner; and it ' leaves no doubt as to what he stands for, tout carries full assuranca of his resolute purpose. The most Important Issue, tie says, Is a more economical administration of the government, and he calls at tention to tha fact that the adoption ot new methods will make a saving wf ver fifty millions, and that a sur pkia is assnred for the . fiscal yea ending In June, 1511. He shows that the postofllce depart ment's embarrassment Is caused by the carrying of second class mall mat ter at a loss of eight cents a pound, which annually totals a loss of 163, 000,00s; aa he very properly advo cates an increase of rates there. He also calls upon congress to hon or the platform promise of the re publican party by enacting a law to prevent the issuance of injunctions wfthout notice unless it must be done te prevent immediate and irreparable injury, and that such injunctions shall net remain in force more than a week, unlees an order for extension has been obtained faom the court In feehaK of the public he also asks for reform tn court methods to pre vent the delays and heavy coBts upon litigants and to remove what he re gards as a primary cause for lynch ings and soob violence' In different parts of tbe country! and he favors postal savings banks with a rate of in terest so loir that they will not at tract deposits from other banks, de moralizing conservative banking and producing financial disaster. The message is short, and worthy the attention of every intelligent read er. The Bulletin prints it in full; and It la so divided and attractively head ed up that it may be read In sections at one's leisure. THE 

MACADAM ROAD. The roads which first bore the name f Macadam were simply built so deep with heavy and light stone, and ao sol idly that they would stand the wear and tear of travel fer a century no heavy trucking or automobile speed ing could knock them out - The macadam of today is a goat of another color. It is just as near like the original macadam as the artificial alligator skin boots and valises, eta, are like the real thing. The alliga tor would not be able to recognize them as the hides of his departed tri bal comrades. And these near not very near macadam roads are not heavy enough for 1909 tourtag cars, which are simply heavy road locomo tives built to beat the cars, and the road commissioners of the states at tha front In good road building are now looking for new road binders for metal which with a light founda tion and good drainage will meet the requirements of this high speeding, something no roads were ever subject ed to until this age; and the New ark News says that "Commissioner Gttkyson of New Jersey believes he has found a new road surface which is destined to completely supplant eruehed stone. He has been experi menting ever since he has fceen in of floe, and he now has eighty-five miles of road built of the new material, with pacifications drawn for thirteen more. Some of these roads have been down for than a year; have been subjected t summer's heat, to winter's cold and t all kinds of heavy carting, light riding and automobile speeding. They hare stood all these tests well and are nat likely to need repairs for several roars to come. "Tha new material is crushed stone, jth an asphalt binder, the best pro portion of asphalt being the subject of many experiments and tests of en durance. The state road law . was changed last winter to allow counties to build roads of the new combination with state aid. The cost of such roads Is from $1.15 to $1.50 a square yard, as against $1.90 to $2.50 for tha best macadam, and it is not only dust less, but durable." . Commissioner MacDonald of this state says: t'The large Increase In automobile traffic which Is so trying on the roads has compelled the adoption of more solid roadways, that is. the foundation must be deeper and the surface laid with better material and so construct ed as to stand the traffic of this new element, the automobile. But as a general principle, I have adhered to the macadam system, which, when properly constructed, is, in my opin ion, the best yet devised for rural highways. The civilized world has come to recognize this fact. As to the possibility of changing this meth od, I have been thinking that it might be beneficial, and on this point I am not quite convinced, to drees the whole material going into a new road, from the bottom up, with tar. It might have the tffect of a better knit ting together of tha stone and top dressing. But the Idea that oiling the surface would improve the situa tion is illusory. I tried oil on roads in ihia state before Its present advo cates knew anything about it, and I found it a poor palliative, with no permanent worth. I tried it on the Wallingford road, for Instance, and my experience there and in other sec tions Of the state did not justify me in spending more of the state's money-ln the experiment." The press is not Inclined to hound the commissioner for the ruin wrought by automofcllists. The Bridgeport Standard, commenting upon Mr. Mac DonaJtTs recent replica to his ques tioners, says: "Commisslaner MacDonald meets all tbe Issues squarely and dodges none. While there may he aa honest difference of opmien as to the facts stated, particularly those with refer ence to the comparative value of Con nection state roads and those of other states, certainly . the commissioner shoal be in position to knew best what is right and his categorical an swers are before the citizens of the state for examination, further criti cism er refutation If any critic feels Inclined and able te continue the dis cueslen. Tbe commissioner makes a good ataAssaaal -has decided conylo 1 tlons and the courage of them, and may well call for proof when derelic tion of duty Is laid at his door." This is a fair way of looking at the matter, and it will impress the people as. being as just as it is deserved on the part of the commissioner. NO 

LOAFING ON THE JOB. Those who are crying loudest about the inefficiency of the state highway commissioner are the expectants who were anticipating Immediate appoint ment as assistants under him because the legislature empowered him to In crease his force of assistants and en gineers. The legislature adjourned months ago arid they have not yet connected with the state treasury; and he does not mean that they shall con nect until such time as their services will be equal to the amount of money they draw from the state. Mr. Mac Donald explains this most satisfactor ily for the taxpayers, if it Is not con sidered satisfactory by those in inter est' He says, with reference to these authorised and legalized appoint ments: - "I have not made those appoint ments, simply because my first con cern is the interest and duty . I owe the state. Like the repairs feature, the money for the payment of those men did not come to me until Octo ber, and they would be of no use to the state until spring orjwns. All they would have to do during the winter months is to draw their salaries. Oh, I realize that I require help as well as my critics do, but I contend that no dishonesty, no inefficiency, even, and, this I say with due modesty, no neg lect of duty, no loafing on the job can he laid at my door and sustained by proof." The commissioner realizes his own responsibility and as tha master of the situation he regards tbe interests' of the state and his own standing of more importance to him than the de sires or demands of persons whose self-interest is often their only rec ommendation. HOW IT AFFECTS THE MESSAGE President Taft's message has been In the newspaper offices and the hands of correspondents two or three days. This forehandedness enables newspapers to put the message in type comfortably and gives the edi tors opportunity to read it carefully and prepare intelligent summary and comment. We think we notice a dis position here and there to betray the confidence. No one tells right out what the president Is going to say, or reveals the recommendations he is go ing to make. But there is a good deal of indirect discussion ot the matters Involved, so that when the message appears some of the points will have been threshed out in advance, and the president will seem to be dealing in second-hand goodB. The information can be found elsewhere, as in some of the department reports, so that it can not certainly be charged that actual violation of the president's confidence has taken place. But the suggestion of special interest in the subjects dis cussed probably comes from a read ing of the message, which contains several matters of great interest Waterbury American. It is surprising how close some newspapermen can come to violating the confidence reposed in them and still stand technically free of the charge. It is afcln to genius for a man to truthfully foreshadow the con tents of a presidential message with out quoting it or making use of lan guage which may be traced directly to its pages. It has been noticeable that the discussion of the leading ques tions for several days past must have given he readers of some papers the impression that "great minds run in the same channel." ' . 

EDITORIAL NOTES. Out west they are of the opinion that the Lord loves a cheerful liver as well as a cheerful giver. It Is now put forth that in order to see the brightest people of a town Christmas shopping should be done early. Happy thought . for today: The man who can laugh heartily several times every day is pretty free from megrims. The only way to properly hunt deer is to stalk them. To go after them in an auto is not much better than trap ping them. At Chicago balls, nothing stronger than ginger pop is allowed to be sold on the premises after one o'clock in the morning. In a Wisconsin town buttermilk was used to put out a fire that threatened the whole town. This is a new use for lactic fluid bacteria. There is little danger of a war be tween the United States and Nica ragua, for it is not large enough to make a respectable target. The conclusion has been reached that the patience of this country with tho muss-making Latin republics has been worn about threadbare. President Taft admits that he can not do it all in one message, and that special messages will be convenient in the future as in the past. New Jersey has decided that it will build no more macadam or telford roads. The high-speed automobile traffic has made them no good. Prices of goods are going up in this country and in all countries, so there we are. Every man's wallet is the local point in all languages. Two pages and a third of The Bul letin today contain a short presiden tial message. Abraham 'Lincoln's models would fit In five to the column.

"It's great, believe me." Miss Maloney leaned back In her chair with an ah- of mingled annoy ance and resignation. "I might have known it," she said. "I've Just about made up my mind that they ain't ev er goln' to be anything but turkey in one shape or another for me in this world." "What alls you?" asked Miss Mel bourne, in considerable surprise. "Well," said Miss Maloney, "I was out in the country over Thanksglvin'. One of ma's cousins asked me to come out and eat dinner With her. She said in the afternoon we'd ride around and visit with the other relatives that live in the neighborhood and then 1 could come hack and sleep at her house. "When I told Ma Jones, the lady that keeps the boardin' ..house, that I wasn't goln to be there Thanksgivin day she was awful kind of provoked. She said she'd been countin' on me to keep things goln' at her table on Thanksgivin' day. There's an awful Jolly crowd at the boardin' hous?, and Ma Jones Just loves to see th-j boarders have a good time. She says to me. 'Now, Miss Maloney, you bein' the cut-up of the house and all, It's goln' to queer the whole thing if you go and ditch us.' "Well, I was real sorry, so I says, 'Why can't you have your Thanksgiv in' day dinner the night before? I ain't goln' till Thanksglvin' day morti in and we could have our turkey din ner here the night before and dance in the parlor and have a pile of fun.' "Ma Jones was game. She put it up to the other boarders and they was all tickled to death. So that was the way she fixed it for us. "Well, the noon before Thanksgivin' I went over to the club to lunch and they was havln the dandiest bunch of eats you ever saw turkey and cram b'ries and everything so I took a big plateful and ate so much I went to sleep three times in the afternoon, but by night I was all ready for another feed. "Sure enough. Ma Jones had a swell dinner and we all et plenty, but she wound up with some good strong cof fee, so by mldntgnt we was au wiae awake and havin' the time of our lives.
