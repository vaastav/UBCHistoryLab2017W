Seward W. Baker, tbc night clerk, be ing alone m tlie office, was attacked byttvomen, who felled him with a *• scad cloh," <a long, narrow Lag, filled with sand,) and then proceeded to rob the rafes of a large earn of money and valuables, variously stated from f20,000 to SIOO,tOD. Several persons inttfpling to leave by that day'a steamer bad money on deposit, and by the loss of I* were obliged to wait. The clerk was found insensible and bleeding ct the nose; and Ills probable the entire tram-action was done within five minute*. At last accounts, over fifty suspicions characters had l»ecn arrested, but without clearing up the mystery. A fine brick building, occupied by officers, Ac., In the garrison at Foil Smith, with nearly all iia contents, was destroyed by fire early on the morning of the 53d nit. Rev. ilr. Springer, Poet Chajilain, and h>« wife, bad a narrow escape from a homd death. The former was obliged to let himself down from on upper story on tbepQ lars of the piazza, while tLc wife was rescued and carried down stairs with the greatest dtlßcnlty. One of tbc telegraph operators was obliged to let himself down by a grape vine. Capt. Churchill and his wife escaped unharmed, and saved most of tbeirfnnilturc. LienL Cob Craig, Adjutant Gen eral, lost all of his effects, all the valuable records of Ids office being destroyed. Ibe servants in the basement of tbc bnllding lost nearly all their ; clothing. Mr. JlcMnblc, telegraph operator, bad barely time to get down slain. He and the other i employes of the office, lost nearly all their effects. Gen.

The war between Spain nod Chill has had the same effect upon the price of copper at the re bellion in the South had npon ißfc price of cotton. Copper le now the idol of the day; even gold pales before its gathering grandeur In the eyes of those who have large stocks on h«na. The recent advance In Great Britain has been followed here. In less a week ingot copper advanced from thirty-nine to forty-five cents per pound in most of the Atlantic -cities, but It cannot now be purchased at forty-five cents. This, as was expected, has created intense ercUemcnt among the copper mining companies, ■who have advanced their stocks to correspond with the times. Statistics of the copper mining com panies of bake Superior show that there are ninety four with their offices sttnated princi pally in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. The combined number of shares is estimated at 1,900,000. They claim that the amount paid in is $18,109,141, not iiifiniiing the original cost of mining nor the sums derived from the sale of copper which have been expended developing the mines. The aggre gate of cash dividend* is claimed to be $5,600,093. Tbc Boston Herald eays it is a well known fact among the business men of Boston that some time since a large lanorting wise firm violated the revenue law, and a compromise was effected with the Treasury Bepartmcnt at Washington, by which any prosecution against the firm would be abandoned on their paying into the hands ol the Collector of the port a fine of f125,0u0. This amount wan paid to Hon. John 7„ Goodrich, and be gave a receipt for the same, «nd the hooks at the Custom House show tbet this sum went into the custody of the cashier. The books of Uie firm above alluded to, howetci, show that slh?.uoo was the.amonnl paid, and it is rumored that the differ -enoc in the two amounts was divided'among several parties in the shape ol commlatdonr, compensation for services, etc. One man, and he not the Collec • tor, certainly got some $6,900 of the s3i,ot», bat where the bt 1 ° r, '’* > west is not known with any de gree of certainty. Tbc case has been before the Grand Jury, bat at present they can do nothing -withit, although ills understood that the tnallur will not be allowed to rest until it U satisfactorily tfiylalaed.

During the fiscal year ending June 30,18614,161,- T|B acres of public land* were surveyed, Tboag 'gngate quantity of surveyed public lands undis posed of September 30, 1865, was 132,285,035 acres. .Thehomes'cadlnw has been In operation since the first day of January, 1863. Large bodies of lands hare been entered under its provision.*. Five ytars continued residence is necessary to the per fection of the title of a homestead settler, unless be prefers toparcbas<iibe lands a£ the minimum price, and obtain a patent. It Is estimated that from forty to fifty per cent of persons who bare so claim ed the privilege of the homestead law will prefer to make payment, and tmis secure title before the ex piration ol the period when it would otherwise vest. The nominal sum paid by tbe homestead settler, end tbe fee which he pays to tbe local officers, are sufficient to cover the expense Incident to tbe sur vey and the disposal of lire land. After recommendations of a settlement of Span ish and Mexican titles in Arizona and New Mexico, the report says: . The organization of a Bureau of Mining was re 'commended in the last annual report of this De partment, and the attention ol Congress is acain tamed to the subject. All lands-denominated mineral, which do not bear the precious mrials. should be brought Into market, and thus placed under me guardianship of private owners, id no other mode, it ts believed, can tbe great forests of timber, the growth of centuries, and of vest value lo the nation, be effectually preserved from waste. Individual proprletorsolp. It is conceded, would stimulate tbe development of coal fields, petrole um, deposits of iron, lead, and of other gross met als and mineral ■ There can, therefor' 4is and mlnuai formations, -aere can, thereiore, be no euff dent reason for withholding such mino rs! lands from market Congress baa not legUla'.ed with a view to securing an Income from the product of the precious metals from the pubbe domain. It U estimated that two or three hundred thousand able-bodied men arc engaged In such mining opera tions on the public lands without authority of law, ■who pay nothing to the Government for the privi lege, or for the permanent possession of property worth, in many instances, millions to the claimant. The existing financial condition of the nation ob viously requires that ail our national resources, and the product of every industrial pursuit should con tribute to the payment of the national debt. The wisdom of Congress must decide whether the pub lic Interest would be better promoted by a sale in tee of those mineral lands, or by raising a revenue from their annual product. The Impolicy ot Buf fering them to remain In their present condition, without any species of legislation regulating or de fining the rights of the parties in interest, must bo apparent to aIL

The number of navy invalid pension* allowed on origins! applications during that fiscal year was two hundred and fifty, and there were seven nary inva lids whose pennons were Increased. Two hundred and sixty-six navy pensions were awarded to wid ows or other dependent relatives of deceased offi cers, seamen or marine?. The aggregate amount raid to naval pensioners of all dosses was two hun dred and five thousand four hundred and eighty dollars and sixty-two cents, ($305.480.0.)

No necessity exists, nor is any likely ever to occur, for tbc large and constantly increas ing accumulation of this food; but further legisla tive action is necessary to subject it lo tbe payment of ail classes of navy pensions. The pension agencies which were suspended to the late rebellions States arc being restored as rap idly a* possible, and agents have been appointed at Richmond, Va., Nashville and Knoxvulc, Tcnn.. Little Rock, Ark, and New Orleans. La. The names ofall those who participated in tbe rebellion against tbe United b tales, aud of those who have been proven disloyal, have been dropped from the rolls. The increasing number of pension applications requires that tbe appropriation for the should largely exceed that mode for the current fiscal year.

Their sacrifices for an imperiled coomryhave been blessed In the preserv ation of its unity, tbe maintenance of- the lostan thortiy of the national Government, and the vin dication of tho principle# of civil liberty, which the fathers ot the Republic bequeathed to their children. INDIAN ATT AXES. The number of Indians rcdldlag within the Jons* diction of the United States does not probably ex ceed 230,00 m large majority or whom maintained, during the past ytnr, peaceful relations. Soma of them have made gratifying progress in civilization and manifested, daring the lain war, a steadfast loyalty to our flag worthy of emphatic commenda tion. Civilized and powerful tribes, however, re dding within the Indian territory, united early in the year ISCI with the Indians of the prairin un mediately wc?t and nor*b, for hostile operations against the United States. In flagrant violation of treaties which t»wt been observeu by ns with ecru* pnloss good tilth, and in the absence of any Just ground of complaint, these confederated Indians entered into an alliance with the rebel authorities and raised regiments In support of their cause. Their organized troops fonpht side by side with rebel soldiers, and detached bond* made frequent assaults on the neighboring white settlements, which were without adequate means of defence, and on the Indians who maintained friendly relations wlththls Government. This stale of things con tinued until the surrender of the rebel forces west of the Mississippi. Hostilities were then suspended, and, at the request of the Indians, com misrioners were sent to negotiate a treaty of peace- Such preliminary arrangements were road-* as, it la believed, will result in the abolition of sla very among them, the cession withi.i the Indian territory of lands for the settlement of the civilized Indians now residing on reservations elsewhere, and the ultimate establishment of civil govern ment, subject to the supervision of the United ** The perfidious conduct of the Indians in making unprovoked war upon us has been visited with the severest retribution. The country wi'hia the In dian territory bas been laid waste, vast amounts or property destroyed, and the inhabitants reduced from a prosperous condition to such extreme desti tution. th*t thousands of them must inevitably perish during the present winter, unices timely provision do made by the Government tor their re lief. * Hostile relations, fact or have existed for several generations, continue, between many of the most fierce and warlike tribes of New Mexico and Ari zona and the white inhabitants. A considerable military force is necessary for the protection of the latter and the maintenance of public order. The Indians of the plains, who subsist chiefly on buChlo, follow them on their migration toward the north in the early part of the summer, and return in autumn, spreading over the western wart of the Stale of and the Territories of Nebraska, Dakota, Montana and Colorado. Influenced by the onlriendly Indians of the southwest, and probably Incited by rebel emissaries, they maintained active aud vigorous hos tilities. Our defenceless frontier set tlements were harassed; the communication be tween the Mississippi valley and our possessions on the Pacific seriously interrupted; emigrant and Government trains assailed; property of great value destroyed, and men, women and children [ barbarously murdered. It became the imperative ; duty of the Government to send military expedi- , tions again?t these savages, which checked the commission of further outrages, and induced them to sue for peace. On the recommendation of the generals in command of our forces, a commission, composed of officers of the army and civilians, was sent to tbeUpncr Arkansas and the Upper Missouri. Satisfactory treaties have been negotiated with a luge number of these tabes. Some of them could cot be tesched on account of tho lateness of the season, bat It is believed that similar arrangements can be made with them during the early part of the aP^i^d^culFto l malntalnpeaceful relationswllh the Indians in Minnesota.

Tb« attempted destruction of 'threehundred thousand of these people, accustom ed to a nomadic life, subsisting upon the spontan eous productions of the earth, and familiar with the fastnesses of the mountains and the swamps of the plains, would involte on appalling sacrifice of the lives of our soldiers and" frontier settlers, and the expenditure ot untold treasure. It is estimated that the maintenance of each regiment of troops engaged against the Indians of the plains costs the Government tiro million dollars per annum. All the military operations of last summer hire not occasioned the immediate destruction of more than a tew hundred Indian warriors. Such a policy Is manifestly as imoracticabie as it Is in violation of every dictate of humanity and Christian duty. If Is therefore recommended that stringent legis lation 1 - be adopted for the punishment of violation* ot the rights of persons and property of members of Indian tribes who arc at peace wltbjhc Govern ment.
