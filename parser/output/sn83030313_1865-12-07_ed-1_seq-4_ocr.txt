UROPE. Tho Canadian steamship Hibernian arrived at Part .ad yesterday, with news from Europe one day later. Tho war hot ween t-'paiu and Chile had oocasioned gr-at excitement among the merchants of both France and England, and they were urging thoir respective govern ments to interfere actively in ftivor of the Chileans. The shipowners of Liverpool were preparing to use the blockade runners cost out of employment by the end of the American war in Chile. Stephens, the reputod Fenian Head Centro of Ireland, had mysteriously cscaped from the prison in which he had been confined. ? Under the impression that there was no immodlato danger of a rupture with this country on the Alabama claims, United States securities remained Arm in the London marmot. Kive-tweutk-s'wero quoted on the 24th inst. at 04 MISCELLANEOUS. St. John, New Brunswick, was somewhat excited yes terday by rumors of an intended Kouiau raid on tliat place from the United States, but nothing dounite in re gard to tho matter has yet developed itBolf. A condensed and carefully prepared statement of the receipts and expenditure's from all sources and for all purposes, of the national gov ernment for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of Juno last, as shown by the report of the S??etary of the Treasury, is given In another portion of this morning's Hkkai.d. ihe total receipts were a little over ono thousand eight .hundred and ton millions of dollars, of which nearly two hundred *nd nine and a hatf millions were from internal revenue, eighty-live millions from customs, and about Ave and a half millions consisted of commutation money from drafted persons. The total expenditures wore a little over ono thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven millions of dollars, one thousand and thirty-one millions being for the army, and ono hundred and twenty-two and a half millions for the navy. The outstretching arms of our commerce and the trado necossities. consequent on the gold discoveries in Cali fornia^iaving of late years made tho Sandwich' Islands a place of interest to Americans, the sketch of the history, manners and customs of the inhabitants of '.hat distant region presented by our Honolulu correspondent will be found entertaining. The population amouuin to about four hundred thousand, and the people have reached quite an advanced stage of tfillgbtonmeul, boing well supplied with newspapers, books and school >. As an ovidcnce of their civilization it is mentioned that in thoir couhs they have trials for murder, perjury, polyjjatny, burglary, assault and battery, larceny and all the other crimes known to civilized society. Business and (;eno rai industry are flourishing, and on the whole the islands are doing well. The coolie labor system lias recently been inaugurated, but has not yet been sufficiently tested to enable a judgment of its results to be formed from actual experience. (Jovornor Bramlette, id hia mewte rocently delivered to the Kentucky Legislature, says that. th" result of the lata war having put at rent the heresy of seoesatou, it only remains for the Judiciary, by passing upon the oaso of the cliiet traitor, to decide all attempts to enforce the dogma treason, and to have it Dually diapos 1 of for ever. The Governor again urges upon the Legislature the adoption of the anti -slavery amendment to the na tional constitution, and advocates encouraging a superior claia of laborers to immigrate into the State. Ha gives eighty-nine thousand Ave hundred as the number of troops, white and colored, furnished by Kentucky to the Union armies. The people of Richmond, one of our correspondent!* in that city informs u?, are considerably exercised in ml ad over the report, noticod in Tuesday's Hbkalo, that General Butlor is shortly to become military commander thoro, and many of them are disposed to think that bis anticipated assumption of the control of. affairs in Virginia Is In some way connected with the intended trial of Jeff. Davis. Our correspondent also alludes to some incidents of recent occurrence in the ex-rehel capital not at all creditable to the individuals concerned, and which indicate that a strongly disloyal feeiing is still entertained in leading Riohmond circles. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia yester day denied the application of James and Richnrd H. Pot ter for a mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Trea sury to i>ay them an alleged award of nine thousand dollars for supplies furnished tho t'tab expeditionary army. There was no meeting of the B'iaril of Aldermen yes terday, only four members answering to their namei when tho roll was called, and the Board was declared ad journed tine die. The Board of Educa ion last evening confirmed the nominations for Inspectors of Common Schools in the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh dis tricts. The nomination In the First district was not con firmed because of the nominee being a non-resident of the district Tho Board also adopted a resolution to clow the public schools to-day in observance of Thanksgiving They will remain closed until Monday next. The BoanWof Fire Commissioners held a meeting yes terday, but did not transact a large amount of business. Some minor appointments were announced, requisitions ware made on the Comptroller for one hundred thousand dollars, and payment was ordered of bills amounting to some twentjr-four thousand dollars. An engine is to be placed In the Corporation yard, to b?(operated by the em ploy as. The Board adjourned to Wednesday next at ten o'clook A. M. A large number of workmen of the city assembled last evening in the Cooper Institute to discuss the question of the abridgment of the day s labor to eight hours. The gathering was an Immense one, filling the great hall of the Institute In every part- The proceedings were admirably conducted, and there was some good and perti nent speaking on the question. The leaders in the move ment had. invite* friends and sympathisers in the learned professions, and on the platform there we're repreeenta tives of the bar, tli* pulpit and the press. The Indies' Protective Association was numerously represented, as were aim the fettle members of worklngmen's families. An excellent band of muste was in attendance.

Patrick McCrudden, an officer attached to the Court of General Sessions, and whose residence was on the oorner of Prince and Mulberry streets, while In the drinking house on the northwest oorner of Broom* and Marion streets, early yesterday morning, was assaulted by the bar keeper, Patrick Dwyer, who, It.is allecred, fired three pistol shots at htta, all of which took efiut producing injuries which it Is thought impossible for Mco'rudden to survive. The lattor was taken to the New York Hospital, and Dwyer was arrested and locked up.

The Proceedings of Con?re*? unci tho President'* P#?UIoii. The people of (his country have been in dulging Uie hope for the last few months that the war tvnH being closed up, its wounds wore being liealod, and that* we woro about to emerge from tho shock of domestic convul sions to pence and harmony. They believod, us Speaker Colfax said in his opening address lo Congr(*3s on Monday, that "poaoo roignod from shore to shore in our land." They thought, from the universal support given to President Johnson and the eulogiuras passed upon him and his policy by all parties, during the late elections, that wo had ontorod upon a new and an astonishing period of harmony. In fact, there was no other issup but this. Both republicans and democrats cfoimed tho Presi dent, and made him and his policy their plalr form. The former wore particularly positive and earnest in thoir appeals to the people on this; and it was on that ground, doubtless, thoy obtained such an overwhelming success over their opponents. It was tho doubt which ex isted as to thS sincerity of tho demoorats in professing to support the President that de feated thorn, and confidence in the professions of tho republicans that gave them tho victory. At the time the Proaidwul was making as much progress .ui ])(!.;. :l)!e to restore the Southern SiatoB and lo have 'heir representatives ready to litke seata in Congress his name was tho ban n r and tl.e 1. attic cry ot the elections.

Now lot us lc.' k :? !. tie ot'.cr. The smoke of the contest is l:?rdly cleared vway; for m 'ny days, or weeks, at ft illicit, have not pansed since tho elec. ion. Tlio President has not changed in he in; aniime, except that he has been moro urgent and emphatic ^n demanding of the .^outli such measures us will satisfy the North. Yet in tho face of these facts W3 see a sudden atttuult made upon Mr. Johnnon's policy by tho very party which claimed bim, and by the very men who obtained their se.iti through using his name and pretending to support him. Th-y did not even wait till Iho Presldont could in form them by message what b? was doing and proposed to do, or what was tho condition ot affair*. A decent respect to tho Chief Magis trate and for the views ho might express in tho mode ^escribed by the constitution was the least that might have been expected from those who claimed to be liis party and who so lately professed to bo his warm supporters. It is the first Congress, we believe, that over acted in such a m.inner, and tho act shows plainly tho revolutionary character of that body. Nover ID the histft?7 of the country had the chi?-f of the nation sneh important mattor td communi cate and Bubmit to Congress; never did tbut body need full official information more, and never whs careful deliberation more required. Yet the first day? the first houre of the session? befoi - the President had timo to Bend his mo't sage, i.h<*3? men be,jan to legislate oiKthe most important questions, and that in a manner directly in conflict with Lis policy. Why lhi.-? unseemly haste? Why this disrespect and covert hostility to the President? We suppose Thaddeus Stevens, Summer, Wade, Wilson and other revolutionary radicais of that stripe oan tell the reason; but we think the greater part of the conservative republicans can not Looking at both sides of tbi* , picture we do not hesitate to say t!>at ? there never was a greater fraud committed upon a pooplc ? upon their constituencies ? than tho member* lately olocted to this Congre?s have committed ? that is, judging from their conduct at the commencement of the session. We can only hope that the major ity have been deceived themselves? carried away, as It were, in an unguarded moment by an artftil and unscrupuloua consplraey, and that they may get out of the trap Into which they have fallen. The whole proceedings, the snap judgment that was taker, the concert of I action In both bouses, the leaders of the move ment. ns Sumner, Thad Stevens, Ben Wade and Wilson; the radical revolutionary measures initiated and the secrecy maintained till the last moment? all show that It was a matured conspiracy against the President and his policy. It reminds us of the convention dnring the French Revolution. That is th? nearest par allel in history we know it. Our Jacobins are as rabid, impracticable and prescriptive as the Jacobins of the French Revolution were, and if allowed to have their own wajr tl?y Vfll plunge J he country Into tb? jjgtt bloody aSRITy ST" their p*rotolyp?5? diJ FrSJ^?-^| with pleasure, howeVer, that some of Qi membors of the Honae ? and the membsrs of this great State ars particularly montioned? are alarmed at tho false step they ha** keen dragged Into, and will not follow tho lead ol our American Marats, Conthons and Robe <? I tarred any fbrt'ic . '?r,.re? ?, U.Ib r i ( 01 ben from the Southern States; for each house u the judge in such oasou, and a majority rules. The constitutionality of rejecting the members from whole States, and of the present proceed ings of Congress on the subjeot, are very ques ' 'tionable; but the President has no power over the matter. All he can do is to restoro the States to t^at point, put all their local State machinery in motion, withdraw the military, and leave them la the enjoyment of local self government He oughtr and we think he will, puraue the even tenor of his way in restoring them. He can perform his duty, If Congress does not perform its duty. If that body be revolutionary and anarchical, he oan be con servative. A conflict between the policy of the Executive and Congress on this subject would be very unfortunate, would embarrass our finances, paralyse our industry, and bring many evils upon us, but would not necessarily he the worst of evils. The country would be kept disturbed another year or so; but the people would settle the difficulty at the next elections. Should the Southern States be kept out of this Congress it is quite evident the next Congress would be chosen of a different character. A new conservative party would grow up and sink the fhotion that has now at tained power by a gross political fraud deeper than ev#r plummet sounded. If the President pursues firmly the even tenor of bis statesman like polioy, he may be assured the conserva tive masses will approve of his oourse, and, as soon as they can speak, will choose a different set of men to sustain bim. General Grant's Report of the Dutrae tion of the Military Power of the Con ffderacjr. General Grant's report is the description of the final gigantic effort by which the United States cruHhod the greatest rebellion of which any memory in preserved in tbe history of the bmnan raco. Distinctly and straightforwardly it tolls how tho nation, putting into one at tempt a power equal to what it had before wasted in twenty ? a power greater than the world believed it to possess ? balanced thereby tbe advantages of position and interior lines that the enemy had, and brought him to the earth by the unrelenting repetition and weight of its blow*. In tho lavish use of our superior power and in properly concerted action, East and Wont, lay, In General Grant's view, tho solution of the problem of the war. It was common sense applied to ques tions of strategy that had been mystified by technloal jargon. "The armies in the Bast and West acted independently and without concert, like a balky team, no two ever pull ing together." Now the East struck ? now the West ? and the enemy was able to use the same force to meet both. The necessity was to over come that fact by "the use of the greatest num ber of Uoops practicable" at. the proper times, and then "to hammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and bis resources until, by more attrition, if in no other way, there should bo nothing, left to him but an equal submission with tho loyal section of our common country to tbe constitution and laws of the land." Such is the simple theory on which Grant directed tbe lapt grand operations of tbe war. His success tbe oountry knows. Even with out bis report, every stop of the way is forever famous. The "let-alone policy" that demoral ized tho onoiny west of tbe Mississippi and sent homo a foroe of forty thousand rebels that resistance would have kept out; the fearless penetration of the Southwestern country by Sherman, with its bloody incidents all along the way to Atlanta and thence to tbe sea, and the other incident of Hood's army straying all (bo way up to Nashville to make Sherman's retreat "worse than Moscow;" the terrible com lntd, fought step by step, from the Rapidan to. Richmond, and the final triumph there ? all these are tho household words of the country ? the recognition of tho great events of the greatest period of our national life. Grant date* Sherman's march to tho sea from Davis' celebrated spcoch at Macon ? a speech in which be stated the weakness of tbe South, and dis closod his p}an for sending Hood into Ten nessee. Davis there exhibited tbe weakness of supposing that an army that had been beaten and fearfully decimatcd in a vain attempt at tbe defensive could successfully undortake the offensive against tbe army that had so often Weaton it, and while be did so be showed Sher mnn where to strike. Grant's account of the campaign against Richmond is particularly full and clear, and bis tributes and references to all his great lieu tenants ? Shtrman, Sheridan, Thomas and Meade ? give tbe country further illustrations of tbe noljle frankness of bis nature. ftlis re port, as thCTecord of great events by the hero of all, is an invaluable contribution to (he national history. Nobody to Bi-amk.? Russell S. Chidsey, James Tyler, Edwtnl Johnwon, George W. Mill?r, Edward Davw, Mury Frincif ind S. W. Edin^er, seven persons, were butchered i few dajB since on the Now Jersey Central Railroad. They were guillotined in tfao most ingonious way. The express truin in which they were ran into a coal train, and one car was lifted and driven with awful force through another car, ihu bottom edge just even with the heads of the passengers. Since the occurrence a coro ner's jury of so called "good and lawful men," who allege thai they are conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, has been in ses sion near the scene of the aooident, trying to And some plea on which to justify the act. After a patient soarch of three days for such a plea the jury fkiled to find one, and then resolved to do without it; ho it comes boldly ont and justifies the act in defiance of all the circum stances. It declares that there was nobody to blame. "We cannot," say these wonderfVil jurors, "attach blame to any of the employes on the trains or to the company."

Among the new theatrical enterprises In contemplation in this metropolis that of the new French theatre is the moet prominent. The building is in process of erection and will be ready for oooupancy soon after the com mencement of the New Tear. This theatre will be of the most comfortable dimensions. Instead of a big barn, like the Academy of Music, where the voices of most of the per formers are lost in the realms of space, or a little room, so small that the orchestra deafens the audienee, the French theatre will hit the happy medium. We understand that the interior arrangements will be some what similar to those of the Opera Comique, at Paris. The upper portion of the house will be divided into small boxes that will be really private, and not open to all curious eyes and ears, like the ao-oalled pri vate boxes of the Academy first tier. Sociality will be enoouraged among the audience. At present it is impossible to enter or leave one's seat at the opera'or the t^atres without dis turbing and incommoding an entire row of people, and the slightest attempt at conversa tion is ohecked by admonishing hisses. Under these circumstances, as the play is dull, the opera not worth hearing, conversation inter dioted and exit impossible, the only resource of the ladies is to study each other's toilettes and of the gentlemen to go to sleep. People attend the present performances, not to enjoy themselves or to meet their friends, but to show off their fine clothes, which are generally pretty well damaged in getting in and out of the narrow, inconvenient stalls. In the new French theatre all this is to be reme died. There will be good performances for those who care to listen, and those who wish to talk can do so without dis turbing the others. If any one doslres to go out or to visit his friends' boxes ho can ac complish this without any noise or confusion. You may attend in lull dress if .you want to bo oonspiouous, or in ordinary attire if you choose to be unnoticed. Undoubtedly this theatre will be patronised by our best people. It will have its habitues, like the famous old Olympic. Its boxes will be engaged weeks in advance for family parties, and Young New York will drop in to while away an hour or two every evening. The new theatre will be demoted to per formances in both the English and French lan guages. We believe that Mr. E. L. Davenport will present English plays on four nights of the week, and M. Juignet will bring out French oomedies, vaudevilles and comic operas on the other two evenings. Of the talents of these gentlemen, both as actors and managers, it is unnecessary to speak. Mr. Davenport promises to colleot an unequalled company of Amerioan artists, and he will enoourage the Ametioan drama, which has too long been sup pressed by the lack of taste and tact which distinguishes the British adventurers who now manage the majority of our places of amuse joaent. M. Juignet, on the other hand, has made engagements with admirable French comedians, and we presume that some of the leading favorites of his former company will be re tained. Besides this, ha. will import a troupe of French comic opera singers, of a olass seldom heard by the publio of this oity. The per formances he will give win be invaluable both to our native artists and to those in the audienoe who wish to acquire the French language in its purity. Now-a-days almost everybody learns something of Frenoh, and M. Juignet's new theatre will afford an excellent oppor tunity to learn the Parisian aooent and pronun ciation. The people go to our opera to hear Ita lian words sung or shouted by German singers, or by Italians who can only speak a dialect of their language as different from the genuine Italian as the Canadian patois is from pure French, or the Lancastershire gibberish from pure English. We hgpe that Manager Grau's opera troupe, which ii to perform here in the spring, will offer us something better than this vooal murder ; but still, in a city where so many persons understand a Uttle French, and so few persons understand any Italian, the French opera comique will be our main re source for that sort of amusement, and the grand operas which Grau will produce must be con sidered as exceptional treats. There is no reason, however, why this metropolis should not support both a grand Italian opera, under Grau, arid a comic French opera, under Juignet ; and we look forward to such a reaction and reform in musical circle? as will justify us in predicting the permanent success of both these enterprises. . Without speculating as to the probable cha racter of the other new theatres to be opened la Broadway and on the corner of Twenty-third stroet and Eighth avenue, we certainly expect that Messrs. Juignet and Davenport will assist us in our work ot theatrical reform by showing the public how good theatres ought to be built and oondueted, and how good plays ought to be accepted, produced and acted. Mr. George Christy, of the original Christy's Minstrels? a troupe famous both in this country and in Europe as the originators of this popular style of entertainment? has cleverly followed up the reform in Ethiopian minstrelsy which we sug gested \nd which the Callfornians and Thorpe A Overin's band had begun. Christy has 1 opened a beautiful little hall in the white marble bnlldlng in Twenty-fonrth street, near Fifth avenue, and has already made it the resort of some of the best funlllee in the oity. The locality is very accessible; the decorations of the elegant half are In the best taste, and Mr. Chiiaty himself leads an exoellent troupe In a brief and spark ling performance. The most of the melodies so popular during the recent war originated with negro minstrels, and Christy has only to give the publld similar songs to become a per manent institution. And we are here reminded of one reform in negro minstrelsy which hr? already been brought about by the attention we have called to the subject, and which is set forth in the following card in the advertising columns of yesterday's Hx*au> v? to tm mrroa or van rauLD.

NEIL BRYANT, of Bryant*' Minstrels. Accompanying this card was an advertise ment, which we printed. It is very certain that the Bryants are by no means the only members of the Managers' Association who regret hav ing had anything to do with It; but they are the first who have had the candor and good sense to oome out publicly admit, as they %li -vlinlt privately, th* Managers' Asso rt .n La i v jry illl / aql cfcUottlfu* fotturr, *> far as its aftempt to interfere with the press to oonoerned. and that the action of the associated managers against the Herald was most foolish and ill-advised. We have no objection to print the Bryants' advertisement, or that of any other reputable place of amusement; but we did not object when the managers took their advertise ments away, and we do not ask them to bring their advertisements back. This is a mere matter of business, which concerns themselves alone, and in which they ought to be wise enough to consult their own interests. But as a proof of the practical dissolution of an asso ciation which impudently attempted to check theatrical reforms and to assail the Huuld for proposing them, the card of Neil Bryant will be welcome to all who hope for a new and better era in dramatic affairs. Report of the Postmaster Otstrsl. The American people hare become so ac customed to the statement annually made by their Postmaster General that a deficiency exists in the Postal Department of the govern ment that anything to the oontrary must awaken emotions of surprise. They mnst, therefore, be not only astonished but pleased te learn from the report just published that the1 receipts of the department for the ourrent year were above the expenditures by the handsome sum of over three-quarters of a million of dol lars. The estimate for the ooming year, how ever, shows a deficiency of over a million of dollars, wbloh is covered by appropriations al ready made and unexpended. The mail servioe in operation on June SO, 1865, embraced six thousand and twelve routes, of the aggregate length of one hundred and forty-two thousand three hundred and forty miles, costing $6,246,884 (exclusive of compensation to route and other agents, amounting to $556,602). The num ber' *of postage stamps issued during the year was three hundred and eighty-seven million four hundred and nineteen thousand four hun dred and fifty-five, representing $12,099,787 ? an increase of $1,873,108 over the previous year. An appropriation will be neoessary for the San Franoisco, Japan and China steamship line from January 1 to June 30, 1867, of $250,000; Brazil line, for eight monthB of the present and the whole of next year, $250,000. The Postmaster General speaks hope fully of the prospects of revenue from the Southern States after the re-establishment of the postal system in that section. Refer ences to the misapplication of the postal fund will command the attention of Congress. One of the points made by the Postmaster. General is that of obtaining from Congress the right of giving subventions to sailing vessels for carry ing the mails. This is of especial importance as affecting our postal arrangements ? or rather want of arrangements ? with the Central Ameri can States. For instance, the mails between New York and Santa Marta, Carthage na,Ac^ in Colombia, lie (or weeks at Asginwall without being forwarded. Transactions with England are enormously on the increase, solely because there are three lines of subsidized steamers be tween the Colombian ports and Liverpool, whioh lines are directing the trade from us. The new postal treaty with Colombia is yet unfinished, and if it were not, it would not neoessarily bring about any great or immediate toolllties, unless both oountries united In a subvention to some oompany to undertake the servioe, and this to not probable. But as there are regular lines of tost sailing vessels from this to these Colombian ports, whioh, in toot, could deliver the United States mails there quioker than by any existing means, and really in much shorter time, the present proposed servioe would be a great benefit to both countries and grate telly acknowledged by our sister republio. Ths Pbmuwnt of ths Ssnatb. ? The Presi dent of the Senate, Mr. Foster, of Conneotiont, now occupies, to all intents and purposes, the position of Vice President of the United States. In the event of the death oi President Johnson, therefore, in the Interval to 1868, Mr. Foster, as he now Btands, would become President of the United States. He is understood to be a sort of semi-radical, semi-conservative old line whig; but it is probable that this is not enough for the leading radicals. Hence there may be , some truth in the report afloat that "there is some talk of a change in the presiding officer of the Senate." Perhaps Charles Sumner may be the coming man. Who knows? In any event, we trust that the life and health of Presi- , dent Johnson may be spared to the country to the end of his present term of office, and for many years after its expiration. A Proper Definition or the Public Drbt ? That of Secretary MoCulloch, who defines it, not as a public blessing, but as a public burdoo, to be got rid of as soon aa possible by bard work and economy. The House Committees.? Speaker Colta* is engaged in the appointment of the standing committees of the House; and we are glad to bear tb^t Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, will^oba ably succeed Mr. Thaddeua Stevens as ohair man on Ways and Means, who In the last Con gress proved himself a blundering financier. Mr. Raymond, it is said, will be made chair man on Foreign Affairs, which is very likely, as be is the proUgS of the Secretary of State, and the hopeful mon of the firm of Seward, Weed & Raymond. We hope, however, that if put at the bead of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee he will not play the artfal dodger on tbo> Monroe doctrine. Board of llmtln.
