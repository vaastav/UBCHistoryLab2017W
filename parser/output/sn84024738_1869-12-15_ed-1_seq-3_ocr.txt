gidtmmut giipidt; WEDNESDAY....DECEMBER lf>, 1 889. WASHINGTON NEWS. Correspondence of the Richmond Dispatch. WiiBWOWs, December 18,1889. There is quite an extensive amount of! talk just now about the passage of a sweep ing disability bill but much delav about setting the ball in motion. There is a growing feeling among the more sensible and loss vindictive Radicals in favor of a re moval of the restrictions under which so many of the white people living south oi the Potomac exist t and as it is known that the President, hacked up strongly bv Gen eral Sherman and, with only a few excep tions. the entire army aud navy, is also in favor of some general measure for removing political disabilities, the hope has been in spired that as soon as the session recom mences after the holiday recess the matter will take practical shape,* and be pushed to a very gratifying conelusion to those in fa vor ot ending the prescriptive measures that prevail to-dav. Senator Drake has grace enough to sav that he will not be able to impart his view's with reference to disabling the Supreme Court with all their force to his political as sociates. Some of them may agree with him in his crusade upon the judicial branch of the Government, but not enough to give his position the slightest dignity. It i> rather noticeable that Grant has very little association with politicians, no matter li ov exalted their station, and after the ex piration of the hours which he devotes to oftieiul duties he is very nuieh averse to re ceiving any but social visitors, who, of course, see "him with his family, and not in the executive office. This is riot agreeable to some of the over-enthusiastic adherent* of the party of progress, who imagine that the President is as much their property a* their overcoats or umbrellas. Grant's old army notions stick to him, and he will not discus* polities, although he is not apt to a-k questions of Congress, being pertectly willing to execute all the laws that congress men make. The proposals which some of the Cabinet officers have suggested to Congress to make an increase of salaries will receive some comment before adopted, even if they are. Those who cry so vehemently in favor of retrenchment and reform refuse to believe that there is any necessity for increasing salaries, and Horace Greeley backs tliem up fervently. Perhaps Congress does-not know that among the extraordinary expenses of the Government is an item of ?14,000 per annum expended as extra compensation outside of salaries for twenty-three clerks in tire office of the Secretary of the Trea- j suit. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs is still busy with bis annual report. This will be a very interesting document when com pleted. " The views ot congressmcnon the financial situation and the methods ot' solving the intricate national financial problem now be fore the rulers increase every day. The discussions on this topic are likely to be lengthv and labored. Everv man in Con cress imagines he knows the exact^ thing wanted to* put the nation's finances in the real groove ot certain success, but very few as vet agree on the topic. The Western members are fighting bard to secure an inflation of the currency, as serting that it will not retard the coming of specie payments an hour. Some of the East ern members are willing to cut oti a hun dred millions from circulation. It is thought here that the inflationists will carry the day, notwithstanding both the President and Secretary of the Treasury are for contrac tion. somehow or other, the lobby has not suc ceeded in getting fairly at work. Then* is an evident drawback somewhere. Possibly, however, thev will spring their influence alter New Year's Day. As yet there is no show for startling "jobs." There is too nun'h patriotism in Congress or too little money in the lobby to allow a very early commencement of operations. Timox. The Three Keeoustruction Bills. 1. Famsicorth's Bill. 44 Whereas the people of Virginia have adopted a Constitution republican in form, and have in all respects conformed to the requirements of the act of Congress enti tled ? an net authorizing the submission of the Constitutions of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, to a vote of the people, and authorizing the election of State officers provided "by the said Constitutions, and members ot Contjwess,' approved April 10, lbGO; therefore be it " ft'solved by the Senate and House of BopyescntaU'ccs of the United Statesof Ame rica hi Congress'assembled, .That tue said Mate of Virginia is entitled to representa tion in the Congress of the United Mules." 'A The following i> proposed as a substi tute by Mr. Paine, of the Reconstruction Committee : "Whereas the people of Virginia have adopted a Constitution republican in form, and have in all respects complied with the requirements of the several acts of Congress providing for the reconstruction of the late rehel States; therefore be it " llesoiced, dr., That the State of Virgi nia is entitled to representation in the Con gress of the United States." ' Mr. Butler introduced the following? viz. : '?'Whereas the people of Virginia have adopted a Constitution republican in form, and by its provisions assuring the equality of right in all citizens of the United states before the law, and has in all respects com plied with the requirements of the several acts of Congress providing for the recon struction of the late insurrectionary States ; rind whereas the Congress of the United States have received assurances, and are as sured, that the people of Virginia, and espe cially those heretofore in insurrection against the United States, have renounced all claims of any right ot secession in any State, and that they are now well disposed to the Uovei mnent of the United States, and will support and defend the Constitution thereof, and will carry out the provisions of the Constitution submitted by the recon struction acts of Congress, and ratified by the people of Virginia in letter and spirit: therefore he it ?'licsolccd, d'C., That the StateofYir ginia is entitled to representation in the Congress of the United States." These several propositions were referred to the Committee on Reconstruction. Whittlesey vs. SIcKenzie? Retroces sion of MexniMt"!#. In the House of Representatives Monday Mr. Paine, of Wisconsin, from the Commit tee on Elections, offered the following reso lution : 44 Whereas it is claimed that the retroces sion of the county of Alexandria to the State of Virginia,* by virtue of the act of Congress entitled 'an act to retroeede the county of Alexandria, in the District of Co lumbia, to the Slate of Virginia,' approved July 9, lS-iG, and of the proclamation -nf .Tumes K. Polk, President of the United Mates, made in pursuance of said act on the 7th day of September, 184G, was uncon stitutional*aud void ; and that Lewis Mc Kenzie, claiming a seat in this House as a representative of the seventh congressional district of Virginia, and alleged to be a citi zen of said Alexandria county, is ineligible to such seat because not an inhabitant of the said State of Y irginia ; therefore 44Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire whether said retrocession was unconstitutional and void, and if so, whether said Lewis Mc Kenzie is for that reason ineligible to a seat in thL House as the representative of the seventh congressional district of Virginia, and to report by bill or otherwise on or be fore the 10th day of January, 1870." Mr. Paine said he supposed lie might have offered the resolution as a question of privilege, but he preferred to ofi'er it in this way as a simple resolution for action at this time, and he hoped 110 exception would be taken to it. This was a question that the House would shortly be called upon to.J meet, and he thought'it desirable that there ' should be a report from the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. Piucklenburg, of Missouri, objected to the resolutiou. Mr. Paiiie then moved to suspend the rules. Mr. Logan, of Illinois, thought this a very Uuusual time to bring up this resolution, especially as the question of the constitu tionality o1 the act of retrocession had not been regularly raised. It has been decided that that act was constitutional, and no other decision has been' asked for, except bv thls resolution, end for that reason he objected to the reference. Mr. Paine said the question had been raised, and there is now a case pending in which it mifst be decided. It was not raised as an abstract question, but because the necessity existed to meet it promptly. The opposition seemed to come, however, from gentlemen who wore perhaps inter ested in the removal of the capital or seat of government, and he had no doubt, the op position could be explained in flr t war. If there was ho objection he woulu with draw the resolution. Objection was-made. Mr. Lo?ran was surprised that the Chair, man of the. Committee on Elections shoul-. i attribute lbe opposition to this measure (?< a desire for the removal of the capital. ? b had viewed it just the other way. l.:*I thought the gentleman from AViscon.-iu wanted to get a report upon this subject now, with an ulterior object in view. Mr. Grover. of Kentucky, asked Mr. Paine whether he knew to Vhat partv Mr. MoKenzie belonged, that howas sonnxiou fo rule him out. Mr. Paine replied that he believed Mr. McITeuzle belonged to tbe Kepublieai L party. Air. Farnsworth. of Illinois, suggested that Mr. AlcKenzie was reported to repre sent other people besides tlioso of Alexan dria county, A a., and he wanted to knov. if it was proposed to disfranchise all tin people of the coiurrcrional district if tin retrocession of Alexandria was declared unconstitutional. _ Afr. Paine said the gentleman knew ver* well what his views were toward Air. AI<: Kenzie, and he could hardly be accused o desiring to legislate him out without cause Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, though the resolution contemplated an act of injus tice which the House should not entertain, aud ho moved to lay it on the table. H withdrew it,however, temporarily,toallov further rem ., ivs. Mr. Sell nek, of Ohio, said he was prob: - bly the only suvvivor in the House of tho Congress that passed theactretrocedingtl,; county of Alexandria to Virginia son- ? twenty-three or twenty-five years ago. H" was a* member of the House then, and for twenty-five years the retrocession lias bee-: recognized 'as constitutional. The district of which Alexandria is a part has been electing members of Congress from time 11 time, and the right of representatives from that district has never been questioned. Yet now we are asked to make an outsid ? collateral question, and in his opinion if would be better to leave the law alone as i had stood for the past twenty-five or thirt;. years. Suppose, we get the opinion of the Con. mittee on the Judiciary that the act o' retrocession was unconstitutional, wha: have we then ? Why, we have simply the opinion of nine intelligent gentlemen as against the opinion of a large majority ol botlr Houses of the Congress that parsed the act of retrocession, and who 9uppo/od thev were doing a constitutional act. Since that time it had always been recognized as constitutional without a question, and he did not see why it should be raised now. The question was then taken upon Air. Randall s motion to lay the resolution 011 the table: and it was agreed to. In the Senate Alonday Air. Cattell pre sented the memorial of Thomas Jefferson Randolph, executor of Thomas Jefferson, asking the return of papers belonging to Thomas Jefferson now in control of the state Department. Referred to tlie Library Committee. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has affirmed the decision that when "bit ters," recognized as medicinal agents, are sold in original packages, and then retailed in smaller packages or bottles, such as are used bv retail dealers, both tlie original and the smaller packages must be stamped ac cording to the requirements of the law. Bills for a general amnesty have been in troduced in both the Senate and House, but the knowing ones say that in a short time a bili excluding from its provision only such as held high Federal, civil, military-, or naval position prior to the war, will be passed without "much opposition. After that, individual cases will be considered until all are finally relieved.? Washington let t er?A lex a ndria Gazette. How the Georgians Show their Loyalty. Special illsputch totlie Chronicle. Atlanta, Ga., December 13.?General Morgan, a leading Democratic member oi the Georgia Legislature, has published a rejoinder to Congressman Tift's letter, in which he says : "Neither"Senate nor IIousc intended to submit the question of eligibility of colored members to seats in the Legislature to the Supreme Court. The present Legislature never will re-seat negroes, nor will it pass the fifteenth amendment. These are settled facts. For myself, I have been a subuiissionist as long lis I intend to be, and have gone as far as I intend to go to gratify the unhallowed will and domineering spirit of a corrupt Congress." Democratic puj jrs quote the above as a manly sentiment and having tiie ring of the true metal. General Morgan occupies the seat of an expelled uegro member. Becclicr's Reply to a >'ote frojn Ron iter. Brooklyn, December 11. 1809. My Dear'Mr. Bonner,?1 took every state ment of every kind respecting the affair of which you write me " without time to in vestigate." The man was dying. Was that a time for sifting evidenceWhat was to be done must be done quickly. I asked only such things us should* determine whether 1 had a right to go forward. It was lor my own sake, therefore, that I hastily inquired, and' not to inculpate or to exculpate any one. But as you how call my attention to the fact that what I did lor "my own justifica tion is hanging over McFarland to liis in jury, and tends to forestall a verdict against him, 1 agree with you that I ought not to let it remain uncorrected. I should be as unwilling to do an act of injustice toward him as toward any one else. Concurring, therefore, with you that it is now due to McFarluud lor me to state that [ know of no legal proof against him on lliat point. 1 do so unhesitatingly. At the time that i >tated what 1 did. I thought of its relation only to other parties. I did not dream of its bearing upon McFarland. 1 urn truly yours, IIexry Ward Beecher. Mr. Greeley and tub New York Sun's Interviewer.?Mr. Greeley publishes a card in the New York Sun denying the accuracy of the "interviewer's" report of the con versation had with the " philosopher of the Tribune" last week, and published in the New York Sun. Mr. Greeley says that the "interviewer" concealed the fact that he was a reporter of the Sun; denies that the name of the Supreme Being was used by him in that conversation, whether profanely or otherwise; that he did not say he would have to testify on the trial of McFarland; and that he did not say he did not want to hurt Mac., &c. Finally, Mr. Greeley says what lie did say was substantially this: "That this marriage on a death-bed, besides giving the woman a legal right to be a mother to Richardson's young nutl doubly orphaned children, was operative maiulv in giving her a right, throughout her bfack and bitter future, to be called bv the name of him who for her sake was so foully mur dered, rather than that of his stealthy, cow ardly assassin; and this small mitigation of j her immeasurable woes I regarded as hu-1 mane and just. That is my opinion, and 1 propose to stand by it." Fire in Wilmington, N. C.? Wilming ton, 2Y.

Since then the curious observer who wanders the streets of that Oriental port may detect a Blight undertone of blasphemy in the business quarters, and science and Saxby come in for about an equal share of the malediction. !

The Pennsylvania Coal Trade.?Yes terday's Philadelphia Ledger thus speaks of the anthracite coal trade : "The coal trade, with the close of navi gation, is slacking otF materially, yet the orders for and the shipments of coal from this point are considerably in excess of the current receipts. For the last three days of last week there was quite an increase of orders for coal, fully maintaining prices. There has been only "a moderate supply of vessels at Port Richmond?the cold snap a week or ten days ago was received by captains as a caution not to venture too far north. The consequence was, freight' charges north were held high, and an indifference to load south, ex cept to open ports, generally prevailed. The few days of warmer weather since has pro duced some change in this respect, and ves sels are more numerous at about last week's rates. A number of vessels are on their way back from northern ports, and should they return to tin's port, venturing another trip, instead of stopping at the inlets where they belong, laying-up for winter quarters, the supply" of Vessels here may* be so in crcasea as to put down freights. The coal trade bv water, however, may be considered over. " The Reading railroad brought down for the week 80,0-12 tons against 127,777 tons for the previous week, and 123/201 tons since the 1st instant, the beginning of the company's lineal year, against 01,170 tons to corresponding time last year?an in crease of 02,091 tons." This is starting the new fiscal year favorably. The Schuylkill canal shipped for the week 10,594 tons against 29,427 tons the previous week, and for the season, 092,659 tons against 080,444 tons to same date in 1808?a decrease of 293,785 tons. " The entire tonnage of ail the carrying companies for the week was 409,472 tons against 398,571 tons the previous week. As some of the companies have ended their fiscal years, we omit the aggregate annual tonnage until the end of the year, when the aceouht can be more accurately presented. The annual anthracite production for 1809 will probably be about fourteen millions of tons?a quarter of a million of tons more or less short of the tonnage of 1808." Fresh Proofs of Dr. J-'choeitk's Guilt.? The Ilarrisburg Telegraph, referring to the efforts made in behalf of Dr. Schoeppe, says : "On this subject we have not now a word to say, but it is* well the public should know that while the friends ot 'Dr. Schoeppe are using their utmost efforts to satisfy the Gov ernor that there is reasonable doubt of his guilt, the fricuds of his alleged victim, Miss Steiuecke, are, on the contrary, daily furnish ing fresh proofs to the Executive of the Doctor's guilt, and that it is not a case for the exercise of the pardoning power, or even the granting of a respite. The whole matter is now before Governor Geary, and he will act in the case as his judgment and conscience dictate." A census just taken in South Carolina is aid to show that the white population there las increased 3,723 and the colored 1,760 ince the last United Stales census, in 1800.

TELEGRAPHIC NEWS. LATEST FROM WASHINGTON. Special telegrams to the Dispatch. Washington, December 14, 1869. The Admission of Virginia. The members of the minority or extreme "Radical wing of the Legislature of "V irgi nia presented to the Reconstruction Com mittee to-dav their protest against the ad mission of the State under its present form of government. They desire that the test oath should be administered to the Legisla ture, and that the Legislature should take no part in the election of senators and other officers until after the State is admitted. This protest is the same as that presented by them at the organization of the Legisla-1 ture. Then it was signed ^hv forty-four I members, now it is signed by twenty-eight? the others having bolted, and arc now de manding the admission of the State as at. present constituted. Bland, the colored State senator, is among the latter. Mr. Ward, of New York, presented a bill in the House to-day providing for the ad mission of Virginia, and that the clauses in the new Constitution which relate to suf frage, a common free-school fund, and that colored men shall serve as jurors, shall never be altered or repealed. The bill was referred to the Committee on Reconstruc tion. There is much disappointment felt bj some of the legislative committee and others some ui icgiM-w- - . ., who expected the Reconstruction Commit tee to report to-day a bill for the admission of Virginia. It i? expected the Senate will pass Mor ton's bill to-morrow, but it is doubtful whe ther the subject will come up in the House. .Patience must be exercised. There is no doubt of the ultimate result. At a meeting of the Reconstruction Com mittee this morning the Democratic mem bers moved the adoption of Mr.-Jams worth's bill providing, for unqualified ad mission, and 3Ir. Wliittemorc moved the adoption of Mr. Ward's bill. Both motions were defeated, and after discussion of the Paine and Butler propositions, but without determining the matter, the committee ad journed until next Saturday. These delays give rise to anxiety lest the subject may go over until alter the holidays without final action, and possibly result in sending the subject back to the citizens of Virginia for vote, or further action of some kind or other; but the latter result cannot surelv take place, for Governor Walker, who has thoroughly canvassed the Senate aud House, finds about nine-tenths of the sena tors and representatives in favor ol imme diate admission upon about such a resolu tion as that of Mr. Farnsworth. The Late Senator Fessenden?Speeclies lii the Senate. The number of speeches in the Senate to dav on the announcement of the death ot Mr. Fessenden were greater than has been customary on such occasions, and a notice able feature about them was the written re marks read from the manuscript. But two. ?senators delivered extempore speeches, and these were committed to memory from man useript that was all the time lying conve niently on the desks of the orators. In gen eral the eulogies were correct estimates oi the j character and capabilities of the deceased 1 senator, and, with two or three exceptions, the efforts were in good taste.- One of the notable exceptions was in the remarks'of Senator Davis, who inserted into his speech an attack upon Radicals, giving utterance to strong partisan political sentiments, thomdi the points made showing blemishes and broad- inconsistencies in 3Ir. Fessen den's character as a statesman were well taken; yet Senator Davis was not content with a' simple reference to them, hut em braced the opportunity to get oil' a political harangue, ill-timed and out of place. Cnba?Revival of Hope. The Cuban heart, bowed down with the weight of Spanish gunboats and other ad verse circumstances, has revived within the piist eight hours by reason ot an unexpect ed impulse in their favor discovered by re solutions etc., in Congress and a canvass of the members, most of whom are disposed to take issue with the arguments in the President's message relative to the status of the insurgents aud thPir claim to he a de facto government. What shall be the re medy to apply to the case gives them pause, however ; and although Cuban friends and sympathizers are numerous, there is no concert of action among them. Judge Stronff. Judge Strong, late of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, has arrived here. Rumor pavs he comes at the request of the resi dent to confer in regard to the nlling of be nluce of Judge Grier on the United States Supreme bench, to he made vacant by re signation in a few days. Pennsylvania, it h-Is been conceded, is entitled to the succes sor of Judge Grier. The Equestrian Statue cf General Grant.

The consent of Secretary Bontwell to have the statue erect ed has been obtained, and, also, a promise to the association by the Military Commit tees of both Houses that sufficient cannon captured by General Grant during the war should be supplied from the arsenal for the statue. The executive committee have already raised qpite a large sum, and deter mined to proceed with the work. J. A. Bailey, of Philadelphia, was selected artist, and his designs adopted. The committee informed the President of what they had done, and asked him to make suggestions, &c. General Grant re plied last Saturday, naming his horse "Cincinnati" as the model. This is the horse rode by General Grant throughout the war. Miscellaneous.
