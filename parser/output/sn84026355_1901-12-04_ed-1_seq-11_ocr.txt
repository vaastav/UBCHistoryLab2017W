To Improve U Is not in-cc-.-aiy to Inci-.-ns,- our Ottr Army, army beyond its present size nl Ibis time. JJut it. is necohsaiy lo keep il ;U the hlKhest point of ofllciencv. The individual units who as officers and enlisted men oompnso tills army, arc, wo have Rood teason to believe, nl least as etll cient as tliose of any oilier aimy in tlio entile world. It Is our duly to sen that their- training is of n. kind lo Insure tho highest possible expression of power to these units when netinsr in combination. Tho conditions of modem war are snr-li as to make an infinitely heavier demand than over before upon the Individual character ami capacity of the ofllcor and the enlisted man, and to make il far more dllh eult for men to act toftother with effort. At prc-onl the tlKhtlni; must bo done in extended older, which tnians thai each man must act for himself and at tlio same time act In combination with others with whom he is no lunger in tlio old-fashioned elbow-lo-elbow touch, t'ndcv such conditions a few men of tlm highest excellence are wortli 111010 than many men without the special skill which is only found as thu result of special training applied to men of excep tional physique and morale. UiU nowadays the most valuable lighting man and ilio most dlfllctilt lo peifect Is the rifleman who Is also a skillful and during rider. Tho proportion of our cavalry rcslnients has wise ly been Increased, The American cavalryman, on foot and on horseback, Is tlio best typo of soldier for gen eral purposes now to bo found in tlio world. The Ideal cavalryman of tho present day Is a. man who can finlit on font as effectively as tlio best Infantryman, and who is In addition unsurpassed In tho can- and man agement of his horse and in his ability to fl(;lit on horseback. A general staff should be created. As for the pies out staff and supply departments, they sliould bo tlllid by details from tho line, the men so detailed returniiiK nfler ii while to their line duties. It Is very undesli able lo have the senior grades of the army composed of men who have como to llll tho positions by ti mere fact of seniority. A system sliould be adopted by which theio shall bo an elimination snide by wriul" of tliose who soem until to render the best servioe in tho next nraile. Just loo to tho veterans of tho civil war who aro still In tlio army would scorn to require tlmt in the matter of retirements tlioy be slven by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades In the navy, Tim process of elimination of the least ill should bo conducted In u manner that would render It prac tically Impossible (o apply political or social pressure mi behalf of any candidal"-, so that each man may be .ludKed purely on ids own mollis. 1'resauro for tin promotion of civil otliclals for political reasons Is bad cnoiiRli, but it Is ten-fold worse where applied on be half ol ollicers of the army or navy. Kvcry promotion and every detail under the war department must be iniido solely with icsnrd to tho koui! of tho scrvuo and to tlio capacity nnd met It of the man himself, Ni pressure, political, social, or pcminul, of any Kind, will bo permitted to exercise tho least effect In any question of promotion or detail; and If thcio Is reason to bellevo Unit such pressure Is exereisrd m Die Instigation of tho olllci-r concerned, It will be held lo militate mriiinst him. In our at my we cannot nf. lord to have rewinds or duties distributed save on tho simple Kiound that those who by their own merits aio ntllltled lo the rewards aot theiili ninl (lull those who nro peculiarly lit to do the duties nro chosen lu per fmni them. 13 Very effort should be made In brlim the tinny to n constantly Incrcuidtur Hlntc of efficiency. When on neiiuil service no work snvo thnl dlrrotty lu tlm lino of such service should hit required. The paper work lu the nrrny, nst lu the navy, should bo urcnlly to ditced, What Is needed Is proved power of command nnd eupnolly to Work well in tho Held. Constant cni-u In necessary to prevent dry rot In the transportation and commissary departments. Our ttrmy Is so smalt nnd so much spnttnrr-d that Ii I very dlillciili to glvo tlie lilshor officers (na well ns llm lower olllcers nnd Hid enlisted men) n chance to pinctlce manoeuvres lu muss mid on u compaiu tlvely lurse scale. In time of need no amount of Indi vidual excellence would tivnll upuliist tho paraly.dH which would follow inability lo work ns a coherent whole, under skillful nnd daring leadership. The con nioss sliould provldo moans whereby It will bo possible to have field exorcises by tit least a division of regu lars, and If possible nlso it division of national ijuurdK men, mire u year. These exercises might ln!e the form of Hold manoeuvres! or, If mi tho Oulf Coast or the I'aclilt! or Atlutitlu seaboard, or In l ho region of tl0 tlreat Lukes, the ntmy cor pi when assembled could be marched from some, luluud point to some point on thu water, there embarked, disembarked after cotiplo of days' Journey at some other point, -ind again nmiched inland. Only by actual bundling and providing for men In masses while they nro mnrch Inu, camping, embarking, nnd disembarking, will II In) possible to train tho higher ofllccr:! to perform their duties well and smoutbly. A groat debt Is owing from the public to the men of the army and navy. They should he so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may bo able lo respond Instantly to any demand niudo upon them to sustuin the Interests of tho nation and the honor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man Is probably on the whole a inmo formidable fighting man than tho regular of any "thor army. Kveiy consideration should bo shown him, and in return the highest standard of usefulness should bo exacted from him. It Is well worth while for tho congress lo consider whether the pay of eti llsled men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not bo increased to correspond with the In oi cased value of tho veteran soldier. Much giiod 1ms already come from tho not i-ui-RanksIng the army, passed early In the present year. Tho thrco prime rclorms, nil of tlimri of literally in estimable value, arc, llrst, the substitution of four year details from the lino for permanent appointments in tho so-called staff divisions: second, the establish ment of a corps of artillery with a. chief at Ilio hcjd; third, tho establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the army. II would lie dllllcult to ovci estlruate tho improvement in tin- eltlelency of our army which those three rclorms aro making, and have in part already effected. Tlio reorganization providi d for by Ihc acl has been substantially accomplished. The Improved con ditions in the Philippines have enabled tho war de partment materially to lediice tin- military charge upon our revenue and lo urrnuge tbo number of "ol- liers so as to bring this number much neater to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law. There I, however, need of supplementary leai.v lalinn. Thorough military education must be provid ed, and In addition to the reguluis the advantages of this education should bo given to the nflioors of (lit National Ounnl and others In civil life who desire In telligently In (it themselves for possible military duty. The olllcers should be sivon tho chance to perfect themselves by sludy In tho higher branches of tiiift nit. At West Point tlio education sliould lie of Un kind most apt lo turn out men who are good In actual Held service; too much stress should not bn laid on mathematics, nor should prnliciency therein be held In establish the riKhl of entry tft a. corps d'ollte. The typical American nlllccr of the best Ulnd need nol be a sood mathematician; but lie must be able lo master himself, lo control others, and lo show boldness and ieitllit. of losourco in every einetgenoy. Action should lie taken in tefeience to the mlliiin and to tho raising of volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The organization suit muniment of tho National tiuard of the several states, which are lioutod as militia in the appropriations by i he congress, should be made ii' iitleal with those pro vided for tho regular forces. The obligation!) and du ties of the Ouard In time of war should bo carefully delined, and n syslom established by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer- forces should bo prescribed in advance. 11 Is utterly impos sible in ilio oxdtoiiKiU and haste of impending war to do this sruisf.ictoiily if the arrangements have not b.-en made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the llrst volunteer organizations called out tho tinlnlng of those citizens who have already hud experience under arms, and especially for the se lection In advance of the. olllcers of any force which may bo raised; for careful selection of the kind neecs i.iry is impossible after the outbreak of war. That tho army is not at all a. mero instrument of destruction has been shown during tho last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba., and Porto Hico it has proved Itself a uveal constructive force, a most potent Implement tor the upbuilding of a peaceful civilisation. , Tribute to the No other citizens desei ve so well of Veterans, the Uepubllc as the veterans, the survivors of those who saved the Talon. They did the. ono ib-ed which It" left undone would have meant, that all else in our history went, lor nolhliiR. Hut for their steadfast prowess In tho great est crisis of our hlstoiy, nil our annals would bo mean ingless, and our great experiment In popular freedom and self-government a gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a united nation, but they left us also as a heritage tlm memory of tho mighty deeds by which tlio nation was kept united. Wo nro now In deed one nation, one in fact as well ns lu name; wo tiro united in our devotion lo thu ling wlileli Is the symbol of national greatness nnd unity; and tho very completeness of our union enables us till, in every part of tho country, to glory In tbo valor shown alike by the sons of tho North and the sons of the South in tho times that tried men's souls, Tho men who In the last three yoais have done so well in tho ll.ist and ilio West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this remembrance Is not lost. In any fcorlous cilslr. Iho l.'nlted States must rely for the great mass of Its lighting men upon the volunie.r soldiery who do nol rnako a permanent profession of tho military career; and whenever such n crisis mines! Iho deathless memories of tho civil war will glvo to Americans tho lift of lolly purpose which conies to those whoso fathers have rloed valiantly in Ilio fnrefrnnt of tho battle. Civil Sot vice The met It system of making appoint- Reform. incuts is In lis essence as demoeratlo and American as tho common school sysleni Itself, It simply means that In clerical and other positions where tho duties uiu unllicly r.on potlticnl, nil nppllcuntH should have a. fnir Held untl no favor, onoh standing on bin merits as ho Is nblo to show litem by prnctleul test. Written competitive examinations offer the only nvnllnbte means lu many cases for applying this system. In other cases, ns whore laborers nro employed, it system nf registration undoubtedly can bn widely extended. There are, nf course, places whom tlio written competitive oxiitnltui llou cannot bo applied, nnd others where It offers by no means nn Ideal solution, but whore under existing political conditions It Is. though nn Imperfect menus, yet thn bcsl present means of getting satisfactory suit.-. Wherever the conditions have permitted Iho np pllcutlon u r the nielli system In Us fullest nnd widest f.enso, tho aaln to the government has been Immense. The navy yards nnd postal service Illustrate, probably better tiinli uny other branches of tins government, the great gain In economy, efllelency, and honesty due to the enforcement of this principle. I recommend the passage of a law whlrli will t. leml tho classified service to the District of Columbia, or will nl least enable tho president thus to oxlcnd 11. In my judgment all laws providing for tho temporary employment of clrrkn should hereafter contain a pro vision that they be selected under llm civil set vice la w. It Is Important lo have this system obtain nt homo, but It is even more, Important to havn II applied rigid ly In our Insular possessions, Not an ofilcc should be llllcd In the Philippines or Porto ltleo with nny re gard to the man's pnrllsnn ufllllatlons or services, with any regard to tho political, social, or personal Influence which he may have nt Ills command: in short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save, the man's own diameter nnd capacity and the needs of the service. The administration of those Islands should bo as wholly free from the suspicion of partisan polities as tho administration of tho nrrny and navy. All thai we ask frotii the public servant In the Philippines or I'orlo Rico Is that ho rolled honor on his country by the way lu which lie makes thai country's rule a benefit to the people who have como under it. This Is all that wo should ask, and we cannot afford to h eonleut Willi loss. The merit system Is simply one method of seem lug honest and eltlelenl administration of the government ; and in the long tun I he sole Justification of nny type of government lie in lis proving Itself both honest and oflli-loni. . J The Consular The consular service is uuw orgun Service. Issed under the provisions of a law passed in l$3ii, which Is entirely in adequate to existing conditions. The Interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the coiin-trj- in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your attention. Several bills providing fur a new consular servico have in recent years boon submitted to tlm congress. They are based upon the just piinoiplo that appointments In the service slicnilil bo made only after a pun ileal test of the applicant's fitness, thai promotions should he governed by ttusl Worlhhiess, adaptability, and zeal in the perfnrmnure of duty, and thai the tenure of ofllce should be un iitfccted by partisan considerations. The guardianship and fostering of nur rapidly ex panding foreign commerce, tlio piotection of American citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pur suit of their iiffiiiis. and the maintenance of the dis nlty of the nation abroad, combine to make it essen tial that our consuls should be men of churaeloi. knowledge, and enterpilse. it is true that the service Is now. In the main, eflleient, but a standard of excel lence cannot be peiinunenlly maintained until the principles set forth in the bills heretofore submitted lu 111-- eongiessnn this subject are enacted into law. I New Policy fov la my Judgment the lime has ,ir the Indians. lived when we should detlnitely make up our minds to recognize tin- Indian as an individual and not as a member of ii tribe. The Oencral Allotment Act Is a mighty pill voilzing engine in break up the tribal mass. It acls directly upon Hie family and the Individual. Under Its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have nl re.idy become citizens of the i.'nllod States. v should now break up the ttibrtl funds, doing for th-.nn what allotment does for the ttlbul lands; that is. tlioy should bo divided into Individual holdings. There will bo :i transition period during which the funds will In many eases have to be held in trust. ThN Is the case also with the lands. A slop sliould bo put upon the indiscriminate permission lo Indians to lease their allotments. Tho effort should bo steadily lo make the Indian work like any other man on his own giound. The marriage laws of the Jnrliuus should be intuit tho same as those of the whites. lu tlio schools the education should bo elementaiy iind laigcly industrial. Tho need of higher education among the Indians i very, very limited. On liio reservations cure should be taken to try to suit the teaching? to the needs of the particular Indian. Them Is no use in attempting to Induce agriculture In a country suited only for cattle raising, where thp In dian should bo made a stock grower, Tho ration sys tem, which is merely tho corral and the reservation system, is highly detrimental to the Indians. It pro incites beggary, perpetuates pauperism, and stifles in dustry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must continue to u greater or less degree us long as tribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common. The Indian sliould ho treated as an indi vidual like the white man. During the change of treatment Inevitable hardships will occur: every effort should bo made to minimize these hardships ; but ,ve should nol because of them hesitate to make the change. Tlicro should be .a continuous reduction in the number of agencies. In dealing with the ttborlglna! races few things aro moie Important than to preserve them from the (er liblo physical and moral degradation resulting from iho liquor tratllc, Wo are doing nil wo can to snvo our own Indian tribes from this evil, Wherever by 111 leriiallmiul agreement this snmo end can be attnhied as regal els races wliero wo do not possess exclusive control, every effort should bo made lo bring it nbout. , , Expositions and I bespeak the uio.-t cunil.il siqi.

We earnestly hope that foieign nations will appreciate tho deep Interest cut' country lakes In this opposition, and our view of Ha Importance from every standpoint, and that they will participate. In scouring lt success. The notional government sliould be represented by n full and complete set of exhibits. Tho people, of Charleston, with grout cneigy nnd civic spirit, nro carrying on an exposition which will continue throughout most of the present nosBloli of the eonnress, 1 heartily commend tills exposition in thn good will of. tlio people. Jt desetves all the eneoutnfie ment thai can bo given It. The niunuKcrn of the Charleston exposition have requested the cabinet mil tors lo pliico thereat the government exhibits which have been nt ntiffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. J have taken Ihe tcsponsllillity of dlroctlnt" thut this bo done, for I feel thtit It Is duo to Chnrtos ton to help her In hot- praiseworthy cffoit. In my (minion tho management should not bo required to pay nil theso expenses. I carncrtly recommend that the 1'iuigt ess npinoprlali- t once the small turn necessary for this purpose. Thu Pan-American exposition at Buffalo has Jiifl closed, Both from the Industrial and the nrtistlc stnndpohil this exposition linn been In n high degree creditable untl useful, nol merely to lUtfr'nlo but lo Ilio United States. Tho terrible tragedy of the prc.rl dent's assassination Interfered materially with Its be ing u financial success.

Such tin if fori whs a genuine service to the entire American public. Tho advancement of the highest Interests of na tional science and learning nnd the custody of objects of nrt and of the valuable results of sclcntlllo expedi tions conducted by the United States have been com mitted to tlm Smithsonian Institution. In fintheiaiire of its declared purpose for tho "Increase nnd diffu sion of knowledge among tuen"-tho congress has Horn time to time given It other Important functions.

The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of the congress. Perhaps the most characteristic educational move ment of the past lifty years Is that which lias cieittcd the modem public library and developed II Into brand and active, service. There aro now over five thousand public, libraries in (lie Putted Stales, the product of tills period. In addition to accumulating material, they me also sliivhis by organization, by improve ment in method, and by co-nperjtiou. to glvo greah-r efficiency to the. mateilal Iboy hold, to make II nunc widely useful, and by avoidance of unnecessary dupli cation in process lo reduce the cosl of Its .idmlulatiii tion, lu these efforts they uattually look for assistance to the Federal library, which, lliough still the library nf congress, and so entitled, Is tlio one. national library of the Pulled Stales. Already the largest, single col lection of books on the Western hemisphere, nnd cer tain to Increase moie rapidly than any other throucdi purchase, exchange, and the operation of the cop.v -tight law, I his llbuiiy bus a unique opportunity to render to the libi.itles of this country to American scholarship service of tho highest Importance.

Tho full measure of postal progress which might be leallzed has long been hampered and obstructed by tin: heavy burden Imposed on the government through iho intrenched and well understood nbusos whkli have grown up In connection with second-class mail mutter. The extent of this burden appears when il is stated tlmt while tho second-class matter makes near ly thioc-flfths of tho weluhl of nil the mall, It paid for the Inst fiscal year only SU-H.-lf.", of tho aggregate postal revenue of $tll,(ill1fi'j. If the pound rale of poetago, which produces the large loss rims enlnlUd, and which was llxcd by tho congress with the pur pose of encouraging tho dissemination of public' In formation, were limited to the legitimate nowspapcis and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no .Hist exception could ho taken, That expense would bo lie recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted for u Justifiable nnd, liui much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rain Is wholly outside of the Intent of tho law, nnd has se cured admission only through nn evasion of its re quirements or through lux construction.

It will be Intel bofote Iho congres!-. with u. report of llm plenipotentiary on boliuir of the Pulled Htntcs, William Woodvllle Jloek 1 lilt, to whom high prnbo l duo for the tnct, good JudErtietit, nnd energy ho has displayed lu performing nil exceptionally dllllcult mid delicate, task, The agreement ranched disposes In a. milliner satis factory to the powers of (ho vurlotis grounds of com plaint, nnd will contribute materially to better future relations between China and Iho powers. Itepuralion linn been made by China for tlio murder of foreigners during tbo uprising nnd punishment has been inflicted on the officials-, however high In rank, recognized ns roi'ponslble for or having participated In the out break. Ofllelnl e'Xnrnlniitions have been forbidden for n period of live years In all citle-s lu which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated, and edicts have been Issued making all ottlcluls directly respon nlhlo for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence against them. Provisions have been mado for insuring Iho future safety of tho foreign representatives In Poklu by set ting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which thn powers e-iiu make defensible und In which they can If necessary maintain permanent, mill lary guards; by dismantling the milltaiy works be tween the cupltal and the sea: and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign mllltnry posts along this line. An edict has been Issued by the Kmperor of Chluu prohibiting for two yeain the importation of arms and ammunition Into China, China has agreed to pay adequate Indemnities to Ihe states, so- li.tles, und Individual!! for the. losses sustained by them and for the expenses of tho military expeditious soul by the various powers to protect life and restora older, tinder the provisions of the Joint note, of Decom b.'i', 1(W. t'hlna lias agreed to revise Ihc- treaties of cornmeieo and navigation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreiiiii poweis may decide to bo needed. The Chinese government lias agreed to participate ilunnelnlly In the work of bettering: the water ap proaches lo Shanghai mid ie Tien Tsln. the centers of foreign tiade In central and unrlheiii China, and nn international conservancy boaid, lu which the Chi nese government Is largely represented, bus been pro vided for tlio improvement of the Shanghai river and tin; control of its navigation, fn tho same line of eiiinincrcial advantages u. lcvislon of iho present tar iff on Importi has been assented to for the purpose of substituting spcolllc for ml valorem duties, and an ox pet I lias been sent abroad on the part of the United States to asisl in this work. A list of articles to re main free of duty, including Hour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been agro-.d upon In the settlement. Dming these I roubles our government has un swei vingly ndvoitort moderation, and has materially nldid in bringing about an adjustment which tend. lo enhance the welfnre of China and to lead 10 a moie tiiiieilolal Intercourse between the empire nnd the modern world: while in the critical period of re,-oit and massacre we did our full share in safeguarding life and property, restoring order, nnd vindicating tlio national iutetesl and honor. U behooves us to continue- in these paths, doing what ties in our power to foster feelings of good will, nnd leaving no effort un-n-ied to work ml tho great, policy of full and fair Intercourse between China and the nations, on a foot ing of equal rights and advantages to all. We advo cate the "open door" with all thai it implies; not inoiely Ihe procurement of enlarged commercial op portunities on the coasts, but access to the Interior by Iho waterways with which China has been so extra ordinal Uy favored. Only by bringing tho people of China Into peaceful nnd friendly community of trade wltli all tho people of the earth can the wmk now aus pkinusly begun be canled to fruition, lu the attain ment of tills purpose we necessarily claim parity of noiitmcnt. under thu conventions, throughout the em pire for our trade and our elite, u with those of all , unci- powers. r. The Pnn-American Congress. We view with lively interest and keen hopes of benetlcfal results the proceedings of tnc I'.in-Aini-viciiii congiess, convoked al the invitation or Mexleo. and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the Pnited States are under the most liberal Inst! actions to co-operate with their colleagues in all mutters promising advantage to the great fami ly of American commonwealths, ns well in their rela tions among themselves as in their domestic advance ment and in their Intercourse with the world nt large. My predecessor comnuinlcatf d to the congress the fi.cl that the- Well and Ta Abia. awards agninsl Alexiro have been adjudged by Ihe highest courts or our country lo have been obtained through fraud and petjury on the part of the- claimants, and that in ac-i-ordance with the acts of the congress the money re maining in tlio hands of tho secretary of state mi these ii wards has been returned to Slexlco. A eousld cinble portion of tin money received from Mexico on theso awards had boon paid by this government to the elalmanls before the decision of the courts was ten dered. My Judgment is that the congress should re turn lo Moxlco un amount equal to the sums thus al ready paid to i lu claimants. . r, International Tin- death of Queen Vkloriu caused Amenities, the people of tlio 'United States deep and heartfelt soirow. lo which the government gave full expression. When President McKlnlc-y died, our nation In turn received Irom every ipi.-iilcr of tho Hrltlsh empho expressions of grief mid sympathy no less sincere, Tlio death of the Kmprcss Dowager Frederick of (Jermany also aroused tint genuine sympathy of tho American people; and thla sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when tho president was assassinated, indeed, from every quarter of tio civilized world wo received, nt th" time of tbo president's death, assurances of such jjricf and regard as to touch tho hearts of our people. In tho midst of our utltletlon we reverently thu'nk tho Almighty that wc mo at peace with tho nations of mankind; and we lirmly Intend that our policy shall be such ns to cniitlnuo unbroken those International ulatlons of mutual reboot and good will,
