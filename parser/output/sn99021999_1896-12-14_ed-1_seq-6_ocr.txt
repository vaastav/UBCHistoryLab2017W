While rejoicing over the vln- dli-ntion of th-'lr brethren of the Lincoln dlo- CCFI- , they condemn the policy that rendered proceedings necessary. "The bishops bhnuld have suppressed Ilotinciini Inns ago , " said onu clergyman. "They were well awiiro of lite wrongdoing and his conleinpl of church law.

If Donocnm should now be retired , It will be more mirprlslng than the fact that a. dci-iston wax given ugalnat him In the ini-triipolltnn court. " This crlllclRin of the bishops la not wholly ill HIT veil. It la learned that several of them made diligent elTorts to resloro peace in the Lincoln dloccxQ and effect a settlement that vuiild be satisfactory to priests ami bishop. Their efforts were unavailing. When Arch bishop Hcnnessy of Dtilmquc notined the prk'Hta. sonio mantlis ago , that a trial by a metropolitan court hud been ordered by thu li'opaianda ; , he appealed to them to pioposc li settlement to the bishop nnil abamlon the trial. The priests did so. They proposed to let byguncs be bygones to forgive and for get. Hut the olive brunch was rejected. Just before thu court convened In Dubuiiuo the arrhhltdiop personally endeavored to har monize the warring elements. The priests wore Killing ; the bishop was not. lie In- Hinted on amends . : hut amounted t > punlsh- inc nt. The proposal was rejected and thu trial proei'i'ded. TIIK QUESTION OK AI'IMJAL. What the oilteome of the cast1 will be Is , of course , pioblematlcal. Bishop Honaclim nn- iiounrcd In a letter given to the press on the nth lust , that ho would appeal from the derision of the court to the apostolic delegate In Washington. An Associated press dispatch Irom Marshall , Mich. , the home of leather Ilnart , judge of thu court , ( jiiotes Judge Haart as saying that the time within which an appeal might bu filed expired last Friday nnd that he had received no communication from the bishop of Lincoln. According to authorities , the only part of the court's decree against which an appeal would lie Is the amount of damages and costs assessed against the Lincoln curia. The accused priests were acquitted , ami cannot be tried again far acts committed up to the time of the trial. This feature of the celebrated cosu Is best explained by the Western Watchman of St. Louis , edited by Father I'hclan , a well luiown canonist. In last week's Issue Father Pht Ian says : "Hy a late decision of a judge specially iiy tiie propngamla to try tlio case , two priests of the diocese of Lincoln were acquitted of the criminal charges pre ferred against them by their ordinary and restored'to their parishes , from which they had been dismissed. This decision was final , as ( hero is no appeal for the prosecution In church or state. If the accuser had the right to both make the accusation nnd drag his victim from court to court until he got ono to condemn , there would be little cbnnco of justice for the poor and weak. A crim inal rase comes to an end with the first judgment In favor of the accused. In this rant ) the bishop of Lincoln was permitted by the propaganda to act the part of nc. ctiser. ami It was In that capacity , and not ns bishop , that ho appeared before Father Haart In Dubwiue. An appeal Is from n sentence , and only he can appeal on whom n sentence falls. An appeal from an ac quittal In a criminal cabo Is onu of tin : Htrangest claims ever set tip In a court of law. " AN UI'ISCOI'AL MISTAKE. The public letter of Bishop lionacum at tacking both the verdict of the court and the fairness of the prrHldlng Judge la regarded by the clergy as a eerlous mistake. The rules of the church strictly forbid the dis cussion of church matters In the public prints. Dlsliojw cannot violate this rule without Incurring the displeasure of their Hitperlors. Hence the bishop's letter la likely to Increase the dllllcultlra that beset him. The reference made to Father Ilaart'n " .strain * cl relations" with Ills own bishop Is rlalmed to be far-fetched. On two occaulons Father Haart acted as attorney for priests who had been removed from their parishes by Hltdiop Foley of Detroit. The question Involved In both cases was the right of the bishop to remove them from ono parish to another both parishes being of equal Im portance without Just cause. The decision of the diocesan court was against the bishop. Thrse cases are said to constitute the only grounds for the "strained relations" alleged to exist between Father Haart and the bishop of the dlocr.se of Detroit. The tone of Illshop Honacum's public letter Is so rad ical as to provoke expressions of nslonl.-di- ment. In all his letters heretofore made public he treated thu assumptions of the p'-icsls ' with lofty ridicule and pooh-poohed their hopes of dual triumph , The Dubuque decision changed all this and provoked a llcive denunciation of both court and idnlntlfTs. Father Haart , who In the resident priest nl Marshall. Mich. , Is about 37 years of age nnd has achieved a wide reputation an a canonist. That ho enjoys the confidence of the legation Is further evidenced by the fact that after the trial at Dubuque he was or dered by Martinet ! ! to preside over a like court eUowhere. Thrao facts strengthen the belief expressed by the priests that the ver dict ot the metropolitan court will not only lie confirmed , but that Ulshop Monacum's dcpreltlon Is a foregone conclusion. The amount of the money damages and costs ansrfiscd against the Lincoln dloceso Iiy the metropolitan court aggregates $1.521 , nnd lime for Us payment Into the chancery of Duhnquo expires January 1. .Much specu lation Is Indulged as to what will happen then. Many of ( he clergy believe that Hlahop lionacum will pursue to the end his policy of "no mirrender. " and that the civil courts of the state may yet bo called upon for power to enforce the decrees of the church courts. 

CATHOLIC t'UKSS COMMUNT. Whllo no mention has been made of the case by the local Catholic paper , the West ern Recorder , tlio Catholic press of the mid west Is not silent. The Northwestern Cath olic or bloux City , edited by Hon. John Ilrcimoii , has this to say respecting Ill hop Honacum'B public Utter : "It falls far short of a Justification , it b n sweeping attack upon the Integrity of the court and a naked nsiertlon that the proceedings wcro null nnd void In to o. It U garnished with un dignified flings at the newspapers and per rons nut named , and Is altogether beneath the dignity of a Mshop. No chari table person will rejoice over Illshop Hona cum's humiliation , but all lovers of Justice will rejoice over the triumph of law. " Father Malonc's paper , the Colorado Cath olic , says the decision hardly Justifies the claim that It clguallzcs the establishment of cletlaetlcal law In America , for the rraron that Hlihop llonaciiin "spurni It , treats It contemptuously , and maliciously attacks the vindicated priests. As long an such things can endure , wo arc a very long ways from having ecclesiastical laww In America. " The Woitcrn Watchman of St. Louis says : "Wo have received from the court copies of the sentences In the cane * of Fathers Fitz gerald and Murphy In Dubuque. Wo can't publish even extracts from them. They are well calculated to make Catholics blushfor their religion. There has been terrible scan- dill , and It luiu lasted live years , but the court places It ut the door of the blihop of Lincoln , BKNTKNCK OF TIIK COUUT. , Following la a copy of the verdict of the tnMropolllAn rourt In the cn e of Ilcv I ) . (1 Kitjwi-nld of South Auburn. It differs from t ie verdict In Father Murphy's cane only In thf amount of damaRos awarded , the former rwlvlim 8BO and the latter $ .126. "None of the uperlflcnttonn under the ncc- end charge have been proven. As wns found above none tinder the first charge wcro proven. Kven the flscil procurator In hli < llnal review dlnllnctly admits that the charges ngnltvt the defendant hnvti not been proven. Wo therefore Judge , decide nnd de clare Hut thn defendant , Hcv. DonlR 0. Kit- gerild. In not guilty of the chars * * lodged asalncl him. "From thin sentence , however , the con clusion may not be drawn that the conduct of the defendant , pending this whole contro versy , was exemplary and without fault. The records' of the case show that nt times even the mrst reverend apostolic delegate wai > not treated with proper respect. The Ir reverence , however , was rebuked by the apoe- lollc delegate hlmfelf and the rebuke wan made public by the blfhop of Lincoln. Wo may. therefore , no longer consider thlD fea ture of the controversy. "Neither doca this Judgment and sentence determine , the amount due by the mission of the defendant In the dloccsun chancery nnd vlco versa. This matter ehould be fairly nnd amicably arranged. "Since It la our duty an judges In this cent1 not only to determine the merits of the principle cause , but also to consider and pass judgment on those matters which belong to It either ns accessories or conscqucnccn , It becomes neiesary to review the record on certain points nnd to settle the question ot cosln. The record shows , nnd we have de cided that the bishop of Lincoln without any authority In law assumed and stated pub licly that the defendant was suspended , whereas he was not suspended. In an offi cial document sent to the defendant by the bishop , the latter. In order to deceive the defendant , stated that he withdrew , of his own potion , the expulsion from the diocese , whereas thU wan done on the Instruction of the apostolic delegate to whom the defendant had appealed. "Moreover , the bishop ot Lincoln , much to the damage ot the defendant , In a letter to ( lie public press , published this same as sertion. "Again , on October 2 , 189i ! , the bishop ot Lincoln passed n most grievous sentence for contumacy on the defendant , when the de fendant was not truly and legally contuma cious , anil when the essential forms ot law- were entlrclj omitted. "Further , In order to head'off any appeal , the bishop of Lincoln Informed the apostolic delegate In Washington that under due pro cess of law the defendant had been sentenced In contumacy , the effect of which false re port from the Lincoln curia was that the defendant could get no redress and relief from the legation. "Ho wai , therefore , forced In great dls- trcps to go to 'the additional expense and trouble of making recourse to Home. When the recourse had been granted by the pro paganda , the Itli'liop ot Lincoln. In a letter to Mr. Kelllgar , Intending to Injure the de fendant , wrote that the defendant had de ceived the cardinal prefect of the propaganda and had obtained under falw pretences the grant of his recourse and a rehearing be fore thin metropolitan curia. More than this , after the bishop of Lincoln knew that the whelo ciiw of the defendant was In the Juris diction of this metropolitan court , he never theless again Illegally fentenccd the defend ant mrst severely , and In the final clause of the sentence gave notice that the hearing ot till ? case of the defendant was postponed Indefinitely , thus deceiving the public nnd greatly injuring the defendant. When finally this metropolitan curia took cognizance of the cause , the bishop cf Lincoln sent up to this curia the actu of the Lincoln curia In u mutilated form , having withheld svveral essential documents' , among which was the sentence he had Inflicted on the defendant on October 2 , 1S05. which was the very basis of the recourse the defendant made to the propaganda. "Thus ho also attempted deceit on this metropolitan curia In a most serious matter , much to the Injury ot the defendant. After Indicting the Illegal sentence ot October 2 , isns. the bishop of Lincoln further published an excommunication against the defendant so that all defendant's parishioners became aware of his disgrace , much to the Injury of his reputation. When on August 1.1 , IS'JO , the bishop revoked his Illegal censures of October 2 , 1893 , he nevertheless In no way repaired the damage done the defendant. Moreover , the bishop deprived the defendant of all bin means of support by appointing another priest In December , 1805 , to take charge of his qtiasl-parlsh and damaged him so much In the estimation of his people that It Is doubtful whether this special damage can over be repaired. And of thla whole case ot the defendant the bUhop truly says 'It has distracted the diocese and scandalized the country. ' All this trouble , damage , ex pense and scandal the bishop of Lincoln put ; ; upon himself In his letter to the defendant wherein over his own signature he admit' ] that the basis of all the trouble , damage , ex pense , scandal , viz. , the sentence which lie passed on October 2 , 1S05 , Is defective and Illegal and which we have declared null and void. Underlying all these proceedings evi dently wca some other motive than n sense of justice ; considering these things and the additional fact that not one of the specifica tions under either charge was proved and that little or no testimony was offered to sus tain them , thus constituting legal calumny , there la nothing left for us as Judge but to declare that the defendant la entitled and must receive from the bishop and the curia of Lincoln not only hl taxable cents , which are In the sum of $179. but that he must also bo reimbursed for the damages unlaw fully and unjustly sustained , which hereby we determine and declare to bo the sum of $ S50. Moreover , we assess upon the curia of Lincoln the actual coats of thla metro politan curia In this case , which are hereby determined and declared to be the sum of $170. Hoth the cents of this metropolitan curia nnd the costs ami damages of the defendant given above , we order to be paid Into the chancery1 of Dubuque by the proper olllccr of Lincoln diocese within thirty days from the date of this prraent sentence "Furthermore , we Inhibit the curia of Lin coln from further persecuting the defendant bccaiiEo ot the charges for which he has been on trial , and we order that the defendant forthwith bo reinstated with all his lights In the quasi parish , as It existed on Juno 15 , 181)5 ) , when these charges wcro first brought against him ; and , therefore , wo order the re moval of Kev. E. J. Fenny from the quasl- parlsh of the defendant and direct that de fendant's name be again forthwith placed on the list of the clergy of Lincoln diocese from which It has been removed. Because through the action of the bishop of Lincoln , the people of Auburn have become averse from the defendant , It later it Is found nccctssary or advisable that he be given another mission or quasl-parlsh ; then as a part of this sentence for damages we Judge and decide that he must be given a mission and quasl-parlsh at least equivalent to the mission of Auburn an It existed on June ID , 1S95. when these charges were Hist lodged against him. "That there may bo no misunderstanding , all parties are notified that by special dele gation given ad cautclam , the exccut'on of this sentence pertains to us aa judge dele gates , " ( Jlven In Dubuque , Iowa.

Although the opening of congress has ex- riled considerable Interest In Wnll street , yet It can hardly be mild to have had any disturbing effect. The president's message was , upon the whole , well received. There ran be no doubt tlmt the past uncertainty as to the disposition of the 'idmlnlHtriitlon on the Cuban question bus In some measure hold In check the current of prosperity which fet In after the election. The vivid recollection of the Venezuelan meswi naturally mnile many people timid lest the country might again be takop by surprise through some disturbing outcome of our relations with Spain ; and this suspense bus undoubtedly held bark recovery in rortaln directions. The president , However , has nov revealed the wbnlo situation and lias fully stated the attitude of the government , and that with a spirit of openness and randor which may help to obviate misunderstand ings with Spain. The public appear to pen- erally accept Mr. Cleveland's position as wise and moderate , and the same view is nrparent In congress , with little regard to party. Thus , on this question , n great relief lias pome over the publln mind ; and Kie Im pression prevails Hint , unless * Spain should assume an utterly reckless attitude , this dangerous Issue may be ultimately settled upon a pacificbasis. . So far therefore as respects the Cuban ditllcilltles , the night mare Is now dispelled , ami business men run again move forward with their enter prises without fear of distil'bailee from Washington. It Is quite possible that Indi vidual members of congress may seek to air themselves on this subject , but congress as a whole appears to sanction the tentative policy expounded In the president's message , and sucfi sensations can therefore have little Influence. 

TRAUR REVIVAL IS CURTAIN. The feeling In trade clrrles continues buoyant and hopeful. Here and there , ho-.v- ever. the question Is asked where Is the great Improvement In business that was rnomlred as the consequence of Mr. Mc- Klnley's election ? The answer Is that It Is on Its way , and will put In Us appearance co soon as the march of the seasons per mits. Some critics of the situation s'eem to have Imagined that the promise of better times meant that mero'innts and traders who bad already boimlit their winter Mip- p'les and were busy Hearing them out would proceed to restock themselves for the sea son's trade , and so duplicate their business at the end of the year's business. This of course would not be a revival of trade but a commercial madness or a trade mlrae'e No Intelligent merchant.1" have cherished hopes of any surh Impossibility , and yet they fiave generally expected a great busi ness recovery , nnd have no doubt that It did reullv arrive a few days after the elec tion , and further felt assured Miat It lias come to stay. They consider that It Is an Improvement 'n ' business when eonlldenee Is well restored. 'When hope taVes the place of paralyzing apprehension when under the Influence of that hope the Idle mills all over ICie country start Into activity , and wren the distributing trades largely Increase their orders for the spring business. That Is the kind of recovery practical men of business have anticipated ; and the realization of their hopes lias not fallen below their ex pectations , sniiiTUlne as they may have seemed to pessimistic minds. The full fruition of these Im irovcments will be In evidence when distributors and retailers be gin to supply the demand for the spring market ; when the unbelieving deprecators will have to confess that the recovery grow ing out of the sound money victory Is some thing more than a myth. There are also bilious persons nnd papers who express a great ile.il of disappoint ment because Europe has not been led by the- election results to buy ! i large amount of our securities , but 1ms on the contrary sent home n large amount of our stocks and bonds. This Is another case of disap pointment at the non-appearance of n mir acle. Thf election came just after we had Imported some J7n.000.OTO of gold from Lon don and the continent. Hetween the be- Rlnnlni ; of Auuust and the end of October the Hank of Knglnnd had lost J.V.MV,000 ) of no'd. the Hank of France S2S.VX,0'0 and the Herman llelcbsbank $1:1.000.000 : ; maklnir a trial loss In the- three rreat banks of 5U7.- O'lO.OOO. The lank of Iviigland had consc- nueiitly put up Its rate of discount from 2 to 4 per cent nnd the Uelchsbank from . " ! to 5 per cent ; while conpols had fallen .114 points and Herman Imperial bonds had de clined 2' ( . . The London stock market and the continental bourses were In ti condi tion closely bordering on crisis and all kinds of stocks fell heavily except Ameri cans. The controlling foreign banks were uslnjr all their power to p-hr-clc the adverse course of the exchanges. Including dlscour- ajjenirnt to the Importation of foreign In vestments. It was In this condition of for eign finances that Kuroiw received the m-.vs of our political victory. The Intclllgrnri was received with flattering recognitions of Its bearing upon our credit and was fol lowed by a rise of 5 to 7'.i per cent In stocks nt New York. AMERICA SAVES EUROPE. In the Imneciinloiis condition of London and Horlln this temptation to make n hnnd- Fome profit on our stocks and nt the same time stop the shipments of pold to New York was too ntrom ; not to bo turned to account , and some $20,000.010 of our securi ties wire sent home within n few days. Tnls reflux of stocks wan taken hero with out a wince and with no very visible result upon prices. It had , however , the gratlfv- IIIB effect of llni'ldatlng $20. < YOOGO of our In debtedness to Europe. In lieu of Increasing It by sending out ri fresh' ' largo amount of our cbllcntlons which hud been antici pated. Thus If , owinc to exeontlonal condi tions , the ofTict of the clectfon upon for eign Investors did not turn out In the way anticipated , we had Instead n result quite as beneficial to ourselves and better calcu lated to bespeak confidence In A-nerlean finance. Nor Is this the only evidence of the revival of homo finance. Our capital ists are today holdltiT some fcO.000.000 to J2'i.0'.0000 of export bills , which bail they gone forward after the usual course , would have created virtual panic In Etiroixby bringing hither an t < iunl amount of gold. Hy thus virtually lending p. largo amount of gold to European banks we are savins them from thivntencd BerloitH difficulties. Contrast this condition of financial resource with the condition of affairs In Will street up to the i-lectlon , nnd some estimate may bo formed of the extent of thu recovery of financial confidence Klnco November 3. A little reasonable patience will later bring still further evidence of .the great revival consequent upon the defeat of free coinage- The easier temkncy In the London money market Is an encouraging symptom , the market rale being now fully 1 per cent be low the bank rate. This change has stopped the local demand for export bills for hoarding , with the effect of wcakcnlmr the market for stcrlhiK bills. AH , however remittances will now have to be made for Interest payments to foreign Investors , the reduced iiuotntloim for bills of exchange arc not calculated to cause a revival of gold Imports.
