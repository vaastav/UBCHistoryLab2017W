tmS BURLINGTON FREE PRESS AND TIMES; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1917. 10 FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE Washington, Deo. 4.-Prestdent Wilson's annual message to Congress, delivered to-day, is as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: Eight months have olapsed since I had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of Immense and grave significance for us. I shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize theso events. The practi cal particulars of the part we have played In that time will be laid before you In the reports of the executive depart ments. I shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast aftalrs, our pres ent duties and tho Immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always In view. 

SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR WAIl. I shnll not ga back to debate tho causes f the war. Tho Intolerable wrongs done wd planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious lo every true American to need to bo rehearsed. Dut I shall ask you to con sider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objectives and tho measures by which we mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here in this p)ace is action, and our action must move straight towards definite ends. Our object is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until It Is won. But it is worth while asking and an swering the question, when Bhall we con sider the war won? From one point of view It is not neces sary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war la about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose In It. As a nation, we are united In spirit and Inten tion. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent who does not? CRITICISM OF THE THOUGHTLESS. I hear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also Bee men here and there fling them selves In Impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither Its nature nor the way In which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirit. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. But from another point of view I be lieve that It Is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action con sider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settlement of Its searching Issues. We are the spokesmen of the American people and they have a right to know whether their purpose Is ours. They desire peace by the overcom Ing of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that Interrupt peace and render It Impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what action we propose They are Impatient with those who de sire peace by any sort of compromise deeply and indignantly impatient but they will be equally Impatient with us If we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are plan ning for in seeming to make conquest of peace by arms. MUST CRUSH GERMAN POWER, I believe thatI speak for them when I ay two things: First, that this intoler able thing of which the masters of Ger many have shown us the ugly face, this menace of combined Intrigue and force Which we now see so clearly as the Ger man power. A thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenated peace tnust be crushed, and if it be not utterly . brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly Intercourse of the nations and, second, that when this thing and Its t power are Indeed defeated and the tlmo i comes that we can discuss peace when .," the German people have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready In the name of their people to accept tho common Judg ment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the basis of law and of covenant for the life of the world we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay it ungrudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will ' be full, Impartial Justice Justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settlement must affect our enemies as well as our friends. NO VINDICTIVENESS. You catch, with me, the voices of hu , manlty that are In the air. They grow v dally more audible, more artlculatlvc, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They Insist nt that the war shall not end In vindictive ,lt action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished be cause the Irresponsible rulers of a single 5 country have themselves done deep and abominable wrong. It Is this thought "no annexations, no .contributions, no punitive Indemnities." Just because this crudo formula expresses tho Instinctive Judgment as to right of plain men every where it has been made diligent UBe of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray and the people of every other country their agents could reach, In order that premature pcaco might bo brought about before autocracy has been taught Its final and convincing lesson and the people of the world put In control of their own destinies. But the fact that a wrong use n and existence of their empire, a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression, Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false and we must seek by tho utmost openness and candor as to our real alms to convince them of its falseness. We are In fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one Is threatening the existence or the Independence of the peaceful enter prise of the Qerman empire. made of a Just Idea Is no reason why a I The worst that can happen to the detrl- rlght use should not be maae 01 it. ought to be brought under the patronage of Its real friends. Let It be said again that autocracy must first bo shown the utter futility of Its claims to power or leadership In tho mod ern world. It Is Impossible to apply any Btandard of Justice as long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany com mand. Not until that has been done can right be set up as arbiter and peace maker among the nations. But when that has been done as, God wilting, It assuredly will be we shall at least be free to do an unprecedented thing and this Is the time to avow our purpose to do'lt. We shall be free to base peace on generosity and Justice to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the victors. 

PRESENT TAX IS" TO WIN WAR. Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and Immediate task Is to win the war and nothing shall turn us aside from It until It is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of materials, Is being devoted and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until It is achieved. Those who desire to bring peace about before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will ! not entertain It. We shall regard the war awake and fully comprehends the issues as won only when the German people invoivea. say to us through properly accredited

The thought of tho lanns ana peop es man tneir own-over p,aln peopJo nere nnd everywhere through mo greui empire 01 Ausina-nungary, world tha Mot,la who an.ov a;, ment of the German people Is this, that If they should still, after the war Is over, continue to be obliged to live under ambi tious and Intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other people of the world could not trust, It might be Impossible to admit them to the part nership of nations which must hence forth guarantee the world'B peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of govern ments. It might be Impossible, also, In such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic intercourse which must Inevitably spring dut of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression In that; and such a situation, inevitable because of distrust, would In the very nature of things sooner or later cure Itself, by processes which would assuredly set In. WAR'S WRONGS MUST BB RIGHTED. The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, com mitted In this war will have to be righted. That, of course. But they can not and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. Tha world will not permit the commission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. Statesmen must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world Is everywhere wide over hitherto free Balkan States, over Turkey, and within Asia which must be relinquished. GERMANY'S FATAL ERROR. Germany's success by skill, by Industry, no privilege nnd have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong. Is the air all governments must henceforth breathe If they would live, It is in the full disclosing light of that by knowledge, by enterprise we did not thought that all policies must be con- grudge or oppose, but admired rather, celved and executed in this mid-day hour She had built up for herself a real empire of the world s Hie. Qerman rulers have of trade and Influences, secured by the been able to upset the peace of the world peace of the world. We were content only because the German people were to abide the rivalries of manufacture, not satisfied under their tutelage to share science and commerce that were Involved for us In her success and stand or fall j as we had or did not have the brains and the Initiative to surpass ner. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political dom ination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. PEACE IS ANTI-PRUSSIANISM. The peace we must make muBt remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and northern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but It must also deliver the peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe, in Asia from the Impudent and the comradeship of the other peoples of the world either In thought or in per son. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exer cised authority over them. But the con gress that concludes the war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now In the hearts and consciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run with those tides. All those things Uave been true from the beginning of this stupendous war and I cannot help thinking that If they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of tho Russian people might have once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, sus picion and distrust swept away and a real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had alien domination of the Prussian military they ben confirmed In that belief since, and commercial autocracy. We owe It, however, to ourselves, to say that we do not wish In any way to Impair or to rearrango the Austro-Hun-garian empire. It Is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either Industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to- them In any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands, In all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for tho peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the peoples of the Turkish empire the right and oppor tunity to make their own lives safe, their own fortunes secure against oppres sion or injusttco and from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. GERMANS NOT THREATENED. And our attitude and purpose with re gard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We Intend no wrong against the German empire, no Interference with her Internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other absolutely unjusti fiable, absolutely contrary to the prin ciples we have professed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation. The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now permit to deceive them and to act as their masters the sad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable govern ment of free men might haye been avoided. The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that havo kept the German people In the dark and the poison has been administered by the very same hands. The only possible anti dote is the truth. It can not be uttered too plainly or too often. URGES WAR ON AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. From every point of view, therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the Senate In January. Our entrance Into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when It is over. When I said In January that the -nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways upon the sea, but also to (assured and un nolested access to those pathways I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone which need our countenance and support, but also of the great and powerful nations and of our present enemies as well as our present associates in the war. now of Austria, herself among the rest, as well as of Serbia nnd of Poland. Justice and oquallty of rights can bn had only at a groat price. Wo are seeking permanent, not temporary foundations for the peace of tho world and must seek them candidly and fearlessly. As allies, tho right will provo to bo the expedient. What shall wo do, then to push this great war of freedom and Justice to its righteous conclusion? Wo must clear away with a thorough hand all Impedi ments and wo must mako every ujui mcnt of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and tnrnn nM n flffhtlnff unit. One very embarrassing obstacle that stands In our way Is that we are at war with Germany, but not with her allies. t thnrefnra vorv ftnrnestly rccommena that the Congress Immediately declare the United States In a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does It seem strange tn vnll Hint thin Rhnllld he the Conclusion of the argument I hove Just addressed to you? Is It not? It is In fact the In evitable logic of what I havo said. Aus tria-Hungary Is for the time Deing not her own mistress, but simply the vassal of the German government. Wo muBt face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment In this stern business. The government of Austria, Hungary Is not acting upon Its own Inttlatlvo or In response to the wishes and the feelings of Its own peoples, but as the Instrument of nnother nation. We must meet Its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one The war can be successfully conducted In no other way. The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They also are tho tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand In the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but It seems to me that we should go only where Immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others. The financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest them selves as tho war and Its undertakings develop, but I will tako the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the releaso of our whole force and energy necessary to extend In certain particulars tho legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies are also neces sary. I believe It necessary to creato a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons Into and from the United States. 

ALIEN ENEMIES OF BOTH SEXES. Legislation should bo enacted defining as a criminal offense every willful viola tion of the presidential proclamations relating to alien enemies promulgated under section 4067 of the revised statutes and providing appropriate punishments; and women as well as men should be Included under the terms of the acts placing restraint upon all alien enemies. It Is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be fed and housed at the expense of the govern ment In the detention camps and it would be the purpose of the legislation I have suggested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and other similar institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals. MORE PRICE REGULATION. Recent experience has convinced me that the Congress must go further. In author izing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrained selfishness. While wo have eliminated profiteering in several branches of Industry It still runs Im pudently rampant In others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of Justice that, while tho regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no to express tho opinion that It will be Impossible to deal In any but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with tho enormous appropriations of the pub lic moneys which must continue to be made If the war Is to be properly sus tained, unless the House will consent to return to its former practice of Initiat ing and preparing all appropriation bills through a single committee In order that responsibility may be centered, expendi tures standardized and made uniform and waste and duplication as much as possl bio avoided. Additional legislation may also become necessary before the present Congress again adjourns In order to effect the most efficient co-ordination and operation of the railroad and other transportation sys tems of the country; but to that I shall, If circumstances should demand, call the attention of the Congress upon another occasion. If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about is that In the pres ent session of the Congress our whole attention - and energy should be concen trated on the vigorous, rapid and success ful prosecution of the great task of win nlng the war. We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this la a war of high prin ciple, debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced Into it to save the very in' stltutlons we live under from corruption and destruction. OUR 

CAUSE WORTH WHILE, The purposes of the central powers strike straight at the very heart of every thing we believe tn; their methods of war fare outrage every principle of human ity and of knightly honor; Intrigue has corrupted the very thought and spirit of many of our people; their sinister and Becret diplomacy has sought to take our very territory away from us and dis rupt the union of the States. Our safety would be at an end, our honor forever sullied and brought Into contempt wero we to permit their triumph. They are striking at the very existence of democ racy and liberty. It Is because It Is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in which all the free peoples of tho world are banded to gether for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation of all that It has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we feel ourselves doubly constrained to propose for Its out come only that which Is righteous and of Irreproachable Intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like mo'lve and equality. For this wo can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun Is fired. I havo spoken plainly because this seems to me the time when It Is most neces sary to speak plainly, In order that alt the world may know that even tn the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought is of carrying the war through to Its end we have not forgotten any Ideal or principle for which the name of America has been held In honor among the nations and for which it has been our glory to contend In the great genera. tlons that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the people have been opened and they see. The hand of God Is laid on the na tlons. He will show them favor, I de voutly believe, only If they rise to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy. IS. DE SUES FREED BY JURY 168,671 LBS.

Mr. Jones, a pleasant-look ing man of 60, with wmte nair ana mous tach, continued to smile broadly and benevolently at the young woman, and to wag his head paternally. Other Jurors Joined him In smiling at her before Justice Manning naa taaen nw ei. mo "" court room knew the verdict was one of acquittal, and was on the verge of a dem onstration. Justice Manning saw the dan ger and the first thing ne saia was: "There must not be the slightest ex pression of approval or disapproval, re gardless of the verdict. If anone so of fends I will commit him to Jail. Clerk of the Court Daniel E. Sealey then went through the formula of asking the Jury if it had agreed on the verdict. "We have," came empnaucaiiy irom an twelve. "Gentlemen of the Jury, what Is your verdict?" "Not guilty." Mm. De Saulles reached for the hand of her lawyer. Henry A. Uterhart. and shook It, smiling Joyruiiy. Tne ciean veraict oi not guilty had not been entirely looked for by the defense. They feared a verdict of "not guilty because insane." wnicn migni have endangered the young woman's lib erty and would certainly havo jeopardized her chance of having the custody of the child In the future. As It Is the young woman may get her boy back to-morrow. Being declared guiltless, her position as legal guardian of the boy Is considered unassatlaable. Only the Justice's threat kept the court room quiet, while Justice Manning asked: Are there any more cnarges against this defendant?" "There aro not," said District Attorney Weeks. Then the defendant Is discharged." MRS. DE SAULLES GETS CUSTODY OF HER SON Lad Restored to Mother without Resort to Legal Procedure. Roslvn. N. Y.. Dec. 2,-John L. De Saulles, Jr., aged four and one-half years, was restored to-day to the custody of his mother, Mrs. Blanca De Saulles. who was' acquitted last night by a Jury In supreme court at Mlneola of the murder of her di vorced husband, the night of August 3. The young Chilean woman had Just told Cambridge, Dec. 2. An official state ment concerning tho number of deer killed In Vermont during the season of 1917 re veals the fact that 168,671 pounds of veni son wero bagged, a large addition to tha State's visible supply of fresh meat. Essex county hunters got the greatest number of deer, 156, and Lamoille and Orange counties furnished the largest sized bucks, 350-pound animals being shot In both Hyde Park and West Falrlsc. Interesting statistical Information of the deer season of 1917 follows: Total number of deer killed, nine days, 1917 !' Tc ' deer killed, 18 days, 1816, Largest number of deer reported from Essex county, 1D6. Second largest number reported from Windham county, 124. Third largest number reported from Washington county, 106. . Largest bucks reported In Lamoille and Orange counties, 350 pounds, each, shot by George Jones of Hyde Park and Bryan Fltts of West Falrlee.

Number of buck fawns Illegally or acci dentally killed, 11. Special efforts were made to maintain on efficient service patrol through the past open season, and as a result, lawless hun ters have not been In evidence. The pol icy has been to prevent violations, rather than to start prosecutions. Several war dens report extinguishing fires started, by carelessness of hunters. There have been very few accidents due to carelessness on the part of the hunters. SUCCESSFUL HUKTEK8, The names of those who shot deer In AriHi.nn Chittenden.

Stlnehour, the well known contractor and builder. When one realties the price that the work of a steeplejack commands he Is led, to ask why Mr. Fogg is working for the wages of an ordinary carpenter. This Mr. Fogg explains by saying that he prefers steady work in one place where he can be with his family to traveling from place to place for more money which he has been offered many times.

Brlgham. one of Bakersfleld's most prominent cltlsens and a well known Franklin, county lawyer. Colonel Brlgham has been a frequent visi tor at the hotel for the past 49 years. The records of the house are very in complete and It Is difficult to secure much that Is authentlo concerning Its history except for the past BO years. It is known, however, that It was built tn 1815 and was first occupied as a hotel In 1811 Among those by whom It has been run are O. 8. Bliss. Charles Field, Hiram Pierce, G. Marshall Pierce. S. I.

He says he has no nerves and can work on top of the spire Just as comfortably as on the ground. He works from an hour a day to half a day it tho wind does not blow. The wind always Bways the spire. Inside the spire are braces and up these braces climbs Mr. Fogg to his work in the air. He is held In place while he Is at work by means of a rope thrown over these braces and held by a man Inside the spire. TO
