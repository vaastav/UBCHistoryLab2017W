Its columns are daily filled with urgent edi torials and with memorials and petitions of labor organizations. Wanamaker and Quay are po litical enemifes, as is well known. For this reason, Quay may pos sibly oppose the bill, unlezs he fears the big labor element of Pennsylvania. Penrose, his asso ciate, is for exclusion, and to-day introduced a bill barring the Chi nese. So did Qua}% but he did it "by request." Frye and Depew Silent. Frye of Maine positively refuses to dis cuss the question of exclusion, but he will probably vote against an exclusion bill end in favor of the Pacific railroads, as he did in 1S92. Senator Depew, chairman of the New York Central board of directors, may also oppose exclusion. He refuses to express his views, however. It is gratifying to observe that Chinese exclusion will not be a party question. It ADVERTISEMENTS. WHAT CAUSES DEAFMESS. She Principal Cause Is Curable but Generally Overlooked. Many thing's may cause deafness, and very often it is difficult to trace a cause. Borne people inherit deafness. Acute dis- eases like scarlet fever sometimes cause deafness. But by far the most common cause of loss of hearing Is catarrh of the head and throat. A prominent specialist on ear troubles gives as his opinion that nine out of ten cases of deafness are traced to throat trouble; this Is probably overstated, but it is certainly true that more than half cf all cases of poor hearing were caused by catarrh. The catarrhal secretion in the nose and throat finds its way into the eustachian tube and by clogging it up very soon af- fects the hearing and the hardening of the secretion makes the loss of hearing permanent, unless the catarrh whicn caused the trouble is cured. Those who are hard cf hearing "mav think this a little far fetched, but any- one at all observant must have noticed how a hard cold in the head will affect the hearing and that catarrh if long ne- glected will certainly impair the sense cZ hearing and ultimately cause deafness. If the nose and throat are kept clear and free from the unhealthy secretions of catarrh, the hearing will at once greatly improve and anyone suffering from deaf- ness and catarrh can satisfy themselves on this point by using a fifty-cent box of btuart s Catarrh Tablets, a new catarrii cure, which in the past year has won the approval of thousands of catarrh suffe-- crs, as well as physicians, because it is in convenient form to use. contains no cocaine or opiate and is as safe and pleas- ant for children as for their elders Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is a whole- some combination of Blood Boot, Guaia- co li Eucalyptol and similar antiseptics and they cure catarrh and catarrhal deaf- ness by action upon the blood and mucous membrane of the nose and throat A.s one physician aptly expresses It: «-\?£ do not have to draw upon the imagl lnation to discover whether you are get- ting benefit from Stuart's Catarrh Tab- lets; improvement and relief are appar- en t from the first tablet taken."

So in the tabulated column appended many of those who are classed as doubtful will probably .vote for exclusion, for natural ly if they expect the bill to pass, the in ference would be thajt they will vote for It.

IV order that he may be well posted upon the Chinese question when the exclusion law comes up before Con gress, Hon. S. D. Woods, who repre sents the Second District of this State, has been gathering data from all sources. There is no inconsiderable Chi nese population in his district and he is supplementing his personal knowledge with that of others who have been more closely in touch with them. The following letter has been sent to him from this city: SAN FRAXCISCO, Dec. 5, 1901. Hon. S. D. Woods, Member of Qonsresa; Washington, D. C— Sir: In answer to your request for a statement of the moral condi tion ot the Chinese in San Francisco. I re spectfully submit the following: My experiences during the past twenty-five years as organizer of Chinese Sunday-schools in Eastern America, as a missionary in China and to the Chinssa of the Pacific Coast, and as an official Chinese Interpreter in the Fed eral courts of California, have led, me to ob serve with much Interest and ever-growing concern the conditions surrounding the Chi nese laborers In California and the probable effect of those conditions uDon the home lov ing people of our own land, as well as upon the Chipese themselves. . . ..-'■ I do not speak from racial prejudice. I nave none. What I have to say about the Chinese with whom I have come in such close con tact is said from a sense of duty and with the hope that It may call attention to the alarm ing conditions now existing in the clcse, mys terious, fetid atmosphere of the Chinatown ct San Francisco so apparent io any worker amcts the Chinese of that quarter. Is the spring of 1SS6 I had occasion to ad drejs a Sunday evening audience In the Chorcn of Strangers In New York City. Upon that oc casion 1 said in effect that durins my five years' rsstdence in the part of the province of China from whence the Chinese of Califor nia have mostly come I had been given ex ceptional opportunities for observing and com paring the Chinese who returned home from California with those - who had never left China, and as the result of my observations I. was strongly In favor of the restriction laws and of making them even more restrictive, be cause of the demoralizing effect that emigra tion had had upon the Chinese themselves. Since that time I have studied conditions earnestly and thoroughly and I ■ seen tenden cies amons these Chinese that fill my mind with alarm for their own future welfare and for the welfare of American youths who come in contact with them. Conditions of Life. Practically all of the Chinese who come to California are from a small region of one or the eiehteen provinces of China. Most of them are farmers' sons, unaccustomed- to city lue. They leave their wives In China, where they can support them for about $4 a month, mak ing visits home every four or five years. . There are at sresent about 1S.0C0 of these men in San Francisco, huddled together within a sracs comDoaed of a few blocks, separated from their wives, with no home 'life and with out the restraining influence of} women. A condition of immorality has resulted only paralleled by that which called down in old times the judgment of God uaon Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same perversions or morality exist in Chinatown to-day. Another evil calling for drastic measures Is the importation of -women for immoral pur poses. There are at present in Chinatown hundreds of Chinese women who have been in duced to come here to marry rich husband3 and who upon their arrival were sold into the lowest form of human slavery. Since their organization the Presbyterian and Methodist rescue homes have, under great difficulties,, rescued over nins hundred Chinese slave girls. What must have bean the number who have lived and died In bondasei Under the instructions ot the Attorney Gen' eral, the United States Attorney for the North ern District 'of California, his associates, and the Chinese Bureau at San Francisco, have made every effort to cope with this evil and have had the encouragement of the San Fran cisco press, but the present laws have ren dered nugatory many of their efforts by reason of the fact that if through any fraudulent means the owners of these girls can establish their American nativity the law as it stands to-day cannot compel these owners to release There are a number of earnest ■ Chinese Christians and others in San Francisco, whose morals are beyond question. I love these Chi nese Christian brethren as I do- the Christians of ■ my own people and I do not feel ais courased in the work of the Gospel among them. - But knowing as I do these alarming facts, I feel it my duty to call attention to them. V v* ".' Suggestions for Amendments. Under the present law thousands of laborers return to this country every year after a visit to China. I believe condition' ■ are such ana the danger to our own youth so great that not only «=hould the present exclusion laws be re enacted, but made sy as to exclude all alien Chinese laborers returning to thi3 country ex cept these .who bring their wives, and that there should be strict provisions requiring the registration of such families and the deporta tion of any who should for immoral purposes abuse the privilege. • • I would respectfully suggest to you that some such restrictions as_the following would in my opinion very largely tend to exclude all undesirable Chinese persons desiring to enter this country and would also mitigate the evils above complained of: • First— That all alien Chinese females in the- United States bs registered annually. That information as to the United States regarding slavery, with directions as to where to obtain relief If held In bondage, be printed on their certificates In English and Chinese, and that such Information and directions be read and explained to the holder of such certificate by the officer issulns it at the time of registra tion, such certificate to be retained by the fe male to whom it is Issued. That information and directions similar to that contained in the certificate be conspicuously posted In every apartment occupied by Chinese females. Spcond— That any alien Chlnsse person who shall be guilty of any crime against the mar riage laws of the State or Territory in which he shall reside shall be deported. Third— That any alien Chinese person who shall engaee in any business or occupation contrary to the laws of the United States, or of the State ■ or Territory In which he shall carry on such business or occupation, shall be "Fourth— That any alien Chinese person who shall be found present at any meeting of any society or corporation where any business is transacted contrary to the laws of the United States, or of the State or Territory In which such meeting Is held, shall be deported. \ ery respectfully ' ■ D. • D.

President. &-rr<HAT the Chinese are determined 

THAT the Chinese are determined to fight the renewal of the exclu i sion act by the present Congress 11 is evinced by an editorial in the Chinese dally paper, Chung Sal Yat Po, published at 804 Sacramento street. In an editorial published on No vember 26 the details of the plan of cam paign are outlined. Four persons will compose the party. They are Ng Poon Chew, the editor of the paper and a Presbyterian minister; Low Choy and Low Chee, sons of a. prominent Chinese merchant and at present attend ing school, arid Brewer, a singer and in terpreter. The party has laid out an elaborate plan of campaign. The article in the Chinese paper, translated by Rev. John Endicott Gardner, the Chinese in spector and translator attached to the Chinese Bureau, is as follows: Going Together to Lecture. The vexatious law of Geary's that has been in operation in the United States for the ex clusion of Chinese will expire in the coming year. At present the labor unions ana the newspapers in the western portion of the • United States are making continued exclusion their chief theme; furthermore, fearing that the merchants in the East migl-t regard the • exclusion lajv as inimical to trade, and that consequently they would not consent to a re enactment of the law upon its expiration, they resort to sophistry in their arguments. claim- Ing that we Chinese have no patriotism, that in spite of exclusion Chinese will not purchase one whit less of American goods, that from the time the exclusion act went into effect the trade that the United States has attained -from Chir.a has been perceptibly and gradually in creasing every day, hoping thus to inveigle the Easterners into the position of not resist ing the continuance of exclusion. \ Though Minister "VVu and Consul General Ho migfc^ expend much lip and tongue energy or labor, much with pen and ink in answering their ar-< guments, the people in general and the schol ars of those cities might say "These are offi cials — one a Minister and the other a. Cousul — and they are merely performing their duty in their respective official positions; what else can they do?" Even the best and most ex haustive energies would thus be swept aside with this one saying. We could no longer bear looking upon these passing events ani do nothing. Thought Preacher the Best. ■We desired some one thoroughly versed In English and capable of expressing himself to travel widely in the East, lecturing every where for the purpose of saying to the mer chants of the different States and the people of wealth that the exclusion act is exceedingly inimical to trade in order that they might take the words of Minister Wu and Consul General Ho as statements of fact, but It was ditneu't to find such a person and there was no fountain from which the money was to come. Subsequently we thought of the trans lator on our own paper, Ng Poon Chew, v.-ho has been a preacher for many years, a man locked up to all along by Westerners, and one who. because of those qualities, had been repeatedly and earnestly invited to lecturt by the people of the University of Southern Cali fornia and at Stanford University and by tha various associations at Alameda, Sacramento, Oakland and this city, ! when they would In variably listen T7ith rapt attention. This be ing so, our paper decided to appoint Mr. Ng to the position of lecturer. Still the matter of expenses incidental to traveling through the different States presented us with difficulties. Will Utilize Churches. .-■■;* While planning about it the . project hap pened to. reach the ears of the General Board of the Presbyterian Church of; tiia city and New York. The board signified its willingness to help, writing also beforehand to the people of the different cities asking them to lend their churches for the lectures. The several tens of thousands of notices printed In English for circulation at the various cities the Pres byterian church took hold of and distributed besides setting forth the dates when certain cities would be reached. In addition to this there will be two brothers. Low Chee and Low Choy,. and an American namedr Brewer, who will go along to play and alng. Low Chee and Low Choy are the highly intelligent sons of Low Wan Shang of Fook Wo & Co. , dealers in Japanese wares of this city. They are. students at one of the .colleges In this city, but for the time being on leave of ab sence in order to go along on the lecture tour. As to the American named Brewer, he has been for some time past teaching English at the Chinese Presbyterian Church of this city. ."--■.: The Plans Proposed.. These three will go along and play and sing as a means of enticing Americans to listen. It is estimated that it will require several thousand dollars to cover the traveling ex penses and hotel fare for the- four peoplo, all of which amount will be paid. by tie Ameri can Presbyterian church. At every place they arrive s0 they will set forth in gsneral terrrta the benefit that will come from mutual inter course between : the two nations,' using the Boxer ■ trouble of the past year merely as an introduction.: in order that the hearers may not be conscious of the fact that they have come especially on accunt of the exclu3iori;act. Later jen in course- of the lecture they "will say that with the vexatious Chinese exclusion '. act in force the Americans are not different^ from .the Boxers, as the Boxers claim to lo^4^ China, but as a matter, of tact Injured China.; so the. exclusion act, though claimed to bene3t the United States, as a matter of fact wLir Injure the United States; that should tha United States re-enact the exclusion act trado can certainly not prosper; R.n<1 that fur»h«*- mqre since the United States desire* to -have . ttle beurflt of China's trade she must abolish the exclusion act in order to satisiy us Chinese. Have Letters of Introduction. This is but a general outline as to the par ticulars. Doubtless Mr. Ngr wiii be able to deal with them very cleverly. We hope that Mr. Ng will on this occasion move the hearts of the Easterners so that as a result the ex clusion act will be -abolished and our peoplo will be so invigorated as not to be unworthy of the project. There are many prominent American citizens as well as presidents of universities- who have given Mr. Ng letters of recommendation In order that upon arrival at Washington he may be able to go before the high officials of the different departments. A ' legislator of this State named Kaan (phonetic imitation of some English name.— Translator) and Consul General Ho also gave hi' letters of recommendation so that he may present himself to Minister "Wu. Low Chee and the others have also let ters of recommendation of the educational or der so that .wherever ¦: they go- they may be able to meet distinguished Americana. We have engaged Chan Sow Shek to be act- Ing translator on our paper. Mr. Ng and party will start in the morning at 8 o'ctock on Th#ir journey to the different cities, which are as follows in : the order in which they wi!t ) be reached: Fresno, L03 Angeles, Pasadena. ! Alhambra, Denver. Omaha. Chicago. Toledo. ; Cleveland, Columbus, Wheeling, Pittsburg. Washington. Baltimore. Philadelphia. Ne,m ; York.
