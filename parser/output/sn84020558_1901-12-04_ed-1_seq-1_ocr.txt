THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE A Voluminous Document Presented to the Congress ITS SCOPE VERY COMPREHENSIVE Foreign Affairs Briefly Touched Upon Recommendations Regarding the Regulation of Corporate Fortunas The Punishment of Those Who Assault Public Officials. Discouragement of Anarchy Fc rest Preservation and National Irrigation A Large Navy and More Effective Army Organization. Washington, D. C. Nov. 3. The fol lowing is a ropy of the President's message presented to. the congress to day: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The congress assembles this year un der the shadow of a great calamity. On the s'xth of September, President Mc Kinley was shot by an anarchist while attending the fan-American Exposi tion at Buffalo, and died in that city on the fourteenth of that month. Of the last seven presidents, he is the third who has been murdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the cir cumstances of this, the third assassin ation of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln and President Gar flJd were ki4ed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in his tory: President Lincoln fulling a vic tim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war. and President Oarfleld to the revengeful vanity of i disappointed office-seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly de praved criminal belonging to that bo:ly of criminals who object to all govern ments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most juc and liberal laws, and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free peo ple's sober will as to the tyrannical and in-responsible despot. 

PRESIDENT M'KIXLKY. It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely loved man in ail the 1 nited States; while we have never had any public man of his posi tion who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities incident to pub lic life. His political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and mot generous tribute to the broad kindli ness of nature, the sweetness and gen t'a less of character which so endear ed him to his close associates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affections and home virtues which are all-importint in the make-up of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example t" all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate home relations. There could be no persona! hatred of him, for he never acted wiui aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to resrct him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those murderous criminals who' seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is ex ercised for political ends. inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose slock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself beionged among the wage-workers, who had entered the army as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at when the president was assassinated, but the honost toil which is content with moderate gains after ji lifetime of unremitting labor, largely in the service of the public. Still less was power struck at In the senre that power is irresponsible or centered In the hands of any one individual. Thi blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of th-? strongest champions the "wage-worker has ever had; at one of the most faith ful representatives of the system of public rights and representative gov ernment who has ever risen to publ'c office. President McKinley filled that political office for which the entire peo ple vote, and no president not even Lincoln himself was ever more ear estly anxious to represent the well thought-out wishes of the people; bis one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people to tir.d out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their thought, af ter having endeavored to guide that thought right. He h;id just ben re elocted to- the presidency because th- majority of our citizens, the majority of our farmers and wage-workers, be lieved that he had faithfully upheld their interests for four years. They feit themselves in dose and intimate touch with him. They felt that he represente 1 so well and so honorably all their ideals ;nd aspirations that they wished him to coniine for another four years to represent thern. . And this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas like infamy of his act, he took advant age of an occasion when the president was meeting the people generally; and advancing as if to take the hand out stretched to him In kindly and broth erly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow. There Is no baser deed In all the annals of crime. THE 

COUNTRY'S GRIEF. The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days, while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the light was stilled In the kindly eyes and the breath went from the lip4 that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his mur derer, of love for his friends, and of unfaltering trust In the will of the Most High. Such a death, crowning the glory of such a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what hj had accopllshed and In his own person al character, that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who Is dead; but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splen did achievements of his life and the ! grand heroism with which he met his ! death. When we turn from the man to th nation, the harm done is po great as to excite our gravest apprehensions and v demand our wisest and most resolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist. Inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and In the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spir its of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind is flowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they j cannot escape their share of responsi ' bility for the whirlwind that is reaped. ! This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter of sensa tionalism, and to the crude and foolish visionary who. for whatever reason, apologizers for crime or e:;cltes aimless discontent. The blow was aimed not at this presi dent, but at all presidents: at every symbol of government. President Mc Kinley was as emphatically the embod iment of the popular will of the nation expressed through the forms of law as a New England town meeting is i.i i f..ail.n Ihn T"n hwwt i n.frt t of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of the town. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the presi- ! dent be accepted as due to protest against "inequalities in the social or j der," save as the murder of all the j freemen engaged In a town meeting j could be accepted as a, protest against j that -ccial inequality which puts a malefactor in ail. Anarc hy is no raor 'an expression of "social discontent" than picking pockets or wife-beating. The anarchist, and especially the an archist in the United States, is merely i one tpye of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity In a greater de I gree. The man who advocates anar- i chy directly or indirectly, in any shaih? or fashion, or the man who apologize? for anarchists and their deeds, mnks himself morally accessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist Is a criminal whose perverted instincts led him to prefer confusion and chaos lo the most beneficent form of social or der. His protest of concern for work ingmen is outrageous In its impudent falsity; for if the political institutions of this country do not afford opportun ity to every honest and intelligent son of toil, then the door of hope la forever closed against him. The anarchist is everywhere not merely the enemy oi system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy is rli umnhant. Its triumith will lost for but one red moment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism. For the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his doctrine, we need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary mur derer. He Is not the victim of social or politic nl Injustice. There are no wrongs to remedy In his case. The cause of his criminality is to be found In his own evil passions. and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on. not in any failure by others or by the stare to do justice to him or his. He Is t malefactor and nothing else. He la in no sense, in no shape or way. a "pro duct of social conditions," save as a highwayman Is 'produced" by the Tact that an unarmed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great and holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked In such , cause. No man or body of men preach- (Continued on Ninth Pase.)

Washington, Dec. 3. The cabinet meeting today was priclpally consumed in a discussion of the insular decisions handed down yesterday by the supreme court. On the whole, it is believed. j tne views of the court were quite sat- isfactory to the administration. It was ' pointed out that the ultimate results ' of tne decisions are in a measure spec- ulattve at present with the exception that customs duties collected In this country on goods shipped from the Philippines since the ratification of the Paris treaty will have to be refunded. It is not thought, however, that the aggregate will be large. Secretary Guge explains that it will be within $1,000,000. He called attention to the fact that a great bulk of the.

MEANS NEW LEGISLATION. Washington. Dec. 3. The supreme court decision relative to the Philip pines has brought to the attention of the leaders In congress the need of legislation for the archipelago some what on the lines of that enacted for Porto Rico, particularly in connection with revenue questions and imports ' from the Philippines. Such legislation I will originate in the house of repre- j sentatlves and it appears to !e con- ced'.d that the ways and means com- j mittee will deal only with questions outside those involving revenue. In , any event the house leaders doubtless j will prepare the general frame work ' the general frame work of Philippine bill before the coming holidays. NONE HEEDED Will Not be Instructed.

The president re ments in the Philippines, and that U i viewed in an interesting Way the won- was not even deemed necessary to issue instructions to the civil government of the islands on the subject as a conse quence of the decisions. Secretary Root has had several conferences with other officials in regard to the enact ment of legislation necessary to mett existing conditions, but he said today that as he had not yet received an offi cial copy of the court's decision he was unable even to indicate what steps should be taken. The secretary of the treasury today Issued to the collectors of customs In the United States a telegraphic ord?r directing them to admit free of dutv goods imported from the Philippines. The following is the order. "Discon tinue the requirement of entry and col lection of duty on merchandise shown by manifest of vessels to be shipped from the Philippines. All free delivery of goods In bond. Detain clrgars and cigarettes until International revenue stamps are affixed under circulars 81 and 85.

Wash burn, counsel for the treasury depart ment before the board of United States general appraisers. In discussing the rupee protest case of L. liebce & Sons, decided by the board yesterday, said to day he thought an appeal would be taken to the courts. When seen, Mr. Washburn said: "While I have as yet made no report to the treasury department of the ad verse decision to the government in the Beebe case, I believe it will be ap pealed to the circuit court. The under standing on both sides was, when the care was resubmitted to the board, that an ap;cal would be taken from the board's decision to the courts. "I shall shortly consider the matter, and make suitable recommendations to the treasury department." It seems likely from Mr Washburn's remarks that the Beebe case, or one si in i lar , will run t h rou gh the cou r is again, ultimately being settled by the United States supreme court.

An Early and Bespectful Ad journment. Washington, Dec. 3. Not In many years have the members of the house listened with such rapt attention to the annual message of the president of the United States as they did today in the reading of the first message of Presi dent Roosevelt. Every word was fol lowed intently from the announcement of the tragic death of President Mc Kinley, in the opening sentence to the expression of the closing w ish that our relations with the world would continue peaceful. The reading occupied two hours, but not over a dozen members left their seats until it was concluded. Several times there was applause and at the conclusion there was an enthusiastic demonstration on the republican side. On the motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio that portion of the message relating to the death of tne late president was referred to a committee to consist of one member from each state, to Join a similar committee of the senate to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it mav be nroDer ! for congress to express the deep sensi bilities of the nation over the death of the president. The speaker appointed a committee headed by Mr. Grosvenor, ! .nd hen as, further mark of respect. the house adjourned. THE

The reading occupied nearly two hours and a half and was listened to with marked respect by the senators. The first portion of the message deal ing with the Buffalo tragedy excited the most profound interest in the sen ate. At the conclusion of the reading of the message. Mr. Foraker. the senior j senator from Ohio, presented the Mc Kinley resolution and as a further mark of respect the senate adjourned. FORM OF THE MESSAGE. Washington. Dec. 3. The president's annual message to congress went in to day for the first time in print.
