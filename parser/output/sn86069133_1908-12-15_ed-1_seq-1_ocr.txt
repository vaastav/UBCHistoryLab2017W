4t I i j Washington Dec 15In a special message to the senate on the Brgwns ville affair President Ro9sevelt rec ommended the passage of a law pro viding for the reinstatement by the secretary of war after investigation of such members of the negro regi ment innocent of direct complicity in the shooting up of Brownsville and who can prove that they actually had no direct knowledge of the crime Attached to the message Is a re port of detectives who have been working on the case This report in cludes a statement by Private Con yers of Company B Twentyfifth In faptry in which he admits taking part in the raid and implicates a number of his former comrades The detectives claimed to have se cured from Conyers a letter written to him by Senator Foraker which the detectives claim stopped Conyers from making further revelations Conyers after he found he had been giving facts of the raid to govern ment detectives is said to have at tempted suicide suicideThe The Message The presidents message follows I inclose herewith a letter from the secretary of war transmitting a re port of the investigation made by Mr Herbert J Browne employed by the department in conjunction with Cap tain W J Baldwin to investigate as far as possible what happened at Brownsville on lath and 14th of Au gust 1906J The report and documents contain some information of great value and some statements that are obviously worthless but I submit them in their entirety This report enables us to fix with tolerable definiteness at least some of the criminals who took the lead in the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville It establishes clearly the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting but upon this point further record TV as unnecessary ae the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting has already been established beyoid all possibility of doubt The investiga tion has not gone far enough Jto en able us to determine all they facts and we will proceed with it but it has gone far enough to determine with sufficient accuracy certain facts of enough importance to make it ad visable that I place the report before youIt It appears that almost all the mem bers of Company B must have been actively concerned in the shooting either to the extent of beingparticl pants or to the extent of virtually encouraging those who were partici pants Apportions the Blame As to Companies C and D there can be no question that practically every man in them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of B troop and possibly by one or two others in one of the other troops This concealment was itself a grave offense which was greatly aggravat ed by their testifying before the sen ate committee that they were ignor ant of what they must have known Nevertheless it is to be said in par tial extenuation that they were prob ably cowed by threats made by the more desperate of the men who had actually been engaged in the shoot Ing as to what would happen to any man who failed to protect the wrong doers Moreover there are circum stances tending to show that these misguided men were encouraged by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment sand denial I feel therefore that the guilt of the men who after the event thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by re fusing to tell the truth about them though serious was In part due to the unwise and improper attitude of others and that some measure of al lowance should be made for the mis conduct In other words I believe we can afford to reinstate any of these men who now truthfully tell what has happened give all the aid they can to fix the responsibility upon those who are really guilty and show that they themselves had no guilty knowledge beforehand and were in no way Implicated in the affair I fair save by having knowledge of it I afterwards and failing and refusing to divulge it s Under the circumstances and in view of the length of time they have been out of the service and their loss of the benefit that would have accrued to them by continuous long time service we can afford to treat the men who meet the requirements given above as having been sufficient ly punished by the consequences they brought upon themselves wKea they I C 0 I t y Y
