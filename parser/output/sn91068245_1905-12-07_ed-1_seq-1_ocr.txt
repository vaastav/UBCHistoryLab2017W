HE PRESIDENTS .-MESSAGE A Strong Presentation of the Leading Questions Demanding Legislation STRONG ON RATE REGULATION The Country is Enjoying a Season of Unprecedented Prosperity Sub jects That Will Engage the Atten tion of the People's Representa tivesA Thoughtful and Exhaus tive Document. F..ll')u iig i in substance the an ri mi-a'ic of President Roosevelt, rend in both houses of Congress: Introduction. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt edly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will lie felt more or less by all attem pers of the community, both by the deserving ;uid the undeserving. Against the wrath of the Lord the wis dom of man can not avail; in times of flood or drought human ingenuity ran but partially repair the disaster A general failure of crops would hurt us. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business com munity would hurt the whole business community. lut such stoppage of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long inn the one vital factor in the per ra'anent prosperity of the country is hc high individual character of the average American worker, the aver age American citizen, no matter whether hi work be mental or man ual, whether he be farmer or wage worker, business man or professional man. , In our industrial and social system the interests of all men are so closely intertwined that in the immense ma jority of cases a straight-dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingenu ity and industry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man of great productive capacity who be comes rich by guiding the labor of ffianj' other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could produce without his guidance; and both he and they share in the benefit, which conies also to the public at large, f-h a Tin- The superficial fact that the may be unequal must never blind us to the underlying fact that there is this sharing, and that the ben efit conies iu,souie degress to each man concerned. Normally the wage-work-'. the man of small means, and the average consume!'. a well as the av erage pieducpiv are all alike helped j uy makuig c-ojjditlon such tliat th8 j ?myed that a shipper has been told man at t.xooptionu busiis ability j by a traffic oificer to buy a large receives r.u exceptional reward lor hU quantity of some commodity and then ability.

Taken as a whole we must all go up or go down together. Corporations. Yet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is also true that j where there is no governmental re straint or supervision some of the ex ceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for the common good, but in ways which tell against this common good. The fortunes amassed through corporate organiza tion are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to Rive to the sovereign that is, to the Government, which represents the people as a whole some effective power of supervision over their cor porate use. In order to insure a heal thy social and industrial life, every hig corporation should be held respon sible by, and be accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control its fonduet. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age pi com bination, and any effort to. prevent all eombination "will be not only useless, M iu the end vicious, because of the wjtempt foriaw Wwa tv tmo enforce law meTitAW.Jr Induces. We snouid, moMH)v-, recognize in cordial am! nmjdfc fashion the immense crood effected by eorjiorate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wffllth of intellect, energy, and fidelity yJpWjI ed to their service and tWeWfo're nor mally to the service tue public, by their officers and directors. The eor lratm has eome to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay. Each ran do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it doe good. But each should be fcharpl-Y cheeked where it act agftinst law and .justice. So long as the finances of the Nation are kept ujion an honest basis no other Question of internal economy with which the Congress .has the pow er to deal begins to approach in im portance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial condition unjjer which the individual? -and e jiecially the great corporation doing an interstate buMiiess are to act. The maker of our National Constitution provided especially that the regulation of intei-state commerce should come within the sphere of the General Gov ernment. ' The arguments in favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. Hut they are far stronger to-day, in view of the enor mous development of great business agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by State action. Such regulation and supervis ion can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by the Nat ional Government. I am well aware of. the difficulties of the legislation that I am suggest ing, and of the 'need of temperate and cautious action in securing it. I should emphatically protest against improp erly radical or hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the great corporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As I said in my Message of December 6 last, the immediate and most pressing need, so far as legislation is concern ed, is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervision and reg ulation of the 'rates charged by the railroads of the country engaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with modi fication, caution and self-restraint; but it should exist, so that it can be effectively execised when the need t rises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affir mative and should be given to some administrative body created by the Congress. Illegal transactions ofte'n occur un dpr tho forms of law. 3 1 has often oc- much to blame as any railroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so that nobody can fail to understand that any kind of com mission paid on freight' shipments, whether in this form or in the form of fictitious damages, or of a concession a frcss pass, reduced passenger rate, or paj'ment of brokerage, is illegal. All private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate Coqjg meree Commission or 4ome similar body so far as rates, aid agreements practically affecting rates, are con cerned. The private-car owners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable com pensation on their investment, but neither nrivate ears nor industrial raflroads mor spur tracks should be utilized devices for securing prefer ential rates'. A rebate in icing charges, or in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate should appty on goods imported than , actually obtains on domestic goods from the Ameri can seaboard to destination except in cities where water competition is the controlling- influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of com mon carriers; no common 'carrier en gaged in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the in spection of the Government. Only in this way can violations- or evasions of the law be. surely detected. A sys tem of examination of . railroad ac counts should be provided , similar to that now conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners; a few flrstclass railroad utmuntanr', !f they had prater HrtV4 d projwr aKr-ily T'A cil books and papers edtdd mpUh much in preventing wtfitui Violations of the law. I urge upon the Const- lV eTd of providing for . rr!aious action by the In ttle I'ommerce Commis si Hi all these matters, whether in regulating ratts for transportation or tor florin: handling property or CoITJiion!iies in transit. Thn. Wrlorv of the eae lit'srate.d "Jtrlder the pres ent )tfiffierfe act phows that its efh ca'cay has been to a great degree des troyed by the weapon of delay, al most the most formidable wearon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law afet'y Appliances. In my annual Message to the Fifty eighth Congress, at its third session I called attention to the necessity for legislation. requiring the use of blork signals upon railroad engaged in interntate ctuntnete. The nuhaber bf ptnlou collisions Upon unblocked road1? that have occurred within the past year adds force t the recom mendation 'then made. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legis lation, for the introduction of. block signals upon all railroads engaged in interstate commerce nt the earliest practicable date, as a measure of in creased safety to the traveling public-. . , Hours of Labor of Railroad Em ployees. The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employees in train ser vice are in . many cases subjected is also a matter which may well engage the serious attention of the Con gress. . The strain, both mental and physical, Upon those who dre engaged in the movement and operation of railroad trains under modern condi tions is perhaps greater than that which exists in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for limit ing by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainly apply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose vigilance and alert ness in the performance of their du ties the safety of all who travel by rail depends. Labor. The National Government has as a rule but little occasion io deal with the formidable group, of problems connected more or less directly with what is known as the labor question, for in the great majority of cases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipal authorities arid not by the National Government. The National Government has con trol of the District of Columbia, how ever, and it should see to it that the City of Washington is made a model city in all respects, both as regards parks, public grounds, proper regula tion of the system of housing so as to do away with the evils of alley tenements, a proper system of educa tion, a proper S3stem of dealing with truancy and juvenile offenders, a pro per handling of the charitable work of the District. Moreover, there should be proper factory laws to pre vent all abuses in the employment of women and children in the District. These will be useful' chiefly as ob ject lessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real national value. There has been demand for depriv ing courts of the power to issue in junctions, in .labor disputes. Such special Iuuitation of' the equity "pow ers of our courts would be most Un wise. It is true that some nudges have misused ' tins power; but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an improper exercise of the power to call, a strike by a labor leader would justify the -dental o the right to strike. Tha Denavtmeni of Commerce and Labor should also raakq a thorough in vestigation of the condition of women in industry. Over five million American women are now engaged in gainful occupations; vet there is an almost complete dearth' of data upon which to base any trust worthy conclusions as regards a sub ject as important as it is vast and complicated. Thore is need of full knowledge on which to base action looking toward ' State aud municipal legislation for the protection or work ing women. The introduction of wo men into industry is working change and . disturbs nee in the domestic and social life of-the Nation. v ' Instirancs. ' . The greatinsurance companies af ford striking: examples' 4 of " . corpora tions whose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the State which created them as to pre clude strict enforcement of supervi sion and regulation, by the parent States. In my last annual Message; I recommended . t ' that tb e Congress carefully consider whether 'the pow er of the Bureau of ; Corporations can not 'constitutionally ,hg extended' to cover interstate' transactions 4 in in surance." Recent s events have em phasized the importance of 'an early and -exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether it is not pos sible to furnish better safeguards than ttie several Mates have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind whieh has been exposed. It has been only too elearlv shown that certain of the men at the head of these large corporations: take but small .note -of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty; they draw the line only, this side of' what may be, called, lawThonqsty, the kind .of nonesty necessary in order to avoid falling into the olutchea of the law i aupme remedy for hl condition mxiki Le fonnd in an around public cansKrienee'. a higher sens? of .ethical roeduct in, jth -immunity at larpe", and ihjUHv nmodg bu ) tpen itUl in me great pro fession of the law, and in the growth of a spirit which eomlemus all. dis honesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the ibape of bribery or of blackmail But much eat? be done bv eUla'ioii whiHi U net i?n!V Ulasiie but UaJUcai. The Bevenues. There is . more need of stability than of the atempt to attain an ideal perfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the boek nd "train to th5 bli'liiCs world" certain io alitiiti any serious change in these methods render such ehange inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by whieh to determine the moment when the ren.-on for will outweigh thoe against such a c'tiailgP. Muflt hiu?t depehit; riot merely bit ihe rlee'di; btit on the desires, of the eople as. a whole; for needs and ci.es ires are not necessarily identical. Of course no change can be made on lines benefi cial to, or desired by, one section or one State only. There must be something like a general agreement among the citizen of the several States us represented . ill the Con gress, that the change is needed iiiid desired in the interest of the people as a whole: and there should then be a 'sincere, intelligent, and disinter ested effort to make it in such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the people at large with the minimum of nece sarv di regard for the special interests pf localities" or classes But in time of peace the revenue must oil the av erage, taking a series of years to gether, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be increased. Last year there Avas a deficit. I niess our expenditures1 can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. Economy in Exepnditures. I earnestly recommend to the Con gress the need of economy and to this end of a rigid scrutiny of appro priations. As examples merely, 1 call your attention to one of two specific matters. All unnecessary oil ices should be abolished. The Commis sioner of the General Land Office recommends fhe abolishment of the of fice of receiver of public moneys for United States land ofiices. Yet, in speaking of ecenomy, I must -i i -i in no wise De understood as advo cating the false economy which is in the end the worst "extravagance. To cut down on the Navy, for instance, would be a crime against the Nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama Canal would be as great a follv. At various times I have instituted investigations into the organization and. conduct of the business of the Executive Departments, While none of these inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant iinal conclu sions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the general imres sion that the organization of the De partments is often faulty in princi ple' and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are artiquidated and inefficient. There is every reason why our executive governmental machinery should be at least as well planned, economical, and efficient as the best macilinery of the great business organizations, which at present is not the ease. Monroe Doctrine. One of the most effective r.itrur ments for peace is the Monroe Dpp. trine as ip has been pr4 i fyeing grad? uaJJy developed, by tjds Nation antj ui'uepiuo, dv Qtner nations, otnor policy could havo -been w fflclent pruwutg ppai'P in me esieru Hemisphere and in giving to each na tion thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. If we had refused to apply the Doctrine to changing conditions it would now be complete ly outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day, aud" indeed would probably by this time have sunk into complete oblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad because we have adapted our application of it to meet the growing aud changing needa of our Hemisphere. When we announce a policy, such as the Monroe Doc trine, we thereby commit ourselves to the consequences of the policy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of the question to claim a right and yet shirk the re sponsibility for its exercise. Not on ly we, but all American Republics who are benefitted by the existence of the Doctrine, must recognize the obligations each nation is under as regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to' insist upon its own rights. That our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance of the Doctrine is as clear as hardly to need argument. This is especially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a mere mater of self-defense .we must exercise a close watch .'over the approaches to this canal ; and this means that we must be thoroughly alive to our inter ests in the Caribbean Sea.

The President touches uiwm ti ie question of Federal elections, fjuot ing the well known constitutional provision that Congress shall be the final judge of the qualification of its own members, lie also - declares strongly against all forms of corrup tion and expresses regret at the grow ing tendency to increase expenses in connection with the conduct of po litical campaigns. Briefly, he ad vocates the greatest possible purity of the ballot and the fuleet free dom of the exercise of the elective franchise consistent with good gov ernment. ' Immigration. Thes ubject of immigration is treat ed by Mr. Roosevelt in a particular ly able and thoughtful manner. The tendency of foreigners to congregate in sections of the country already congested with people is deplored. High-class foreigners are desirable and are welcomed, but only those with tendencies towards good citizen ship, and of industrious and law-ab iding habits will add to the general welfare of the nation. It is pointed out that our farming sections need labor, and that all who come with a will to work will find a ready welcome. Criminal Laws. In my last Message 1 asked the attention of the Congress to the ur gent need of action to mak our original law nor effective and 1 mot earnestly iequ6t that vqu py hetd, tP the reporp' of the Aajtorneyr Genergi on this subject, Centuries ago it was pspeeially needful to thrtw evry safeguard round the &e fMeat Buch danger thea wM lt he tchu'uld bo wronged by the stat, The danger know exactly the revcrw, Breaches of fruit in Public Service. There aeems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a tnited States attorney or other officer of the Government who eorruptly ugrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully re frain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agree ment is other than one posesiing money value. Thw ought to be reme died by appropriate legislation. Fnblic Land Laws. Once again I call your.attention to the condition of the public-land laws. Recent developments have given new urgency to the need for sueh changes as will fit these laws to actual pres ent conditions. The honest disposal and right use of the remaining pub lic lands is of fundamental import ance. The iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of the public bnds is being brought abodt under the present laws are becoming more generally known, but the existing laws do uot furnish effective remedies. Ihe recommendations of the Publie Laud? Commission upon this subject are wise and should be given effect. The Jamestown Tercentennial.

I rtfeomuiend more adequate pro vision than he been made hereto fore for the work of the Depart ment of State. Within a few years there has been a very great increase in the amount and importauce of the work to be done by that Department-, both in Washington and abroad. This has been ' caused by the great in crease of our foreign trade, the in crease of wealth among our people, which enables them to travel more generally than heretofore, the in crease cf American capital whieh is seeking investment in foreign coun tries, and the growth of our power and weight in the councils of the civilized world. Conclusion. Suitable provision should be made for the expense of keeping our dip lomatic ofbcers more fully informed of what is being done from day to day in progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries. The lack of soch information, caused by insufficient appropriations available for cable tolls and for clerical ancl mesenger service, frequently puts our officers at a great disadvantage and detracts from their usefulness. The salary list should be readjusted. It doc not "now correspond either to the importance of the service to be rendered and the degrees of ability and experience required in the dif ferent positions, or to the differences in the cost of Irving. In many cases the salaries are quite inadequate. THEODORE ROOSEVELT. The White House, . , December 5, 1905.
