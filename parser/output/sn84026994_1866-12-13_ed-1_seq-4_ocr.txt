JOHN MITCHEL ia ono of tho editors of tho Rich? mond Dispatch. Tiic bushwhackers about Lexington, Mo., are .leaving that portion of tho country under tho pressure of Gov. FLETCZIEB'S operations against them. Tho Basso-American Tekigraph expedition were vinterihg in Siberia when last beard from. Tho Russians received them Mildly, and the Esquimaux and other tribes were disposed to bo friendly. Advices from Utah stato that EEIGHAM YOUNG has lately married his forty-fifth wife. Is thoro any oilier civilized country in the world which per? mits -such a neut of abominations as Mormondom to flourish within its limits ? Tho United Biat03 Consul at La Rochelle re? ports that the vintage this year ia of-an inferior quality. Thc absenco of sunshine at harvest time, and prevalence of rain, produced thc disastrous results. The Machias, Me., Union says the production of lumber this year on the-Machias and ^3ast Ma? chias waters will reach nearly fifty million feet. This is nearly ten minions higher than estimated in calculations based upon previous reports. Tho Herald's news from the seat of war in Para? guay-is dated Rio Janeiro, November 9, and comes hy way of Lisbon. A.Bolivian army had been con? centrated on the borders of the Argentine Re? public, and threatened to invade that State. On the 18th of October the Paraguayans bombarded the entrenched camp of the Allies. " At the dedication of the German Catholic Church in Buffalo, on Friday, soon after the commence? ment of the services, tho section of the floor in front of the altar gave way and precipitated fifty or sixty people, mostly ohildren, into the cellar. Fortunately only four or five persons were severe? ly injured-none fatally. Many received -slight harts and scratches. A cane, made of wood from the steamer Merri? mac, ia tobe raffled for at a fair given hythe ladies of ?ho Catholic Church in Norfolk, Va. It is to be presented to JEFF. DAVIS by the winner, and the first name on the hst pf subscribers is Mrs. General MAHONE, followed by every member of her family. The cane is to be beautifully and tastefully mounted with gold, and appropriately inscribed. A pmer pantile circular from : Chicago - announces the receipt of the first consignment, of .wheat! frojn Omah^, on tho Missouri River (the initial poixit-of the great Union "Pacific Railway)", 489 mills westoi Chicago. The wheat was wagoned thirty-nine miles, from Omaha to Woodbine, in Iowa, to which place the Chicago and Northwest Road, Iowa ex? tension, is now running, and thence hy the North? west Road into Chicago. The desire.for the repealof the-13th section of the Amnesty Act seems to be abating, in view of the fact that nineteen-twentieths of the property af? fected by it has already been restored to Southern owners, Which restoration cannot now-be disturb? ed. The repeal would affect only a few promineni Southerners now absent from ;the country, and who own hut little to be confiscated. It will be .contended, we learn, by several Senators, that the tendency will be to disturb the confidence, embar? rass the industry, and hazard loss .to Northerr creditors of Southern merchants. Tlie New York Herald's Washington .correspond . ent, in .referring to the action of the Radicals re? garding-the President's appointing .powers, says : "It has heoomo a i interesting question here whether.it will not check, If net entirely stopi thc machinery of government, if Congress persists ir its proposed.nieasures abridging .the powers of thc Executive. For instance, if Congress persists thal appointments shall be made by tho President in a certain m??ner, and the President does not choose to appoint afc all, there is no constitutional an thority.to compel him to. Hence in case of vacan? cies in important office's the damage to the inter? ests of the conntry is obvious." It is believed in-;Washington that after thc : adoption hy Congress of the Suffrage Bill for that District, the city charter will betaken away, and tb.3 city governedby a board of 'four Commission? ers, to be appointed hy tho President. These Commissioners . will absorb the functions of the .?ty governments of Washington and Georgetown. Along bill on?he subject bas been proposed foi presentation to Congress. Most of the large property owners of the city are in favor of the . change, because they believe such a commission ?will have more influence with Congress, and obtain ;larger appropriations for improvements, &c Southern Senators and Representatives now in Washington held a meeting for consultation at Willard's on Sunday evening. Among those pre eenfc were Governor 

STABKJE, of-Mississippi; Gov? ernor PASSONS and Mr. FOSTEB, of Alabama; and .Senators BUBNETT and ROBEBTS, and Representa? tives J&aEBSON* of -Texas. - Considering ,th? few SanJhern wewbejs pr?sentri? Washington, np jde finite course of action was agreed on. Should events require it, a general meeting of .all the Southern Representatives may be oalled early in January. The New York Journal of-Commerce thinks that the impression is gainingground that staple goode have reached about the lowest point, and here and there a hold operator has been induced lo pick nf invoices of desirable goods offered at a .concession, io hold them over for another season. We think ?hat many houses with moderate capital, which have bought for cash or abort time, have been toe liberal in granting credits to their country custo? mers, and finding, themselves disappointed in ma Jsmg collections, will bo pinched in their finance^ feefore the opening of the next season. But a little -pressure of this sort does not imply insolvency. In the Circuit Court afc Alexandria, on .last Fri day, in the case of HOOE VS. TILLSON, in which the plaintiff sued for the recovery cf city property sold -daring the war under a decree of Judge UNDER? WOOD, Judge THOJCVS decided that hy the provision of tho Constitution of the United States, Congress oonld not forfeit more than the life estate of the party charged with the offence stated in the act ol Congress providing for the confiscation of the pro? perty of persons engaged in the rebellion, and that as JD ANIEL F.t HOOE, against whose pjc.pert3r.the proceeding-was inatitufced, had departed ibis life, the plaintirt, his devisee, was entitled to the. re? covary of the property.. An appeal from this deci? sion was taken, and the case will be carried to the .Supyerne Court of the United State?. y.r W A?i communications intended for publication in J i this journal must br addressed to the Editor of the 'DailyNcicc, Np.

Thc view to bc taken of thc present posture of national affairs, and the actings nnd doings o^ the dominant ps vty at Washington, from the stand-point already indicated in our ideas of the situation, cannot but afford something of a grim satisfaction. It is true that the rights of thc States are not more likely to be preserved in? violate now than they were a year ago, but a fairer prospect affords itself that the integrity of thc Constitution will be maintained; that thc Southern States will be admitted to their full share in the Government, and that they will be left to pursue thc prosperity still in store for them, freed from tho embarrassments and diffi? culties incident to the present abnormal state of affairs. Then, bovvovcr, wc reasoned as io thc future from a continually shifting base; then we were continually perplexed by the doubtful is? sues of a conflict between two powerful branches of thc Government; and arguing from thc right of our position, and our confidence in thc ability and desire of the . President to pro? tect that right, we were induced joyfully to ac? cept, as conclusions, what proved as unreal as the promises which supported them. Upou what seemed the clear revelations of one daj the glad assurance was based that our people though disappointed in their exertions for ? separate government, could still proudly clain the title of freemen; while the doubtful inter pretations of the next mocked their hopes, ant seemed to present nearer still the bitter chnlic of subjugation. Now the issue of the struggl seems no longer dubious, and, however gloom; may be the thought that our expectations have nc been realized, still there is, as we have said a satisfaction in finding something certai in our situation from which we may argue ast our future prospects. It is argued by some that the power of the Presi dent, constitutionally exercised, may still prov an effectual barrier against the further raging of the Radicals; that, as the executive, he hs the right to judge himself of the constitutional ty of laws, and to refuse to allow those to ope rate which, in his opinion, violate the provL ions of the Constitution. We are disposed freely to accord this pow? to the President, but we con feel no assurant that it will ever be exerted. On the contrar; he has exhibited a disposition to interfere wil Congress no further than in the way of gra1 } protests in messages, and the use of the ve power. Laws have been passed over his ve for constitutional reasons, and however the J diciary have asserted their high prerogative dealing with them, yet the President himsi . has offered no bar to their execution. Beside : if he should venture on such a course, the o . stacie he presented might be removed by 1 1 impeachment, or he might be forced from 1 1 constitutional basis to a physical issue wi Congress., To us it seems certain.vthat the President c . never carry the principles of his policy to th [ logical conclusion in any manner, without i some point asserting an authority not deducil 1 from the Constitution, and it appears very cit ' that he has no idea of doing anything of 1 1 kind. Armed, then, only with the thunderbolts . have already referred to, the President can : Congress but little harm, and he seems to hi ? virtually retired from the contest. In his messs 1 he says : "The Executive Department found t 1 it had accomplished nearly all that was wit! \ the scope of its constitutional authority." ' goes on to say that one thing remained to j done, that is, the admission to Congress . members from the States which seceded, ' ? expressly recognizes the power of Congres! . fit that keystone in its proper place. 5 Executive bas done all that it can do or is go 1 to do, and it is well, therefore, that the Sot ' ern people contemplate, with whatever ct placency they may, their situation and pi i pects under the sway of the Republican pai i As one consequence of this situation, let recover from the delusion that we have i active part to play in the drama of natic ' affairs. Our people have been laboring un ' this idea-as they generously responded to call of the President and yielded, as far as logic of events required and their honor wc . permit, to his exactions ; but, now that ? arms have fallen powerless, let them .qui . contemplate the spectacle as those who i suffer but cannot resist ; not, without " ntei \ for that would be unnatural-but an inte . made subservient to tho calls of duty in . ways of usefulness and the paths of prospe i now Opening before them. Tnr enterprises 1 local objects, projects for developing the . sources of th? State at large, for benefit ourselves, our neighbors.and a whole com J nity, the citizen may find scope* for his ?bi [ his talent, and his virtue, and we can now i no ground for apprehension that .such exert i will be without their legitimate fruits. ~ ' ' 1 

CULTIVATION OF . WOOL IN THE BO I i . .. .. . ... _ ... . ' ? . The Baltimore Transcript, in referring t< , above subject, says the following, whicl , commend to our readers : " The increase ii wool of the United States from 1860 to 1 . was 8,064,885 pounds ; increase Southern S 1 815,164. The Southern States are better a? ed to sheep husbandry than any portion o: world, and we would specially commend branch of enterprise to the attention of people. The idea entertained by some St ' ernerB that the South is. too warm for she? flourish, is entirely .without foundation. & have been bred on the eastern, continent the Equator to the 65th degree north lati J"h? Merino has boen bred in Europe a south as between thc 86th and 88th parall latitude, and as far north as Sweden. ~ li , have flourished among the rico swamps of da and South Carolina, and are just as healthy I is in tue mountainous regions. Any part ofi Maryland or Virginia is admirably adapted [br sheep raising.. The -whole South has a most decided advantage over other parts of the United States for the production of wool, in Boil, climate, and abundance and variety of grasses. The winter feeding of thc most favor? ed parts of the North averages 150 days, and costs, under the most favorable circumstances, 27? cents per pound, whilst in the Southern States it is not necessary to feed in winter, ex? cept in the most extraordinary circumstances. The Southern States, including those west of the Mississippi river, embrace an area of four hundred and fifty thousand square miles, or two hundred and eighty-eight million square acres. The attention to sheep husbandry need not impair the cultivation of the great Southern staples. The United States, before' thc late war, produced 578/ J,478 pounds of cotton more than half the /op of the whole world. Thc cotton crop of . the world amounted to 1,000,000,000 pounds, which would require 4,000,000 acres. The four States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, contain 130,- ; 000,000 acres, and could alone supply the de? mand of all thc markets in the world. After deducting ail the land in thc Southern States devoted to cotton, rice, wheat, oats, rye, tobac? co, &c, a balance is bpft of fourteen millions of acres which might bo employed, in sheep hus? bandry. The time has come when tho South should make available every species of enter? prise, and there is none more eligible, under present circumstances, than sheep husbandry." 

BEFORM I2f ENQLANB. The great reform aernonstration in London, on the 3d instant, is said to have been the most important affair of the kind ever seen in that city. There were forty-seven tra<*e societies in line, and fully fifty thousand persona, which, in a population of over 'hree millions, is not much to boast of. But the magnitude of ?he English reform movement is unquestionable, and the fast anchored isle may ere long slip from its moorings, and be tossed like a cork boat on the waves of revolution. We, do not anticipate any permanent enlargement of civil i liberty from the success of the English Radi? cals. JOHN BBIGHT and the other leaders are ambitious men, looking, like all demagogues, to their own advancement, and using .popular professions simply as means to that end. The experience of mankind is, that successful dema? gogues are in general greater tyrants than those whom they supplant. There are abuses, no doubt, in the English Government as well as in all other governments, but whether they are greater than those which will follow a change, remains to be seen. On the whole, there is no Government in which there is so much of liberty regulated by law, and it will be a bad day for Old England when JOHN BRIGHT succeeds, in . substituting his theories and abstractions for' the British Constitution, which is simply the experience and common sense of the English people. ABVICE TO THE SOUTH. The New York Times has been one of our j most persistent advisers of late. The last num- 1 ber of that consistcnt(?) sheet (edited by HEX- | RY J. BRAYMONT*-the fellow who wrote the "stunning" Philadelphia Convention address, and who was lately begging to be let into the Radical caucus at Washington), tells us most sweetly as follows : We can tell the South something more. Unless the pending Amendment be accepted by the South? ern Legislatures, the fate of existing governmental organizations at the South may be considered fixed. We indulge in no menace. We affect no prophetic vision. We essay no abstract argument, and lay claim to no exclusive information. But there is a fact which the South cannot too quickly comprehend, and that is, that in the absence of a settlement based upon the proposed Amendment, Congress will affirm"the territorial existence of the Soutu, legislate out of official being its present functionaries and machinery of government, and provide for the - organization of Territories on a plan suited to tho emergency.. Are the Southern people prepared for this alternative ? M?st of our readers would answer Mr. R.,~ we have no doubts as a prominent character in a very old play once did. when offered advice : "D-your sentiments and advice." 

PUNISHMENT FOB. MISBEHAVIOB IN CHDECH.-A Dublin letter, of November 13, says: Peter Donnel? ly was brought before Mr. McDermott, at tho Head Police Court to-day. charged with "having con? ducted himself in a disorder!;' manner, calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, by having hissed his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, with intent to insult him, when leaving St. Mark's Church, after Divine service on the 12th instant" The prisoner was among a number of young men who waited in the churchyard and hissed the Archbishop when ho came out of Church with his daughter, and he was arrested by Chief Superintehd?nt Campbell; but it was doubtful whether he had himself actual? ly hissed, and witnesses were produced to prove the negative: He was, therefore, let off on his own recognizances to appear when called on, espe? cially as ne seemed much distressed at the posi? tion in which he-was placed. There was a large number of strangers at the church, as an attempt had been made by posting placards in the pariah' to get up. an organized dis? turbance. AUwent.cn quietly, till the Archbishop read his text. Then two hundred or three hun? dred persons, mostly . young- men, who crowded the'aisles, left the-ehurcbv . There was some noise made' during their departure, and a few persons hissed and coughed, but these attempts were quickly suppressed. During' ' this ' insulting: der monstrataon the rn o st. re ver end preacher stood Ul the pulpit calmly looking, on, its ? pitying his anti tractanan antagonists, and then. proceeded with his sermon for the Society for. the Propagation of the.Gospel without the slightest allusion to the occurrence. The congregation which remained waa large and attentive: . ?no'ofihe. placards con-1 tained a denunciation of ' ritualism from the late church of the Bishop, of Cork. FACTS OF' HISTOKI AND ABT.-Under this head there is a lively anecdotal article in a late'number of the Edinburgh'Review,'in which lively articles are rather few and far between. The following are short random extracts : Dr. Morrison breathed his last, grasping a box of. hie own pills, and call? ing for morel The Curieux relates a trait of en? thusiasm ott the part of a milord, which, we sus? pect; will prove new to nis- countrymen. A Scotch Earl, Lord Fife, gave Madame Vestris a thousand, guineas to allow a cast to be taken of her leg; the Earl died, and this cherished log1 was sold for half a cr?wn. Frederick !the. Great's collection Of snuff? boxes amounted to. more than one thousand five hundred. Talleyrand had a . peculiar. snuiT-box; it was double, two . snuff-boxes joined together by a common bottom!.- . The-one was politely offered to his acquaintances;- the other, never to be profaned by the finger" and thumb of a third person, was reserved for himself. Here we recognize the cbplo matist, so eternally on his guard,' that when a lady requested his .autograph, Too wrote his name on the very top of the sheet of paper handed to him . The fashion of powdering the hair with gold dust, which has recently found votaries at London and Paris, was commenced by Hoppaea, the wife of Netti,- and copied .by Lucine Vorus. tho adopted son of Aurelius.

CINE AND SURGERY. Organized, 1848-Chartered by the Legislature, Feb. 26, 1853-Amendments to Charter, Feb. 15,1860, and March 15, 1865. TWO FULL SESSIONS OF LECTURES EAL H YEAR, commencing the first of October, and continuing until April. The Dissecting Rooms are open, and pri? vate lectures and quizzes continued during thc entire year. The first session continues until Christmas, or for three months, and the second until the first of April, or three mouths ; the two constituting one full course of lec? tures. Examination or candidates for graduation wQI occur at the end of each session. Exquisites for Graduation-The requisites for gradua? tion are three sessions of lectures, and three years study ; or four sessions, including two years spent at the Uni? versity. The System of Medicine Taught-The University is a liberal medical school, in which all branches of medi?me and surgery are taught including the preparatory studies, without regard to any sectarian views. Hence, white they deprecate the exclusiveness of Allopathy, Homoeo? pathy, Eclecticism, Hydropathy, etc., they believe that all principles of cure and therapeutical agents should be ' taught in all well-regulated medical schools, and that every intelligent honest, and thorough practitioner is entitled to all the courtesies and privileges of the I profession, without regard to his peculiar notions ia therapeutics. Fees.-The fees for all branches, including all the tickets, matriculation, and dissection, are $60 a session, or $120 per year. Those who purchase tickets only have to matriculate once, which makes the second session $56r including demonstrator's fees, or $115 for a fall course. To aid young men of moderate means, thc University j has issued five hundred scholarships, which are sold to first-course students, for S75, and to second-course stu? dents and clergymen for ?50, each constituting the holder a life member, with the perpetual privileges of the lee , tures, and all the teachings of the school. Tho only ad? ditional fees are a yearly dissecting and matriculating ticket each of which is SS. T?ie Advantages of Scliolarships.-The student holding a scholarship can enter thc College at any time during the year, attend as long as he chooses, and re-enter tb? Institution as frequently as desired. It requires no previous reading or study to enter the , University on scholarships, hence all private tuition fees i are saved. ? Students, by holding scholarships, can prosecute other business a part pf the time. The candidate for graduation con present himself at any time, and receive his degree as soon aa qualified. In case a student should hold a scholarship and not be able to attend lectures, it can be transferred to another, thus preventing any loss. Parents, guardians or friends of students wishing te purchase scholarships for them a year or more before their attendance at the University, eau secure them by advancing one-half the price and paying the balance when the student enters. Physicians and benevolent men can bestow great benefit upon poor young men by presenting them a scholarship, and thus enabling thens, to obtain an honorable profession. . THE UEO CT. AB
