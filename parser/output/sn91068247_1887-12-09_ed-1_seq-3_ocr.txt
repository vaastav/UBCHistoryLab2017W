in- The Charlotte Democrat. VATfii & STRONG, Editor and Proprietors CHARLOTTE, N. C. Friday, December 9, 1887. A vbky Important Decision. It is pleasant to know that the Supreme Court of the United States has over-ruled the tyrannical action of Judge Bond in Vir- aud discharged the State officers giaia. whom he committed to prison for dis obeying restraining order issued by bim. The Court decides (decidedly) that a State cannot be sued, even when an at tempt is made to dd so through individ uals speakingly. A synopsis of the de cision says: "Although uomiually a suit against in dividuals, it was in reality a suit against the Slate of Virginia, and as such, forbid den by the 11th Amendment to the Fed eral Constitution; that the United States bad therefore no authority to entertain guch suits; that in so doing and issuing a restraining order to prevent the officers of the State from discharging their duties under the laws of the State, Judge Bond was without constitutional warrant, and that the restraining order and all subse quent proceedings under it, including the arrest and imprisonment ot the prisoners, was illegal and without authority. The Court, therefore, directs that the petition ers, Attorney General Ayers and the Commonwealth's Attorneys Scott aud McCabe, be at once discharged. The opinion, which is that of the whole Court, with the exception of Justice Har lan, who dissents, sustains the State ol Vir ginia at all points and virtually declares that a State as a political sovereignty cannot be sued nor coerced in the Federal Courts, either by an action brought again 8 1 them or an aotion brought against her officers in their official capacity. The Court declares that the eleventh amend ment establishes a distinction between contracts made by individuals with each other and contracts made by individuals with the State. The latter class cannot be enforced by the remedies used to en force the former, that is by suits in the United States Court and they therefore are without sanction, except in so far aB such sanction is given to them by the honor aud good faith ol the contracting State. Such State may consent to be sued in its own Courts or in the Federal Courts for breach of contract, but it may at any time withdraw such consent and resume its sovereignty, and it cannot then be judicially coerced at the request of an individual." Justice Harlan, who dissents, was put on the Bench as a representative of the Southern States, but he is a traitor of the worst sort. What we mean is, that when a vacancy occurred during Grant's term, and the South was entitled to the appoint ment, Mr Harlan was appointed because he had once lived in the South. The Lord save us from such friends as Harlan. The decision saves the country from much trouble it acknowledgesthe sove reignty of the States it squelches the VSpecial Tax Bond conspiracy in North Carolina, and rebukes a tyrannical Judge ot the Circuit IT. S. Court The prospect is cheering. Two very sudden deaths occurred iu Fayetteville on Friday night last. creating a profound and solemn sensation iu toe community and in the JN. C. Con ference then in session. At the residence of Mr J. W. Welsh, the Rev. L. S. Burkbead, D. D., was a guest. At supper time the Reverend gen tleman complained of being unwell, went into his room and lay down with his clothing on. Mrs Welsh began preparing a mustard poultice, and Mr Welsh went for Dr. W. C. McDuffie. Mrs Welsh re turned to the room about the time Dr. McDuffie reaobed the house. Both went into the room together and found Dr. Burkhead dead. The news spread and f 1 the house was soon filled with weeping j Methodist preachers. The scene was a oau uue auu long io De remembered. 1 be deceased was a native of Davidson coun ty, about 64 years old, and was held in high esteem by the Methodists and people of the State generally. He had filled all the most important and honorable posi tions in bis church, and was always a leading member and Minister. He was buried at Raleigh last Sunday. The other death was that of Mr Kotrr S. Williams (son of Mr J. D. Williams.) it . . . o- ue went to bed Friday night and died suddenly in bed. lie was about 35 years old, snd had many friends in Fayetteville. - i s J2f The Druggists of Raleigh have mutually agreed to sell nothing on the Sabbath but medicines and put up pre- 9 crpuon8. 2 Wereirret to learn that the health of Hon.

In the name of reason, what would be a just cause of complaint? He not only says this, bat dismisses the whole subjeotof iaternal taxes in a few sentenees. Yet he almost immediately complains of tariff taxes that they oome out of the con sumer in the end. Do not internal taxes come out of the consumer in the end? We do not infer, however, from the Presi dent's language, that he would veto a bill abolishing be tax on tobacco and read justing custom duties. We are only sorry that he should feel so little sympathy with his numerous friends and supporters in Virginia." Notwithstanding Mr Cleveland's posi tion, we hope Congress will make some change in the revenue laws and abolish the tax on fruit brandy at least. There ought to be ' some way to regulate fires in stoves on Railroad trains. The Conductors and train men cannot be good regulators because they go in and out so much that they cannot tell what the heat inside of a coach really is. The heat very often is almost intolerable, and very seldom too low. Bat then there are so many cold-blooded people who travel, it is bard to suit them. Bad oolds to ao- tive men is the result of over-heated rail way coaches, tdlf" The old blind preacher, Rev. Mr Millburu has been elected Chaplain of the House of Representatives. He has two or three times heretofore held that posi tion. td The N. C. Supreme Court got through, this week, with the oases from the 12th District, and next Monday will begin the examination of appeal from this (the 11th) District, as follows : Harry vs. Hambright, from Cleveland.. Gentry vs. Callahan, from Rutherford. Morgan vs. First National Bank of Char lotte, from Ueckleuburg. Carolina Cen tral Railroad vs. Rutherford Railway Construction Company, from Cleveland. Caddell vs. Allen, lrom Union. Smith vs. Fite, from Gaston. Slate vs. Garris, from Mecklenburg. Traders National Bank vs. Woodlawn Manufacturing Company, from Gaston.

The opinion is worth the attention of those in terested in such matters. The Supreme Court of the United States decides that a State has a right to tax out of existence or confiscate a busi ness if it is deemed to be productive of poverty, and that no compensation can be claimed, thus upholding the prohibition laws of Kansas. ff3T It is understood that there are no hopes of the reoovery of that talented gen tleman, Prof. W. G. Simmons, for so many years professor of higher mathe matics at Wake forest College. He is troubled with a brain affection, and your correspondent is told that New York phy sicians pronounce it incurable, lim is sad news. I3f The Morganton Star say: "From the most reliable information that we can gather from the Southern and Western Air Line Railroad authorities, work is to commence at Shelby, between the 15th and 20th of this month December. And when commenced the work is to be push ed forward as rapidly as possible until the road is completed from Shelby to Cranberry." The net gains in the growth ol the Lutheran Church in this country this year are as follows: Ministers, 223 ; congrega tions, 419; members, 56,770. In the State of Pennsylvania alone there are 170,- 000 Lutheran communicants. Mr J. L. Hooks of this county, raised 32 bales cotton on 36 acres of land Will not farming pay when properly at tended to ? Some Prospect for Reform. The following special dispatch to the Wilmington Messenger indicates that there is a prospect for some reform, at least, in the internal revenue law, if it can not be repealed, notwithstanding the President has given internal rereoue re form a cold shoulder: Washington, Deo. 3. The North Car olina defecation waited on Mr Carlisle at ... - TXT . . ? 11 o clock to-day. vvnat iranspireu is known accurately, but not authorized. Mr Carlisle received the gentlemen cordially, and they aDDear satisbed with the result of the conference. They are confident that the internal revenue laws will be ma terially amended in connection with the tariff! While the leaders of the delega tion are retioent. I am prepared to state the following : Mr Carlisle favors a mod ification of laws relating to fines, prosecu tions, breakage of stills and generally the provisions of the bill reported favorably to the last Congress, and known as the Henderson bill. He is willing to have the brandy tax reduced, and a reduction of the tax from ninety to ten cents is looked for with confidence. All this will be secured by amendment. Heretofore the difficulty has been to get the subject before the House. The whole delegation of the State is here. Unless something is done with the mis erable law, North Carolina is lost to the Democrats. Hear that. Let' the Tariff be moderately reduced and there will be enough revenue without the internal taxes. The 50th Congress. A new Congress (the 50th) assembled in Washington on Monday last. At ex actly uoon the gavel of President pro tern. Ingalls fell, and be declared the Filtieth Senate to have entered its session in ac cordance with the constitution. After prayer the clerk read the credentials of new members. When the credentials had all been read as well as approved, the Chair announced that duly checked Sena tors would be sworn and the clerk began to call the names iu fours. Mr Riddleber ger was the only one who failed to escort his colleague to the desk. Mr Vance per formed that service for Mr Daniels. No objection was made to Mr Turpie's admission, but after he bad qualified, Mr Hoar penciled a memorandum of protest and it was referred. Mr Faulkner was given the privilege of the floor. Messrs Hoar and Morgan were appointed a com mittee to notify the President that the Senate was ready to receive his message, and at one p. m., the Senate adjourned. In the House after roll call, io whioh 313 members answered to their names, the House proceeded to elect a speaker. Hon. J. G. Carlisle was nominated by Mr Cox of New York, and Mr Cannon. of Illinois, nominated Mr Theodore Reed of Maine. MessrB Randall, Miles, Long and McKing ly were selected as tally keepers by the clerk, and the vole resulted : Carlisle 163, Reed 149, Bramm 2. Of the four Inde pendents, Anderson of. Iowa voted for Carlisle, Nichols of North Carolina and Smith of Wisconsin vfor Brumm, while Hopkins of Virginia did not vote. Mr Carlisle was escorted to his seat and re ceived hearty applause. Mr Kelley of Penn., haviug administered the oath, the Speaker brought the House to order with a tap of the gavel and made a brief speech. He thanked the gentlemen for the honor they had conferred upon him and dwelt upon the apprehension he felt in the du ties of the Speaker of the third term. He asked for their consideration and forbear ance in his efforts to do his duty. Con tinuing he said: "There has scarcely ever been a time in oar history when con tinued prosperity of our country depended so largely upon legislation in Congress, as now, for the reason that the dancers which at this time threaten the commer cial and industrial iuterests of the people are the direct result of laws whioh Con gress can modify or repeal. it must be evident to every one who has taken even a partial survey of publio affairs that the time has come when a revision of our rev enue laws and a reduction of taxation are absolutely necessary in order to prevent a arge aud dangerous accumulation of mon ey in tbe .treasury. Messrs Randall and Cannon were ap pointed a committee to wait npon the Presi dent, to announoe the organization of the louse, and its readiness to receive any communication from him. The choice of seats then took place. Prior to the draw ee, Messrs Cox of Mew York, and Kelley of Penn., were accorded the courtesy of choosing tbei- seats. The House then ad- ouned. On Tuesday, the President's Message was read, and both Houses adjourned. A. B. Hurst of Mississippi, was elected Doorkeeper of the House, and Rev. W. H. Millburu (blind man) Chaplain. Dec. 7. -In the Senate, Mr Cullom said that as the introduction of bills prior to the appointment of committees caused unnecessary trouble, he would move that the Senate adjourn. He withdrew the motion at the request ot Mr Plumb, who oflered a resolution, whioh was adopted, inquiring whether any persons employed under an appropriation of Congress lor experiments in the production ol sorghum, have procured patents on their inventions perfected during this week. Mr Farwell asked that he be allowed to introduce a bill to perpetuate the national banking system. Mr Cullom declined, and renew ing his motion, the Senate adjourned until to-morrow. Correspondence of the Cliarlotte Democrat A Traveler's Notes. Jtditors Democrat: 1 have lust re turned from a visit to the county of Lin coin, and a good county it is, and better still are its people, especially the sturdy and progressive farmers that I principally visited. I say progressive because they are moving on in tne rigbt direction. Their wheat fields (not patches) show progress, as soon as you come in sight, looking at this season like meadows in May. Their garners are full of grain of the best quality ; their barns and barn yards full of the best forage, hay, stacks upon stacks of straw, fcc, tons upon tons of the best home-made fertilizers, tat horses, good stock of all kinds, showing the best of care, improved agricultural implements: in fact everything in the on ward line of success, needing only a few more hogs (which is not their fault) and the Farmers' Alliance, which I am happy to say tbey are fast preparing for, to make them a perfect people almost. Their chil dren are plumpy, fine, hearty, handsome, and being well educated ; good school bouses, handsome brick cburcbes going up, and I judge they are a reading people, tor all read the Chaelottk Democrat, and a great many say they are going to read the Progressive Farmer, as they think tbe farmers should organize, as ai other classes of men have combined, and well may other classes obiect to our fall ing into line, as we will be quite a strong combination of back-bone and sinew, never expecting to use it rashly, only wishing to know it was on hand, as we have been told often that we were that part of the shoot. I cannot refrain mentioning tbe kind ness of Capt. I. R. Self. S. D. Burgin, Esq Philio Carpenter. Esa. Luiz. Mai. War lick and son, (the former in his eighty fourth year, vigorous, active, never hav ing used any spirits or tobacco in his life,) Messrs C. and W. Motz, Ben. Sumner, Col.Micbal, Maj. W. A. Graham, Capt. W. A. Paine, and others. I hope some o our Mecklenburg farmers will see some of these farmers ere long, and their beauli ful fields of grain, and learn a lesson That it is best to raise more grain and not all cotton, make more home-fertilizers, stop time prices, take up the mortgages cancel old claims as fast as tbey can come down to the cash system, and once more beoome an independent and bappy people.

The two most impor tant cases that was tried last week before Judge Clark, was that of Albert Allman charged with rape, and Greeu Horton charged with seduction. The first case brought out a most shocking state of af fairs. After the evidence was all in All man was permitted to plead guilty 'to a simple assault, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He could not have been con victed of the charge of rape, but it seemed to the judge and all the counsel on both sides tbat tbe law was not adequate to tbe lull punishment of Allman, but he got all that the Judge could give him. In the latter case Horton was convicted, and notwithstanding the earnest appeal by his attorney for clemency, be was sentenc ed to four years in tbe penitentiary. An appeal was taken. Salisbury Watchman. Sf The newspapers publish a report that Judges Clark and J as. H. Merrimon contemplate tendering their resignation. The Chronicle hopes they will not do this.
