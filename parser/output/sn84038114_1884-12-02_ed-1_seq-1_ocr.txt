President Arthur's fourth and final annual message was delivered to Con gress on Monday. Like the whole course of bis administration, it Is marked by manly good souse. It opens with refer ence to tbe receut election and the loy alty to law of American citizenship eo marked at the close of a heated contest decided by so small a majority of tbe popular vote In the deciding State. He renews the suggestions for a revision of the legislation on the »object as a mat ter of "gravest importance." Every one who understands the perils of tbe existing system will second his sugges tion. Our relations with all foreign S overnments are in a serene condition. ueb of them as afford oocasftons for any remark are disposed of in alpha betical older. With Belgium we have a new con vention, which places the oltlsens of the two countries on a more nearly equal foe"* g with regard to personal and property r>bta ; and there Is also a new trademark treaty. It is Inti mated as to reitK u ( hii.t se coining to this country that an act of Congresaof tbe last scssiou may bean Infringement of the Chinese treaty. The recent pur chase by American citizens of a large fleet of Chinese trading vessels is made tbe occasion for a suggestion that a uni form role for the legistiatlon of such ves els might be adopt d Reference U then made to tbe Congo Conference now sitting at Berlin, and to our Coversinent's The advantage of premises occupied by our legations abroad, Is brought to tbe attention of Cong renn apropos to tbe handsome behavior of Corea, Morocco, Japan, Slam and other countries in offering us lands and hoiiat*. Our intercourse with Egypt has been embarrassed by the failure of Congress to make a certain appropriation, and the restoration of the Consulate General at Cairo Is re commended. When France comes to lie considered theie is a neut little suggestion lor help to the Bartholdi statue }K«lcsta!—that's all of our French rclauoi s Negotia lionaare to be opened with tbe Ger mau Empire for a single extradition treaty to r*place the separate treaties with the several German Slates. Great Britain—everything being in fine cou rt ition—is riisjMiHed of in three lines. The Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty in judgment of the 1'resident should be renewed for seven tears. [To this there is strong objection. J The Hay tien révo lu 'ion is over. Italy and several other foreign Gov ernments are «xercisid about our tariff duties on foreign works of art. Japan gets encouraging words concerning the revision ot treaties desired by that country. The Mexican Commercial Treaty awaits the necessary legislation by our Congress , also the re-survey of tie Mexican boundary. With Nicara gua a liberal and just treaty has l>een concluded, authorizing Deconstruct!* n by the Uuited States of a canal, rail way and telegraph aerr ss the isthmus. Our Intercourse with Bussia is so en tirely satisfactory that a few lines dia S oe.es of the subject, and tbe same with lam. Spain, Cuba and Porto Bioo call for more extended remarks with regard to tbe efforts of our Government to pre vent filibustering from our shores against Cuba ; and in respect of the more carefully prepared Commercial Convention, recently negotiated with Spain, which is soon to be laid before the Senate. The negotiation to this Con vention has postponed tbe considera tion of certaiu claims of American ciU /.»■us which will now be urged. A Com mercial Bee!procity Convention hss been negotiated with San Domingo. Some ugliness on tbe part of Tur key on tariff subjects remain unad justed ; and the V enezuelan claims dispute, it is expected, will soon be settled. Tbe message then refers to the Cen tral and South American Commission, the International Meridan Commission, tbe subjectof International Exhibitions and Commission», and international marine for preventing collisions at sea—with all of wich tbe public are familiar. Tbe matter of Internation al copyright is called to the attention of Congress ; also, the enlargement of the, scope of our neutrality laws ho an to prevent the shipment of explosiven that may bo used for mali cious or bostile purposes ; and likewise the desirability for a revision of our naturalization laws, ho as to Include a central registry bureau for all natu ralization papers issued. A project for the organization of tbo diplomatic and consular service ih rec ..mmenned, and also tor re-castiug of the scheme of extra teritorial jurisdiction in certain foreipn countries. In Treasury matters the message is obliged to repeat some facts already known. The total revenue from ordi nary sources for the year ended June 30, 1884, was $548,510,870 ; the total expenditure for ordinary purposes was $290,016,474. There was a net decrease of expenditure for tbe year of $21,000, 000, while tbe falling off' in the revenue was $54 000,000. For the present year, to 30th qf June next, the estimated reveuue is placed at $230 000.000, and the estimated expenditures at $290,620, 201, leaving an estimated, surplus of $39,060,000. For other statistics rela ting to imports, exports and manufac tures, we refer to tbe d< curoent itself. Tbe President recommends the ira mediate suspension of the coinage of standard silver dollars, referring to the conclusive fact that, of the $185,000,006 of them coined, only $40,000,000, or only 22 per cent, of them, can be kept in circulation ; and also referring to the expressed conviction of the Secretary of the Treasury that, unless tbe coiuago is stopped, silver will become our sole metalic standard. The President further seconds the suggestion that the one and two dollar notes be withdrawn from oirculation, but this, we imagine, will not be so heartily acquiesoed In by tbe public. As to tbe Trade Dollars, it is recommended that they be called in at a slight advance over their bullion value. As one reason for fixing that unfair price on tbe Trade Dollar, the President has been led into the error of stating that they " never had a legal tender quality." The message renews his recommen dation for the altolition of all Internal Bevenue taxes,except those on distilled ipiCiLs ; and tie oalls attention to the MMllMrlo recommendation of the Stcre pmfêt the Treasury, in favor of liberal SpUMDte for mail transportation,as an «■SU tive to the investment of Ameri- ' oapitalin American »tea tust l|m and |T measure* for the revival U our •bunt marine. This p* *an8 giving Great Britian and Frauce: • participation in it. iwnershlp of tbe a I As the three per cent, bonds consti tute the chief basis of our bank circula tion, and only about $200,000,000 of OH ve done. them are left out-standing, how to ayert the eontraof ion of the currency when thej are called in Is a subject of increasing Importance. The bills passed by the Senate at the last session to per mit the Issue of notes to the face value of the bonds Is commended to the favor of the House. The portions of the message ing the War Department relate to tine matters, except those connected with the sea coast and harbor defenses, and the related manufacture of heavy modern cannon. The President renews his recommendation to Congress to authorise the Government to construct its own ordnanoehcre at home, for such armaments as are necessary tor the national safety and honor. Thscondition of ths navy Is reçu- i minted with references to the un ort unate Jeannette and Greely expeditions. In Post-office allairs the F resident recom mends the rrduotion to one cent of the pust single rate •* drop* letters ; that Is. loiters to he delivered In the city or town where tnsilcd ; and aieo that the unit of weight for a letter to go anywhere In the united states shall be a fhll ounce for one rate Instead of half an ounce as at present. It Is also suggested that measures shall be ado|trd wherehy quick er despatch • rbali be secured tor exceptional letters, eo as Î iete with suob private enterprises riet Messenger servfo >. 1 here ere but three other subjects ia the message that are not already rally I efore the Ç ubile, or that are n t of a routine nature. 'best are thcreoominendatton of a pension In recognition of the services of Genera] Grant : that which emphasises the good re sults of the CJlvll Service act ; and that which relates to the extension of our cotnroeree abroad and theeoonomlc policy to he pursu ed at home An the tariff and other kindred questions. It Is not easy to make this last mentioned r«>rtlon or the message elear In a brief summary, and we therefore recommend every one to reed at least that pert of the document The complex problem Involved Is admirably stated. For the enl«rgement of o-r commerce It suggests reciprocal commercial treaties with our sister ü met lean States, to which we should mainly look for commercial extension; the establishment ot our consular system on a salaried footing so as to do away with the burden of fees on reciprocal commerce ; tfe enactment of measures to favor an âmerl -an •team merchant marine ; and the estât* isb inent of a uniform monetary basis for ell Amerloan countries. It seems to the Presl dent that such measures will not only turn to good account the existing protection and free trade conflict, bnt "that the i «venue may be reduced so as to no longer overtax the people ; that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome; th .t •hipping Interests may be judiciously encouraged .the currency fixed on firm basis, and above all such au unity of Interest este bllshed among the States of the American system as will be of great and advantage to us all *' The message closes with the following graceful and grateful passage *• As the fine draws nigh when 1 am to »«tire from the public service, 1 cannot refrain from ex pressing to the members of the National legislature, with whom 1 have heen brought into personal and official Intercourse, my slacere appreciation of their unfailing tesy, and of their hanannlons so-operatbrn with the Executive In so many measures calculated to promote the best interests ot the nation. Aud to my fellow oltizuns generally 1 acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded tne In my administration of tre Executive Department of this Govern ment. Work ob Che Big .Bridge Checked The work on the big B. & P. bridge over the Brandy wine baa been tempora rily checked by the P..W.& B.Railroad Company objecting to any wood work trusses being placed upon their pro perty on (he east side of the Brandy wine. The latter has sixty feet right of way np the Brandywine and the B. & P. bad eiecieti some of their trusses on this property, bat notin such a man ner as to obstruct the passage of trains. Objections, however, being made to this there was nothing left tor the B. & P. Company to do than to tear down tkalpartof the work standing on the property of the P., W. & B. Kail road Company. The trusses were taken down on 8nuday aud the B. & P. Company will be put to the trouble of framing an arch over the other road, which can be done but not without the cousnmption of a little more time and expense. Muddy Water. The water supplied to the inhabitants of this city for the past week has been a compound of mud and tilth, totally un fit for use. No one seems to know what the trouble is. but it is certain that if it is possible to do so something should be doue to porify it before it is pased into the mains to be distributed to families. Such a compound cannot but prove prejudicial to health, and as the water is bad enongh at the best, some action should be taken without delay to make it as pure as possible.

The scenery, which has been painted expressly for this play, is realistic and grand, and the train passing around the horse shoe bend is one of the finest pieces of stage mechanism ever shown in this city. The double character of BtuartForsytbe and «lohn Forsythe, the twin brothers, is well portrayed by Frederick Bock, and the changes lie makes in scene 4, act 1st, and scene 3 in the 5th act, are done so quick and neatly that the audience can scarcely realise that the two characters are personated by the same person. Frauk Davis as PeterLucuia Jolland, and Miss Fanny Davis as Artemesla Clinton Jolland, with tbeir songs and specialties ars excellent, and were loudly applauded, while Mr. Davis' imitation of a stuttering woman in search of a parrot, convulsed the audi ence with laughter, and brought down the Louse. All the other characters were well sustained, and the company is fully ah strong aa the generality visiting this city. The play Itself is filled with thrilling situations, and the plot is well drawn. The drama and the company are worthy of the patronage of the theatre going public,and the house should be crowded at the last performance this evening. White sngar 6c. per pound.

On Thursday evening, Robson and Crane, tbe celebrated and well known comedians, will appear at the Opera House as Buster & Dove, Counsellors at Haw, in Dion Boncicault's great comedy entitled " Forbidden Fruit."
