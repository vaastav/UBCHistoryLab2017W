BBBB the law-maklnfr and war-making author- H ity what It was that ho instructed Mlnlstor B "Willis to do. Tho assumption ot tho BBB ; power to dictate to Hawaii Its destiny, on BBB his Individual responsibility and without BBB consulting Congress, Is complete. "From BBB the facts dovolopod," says this oiccu- B tivo offloer. "it ecemed to m that the only H '1 honorablt course for our Government to pur- B sue was to undo tho wrong that had B been dono by thoso ropresontlng us, and to H restore as far as practlcablo the status ex- BBB lstlngat the tlmeot our forclblo Intorvcn- BBB tlon. With a view to accomplishing this BBB result within the constitutional limits ot BBB executlvo- power, our present Mlnlstor at BBB Honolulu has received appropriate instruo- H tlons to that end." Congress Is not likely to H forget that it was actually in session at H the time when tho President undertook to 

BBBB constitute himself tho Government for tho BB purposo ot undoing a wrong which his In- B dividual Judgment had alone discerned. B Furthermore, Congress will reserve to It- B " tho right to determine whether the H' policy ot infamy, now openly avowed by B' tho Frealdent, has respected" the constltu H' if tlonal limits ot executft power," or has B' boldly overleaped them. B In what ha has to say about the reform ot B. the tariff. Mr. OLKTErjAiro recognizes "tho B ' ejmphatlo verdict ot the people," but he Is Br very careful not to say what that emphatic Bl '-! verdict was. There Is not a word about the B constitutional limitations on the taxing B- power of the Government, as affirmed by BBBt Democratlo platform on which ho BBB-. wu tltotod. Tho generalities and half- BBB: truths and solemn nothings which aro so BB characteristic of his rhetorical style, aro BB employed to hido the naked iniquity ot bis B proposition that tho platform shall be re- H pndiated by tha party, and that the Domoc- V racy shall now engage In the construction B' ot n BTOwedly protective tariff, differing B f trom the MoJCctlet tariff in tho drgreo B of its MoElnleyism, but not in kind.

As to it Corporation Tax, The spirit of communism Is no sooner laid in ono corner of Mr. Wilson's com mittee room Minn It breaks out In another corner. The Democrats with Populist prin ciples havo no soonor loarned from Mr. UouriKE Cock n an that a tax upon tho In comes of Individuals would knock tho Dem ocratic party lu thoso parts Into tho middle ot two weoks aflor noxt, than they aro said to be showing a burning fondness for a tax upon the net earnings of corporations. A corporation, to the lngonuous Populist mind and In tho haranguos ot ranters and soapless sapheads ot many names, Is tho personification and mlxturo of all wicked ness. It Is a ploaslng combination of CALiatTLA and Dam Damoeii. It grinds the poor, defrauds tho publio, robs tho orphan, and cheats tho widow. Its stock holders rldo in coaohes ot solid gold, eat off diamond plato, and dlssolvo pearls In their salad dressing. Tako tho knowledge of tho facts and tho dlspasslonato temper dis played by tho Chlnoso artists, who carica ture tho foreign dovlls, nud you got a faint notion of the montal stato of tho spout era against corporations. What happlnoss to havo theso monsters taxed I Yet wo Invito tho nttontlon of tho Popu list mombors of Mr. Wilson's conimlttco to tho fact that a corporation Is only a con vonlonoy ot business, no moro criminal than a partnership. Vast business Inter ests, many of thorn liullspousablo to tho public, aro carried on In this way; and tho majority of tho stockholders though this is really no business ot Mr. Wilson's com mlttco or ot tho public aro holders ot only small amounts of stock, aro poor men aud womon. Wo mention this bocauso tho In teresting theory that tho rich should bo taxod for tho benefit ot tho poor seems to obtain In Mr. Wilson'b committee. Not monstors, nor millionaires, but plain, ordi nary, struggling folk would most fool a tax on tho not earnings of corporations. Tho first to feel such n tax, howover, would hardly bo tho stockholders. Tho em ployes would feci It first. Tho public would fcol it In higher prices or lower quality of production or service. A railroad corpora tion, for Instance, would put up faros and freights, or reduce expenses by inking off trains nnd dismissing Us men or cutting down their wages. In any case, tho publio would havo to pay tho bill. Tho main reasons against a Fednrnl tax on the net earnings of corporations nro that such a tax would be unconstitutional, that It would bo communlstlcal, aud that it would bo unspeakably silly. Tho New French Ministry. After a prolongod delay, for which Presi dent Cahnot seems to bo held mainly responsible, M. CAHiMlit-Pcrtiint, tho pro siding officer ot the Chamber of Deputies, has consented to form a Cabinet. . His reluctance to undertuko tho task was attestod by rcpeatod refusals, and was Justified bythoblttor experlouco of many leading politicians. Including Oamiietta himself, who by accepting tho post of Pre mlor darkened a fair prospoct ot obtaining tho Presidency ot tho Kepubllo. Tho only Minister who can bo said to havo strength ened his hold upon a large soctlon of tho French pcoplo by his conduct and success lu ofllco wasM. Constanb; and tho recent crisis would have terminated earlier had not M. Cabnot rciusod to permit him to occupy again a Cabinet position. That no Cablnot can long maintain Itself, howover, without the support of the friends ot M. Constats seems recognized by tho Inclusion ot two ot his most stanch adhoronts, M. SrcLLrn aud M. Buhdeau, in the new Ministry. Considered as a whole, tho Cabinet headed by M. CASiMin-PiiniEn 1b rcpreseiitutlvo of tho Opportunist and Modorato opinions which are supposed to hnvo been sanctioned at tho last gonural election. It Is moro representative of tho ostensible- majority of the Chamber than was Its ptodocesdor; for thrco members ot the latter held views irreconcilable with those of their chief, aud consequently M. Duruv hud Intended to dispense with tholr services after obtaining a vote of coulldenco. As it is acknowledged on all hands thattbo progrummo submlttod to tho Chambor by M. Dui'cr would have commaudud u largo majority had It been pressed to a voto, it Is scarcely to bo expected that tho proposals of his suc cessor "111 differ in any essential fea tures. That M. Cahimik-I'eiiii:!! and his colleagues will pursue n rolutlvcly conserv ative uud nntl-.Sodallst policy may bo In ferred from their own political antecedents as woll us from thn composition of tho Chamber. Tho fact that tho now Cabinet Is hailed Ironically by M. Clemknceau as a triumph for the Popo, Indicates a general belief that it will to fur recognize tha friendship evinced by Leo 

XIII. for tho I'ronch republic, as to deservo tho support of tho so-called " rallied" ltopubllcaus. Tho other facts that M. IUvnal is a Jow, and that M. Udbdeau has been denounced by tha anti-Semites as an agent of the Koths citiLPs, may be regurdod ns evldeuce that the Government will havo tho good will of influential financiers. Are wo to conclude that tho protruded crUls has dono 110 harm to thn cause of stable and judicious government? On the contrary. It is to bo feared that the chuotlo condition Into which the Chamber ot Depu ties was thrown at tho outset of itsllrot sessluu, has seriously irupuirod the means of constructing a firm and homogeneous majority. It must ba remembered that the present Chamber contains an exceptionally large number of new men, utmost destitute of political experience. They were elected undor a moro or loss explicit mandate lioin their constituents to conform to the moder ate policy persoultled lu M, Dnptrr. Un doubtedly they would have fulfilled their express or tacit understanding with tho electors had an opportunity been glvon them ot taking part la a vote of confi dence. Ilut before they could commit them selves to a deflnito set of opinions and enroll themselves In an organized, comprehensive party, they wore exposed to tho disinte grating strain of the most protracted crisis which has occurred undor tho Third Repub lic, with the exception ot that which forced President Ghevt to resign. The result has been the formation of groups, not only out-1 I side but Insldo the ranks of the Moderates. The substitution of numorous small groups for two largo opposing parties has hitherto been fatal to tho durability ot Ministries lu France, and the prospect of a better order of things, whloh ecomod to bo opened by tho last election, is now ovorcast. Trying to Hcpross Manifest Destiny. It Is unfortunate for tho Democratic party that tho Domocratlo Kxccutlvo, bcsldos his excursions In soarch of a monarchy In Ha waii, should oppose that expansion ot Amorlcan commmco and of tho Amorlcoh spirit which would follow tho annexation of the Sandwich Islands. It Is unfortunate for tho Domocratlo party that the Domocratlo representatives on tho Comralttoo of Ways end Moans havo framed a tariff bill which, by an odious Bocrlllco of tho agricultural Intorests of all the northorn part of tho United States, proposes 10 lurnisu mo Dominion with such free access to our markots that tho commercial or political union of this country nnd Canada must bo retarded nnd postponed. Mr. Wilson, In his apology for the wonk and fraudulont bill that boars his namo, had much toeay about building up n for eign trado. Plonty of other Domocratlo publio men whoso hands havo been itching to reform tho tariff In tho lost llfteon yearB, havo put this expansion ot our foreign trado as oue of tho gro.it goals of cco nomlo change. Aud now a Domocratlo Prosldont seeks to chock nnd repress tho expansion and prevont tho suptemncy ot Amorlcan interests, commercial, political, and patrlotlo in tho Pacific; and a bill pur porting to bo a Domocratlo tariff bill throws obstacles In tho way ot tho greatest expan sion of American trado nnd ot American ideas that can now bo soborly Imagined, tho union of tho United States and Cannila. Tho Democrutlo party, ns n political en tity, may havo to onduro tho odium of thoso surrenders of American principles aud theso betrayals of its own policies; but tho Dem ocratic party, whntovor may bo tho vngn rlcs of Its temporary leaders, Is truo to Its Ideas, nnd thoso Ideas aro American. Mello nnd Monarchy. Thoro Is something suggestlvo In tho vigor with which Admiral Mello and all his friends deny that ho Is trying to restore thoomplro in Brazil, ltuv lUnnosA. who ought to bo good authority, says that tho lnsurgont causo Is truo to the republic truer to It than Peixoto'b Government is. Mello, who Is even bottor authority, now protests that ho has novor contemplated an act so repugnant as bringing back mon archy to Dtuzil. It is n weak invention of tho onomy, dcclaro tho Insurgents, de signed to Injure them thero and clsewhore. Hardly less significant Is tho persistency with whloh Tresldont Peixoto's supporters renew theso charges. At ono tlmo tho rumor was spread that Prlnco Pieiiiie, old Dom Pedko's grandson, was actually aboard tho Aqutdubnn, so that he might lose no tlmo In being crowned, after Peixoto should bo overthrown. Dlroctly on tho heels of Mello'h Indignant protest at being callod a monarchist. It Is declared that his doparturo from tho harbor ot Itlo Is lth a view to stir up and Increase an ex isting sentiment In favor of the empire. In Dahla nnd Pcrnnmbuco. So, whothor Mello Is or Is not a mon archist, ho and his opponents scorn to ngrco that it would lnjuro his causo to huvo him thought one. In other words, tho pcoplo of Ilrazll, having once got rid of tholr throne, do not propose to havo It brought back. If eo, Ilrazll Is not wholly unhappy, even In tho midst of her misfortunes. She might bo worse off. Sho is not llko poor Hawaii, which, having overthrown monarchy, may now have It set up again by foreign force, supplied from our free republic. Itupld Transit. Elovnted rullroad travel is worse than evor in lti iuconvonlonce, discomfort, nud danger. Tho capacity of tho roads remains unchanged, but tho tralllc continues to lu croaso. That Is, It Increases In thoso hours when thero Is room for incroaso; but In tho hours when tho movement of humanity Is at its maximum tho roads do not admit of auy Increase. On the contrary, there Is a large aud constantly growing overflow to tho surface lines. In tha moan tlmo thn Rapid Transit Com mission has accomplished nothing, and has given conclusive oitdence that It is lucupa blo of affording any relief whntovor. It deals with Impractlcublo schemes; It Is Irrogoluto and vacillating, aud In Its methods thero In neither logio nor consistency. At ono mo ment It declared Its belief that tho elevated structures aro dlstlgiiiiug to tho city anil that thero must bo no addition to them, nud at another It plain wholly now and for midable elevated linos completely gridiron lng tho town fiom ono uud to tho other. It Is In favor of tunnels, of viaduct, und of roads ou lofty stilts, but It entertains no idea or project of practical value. It should bo abolished us soon as possible, Slnco its first sitting tho Coin mission has loft uothlug uudouu to defeat every meri torious scheme for affording relief to tho publio that has been presented. It has con cerned Itself with visionary engineering and with enterprises tliut capital would not touch; and It adheres steadily to that policy to-day. Had the Commission been govorned by common souso, our elevated system would already afford a vastly greator ac commodation to tho publla needs than It does. Tho Commission has preferred to set its face against the elevated system, and to moke, as It were, a personal issue- of tho case. Thero must be an appeal by the people from tho decisions of tho Commission. Were Its deliberations founded lu honesty and In a proper sense of its duty wo should have twice as mauy trains running ou tho Manhattan lines, running at higher aud satisfactory rates of speed, with cars lighted by electricity, and with steam banished from our streets. Thoro is no roasoa whatever why oleetrielty should not bo substituted for 6team on our elevated roads where the disadvantages of the ordi nary trolley system do not exist; and that is the sort ot rapid trunslt which wo are en titled to and must presently have. What woueedls a Commission with brains aud public spirit. It would ba exceedingly bad diplomacy for the Chinese Minister at Washington to at tempt to impede the execution of tha lleeUtra tlon law. for the carrying out of which tha Col lectors of Intornal itevenua have now received instructions from tha Treasury Department Our Chinese residents have less than five months In which to deliver their photographs and seoura their certificates; and the only wise course for them to follow is to obey the lawat once. They were permitted to disre gard it for a year; but they will surely cot into trouble if they fall to ulva heed to It before the Istot May next No people la this country, other than tha Chinese, have ever been al lowed to rofuse obedience to an act ot the American Congress Even If Minister Vino Yu shall succeed In negotiating a new treaty between the Chinese and American Governments with regard to iaimlgratlon, the lleclstratioa law will, mean- while, be enforeed It ha entertains tha opin ion that ha can carry out the purpose aserloed to htm In a Washington letter here printed a few days ago, ha Is mistaken. There Is no war In which tlie amended law for registra tion can hereafter bo evaded. HYaxoYuIs one-half as astate as ha is supposed tofcet It ho Is a better diplomatist than his discredited predecessor. Minister Yin. ha wilt advise his countryman Hiring hare to begin to take out their eertlQeates bsfore the and ot this week ot Deoomber. The Chinese among us have been In tronble, and have given us trouble, for a quarter ot a century. They can get out of trouble, and can eave us from It, Tory easily, at an expense of a dollar each. The people know that tariff reform Is a good thin Vitn O0ntr. They also know that It Is a good thing for a great political party to stand by Its plodgos and to keep Its promises. When a party has parried an election on the square declaration thatproteotlon Is unconstitutional, and that It Is fraud and robbery, that party cannot safoly turn around and mako a protectionist tariff. The poopte aro not fools, and they hate Impos ture and humbug. A great number of pooplo In this rlty be sldos the mombera of the West Presbyterian Church hale been grieved to read ot the afllla tlons sutTorcd by the llev. Dr. .tottx 11. 1'axtoV, whloh ho described In his Interview with a correspondent of Tiik Bun. We must hora that Dr. I'axton will soon regain his usual health and vigor. Titr.

The Domocratlo platform promises a tariff for revenue only, and says protection Is unconstitutional. Why not stick to the truth 1 Mr. Willtam Waldobp Abtob of Now York has evidently won a gonulno American success tn London ns the proprietor and di rector of tho ;H Mall Gaielte. Wo atwnrs re joice to hear of the succens of New Yorkers, rich or poor. In any part of tho world. The paper had grown dull and cranky when Mr. Asiob gavo his mind to It. And RiUKsrr:nR does not any "Imperial CAKAK."but " ImpurlO'll l.Kiin." llihn,ni. That depends on thn editor. Bomo editions have It ono war, and some tho othor. Tho Constitution of tho United States of Ilrazll provides that tho Trosldont shall bo elected by a direct voto of the pooplo. and that the cnndldato who gets a majority ot tho votos cast shall be declared elocted. Ho must be n nattvo Urazlllun: he holds ofllco for four rears: ho Is not eligible for tho succeodlnc term. Trosldcnt Peixoto. who Is a candidate for reelection, says he Is not Ineligible for nn othor terra, as he was elected Ylce-rrosldout, not Prosldont, nnd merely reachod the Presi dency through tho forclblo expulsion ot the previous holder ot thatoQlco. This Is a bad argument It Is an ovaslon ot tho Ineligibility clausoot the Constitution. The object of thut cliu.se was to provent a President from using the Influonaoot Ills office la favor of his re election: and Peixoto has tho opportunity of thus using his Influence tho same as It he had boon olocted President In the first place. Ills pretext Is a poor ono. and should ba so de clared by Congross. The boatman for Presi dent In succession to Marshal Peixoto Is Dr. MKsnoscA. who Is now Jilnlstor of Brazil at Washington, ami who possesses all tho con stitutional Qualifications for tho Presldonoy. Qho statue- of lloscon Conkltno In Madi son tiquaro Park Is not a Croat work ot art It represents a man leas haughty and Imperious thnnwastho deceased benator himself ordi narily. It is of more pleasing ospect than ha was at tlmos. It Is open to criticism in sundry respects and from several points of view: yet in tha whole, it Is crodltable to tho artist It wnsagrent victory for the cause of womin suffrage that was won last month la Colorado. We lonra from the official roturna of the elections there that tho majority la favor of the cause was 0.317. Tho womon ot tha Centennial Etate can hereafter vote In all Stato elections. Nevor before could the woman suf fragists of any part of tho country boast of such a victory. Tho Colorado miners wore dlshoartonedfora while by the repeal ot the Siikiiman' HUter Purchase law: but. all tho samo, they carrlod their hearts to the polls when they votod to cUo tho ballot to women. That was right. Kvery voter should use both his brains and his heart, at also both his eyes. In politics. Colorado Is the second Stato In the Union to grant tho full suffrage to women In btate eluc tlons. It was guaranteed to them In Wyoming four years ago. and there havo bean no com plaints of tho way In which thoy have oxor cNod It Of courio. women cannot vote In either ot theso two titatos In any election held under thn Federal Government, or, for exam ple, tn any election for Longrussmen or for President. The caiibe advances, especially In those broad and breozy btatos o'er which rise the ltujky Jlouutulns. It Is for a patrlotlo purposo that tho American Symphony Orchestra has been or ganlrod. It Is to strive forthe encouragement of native talent ns against tha foreign-born singers and musicians who aro brought to this country. All Its members are said to ba nnthe Ainorlcans. We fnvor the object of this orehi'stra, bo fur as It relates to tho encourage ment of our native imislcul artists, but, at tha same time, wo cannot uphold any attempt to discourage or tn drive away tho eminent for eign artists who are plo-tsed to coma here. In the whole world thern are not 100 many sing ors. roan or women, of the llrst rank, and there are not too many Instrumental musicians ot thut rank. As wo accept, and are glad to got, the books of foreign author, tha pictures ot foreign painters, tha discoveries nf foreign scientists, and tha mechanical devices of for elgn Inventors, so lu like manner are we glad to get musical genius from any country In which It can be found, (loin our operatlo per formances or to our high-class concerts. Certainly we shall give native talent a chanoa. We shall do all In our power to encourage It It must be judged by Its merits. We do not desire to see It boosted to the front It it cannot maintain Itself there, and justify Its claim to stand there, and approve Its ability to meet any foreign rltalrr upon eoual terms. We have now good schools ot music We have a large number ot American singers and musicians. We have some excellent sympho nltta. We have two or three admirable or chestras. Wa have plenty of singing and mu sical societies. Wo can speak well of those People's Concerts and People's Ringing Classes which have been organized by that unquatllng enthusiast, Jlr. Fiunk lUuuosiU. It would ba hard to keep down any great American singer, male or female, operatic or eoncert, or any first-class performer upon any Instrument whatever. Such people do not need to fight long for recognition. They are not easily discouraged. There is an Im partial and intelligent musical community to which they can always appeal in person, with assurance.

It Is Just as much a protective tariff bill as tha existing law Is. We donot refer. In making this statement, to the artlctos that are put upon the ftoo list We refer to the duties that are Imposed upon Imports. Those duties aro all left at a point which makes them protective of American manufactures against foreign Im portations, The duties Imposed by tho Me Klnley bill are undoubtedly towered, and In many Instances uroatly lowored, butMcKln toy's duties wero placed at a figure far above what was necessary to Insure protection. All that the Wilson bill has done Is to top off the unnecessary protection, but It has left alt that Is necessary to secure effectual protection. Our readnia may accept Has a fact that all duties nn forolgn imports tint come Into com petition wttli American manufactures aro left at a protective point This la certainly one of the most astonishing outcomes ot a long nnd blttor contest that tho world wns evor treated to.

What lino that jmrtydone for tho Houth In return? Mmplythls: It has done all thnt lay In Its power to Injure nnd cripple a grent part of.the Houth by tha bill that Its rapresnutatlvcH haa framed. Tho houth wanted free Imports, that alio mlwht buy all hor supplies ns choanly ns posalblo and thnt justice might b dune all nround. To get those frco Imports she was willing to give up tho advantnees tt.nttho principle of rroteo tlon secured to her. Ilut here comes the Domocratlo Committee on Ways nud Means, retaining tho duties on Imports for tha bonont of tho New Knglandcr, but putting coal. Iron oro. and sugar ou tha froo list, to thn Incal culable Injury of Virginia. Wobt Virginia. North Carolina, Alabama, Uoorgla. and Louis iana. Wo should like to know whero the Domocratlo paity of tho country would ba without these Htutos? It owos Its possession of powor to them, nnd this Is a pretty roturn to mako thum for tho gift Wo aro tor free and uurestilctod trnde. Hut as burdens must bo Imposed upon Imports to raise tho revenues that tho Government noods, wo yield to a scheme otilutlas. but wo Insist that those du ties shall bo so distributed thnt all shall boar an equal and ratnblo share. Wo rotuso to sub mit to having thorn so adjusted thnt Now Eng land manufacturers can mako us pay for their goods what they please, while our own prod ucts era forced Into full competition with the products of tho rest of the world. Equality Is equity: but this Is the most uuoqual schomo that can bo do Ised. We urgo tha representatives from all tho fitates wo havo namod to voto against tho Wil son bill In toto. unless coal. Iron ore, nnd su gar aro given tho benefit ot tho samo protec tion which has been given to tho Now England manufacturers. It we aro to have protection as the rule of government lot It bo a protec tion which applies equally to all: but not pro tection for theNowEnglaudor and freo trado for us. Jhm (' XbnrAfari? A vine. TnE Sex h&i corao forward with a substitute for tho Wilson Tariff bill which possessos at leasttho moritof simplicity. Wo glvo tho pro posed bill In full, tttlo and all. It must be confessed that this substitute has soma morlt There is no faorIUsm In It. and no protection. It Is in full uccord with tho Domocratlo platform, which denies that Con cress has tha constitutional right to levy duties for any other purpose than to ralso revenue for the Government economically administered. Under such a tariff law thero could be no dis graceful scramble for special favor, and no log-rolling on tho part of members of Congress. If ft duty of U3 nor cent ad valorom should turn out to ba too high. It would be eusy enough to reduce the ruto to 30. or23. orl'O per cent, just In proportion to tho financial necessities ot tho Oovernmont Wo do not expect to see Congress adopt thla simple plan. Tlie Idea of protection has too firm a lodgment In tho heads ot many Demo crats, and epoclal Interests aro eager to roap the benellts ot a system which bus so long af flicted the country.
