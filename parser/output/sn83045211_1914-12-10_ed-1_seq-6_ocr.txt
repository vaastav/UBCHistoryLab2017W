NEW YOltK, Dec. 10. "Mow have the mighty fallen," wns the manner In which Andrew Carnegie expressed himself to day when asked his opinion on cx-Preal-dent Tatt's Bomervllle speech of last night on the national defenses. Tho great pence advocnto received n reporter lit (its study. "I am greatly disappointed " he said, "at ex-1'reildent Taft's assertion that 'as long as governments ore unjust and tyrannical the possibility of wars nnd revolutions cannot anil ought not to aia appear," The former President's demand for recognition fefr what war has done In the past for the progress of civilization, was sharply challenged by tho steel mag nate, who said: "Tor every ounce of good that war has done In the past It has done a ton of evil. 1 cannot Imagine how tho ex President has rcathed this sad conclu sion." To Professor Taft's next assertion that the "present war demonstrates that treaties may be broken nnd Just rignts violated by nations In tho first rank of civilization," Mr. Carncglo leplled: "Any nation that breaks a treaty has fallen from that high state and proven Itself less than uncivilized. "Mr. Taft contradicts himself nnd an swers his own argument when ho soys: 'The wise optimists should not look for a panacea to abolish war, but for a peace ful means which may be substituted for war' whloh In Itself Is the roat panacea for war he tells us to stop looking for. "Good common sense for tho first time," wns Carnegie's remark regnrdlng tho cx I'resldent's diagnosis ns "mild hjsterla" of the dlseaso from which certain critics of the army nnd navy are suffering." Regarding tho former President's plea for purchase of moro munitions of war and the "taking of reasonable steps for military effectiveness," Cnrneglo Bald: "Our country, with Its hundred millions In population and 23,000,000 available for militia duty. Is practically unassailable. Tho transport of sufficient men to attack and Invade us may bo said to be Im possible. If our country were afraid of such invasion she would bo In the po sition of the man who never walked abroad without a lightning rod don his back because It Is a fact that men havo been hit by lightning. American men are not such cowards ".Mr. Taft Is once more on solid ground when he says we do not need a larger navy than It was the policy of tho sev eral administrations before this one to maintain I had suspected the ex-Prcsl-dent from the tlrst portion of his speech of being one of those who needed a light ning rod, but I am delighted at such words. No nation wishes to Invade us, we Wish to Invade no nation. "Our ex-President's logic glows more sound as he goes along In his nigumcnt. I am sure he concurs with the policy pro claimed b President Wilson In his re markable, wonderful message chocktull of .common sense Of course, the Presi dent opposes that mad inllltnry and naval coterie which wtBhes to become Investi gator of our national defenses. I would bo glad tu recommend Mr, Taft to Pres ident Wilson ns one of thosa to Investi gate our preparedness. If he was going outside to got men.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.-Thc report of Secretary Garrison to the President, mado public today, shows that the head of the War Department is nof altogether in agreement with his chief upon tho sub ject of military unprepiredness. In tho oxccutlvo message President Vin son said "We must depend In every time of national peril In the futuro ns In the past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon n reserve army, but upon a citizenry trained nnd necustomed to arms.

The addition of 25,000 men would bring tho nrrny up to Its full war strength of 120,000 men, 50,000 of whom would bo avail able at home. At present tho mobile strength Is St.OM, which Is soon to bo cut In two by detnehments to service In the Canal Zone, Hawaii nnd tho Philippine Islands.
