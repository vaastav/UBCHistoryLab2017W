W. A. HUNT, KDITOK AND PKOPEIETOH. Oflkiet Mala SUreel, P. Icl Hs- Taursday, Dec. 9, 1386. It is said that Georgians drink twice as much liquor as they did before local option wed into effect- Of course this statement Is entitled to credence because Frank Gordoo tbe son of the governor bath said it. Complete otliicial returns snow tbat toe Republican candidate for congress carried Colorado by 803 plurality. His opponent was long put down in tbe lists iu Democratic papers, of Democratic congressman certain !y elected. The inscription that Count Beust, tbe able Austrian statesman, directed to be placed upon bis tomb was tbe following, which is not only a beautiful sentiment, but handsomely expressed ; "Peace to bis ashes; justice to his memory." If tbe "offensive!; partisan" office holders of tbe present administration should succeed in thrusting Mr. Cleve land on the next Democratic National ticket, a large amount of crow will have to be eaten by the Democratic partisans The movement to abolish spring elec tions has been taken up by the commit tee of one hundred in Cincinnati. A committee of one hundred from each county of the state, should reinforce the Cincinnati committee. The costly, slushy, chilly spring election should go. The secretary of war gels down on bis marrow bones and begs congress to do something for tbe national defense, but the chances are that tbe members will be too busy looking after tbe "offen sive" and inoffensive partisans in their district to pay auy attention to his prayers. Senator Payne whose nomination for Senator from Ohio was brought about, by tbe most corrupt methods ever practiced in tbe Ohio legislature, seems to be solid with the "reform adminis tration. He secured the Toledo inter nal revenue commissionership for his man, after a protracted contest. An interesting iiiustiaiive feature of the Srst instatment of Mr. Washburne's "Reminiscences of tbe Siege of Taris," vbich are to appear in Scribner's Maga zine, will be a fac simile of the written draft of tbe original proclamation, sent to Mr. Washburne.announcing the disas ter of Sedan, and signed by the Council of Ministers. How that lliere is no question that the Republicans have two majority in the legislature of Washington Territory, and would elect two Republican United States Senators if tbe Territory were admitted to tbe Union at the present session of Congress, it is not likely that tlw alleged Democratic scheme by which they were to get control of tbe Senate, will materialize. Indiana Democrats ujauaged to in duce the grand jury of the U. S. court to adjourn without returning any indict ments against the parties who forged and mutilated tbe election returns by which to Democratic county officers were counted in at Indianapolis. Judge Woods, who claims to know of tbe gross frauds and crooked methods in discharg ing the jury, administered a sevare re buke, and ibtitnated that the investiga tion would not be given up. The Dem ocrats of Indiana are following fast iu the footsteps of their Ohio brethren. In his speech at the G. A. R. Camp T ire at loungsiowu 011 me ioiu uu., General Logan said : "I am in favor of pensioning every honorably discharged Union soldier sut fering from wounds received or disease contracted in . the army ; every Union soldier incapacitated from earning his own living since, tti rough no fault of his own, aud every Union soldier who served in the Union army aud earned bis own living. These arc my ptioci pies, and if tbe members of the Grand Army want Union soldiers pensioned they must place men in power who will do it. I am not going to talk poli tics, but I say now that I think a Union soldier is as good as any man to repre sent this government abroad." 

OFFICIAL CROP REPORT Of the Ohio State Board of Agriculture, December 1st. The following estimates are based on reports received by'ibe State Board from its corps of regular township corre spjr.denls, and fairly represents tlv conditiou of crops and stocky Dec. 1st, 1SS6. The comparisons for area are with tbe last crop, comparisons for condition of plant, are witii k full average condi tion: "Wheat Area sown for harvest of '87, 101 per ct " Estimated Lumber uf acres.. 2,741,233 " Condition of plant... !)7 perct Rye Area sown for harvest of 1 887 97 ."

In the grass regions of the State, w here much : the pasture was killed by drouth and the grub worm, and where fall seeding for" timothy failed, wheat has been soa and repealed, thus in creasing the acreage corresponding to the loss in the corn districts, so that, on the whole, the wheat acreaafl for the St:tfi is estimated as very slightly in creased over lust ye.tr. The condition of the wbnat plant is a little below a full average. In some parts it is small and tender, but on the whole, generally healthy and goes into "Winter in good conditiou. Of other crop9 there is nothing eoecial to report, except that given in the Az ures and in rormr reports. The condition of live stock, except, bogs, is generally good. The low aver age condition, (90 p?r cent ,) is due al most wholly to cholera among Imga, the disease prevailing in 23 counties of the State. In some of the more important bog growing districts, the loss is estitna &d as high as 50 percent. Congressâ€”The Message. The 49tu, Congress began its second session on Monday. In both houses mo.st of tbe tiiiiO was consumed by tbe reading of tbe Presidents Message. The doenment is more notable for its length and straddling, than for its strength. Below are extracts from the paper, of special interest to the people of this section : In my last annual message to Con gresa attention was directed to the lact inat the revenue of tbe government exceeded its actual needs, and it was suggested tbat legislative action should be taken to relieve the people from tbe uLnecesary burden of taxation made appaieut. In view uf the pressing im portance ot tbe subject I deem it my duty to again urge its consideration. The income of the government by its increased volume, ana through econo mies in its collection, is now more than ever in excess of public necessities. Tbe application of the surplus to tbe pay inent of such portion of tbe public debt as is now at our option subject to extin guishment, if continued at tbe rate which has latelv prevailed, would retire tbat class of indebtedness in less than one year from this date. Thus a con linuation of our present revenue system would soon result in tbe receipt of an annual income much greater than nec essary to meet government expenses. with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should then be confronted with avast quantity of mon ey, the circulating medium of tbe peo ple, boarded in the treasury, when it should be in their bands, or we should ue drawn into wasteful public extrava gance, with all the corruption national demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not tbe simple existence of this surplus and its threatened attend ant evils which furnish tbe strongest ar gument against our present scale of fed eral taxation. Its worst phase is tbe exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of tbe relations between tbe people and tbeir government, and a dan gerous departure from the rules which limit tbe right of federal taxation. Good government, and especially the govern ment of which every American citizen boasts, has for its object tbe protection of every person witnin its care iu tbe greatest liberty consistent with the good order of society and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earnings with the least possible diminuatton lor public needs. ben more uf the peo ple's substance is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of the govern ment and the expense of its economical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of tbe fundamental principles of a free gov ernment Tbe indirect manner in which these exactions are made has a teudency to conceal their true charac ter and their extent, but we have arrived at a state of superfluous revenue which has aroused the people to a realization f tbe fact that the amount raised pro fessedly for the support of the govern ment is paid by them as absolutely, if ..tided to tbe price of the things which supply their daily wants, a3 if it wa3 paid at tixed periods into the baud of the tax gatuerer. Those who ton for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital, though sometimes vaunting ts importance and clamoring for tbe protection and lavor of the gov- rument, is dull and sluggish, till, touch ed by tbe magical hand of labor, it springs into activity furnishing au occa sion lor teiie rat taxation ana gaming the value which enables it to bear its burden. And . tbe laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring whether, in these circumstances, and considering the trib ute be constantly pays into the public treasury as be supplies bis daily watitf, he receives his fair share of advantages. Ihere is also a suspicion abroad, that the surplus of our revenues indicates abnormal and exceptional business prof its which, under the system which pro duces such surplus, increase without corresponding benefit to people at large and are the vast accumulations of a few among our citizens whose fortunts, riv aling the wealth of the most favored in anti-Democratic nations are not tbe nat ural growth of a steady, plain and in dustrious republic. Our farmers, too, and those engaged directly and indirect ly in supplying the products of agricul ture, see that day by day, and as often us the daily wants of their households recur, they are forced to pay excessive and needless taxation, while their prod ucts struggle in foreign markets with the competition of nations, which, by allowing a freer exchange of productions than we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the Araer lean farmer. As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of our people in American citizenship and in tbe glory of our national achievements and progress, sentiment prevails that the leading strings useful to a nation in its infancy, may well be, to a great ex lent discarded in the present stage of American ingenuity, courage and fear less self-reliance; and. for the privilege of indulging ia this sentiment with true American enthus'asro, our citizens are quite wiping to forego an idle surplus in the public treasury. All the people know the average rate of federal taxa tion upon imports is toJay, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some articles of necessary consumption it is actually more than was imposed by the grievous burden, willingly borne, at a time when the government needed millions to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the Uuion. 1 is 

REVISION OF REVENUE LAWS. It has been tbe policy of tbe govern meet to collect the priucipal part of its revenues by a tax upon imports, and no cbange in this policy is desirable. But the present condition of affairs con straius our people to demand tbat, by a revision of our reveuue laws, the recipts of tbe government thall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical administration, and this demand should be recognized and obeyed by the peo ple's representatives in the legislative branch, of the government. In readjusting tbe burdens of federal taxatiou, a sound public policy requires tnat sucn of our citizens as have built up large and important industries un der present conditions, should not be suddenly, and to their injury, depiived of advantages to which they have adapt ed their business; but if the public good requires it. they should be content with such consideration as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interests, while Hie just demand of the people for relief from needless taxation is honestly answered. A reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be possible without a disastr ous shock to any interest; and a careful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impatience and delayed justice. Due regard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the inter ests of American 1 ibor go far as they are involved, We congratulate oui selve3 tbat tb-re ia among us no labor ing class fixed iu unyielding bounds and doomed under all conditions in tbe inex orable fate of daily toil. We realize in labor a chief factor in the wealth, of tbe Republic, and we treat those who have it iu tneir keeping as citizens entitled to the moiit Careful regjrd and thoughtful attention. Thie regard and attention should be awardad them, not only be cause labor is tbe capital uf our work ing men justlr entitled to its share of govern noeuf favor, but for the further us n and not less important reason that the laboring mau, surrounded by bis family in his bumble home, as a customer, is vi ally interested in all liiat cheapens the cost of living and enables him to onng within his domestic circle addi tional comforts and advantages. This reialiou of the workingman to tbe revenue laws of tbe country and tbe manner in hich it palpably influences the question of wages, should cot be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper maintenance of tbe supply and protection of well-paid labor, and these considerations suggest such au arrangement of government revenues as shall reduce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the compensation of American labor and injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in tbe estimation of our people. But our farmers and agriculturists those whom from tbe soil produce the things consumed by all, are perhaps more 01 rectly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizens, in a just and care ful system of federal taxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this kind of work, num ber nearly one half of our population None labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactmeuts limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of the government enhances, to 1 any great extent, tbe value of tbeir products, and yet for many of tbe necessaries and comforts of life, which the most scru pulous economy enables them to bring into tbeir homes, and for tbeir imple ments of husbandry, they are obliged to pay a priee largely mcreased by an tin natural profit which by the action of tbe government is given to the more favored manufacturer. l recommend tbat, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and unnecessary surplus of national in come annually accumulating, be releastd to the people by an amendment to our revenue laws which shall cheapen tbe price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported mate rial as by American labor may be manu factured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished however. in tbe direction of this much needed reform, unless the subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interest of tbe entire country and with willingness to yield something for the public good. TnE President had his say in a message of 16,269 words. He evidently told ail he knew, and all that several other per sons knew, and didn't know. The President is reported as sick confined to his room from rheumatism affecting his knees especially. His civil service reform doings recently, in dicate tbat be has also rheumatism in tbe bead. The supreme court beard the argu ment in tbe Dow law cases Ust week and now ha3 them under consideration, but we observe that the Democratic or gans are not s" clamorous for a decision as they were a few weeks before the election. Tue supreme court of Massachusetts has decided that a member of a law a"d order league is not competent as a juror in a liquor case, on the grounds that the complaint which the juror was to try was originated by his agent," and that he "could not be indifferent to the result of the prosecution." Ex-Goteknor B. F. Pekry, of South Carolina died on Saturday. His dealb calls to mind his bitter opposition to nullification and his famous declaration when the South Carolina legislature passed the ordinance of secession: ou fellows are all going to the devil, and m going with you. The report that the double barreled Ohio-Kentucky statesmen of the Ohio senate, who journeyed to Chattanooga last winter will not put in an appear ance at Columbus, when tbe legislature meets, is not credited. Tbe verdict in Ohio in Novemher wa9 not sjch would lead them to believe tbat their great-double-baby-act was unanimously approved. The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette a progressive and ably edited newspa per, embodying all the requisites for a hrstclass newspaper. Its weekly edition for a general newspaper for fireside reading, adapted to every condition and class, is not excelled in Ohio. Read their annoal prospectus in this paper. "Doc Wilson says he is the son of tbe Massachusetts millionaire Philip Moeu. Tbe latter denies the charge. ahd his denial is supported by tbe state ment of Wilsons own sister. Its a wise son that knows his own father or anv other son's father from whom he can obtain $300,000 hush money. The article in the January number of Scribner's Magazine, on "Our Defence- ess Coasts, by Captain F V Greeiae, is noticeable as containing the first clear statement of the plans favored by the best engineers for fortifying New York Harbor. W bile there has been a great abundance of destructive critical writ ing on the subject, no definite idea has oelore this been given to the public as to what it has been proposed to substii tute for the existing so-called forti- flicaiions. 

COLERAIN. The chilling winds of winter sat down on us last week, and compelled the folks of the rural isti lets to resume that old trade of manufac turing coal ashes and comparing the weather records of the past and present acknowledg- ng that it was, quite breezy for a starter, and declaring they "never saw the like before Christmas." Those that live the longest will see the most of it, if they are not blind. The apple trade is booming. Most of the crnp in this township was disposed ot uelore the raise. Sir. Ed. Wells, of Bridgeport, gave our firm pleasant visit last Jlonday, and explained to what we did not know about poultry. He is great tancicr of hue chickens, and a vcrv pleasant man. Kev. tlayes, ot .Bridgeport, will preach at armin'lon next cabhath evening. Mr. W. S. Taggart, ot Barton, contemplates hanging business, owing to ill health. He is one of the best business men of this township, and his place would ne hard to nil. ilr.

Miss Ilattic Bailes, of near Kidd, resumed lutvugain at tbe children's home, at Barnes- Wile, last week, after several months' vacation. The bridge boss, at Kidd s station, paid his men off last Weduesday, allowing them $1.25 per day. Tbe men demanded $1. ."(), which war efused, and it created a racket of large dimen- ion. There was no special contract made with he men as to the wages they were to receive.
