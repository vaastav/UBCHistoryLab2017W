A Heep Water Harbor to Ke Located There. Report of the Army Engineers to Congress. The Verdict of the Examining- Board Is Against Santa Monica. House and Senate Proceedings—A Bill Introduced for the Kepeal of the Sugar Bounty—Wash ington Motes. By the Associated Press. Wahuington, Dec. 7. —The report of the board of army engineer officers to make an examination relative to the re spective merits of San Pedro and Santa Monica bays, as a cite for a propoeed deep water harbor on tbe Pacific slope, was today submitted to congress. The board reports that the unanimous opinion is tbat tbe location selected by tbe board of engineers of 1890, at the present anchorage, at the westerly side of San Pedro, under Point Firman, is tbe more eligible location for such a harbor, in depth, width and capacity, to accommodate the largest vessels and the commercial and naval ueceesitieß of the country. Tbe report of the board estimates the cost of the proposed deep water harbor at San Pedro bay at $2,885,324. In considering the relative advantages of the locations suggested, the board says the proposed harbor should not be primarily a port of refuge, but a port of commerce. Tbe object, it cays, is to provide a fine liaibor for foreign trade, which will become of great importance, and the coastiug trade a matter of sec ondary importance. From a national view, the capacity of a harbor for de fense is a matter of tbe highest momea', since an indefensible commercial port ih simply an invitation of attack in time of war. We have now too many such ports, and it ia not desirable to increase the number. Contrasting the harbors of t-'an Pedro nud Sanla Monica, it snya tbe deeo water entrance at Ban Pedro harbor is about one and one-half times as wide as tbe eastern entrance to Santa Monica harbor, BLd has a much better offing. Santa Monica harbor ia free from hidden dancers, but in San Pedro harbor there is a rock covered by 18 feet of watpr. The rock is not in the line of approach of veesele, however, and is not considered a eerious danger, but its removal in re garded aa desirable. Xbeßiiiliijgdistauc'rflfrc;n "i'Sc porta are practically the same. As re epecta the coasting trade, which iB prac tically lumber, Santa Monica enjoys about 25 miles advantage of San Pedro, but this ia thought to be uuimnortant. Should the Nicaragua canal be com pleted, tbe board says, it ia predicted tbat there will be a very great increase in the fruit production "of Southern Cal ifornia, and for prospective traffic San Pedro will have tiie same advantage of lesß sailing distance that Santa Monica has in the lumber trade. No estential difference is seen between tbe two harbors as respects advantages for the arrival and departure of veesels. San Pedro harbor is regatded aa de cidedly the best located as a place of shelter and for the receipt nnd discharge of freight; and also better adapted to tbe construction aud maintenance of a deep water harbor, as well as being more cheaply defensible. 

ARMAMENTS ON THE LAKES. Tbe President Transmit! a Special Mes sage to the Senate. Washington, Dec. 7. —The. president today, in answer to a resolution, trans mitted to the senate the report of the secretary of state on the agreement be tween the United States and Great Britain concerning armaments on the great lakes. The resolution called for an opinion whether the arrangement of 1817 is now held to be in force. The secretary of state says correspondence exchanged in 1804 shows that it is so regatded. It does not appear, he says, that any British or Canadian naval ves sel is now, or has been for many years, stationed on the lakes. The report further Bays, however, tbat it was recently learued by the treasury department" that two vessels recently constructed by the Canadian government at Owen sound, styled reve nue cutters, are in reality capable of adaptation to naval purposes. Addi tional weight is lent to thia suspect case by the precautions taken to guard these vessels from public inspection. In closing, Secretary Foster says it seems most desirable now, in view of the lon/ lapse of time and the vast changes wrought, that the arrangement now grown obioletedo practice and sur viving in letter only, as the declared guarantee of international peace, should be modified to fit the new order of things and with such adaptation to tbe exigencies of the future as prudence may forecast. 

CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS. Bonator Vest Makes an Impassioned Sp. cch • New Rills Introduced, Etc. Washington, Dec. 7.—lv the senate today, after tbe presentation of tbe treasurer's report and the president's message in regard to naval establish ments on the great lakes, Hill intro duced a bill to repeal the act of July, 1890, directing the purchase of silver bullion. Referied to tbe committee on finance. Tbe resolution offered yesterday by Vest, as to alleged partisan action by employes of tbe census bureau, wns re ferred to the committee on contingent expenses. The joint resolution introduced yester day by Vest for tbe appointment of a commission to make an agreement with the Indians in Indian territory for tak ing lauds in severalty and settling the remainder of their lands was taken up, and Vest made an impassirned speech. Ue said tbe four adjacent states were directly and immediately concerned in the existing condition in Indian terri tory. The territory today is a menace to civilization. Crime is rampant and corruption rife. The territory today a depot for crime. Criminals from adjacent states take refuge there and from thence make raids. He instanced the Dalton gang and referred to the fact that come of tbe Dalton brothers were at one time deputy marshals in the ter ritory. Vest asserted that a large num ber of the deputies in tbe territory were tHken from the lawlesaclaeses. No such monstrosity bad ever been known in judicial annals as the system of organ ized plunder practiced in the United States courts there, the whole object of the officials being to obtain fees. The resolution went over without ac tion. The formal announcement of the death of Representative McDonald hav ing been announced, tbe senate ad journed.
