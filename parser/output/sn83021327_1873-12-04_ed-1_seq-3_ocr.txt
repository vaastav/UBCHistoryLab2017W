Ho came and rami around fur some, lime, but did not succeed in getting up a row.

WEDSE-Tiar mr tre-ts were fall of life. Every body seemed anxious about the returns from the differ ent precincts and wanis. Many bitter eiiithets were leTcledat the newspspT In the city for not furnish ing an extra early Wednesday momiug with the full list of returns. This It was Impossible for any of the newspapers to do, until at rather a late hour, cu ac count of the tardiness of many of the pnt-inet and wards tending In thtlr return. Til Democracy of tho Tenth Ward arc not dead, but livelh in all thrlr ancleul glory. They marshaled their hot, went' Into the field to conquer, and they did couqurr. They beat Davis and every other Radi cal candidate, and last night Mr. Emerson, president of the Tenth Ward Democratic Club wa oot with ome of Us frienil nd fired a salute in honor of onr great Democratic victory, flnrnih for the Democracy of the Tenth Ward! La.t night about 1 o'clock, while the wife of Mr. Philip of thi city was standing near the supper table, her dress caught fire from kcroseno lamp and she wa immediately enveloped iu flames. The eric of the family soou brought quite a number of the n ;gh bor to the bouse, where Mrs. Ihilip was found ; . the yard, near the door, still burning, though cnt- .K-d in a buffalo robe, which happenud to lie outbid . and which Mr. Ihillps had been thoughtful t-uough to throw over her. That. with some water hastily brought, put out the fire, and fortunately the lady was but little Injured. Her husbaud was the worst snffercr, his right hand being badly bnnieil in trying to extinguish the fire. It has been proposed to get np a grand jollification in celebration of tho Democratic victory, on Saturday night, the sixth of December. It is most proper, in deed, that some steps be taken to show by our rejoic ing that we fully appreciate the efforts of the people ti free themselves, and to do this let us all turn out on Saturday night In procession, and w ith banners, lan terns, bonfires, the discharge of cannon aud display of fireworks, do the thing handsomely. Travis county has most nobly retrieved herseir in thi stnnrglc and wo think the old men, and the ladies themselves, are ready to do something to get up a grand display. These cel ebrations and demonstrations will bo gotten np at many places In the State, and Austin ought to make as much fuss as any other place. Mr. L. L. Smith, who ha had a good deal of experience In getting up pro cession and showy demonstrations, proposes to take charge of this poet, and do it up w Ith a host of norcl tle. All that is necessary 1 a little money to carry oct Hub plan, and the effort will be made among our citizen to obtain the required funds. Mr. Smith has on his own account sent to Houston for a fine lot of manufactured firework. We hopo our citizen will respond in the effort to get np something very cred itable. Captain Fry'a Last I,elter. On Board the Spanish i Man-of-War La Tornado, r St. Jaqo de Cuba, Not. 0, 1873. ) Dear, Dmt l)ita "When I left you I had no idea that wo should never meet again in this world, hut it seems strange to me that I should to-night, and on Annie's birthday, be calmly seated on a beautiful moonlight night in a most beautiful bay in Cuba, o take my last leave of you, my own dear, sweet wife, and with the thought of your bitter anguish my only regret at leaving. I have been tried to-day, aud tho presi dent of tho court martial asked the favor of embracing mc at parting, and clasped me to his heart. I have shaken hands with' each of my judges and the secretary of the court and interpreter have promised mc, as a special favor to attend my execution, which will, I am told, bo in a very few hours after my sentence is pronounced- I am told my death will be painless; in short, I have had a very cheerful and pleasant chat about my funeral, to which I shall go in a few hours from now. Uow soon I can not yet say. It is curious to sec how I make friends. Poor liambetta pronounced me a gentleman, and ho was tho brightest and bravest creature lever saw. The priest who gave me communion on board this morning put a dublc scapular about my neck, and a medal which ho in tends to wear himself. A young Spanish officer brought mc a bright new silk badge with the Blessed Virgin stamped upon it to wear to my execution for him, and a handsome cross in some fair lady's handi work. These arc to be kept as relics of mc. He embraced mc affectionately in myroon), with tears in his eyes. Dear sweetheart, you will be ablo to bear it for my sake ; for I will be with you if God permits it. Although I know my hours arc short and few, I am not sad. I feel that I shall always lie with you right soon, dear Dita, and you will not bo afraid ofmc. Pray for mo and I will pray with you. There is to be a fearful sacrifice of life from the Virginius, and, as I think, a needless one, as the poor people arc un conscious of crime, and even of their fate up to now. I hope God will forgive if I am to blame for it. If you write to President Grant, he will probably ordcrmy pay, due when I resigned, paid to you after my death. People will be kinder to you now, dear Dita; at least, I hope so. Do not dread death when it comes to you. It will be ns God's nngel of "rest; remember this. I hopo my children will forget their father's harshness, and remember his love and anxiety for them. May they practice regularly their religion, and pray for him always. Tell that the last act of my life will bo a public profession of my faith in Him of whom we need not be ashamed, and it is not honest to withhold that public acknowl edgment from any false modesty or timidity. May God bless and save us all. Sweet, dear, dear, Dita, we will soon meet again. Till then, adieu for the last time. Your devoted husband, JosErn Fry. A Tuck Woman. Tho higher and more perfect the training a woman has received in all womanly essentials, the better wife and mother she is prepared to become. She will not want for suitors, who is worthy of them. Men are not all bunded by glare and glitter, by long ringlets of false hair, by mammoth panniers, artificial insteps, un natural complexions and that long languish of the eyelashes due to detective arts not even when the soft rustle of 6ilk is thrown all oTcrthta, and is softened by draperies of real lace, and embellished with the gleam of costly jewels. Most of them carry, deep in their hearts, a love of home and real woman hood. Now it is tho business of all true women to call out this celing in men; their doing so is necessary for the life of society for the prosperity of the world. "Men arc what women make them," it has been said. "Well before women can call forth any good in men, they muft themselves be good and pure and true to every law of health, mental and physical.

TELEGRAPHIC. Awodated Pre Difixuho. 1 VTaablnrton Cltr. Wasoixgtox, November 20. Mr. John Dclan has resigned the chief clerkship of the Interior Department on account of jer sistcnt ill health. He was capable and po lite, and his retirement under the circum stances causes general sorrow among his associates and those who have had business with the departmett. WasiiIxgtox, November 26. The No-vemlK-r statistical report of the Department of Agriculture, now in press, makes a show ing for the corn product quite as unfavora ble as that which forecasted the short crop of 18C9. The preliminary report of the ag gregate pjantitv in that year indicated a total of &4, 000, 000 bushels bs than the s timatc for the large crop of1870; ami the present returns point to a product of nlxnit 8.1,000,000 bushels less than the estimate of lat year's crop. The estimate of the pres ent crop is 132,000,000 bushels. Only six States show a crop equal to last year, viz: Virginia, Georgia, Florida, West Virginia, Oregon and Rhode Island. The decrease in the principal corn growing sections, in cotnjtarison with the total product of last year is as follows: Kentucky, 4 per cent.; Ohio, 11 percent.; Indiana, 22 per cent.; Illinois, 3'J per cent; Iowa, 28 er cent.; Missouri, 32 per cent. ;. Kansas, 31 percent. The deficiency for New York is 8 percent., and 10 for Pennsylvania. Wafuixgtox, November 28. The negro II. Young, convicted of the murder of Frank llahun, the Virginia drover, in March, was hanged tonlay. Ho made a statement on the scaffold that ho was pre pared to die, and iu response to an inquiry from some ono of the spectators, said that he was not guilty. Washixgtox, November 29. Senator Casserly, of California, has resigned. The negotiations between the United States and Spain with regard to the ques tion growing out of the capture of the Vir ginius were brought to a close to-day, Sec retary Fish and Admiral Palo having agreed on and signed a protocol, which the latter soon after telegraphed to his govern ment. As conflicting statements have ap peared in the newspapers regarding the in telligence received last night, also to-day, it can now bo positively stated that the terms aro substantially as follows : First The immediate delivery to the United States of the ship Virginius, and all the surviving passengers, etc. Second A sa lute to our flag on tho twenty-fifth of De cember next, ualess, in the meantime, Spain shall satisfy the United States that the American flag was improperly borne on that vessel, and further, that she had no right to the American flag or papers. In this event the salute is to be spontaneously withdrawn, and Spain is to formally disclaim any intention of indignity to the flag in the acts committed by Spain against the Virgin ius. Third If it shall thus be shown that the Virginius had no right to carry the American flag and papers, and the United States will institute proceeding against the vessel and the surviving parties who have violated tho laws of the United States ; and Spain guarantees to institute proceedings against those of her authorities who may have violated the law or treaty stipula tions. Fourth The matter of reclama tions for damages is reserved for future consideration. In addition to the above, it can also le stated that within the next two days, Sec retary Fish and the Spanish Minister will determine the port at which the Virginius and the surviving passengers and. crew shall be delivered totheUnitcdStatcs. The words "immediate release," as appli cable to the delivery of the Virginius and the surviving passengers and crew, implies, of course, a reasonable time for its execu tion, as some days must elapse before Havana and Santiago do Cuba can be reached. The agreement is regarded in olli cial quarters as covering all the' points of our original demand, though in a modified form, while it is considered respectful and houorablc to both countries. The fixing of tho twenty-fifth of Decem ber as the time for 6aluting our flag is to allow the necessary opportunity to Spain to show that tho Virginius improperly carried the American flag and American papers. There is a sense of relief in all quarters that the negotiations have thus peaceably ended. Both Secretary Fish and Admiral Palo have for two weeks past been engaged in arriving at the result, for which they re ceive the congratulations of their respective friends. Washington-, November 2!). The report of the Secretary of War exhibits in detail the operations of the various bureaus of tho department for the past fiscal year. A slight increase in the appropriation for the next fiscal year is asked. The oper ations of tho engineer corps of fortifications and harbors arc progressing, but the Secre tary calls the earnest attention of Congress to the necessity of providing an adequate defense of the seaboard in case of a war with foreign powers. The Springfield riflo has lcen adopted as the most effective arm for the uso of the service. Additional ap propriations aro asked for placing the mili tia in good trim and for providing the army with a proper supply of email arms. A site is asked for a powder magazine and for a grand arsenal, and the salo of several of the smaller arsenals is recommended. The effectiveness of the signal bureau is set forth at some length. Washington, November 30. Tho Presi dent's message will make about 12,500 words. Tho organization of the House and the luual formalities will delay it beyond the noon report. There was a Cabinet meetiug at 10 :30 a. m., when tho President read his message. Kusscl Sage succeeds Capt. Bradbury as President of tho Pacific Mail Company. Washington, December 1. The cabinet remained in session till a late hour awaiting communication from Congress. Judge Williams was announced as Chief Justice, and Col6ncl Bristow, of Kentucky, as Attorney General, vice Williams. Butler made several attempts to inaugur ate measures to seat Messrs. Sheldon, Syphcr, and others from Louisiana, but failed to attract Blaine's attention. On tho vote for Speaker Blaino got ono hundred and ninety votes, Wood seventy seven, Cox two, Clymcr one, and A. II. Stephens one. About fifty members from tho South took ante helium oaths, and others took an oath as long as their arm. In drawing for scats an exception was made in favor of Mr. Stephens and Mr. Dawes. Mr. Stephens's seat is directly in front of the Speaker, on the Democratic side of tho isle. Mr. Butler of Massachusetts, offered a resolution to admit to their scats Messrs. Syphcr, Sheldonand Pinchback, of Loui siana. Without action the House at half past four adjourned.

This action postpones the bill in definitely and probably defeats ii.- Beck made a powcrlul speech against the seating of the Louisiana delegates. The rre!4en( 7IrMge. Washington, December 2. President Grant's message opens by a reference to the financial crisis, the Granger's movement, the Virginius matter, which it says is ia course of negotiation and likely tiVlie amia cably and honorably arranged. It refers to the Vienna Exposition, which was creditable to the artisans of tho United States; to the reception of tho Western Embassadors by the Emperor of China, and to the need of further lcgislition to sup press the infamous Coolie trade. It recom mends a commission for the purpose of auditing and dctermlrirg the amount to be paid for losses caused by the Confederate privateers. It refers to tho mixed comnuion for dc tcniEirg chums between Eriash subjects and Anif ricaa citljr-ns, sc:d &iVs for an ap rrcpriatlcn t. ar the a:o"st rf decisions a.rvt the Uruied Stitc. It recensfsdi a creating a f;v:c;j.l court cf three zl -cs to Lrr tzd dctennbe k.v,::-.s cf a'.icss arv.ssi the Uritcd States, ari-ing out of acts committed aguiust their H rn anil property during the instirreeti'iu. It a-k the decision of Congress on the subject of the action f the Ottoman and Egyptian governments relieving foreign Consols of judicial jMiwer. The Pitsident transmits the application of the republic of Santo Domingo, that the United States fhnU exercUe a protectorate over that republic. The message di-cusses at some leng-. a the question of the right of expatriation jar ticularly as to citizens of the United States residing jiermanently abroad with their families, and suggests legislation on the subject. It refers to the establishment of a repul lic in Spain, and the efforts of the new gov ernment to alxi'.ish slavery ia nil its domin ions, which effort arc opposed by the reac tionary slaveholder. of Cuba, who are plainly striving to stop the march of civili zation. This 'baleful influence had thus far succeeded in d.fi uting the efforts of all lib eraljmindcd men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, aud in preventing the proposed re form iu that island, in the interest of hu manity, civilization and progress. It was to be hoped tliat this evil influence might be toon averted. In reference to the capture of tho Virgin ius, and to the inhuman and illegal murder of fifty-three of her passengers and crew, lie says that the Spanish government has recognized the justice of his demands, and had arranged for the immediate delivery of the vessel, for the surrender of the prison ers of the vessel and crew, for a salute to the flag, for proceedings looking to the punishment of those who may Ihj proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of vio lence ujMm citizens of the United States, and also tow;irds indemnifying those who may bo shown to be entitled to indemnity. The President expresses his conviction, that the existence of African slavery in Cuba, is the greatest cause of the lamentable condition of the Island, and docs not doubt that Congress shares his hope that it will soon be made to disappear, and that peace and prosperity will follow its aboli tion. lie suggests two constitutional amend ments one to authorize the President to approve so much of any measure of Con gress as his judgment may dictate, without approval of the whole; and the other that when an extra session of Congress is con vened by executive proclamation, legisla tion shall be confined to such subjects as the executive may bring before Congress from time to time in Avriting. Ho recommends tho erection at Wash ington of suitable buildings for Cabinet officers and for such officials as now receive commutation for quarters, thus setting an example to the States, so they may be in duced to erect buildings for their senators. The message goes very fully into the financial question, and declares that the country never can have permanent pros perity until specie payments bo resumed. He recommends legislation prohibiting na tional banks from paying interest on de posits and forcing them into resumption, if only in legal notes, lit suggests the ques tion whether banking should not be made free, but securing all the present safct' guards to bill holders. Ho notices tho improvement in American ship building during the past year, and hopes'for a continuation of it. In regard to the programme of cheap transportation, he refers to tho Erie and Illi nois cauali, and suggests whether it would not bo wise statesmanship to pledge to the States that own these canals that if they will enlarge them, the general government will look after ami keep in navigable condi tion the great public highway with which these canals connect, to-wit: the Hudson river, the St. Clair flats, and the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. lie recommends a government exploration of the upper Amazon river and its tributa ries; a revision and modification of the tariff laws, aud the opening of more mints. He endorses the recommendation of the Postmaster Geueral for the establishment of postoflicc savings deposition?, and invites the reconsideration, of Congress to the gov ernment proposition for a postal telegraph.
