Rate Regulation Demand* Flret Atten tion—Preeent Law* Ineffective- More Money for Canal Work—A*k* for Larger Navy—Revl** Immigra tion Lawe—Change Land Lawe. Washington, D. C. —At 11:40 Tues day morning assistant secretary to the president, Barnes, and executive Clerk Young and a messenger left the White House bearing copies of the presi dent's message for reading In the house and senate and for distribution among the member. The reading of the message began at 12:23, eight minutes later than in the senate. It required three hours to read. President'* Message. To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives —The people of this coun try continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community, both by the deserving and undeserving. Against the wrath of the Lord the wis dom of man can not avail; In times of flood or drought human ingenuity can but partially repair the disaster. A general failure of crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are Innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the busi ness community would hurt the whole business community. But such stop page of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country is the high individual character of the average American citizen, no mat ter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he be farmer or ; wage-worker, business man or profes sional man. Talks on Corporation*. Corporations are the first great sub ject dealt with. He says he is not opposed to corporations. Like trade unions they have come to stay. Each must be checked when they are not doing good. He thinks their regula tion possible under existing conditions but if not the constitution must be amended. The power to regulate must be affirmative and given to some ad ministrative body created by congress. He says such a body should have the power to judge of the reasonableness of a railroad rate and to prescribe the limit beyond which it shall be unlaw ful to go. All decisions on rates must be subject to revision by the courts. He does not favor power being given to originate rates, but to regulate rates already fixed. "I regard the power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. All private car lines, Industrial roads, refrigerator charges, etc., should be controlled by the commis sion. Labor Question Taken Up. Again recommends compulsory use of block signals on interstate railroads and recommend regulation of hours of railroad workmen and the liability of employers for Injuries. He says it would be unwise to deprive courts of power of injunction in labor matters. Recommends thorough investigation of labor matters, child labor, healthy factories, reasonable hours. He recommends consideration of federal supervision of insurance. He says the needs and desires of the people Bhould be consulted on tariff matters. Sayß economy In expenditures is ab solutely necessary this year. Advises the addition of the element of elastic ity to our currency. He wants better business methods in the various departments at Wash ington. Also recommends supervision of federal elections and campaign ex penditures. International Matter*. The various matters affecting inter national law coming before the next Hague convention are discussed at length. He discussed the Monroe doc trine as an aiu to the world peace and in this connection the San Domingoan situation. Canal Fund* Forthcoming. The Hepburn bill, appropriating $16,500,000 for the canal, will pass the house Thursday without reference to committee, either by unanimous consent or by special rule. In this connection he also discussed the army and navy. He recommends general maneuvers and promotions based on ability or seniority. He says increase (he navy. Revision of the naturalization and criminal laws are recommended. He says public land laws should be cbaiged to suit our needs today. He recommends to congress consid eration of the Mississippi levees, mer chant marine, Jamestown Tencenntal, care of confederate soldiers' graves. He discusses at great length im migration and its evils and the neces sity of the revision of present laws. He also considers the civil service and its needs, copyright laws, adulter ation of foods, smoke nuisance in Washington, and national parks, rec ommending an extension of Yellow stone Park south and east. Life sav ing stations and the Indians are also dealt with. He talks at length on the Philip pines, their improvement and needs. Says the most encouraging feature is Increase of school children from 300,- 000 to 500,000. He recommends free trade between the United States and the Philippines. He considers Porto Rico and insular affairs in general. Delegate for Alaska. He earnestly asks for an elective delegate for Alaska and recommends that Oklahoma and Indian Territory be admitted a* one stats and that' New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. | He goes into canal affairs, but says. he will recommend type at a later I date. He finishes with the recommen dation for more adequate provision tor | the state department

ALIENS TO THIS SIDE COHHISSIONEK'S ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS 1,026,499. ; Over Two Hundred Thouaand More Than Laet Year—Pacific Porta Show Decrease—On Account of Jap-Ruaao War—Slave and Huna Moat Promi nent—Fewer From Germany. In presenting the annual report of the bureau of Immigration, Commis sioner General Sargent refers to the magnitude and gravity of the problems presented by the growth of the alien population of ti.e United States. "These problems," he declared, "loom so largely In the prospect of our country that It may be said without giving just cause to charge exaggera tion, that all other questions of public economy relating to things rather than to human beings, shrink into compara tive Insignificance." The total alien arrivals reported for the year of 1,026,499 represents an In crease over the preceding year of 213,- 629, of which the continental ports of the United States report an Increase of 196,940, as compared with arrivals last year, and Canadian ports 13,830. At the insular ports the Increase was 2849, although the arrivals at Porto Rico were less by 94 than in 1904. There also was a large increase in arrivals at southern ports, while a decrease is shown for the Pacific ports, which Is accounted for in some measure by the Russian-Japanese war. Of the increased arrivals above re ferred to, Austria-Hungary sent 98,537 over its quota of 1904, Russia 39,756, Italy 28,183, and the United Kingdom 49,544. This increase from the last mentioned country, says the commis sioner, is somewhat offset by the de crease from Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. Notwithstanding the Increase from Italy, that country, says the com missioner, may be regarded as having probably reached the high water mark. From this showing, Commissioner Sar gent ventures the prediction that the chief source of future Increases in im migration are those two in Europe which have the greatest resources In population, probably, to dispense with —Russia and Austrla-Hungaria.
