VANCOU VF. It 1N I)EPEN DE NT. THURSDAY, PKCI'MHKH 4, 1879. The steamship State of California made the trip from Portland to San i Francisco last week in 461 hours, the fastest trip on record between the two places. Mr. H. W. Scott, editor of the Port land Orui/onian, lias g< ne to Wash ington I attend the meeting of the National Republican committee, of which he is a member. The wooden row in the rear of Ladd & Tiltou's bank, Portland, was par-j tially bunted, and practically de stroyed on Wednesday night of last week. Losses about $12,000, partly i insured. The balance unexpended t>f the Grant reception fund at Portland, 5041.25, has been distributed among the hospitals and charitable institu- 1 tions of that city, an act worthy of * | commendation. The city assessment of Portland, Oregon, just completed, shows an in crease of taxable property over that assessed last year to the amount of $710,650, which is a creditable show ing for the metropolis of the Colum bia country. Xannanßuck, Ksq. U. >S. District] Attorney for Idaho, states that there , is a strolls; probability that several j of tlio Indians captured by Lieut. Farrow and his command, will be j given up to the civil authorities to be ; tried for their crimes, as there is ample testimony both to identity of them and to prove their guilt. Congress met 011 Monday in regular session, and but little lias been done aside from receiving the usual annual message and reports of departments. The message is a lengthy document, but contains nothing startling,except it be a proposition to retire all green backs from circulation, which can hardly be accomplished against the j;i linneiit of nearly all parties. The Columbia river country has Wen surprised liy tho sudden death of Mr. A. J. Gillikan of Cowlitz county, who recently attained notoriety as a party in a hotly contested divorce; suit. He died at the Occidental hotel in Portland, on Friday, and bv his bedside was found a bottle labeled laudanum. It is a fact beyond rionht that whiskey was at the bottom of most of his troubles. Two of the Indians who murdered the Perkins family a year ami a half ago during the Bannack war, were hung at Yakima city on the of X 'Vemb r. The citizens present were fully arnie 1, but there was no disturb ance of any kind. Of the seven Indi an- engaged in that brutal murder all . r now dead '>ut the one who turned -tntes evidence, three being shot in att inpts to capt ire them, one in ut t. m ting to bn a 1; jail, and two hung. Jay (iould is coming to the front aL'iiin ia railroa i matters, in connec tion wit!i a Pacific ocean route. Hav ing control of a chain of routes to the Missi.-sippi lie cannot be satisfied until Jay (jould's railroads reach the western oetan. He tried for years to g -t control of tin' Central Pacific, hav ing already the l*nion Pacific, but failing on this, trod with ex-Senator Mitchell and other* to gobble up the Northern Paeific. That this failed was n«t for the want of hard work and the assistance of unscrupulous men on this coast, but fail he d'd. Xow he i- after the Atchison, Topeku and Santa Fe road and its new line now building to -an Diego, and a re cent Xew York dispatch states that with the aid of Boston capitalists Jie will certainly accomplish his object. An act approved Nov. 14, pro vides that all barrels, packages or cans containing fish caught within this Territory, and packed, barrelled or can ned therein, shall be marked by lalnd or otherwise in plain letters, with the name of the place where said salmon were caught, and also the name of the Territory in full, and the name of the party or parties putting up the same. And for each package, barrel, part of a barrel or can not so marked the per son or persons whose duty it l» to mark the saline, shall W subject to a penalty of not less than ten dollars, to be re covered by action brought by any per son first informing in a court having jurisdiction, and one-half of the sum recovered shall go into tlie common school fund of ihe county where the offense was committed, and the other fjalf to the informer. A London dispatch of Dec. Ist says that the Queen of Kngland is reported as suffering from a severe billions attack, and although the court physi cians seem to attach but little impor tance to this illness, many persons 1 are inclined to look upon her niajes ; ty's sickness in a much more serious | light. The queen is now 60 years of age and has always enjoyed exception ally good health, but has a constitu tion liable to break down suddenly under forms of illness to which she may now be considered subject. Con siderable solicitude is publicly ex pressed over the matter both for per sonal reasons and in view of the j political effect which might attend her possible demise at the present time. ! At the last session of the county ' commissioners'court in the counties of Pierce, Thurston, Lewis and Cow ' litz, an adjustment of the claims of these several counties against the Northern Pacific Railroad for delin quent taxes was made. It was agreed i that, if said Company would pay three per centum upon its gross earnings in this Territory for the past two years, into the treasuries of the several coun ties prior to I)cc. Ist 1879, such amount should be accepted i;i lieu of or full payment of, all the past taxes due from the Company, including that of the current year. This action was ratified by the legislature, and the ! Company has already made the stipu lated payment. The division of the j amount was to be made upon the pro | rata of road in each county. There : | are 1 :>i> miles, in all, of road, in the | j four counties , of which Thurston has 27 miles, and its share of the payment ( was SUiMi.2O. Til addition to this will !be about more as its share of the tax on the company's rolling stock. It was further stipulated that the com promise should not in any way affect | future taxation of the Company's i property in the several comities,— | Olympici Conri< r. According to the annual report of the general land olliee, just issued, the homestead entries for the past year exceed those of any previous i year for a long period. The area taken in homesteads last year was .".Jim. 111 acres. The Oregon Barrel Factory Co. have ' \ begun construciton of two additions ' to their buildings at St John's. One addition will be ollx'il) feet and tile i other 1Sx:!i), l>otii two stories high. As soon a> .satisfactory arrangements ' are made they will commence tlie manufacture of tubs and buckets. The great rise in the value of Xorth icm Pacific stock has brought the I bankrupt estate of Jay Cook A Co. , I clear out of debt and left It a surplus. It is now shown that every creditor 1 will receive his money in full, and that for every S limit of indebtedness , there are cash resources to the amount of >1,07J.:!7. This is an astonishing result for an estate whose liabilities once amounted to ss,oimi,(Wio. There is a large-eopcof agricultlira land lying along the banks of the Col ! umbia and Weiiaehie, upon which the water for irrigation purposes could be | easily brought. The Indians in this neighborhood, a majority of them, are securing their "Boston papers," and locating on the most desirable por tion-. They are making some sub stantial improvements in the way of building lou houses, the logs forwhieh they haul about four miles. The com ing season many will plant crops. Wong Fook, wiio was convicted in Portland in the circuit court of mur der in tile first degree, his crime be ing the killing of his mistress Hetjuai, was sentenced by Judge Bellinger, Saturday morning, to be hanged Tues day, January Jo, ]ssn. Xoapplication for a new trial was made, and in all probability he will sutler the death penalty at the appointedtillie. Fook's attorney, however, has published a notice t bat an application to <Jovernor Thayer for a commutation of sen tence will be made. From dispatches recently received it wouid appear that the new Cuban insurrection was becoming a werious affair. Tin* insurgents are mustering by thousands, and carrying on the \> ar in their jieculiarfash'ion of pillage and burning, while the Spanish au thorities are at their wits' ends and look anxiously for reinforcement from Europe. It would be interesting to know whether the revolt has any other motive than pillage. It has been understood that Spain was intro ducing the reforms demanded with all convenient spetd. The reports all indicate that there is a very melancholy winter before tlie people of France. The price of bread is high, the )«>tato crop is ruined by blight and many vineyards will not yield sufficient to pay for gather ing tile few m attered L'fopes. Add to this that the people of Ijjrope gener ally are in the same fix and cannot therefore buy the thousand and one nicknacks which form the bulk of French good* exports, and the outlook is seen to be gloomy indeed. Stone of us in this country are still inclined , to complain of the dullness of the times, but we are now «t the bight of prosperity compared to the people across the water. A Chicago telegram to tlie Milwau kee Sentinel says that during the stay of <»ratit in Chicago, large numbers of politicians from many states were in that city, taking observations of the situation, most of whom expressed their conviction that the effort to make a third term boom was an ap parent and even conspicuous failure. Father Conrady, the Catholic Priest in charge of the Missionary Depart ment at the Umatilla Indian Reserva tion, is reported by the East Oregonian as stating that a census of the Indians 011 the reservation will soon be taken, preparatory to their removal or their settlement. The Priest is of the opin ion that but few of the families 011 the reservation will remain; most of them being determined to lead a nomadic life. He thinks that many of them will go to Moses, and others to the Xez Perce country. A little daughter of James M. Lamb, on Dry creek, above "Walla Walla, died instantly last week, the circum stances attending her death being both remarkable and extraordinary. A month or two previous she hail an attack of diphtheria, from which she had, apparently, entirely recovered. On the morning of her death she seemed unusually vivacious, ond after playing around the house got up into her sister's lap to partake of some food from her hands. The little one took one spoonful only when she fell back and expired. OKEtiUX. Col. Lang will drive *20,000 head of beef cattle from Eastern Oregon next spring to , Laramie. Emigration continues to flow into South ern Oregon, notwithstanding the lateness i of the season. The Jacksonville Time# says that Mind fraud, Dr. Busby, is infesting the Willam ette valley at present. There are *204 prisoners in the Oregon penitentiary at the present time. This is the largest number ever incarcerated there I at any one time. Cattle raisers in the vicinity of Shoo Fly, Wasco county, Oregon, have sold to Messrs. Lang and Ryan 4,800 head of cattle, at I from 87 to 818 per head. Mr. TL I\. Pnrver, whose farm is in the Red Hills, fix miles south of S ilom, the piist season raised a p:itch of mangels, which yielded at the rate of sixty-four tons to tiie . acre. The Monti*: ■' /'learns that the O. S. X. Co. will soon commence the building at the Dalles of two baiges—one of 1/200 tons and the other of ,jOO or 800 tons. Also a largo steamboat to bo used in towing these birges. The Salem >' f *7M in says never in the memory of the oldest inhabitant has there been as much fall wheat sown as this fall; never did the wheat look better than it is now looking. If uotlim; oceurs to prevent it there will Ik* a tremendous crop of wheat ' harvested in this county next season.
