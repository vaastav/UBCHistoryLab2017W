C The President Sends in His Regular December Message. RECENT EVENTS TREATED. Work and'Recommsndjttlona Appertaining to the Departments Necessity of Re trenchment The Condition of the Treasury and Tariff Changes No Foreign Troubles. Washington, Dec 4. The president's message to congress was not so long as expected. The Hawaiian matter was not extensively referred to, advices being awaited. The views of the presi dent on foreign and domestic affairs are as follow: Message to the congress of the United States: - The constitutional doty which requires the president from time to time to give to the con gress information of the stale of the union and recommend to their consideration snch meas ures as he shall Judge necessary and expedient, la fittingly entered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statement and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of the beads of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. In an ef fort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with Its purpose, X shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced there and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appro priate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity no embarrassing situation remains that wllloiot yield to the spirit of fair ness and love of justice, which Joined with con sistent fairness characterizes a truly American foreign policy. - Foreign Affairs. My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long standing bound ary disputes, tendered to the president by the Argentine republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned bv those states to lay be fore me evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found th United States alert to watch the Interest of our citizens in thatcountry with which we carry on important oommerce. Sev eral vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the es tablished government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations and certain offieers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as It does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents ean reasonably claim recognition as belllgeraut. This far the position of our gov ernment has been that of an attentive but an impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict In passlng.our fixed policy of Impartial neutral ity In such a condition of affairs as now exists, I deem it necessary to disallow In a . manner not to be misunderstood, the unau- i thorized action of our late naval commander in , those water in saluting the revolutionist Bra- ' xlllan admiral, being Indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrections The convention between our government and Chill, having tor its object the settlement and adju tment of the de mands of the two count-ies against each other has been made effective by the organiza tion of the claims commission provided for. The two ' governments - failing to agree upon the third -member of th commission the good offices of the president of ths Swiss repub'ic were invoked. ' as provided in the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss repre sentative to this country was gratifying aliice to the United States and Chill and the vexa tious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chill by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving into his orricial residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against, whom criminal charges - were - pend ng, growing out of a - former abortive disturbance, and the doctrine of asvlum as applied to this case is not sanctioned bv the best .precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and strife Under no circumstances can the representative of this government be per mitted uniier the ill-defined fiction of extra-territorial jurisdiction to attempt the administra tion of criminal Just ce In the countries to which they" are accredited A temperate de mand having been made by the Chilian govern ment for the correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned, lhe minister was Instruct ed no longer to harbor the offenders The legislation of last year known as the deary Jaw, requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United States and the deportation of all not com ply lug with the provisions of the act within the time prescribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of eminent couusel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of the Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its va lidity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before the supreme court and on May 18, 1 MJ, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amend ment of the act extending the time of registra tion, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of ths renewed privilege thus af forded of establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain and that thereby the ne cessity of enforced deportation may ba to a great degree avoided It is devolved upon the United States min ister at Pekin. as dean of the diplomatic body and in the absence of a representative of Sweden and Norway to press upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder of Swedish mlssionaires at Tons, but this ques tion is of vital interest to all sountries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the in terior Our relations with the French republic con tinue to be intimate and cordial. I sincerely hope that the extraction treaty with that country, as amended by the senate, will soon be ope rati e. While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our inter course with Germany our relations with that co ntry continue satisfactory. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress be tween the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Behring sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for the- ac complishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the discrimination tolls Imposed in the Welland canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable sched ule of charges and my predecessor thereupon suspeade his proclamation imposing discrimi nating tolls upon British transit th ouph our canals. A c quest for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under con sideration. During the past year an American citi zen employed in subordinate commercial position in Hayti. after sufferings, promote I imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smug gling was finally liberated on judicial examina tion. Upon receiving authentio information of the flrinar udoo an American mau steam r toucniu refused to deliver up a passenger in transit TO

The government of Honduras, a3 to needed legislation on various subject I actuated by a sen e of justice and In a spirit of , cannot too heartily Indorse the proposition the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the ; that l6e Iee sy9tem as applicable to the corn ill conduct of lis offlc ra I pensation of United States attorney, marshals, The extradition treaty with Russia signed in clerks of federal courts and United States corn March 1887 and amended and confirmed by the missioners should be abolished with as little senate in February last was duly proclaimed last June. It is hardly necessary for me to stat e that the questions arising from our relatl ns with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the installation of the pres ent administration the existing govern ment of Hawaii bad been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the island and th United Ststes and submitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty I with drew for elimination and dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commission to make an impartial in vestigation of the circumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon th- subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitt d to me his report showing beyond all question that the ooastliutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to that g vernment and through the intimidation caused by the pres ence of an armed naval force of the United Seates which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wroti; that hid been done by those representing us and to restore as far as prac ticable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom plishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations anl responsibilities grow ing out of a-iv chm? of coalitions, brought about our unjustifl ible interference our present minister at Honolulu h is received appropriate instructions to that end Thus ar no information of the accomplishment of anv definite result has been received from him Additional advices are soon expected. When receiveJ they will promptly be sent to congress together with all other information at band, accompanied by a special executive message fuily detailing all the facts necessary to com plete understanding of the casa and presenting a history of all material, events leading up to the present situation. The Treasury. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from ail sources during the fiscal year ended June 3i. 183, amounted to $161 TH. Ml 91 and its expenditures to $159 1.71.674 29 There w is collected from customs $a.',3.!5 016.71 and frotn intrual reve nue tl6l.0J7.6SJ 93.

Internal revenue receipts exceeded thos? of the preceding year by $.r,H7,4l.32- The total tax collected on distilled spirits was 194,73), 260. 55 ; on manufactured tobacco, $H, 889.711.74, and on fermented liquors, $32, M8.933.07. We exported merchandisa during the year amounting to $817. 64. 194. a decrease of i 182,012. 9.V4 from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than an previous year in the history of the government. amounting to 1 "8. 681,844, and exceeding the amount exported dnring the preceding year by $.8.483,5I7. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was $9,S7S,13'.8S. un increase over the preceding year of 4 '.03 1,053 09. It is estimated upoa-"tbe basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the gove n ment for the year ending June 3), 1894. will be $43 ,1.M,3S5 ,6 and its expenditures $158 121, 363 38, resulting in a deficiency of 2,00,00J. On the 1st day of November, 149 ), the amount of money of all kinds in circulation or not in cluded in treasury holdings was 1,7 1 8, 544. 682, an increase for the year of $112.41)4.947. Esti mating our population at 67,421,000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was s 4ft On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,67,':?3, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of J I -6, 261.5i3. The purchase of silver under the law of July 14, 189 during the last fiscal year, aggregated M,0 8.l6iS9 fine ounces, which cost $15,5)1 374.13. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the 1st day of November. 1893, was 16674.59.). 43 fine , tounces, which cost I155.9J0.94 3 8L Between the . 1st day of March, 189 1, a d the 1st day of November, 189,1, the government purchased un der all laws 503,003,717 fine ounces of sliver at a cost of $"16,6.2,9ia The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July It, 189), num ber 26,087,28 v The seigniorage arising from .such coinage was $897,9(19.8.39, leaving on hand j in the mints 140,699,761 fine ouncei of silver which cost 126,7o8,2ia Our total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of 997,2$0,8i'5 piece valued at $43, 68i. 173.8 of whi h there was $3),-r3-,14 in gold coin, J ',343,715 la silver dollars. 17.217,22). 90 in subsidiary silver coin and $l,8',. , 10390 in minor coins. During the calendar year 1 1892 the production of precious metals in the United Slates was estimated to be 1.953,375 fine ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage : value of $10,000,0 o and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,750, 0i and of the coinage value of $7 4,9-19. 0. It is estimated that on the first day of July 1 9JL the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion amounted to $1,218 559,169 of which $597,697 ,85 was gold and i615.861.484 was silver. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending October Si, 1893, with a capital of (11.230,000, for Iff -six went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business, and seven remain in te hands of bank ex aminers with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized 44 were located in the eastern states 41 west of the Mississippi river and 34 In the central and southern states. The total number of banks in existence on the 51st day of October. 1893, was 3,793, having an aggregate capital of t695,55M2a The net in crease in the circulation of these banks during the year was $38.t3,872. The recent repeal of the provision or law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the' covernment as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency af fairs. I do Lot doubt that the ul imate result of this action will be most salutary and far (reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impos sible 10 know l "Ms time precisely what condi tions win uo uruugub uuuk uy lac vuauge, or , what, it any, supplementary legislation may i in the light of snch conditions, appear to be es : sential or expedi nt Of course, after the re cent financial perturbation tim is necessary - tor the re-establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confi 1 dence, the money which has been frightened ' into hoarding laces Is returned to trade and enterprise, a surve of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our in creasing population and business. In the pur suit of this object we should resolutely turn away frm alluring and temporar. ex pedients, determined to be contented with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan. In these cir cumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with the su Ject. instead of being injurious, will increase the probability of wise action. I desire to earnestly suggest the wisdom . f amending the existing statutes in r gard to the issuance of government bonds. The authority now vested in the secretary of the trea-ury to issue bonds is not as clear as it should be and the bonds tuthorized are disad vantageous to the' gov ram n both as to the time of maturi and rate of interest. The superintendent of immigration through the secretary of the treasury report that dur ing the 1 st fiscal year there arrived at our ports 41,793 immigrants. Of these 1.063 were not permitted to land arder the limitations of the law and 577 were te turned to the countries from which they came by reas n of their having publie charge .- The total arrivals e 141,034 less than for the previous year. , delay as possible It is clearly in the interest of the com oi unit that the business of the courts both civil and criminal shall be as small and as inexpensively conducted as the ends of justice will allow. j The system is, therefore, thoroughly viciotu which makes the compensation of court off! cials depend upon the volume of such business and thus create a conflict between a proper ex ecution of the law and private gain, which can- , not fail to be dangerous to the rijhis and free- j dom of the citizen an an irresistible tempta tion to the unjustified expenditure of public funds. If in addition to this reform another w.as inausju-ated which would give to United States commissioners the final disposition ol petty offenses within the grade of m sdemean ors, especially those coming under the interna! revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration ol the.crimin 1 law. An my first message to congress dated Decern JierS,188',l strongly recommended these changes ana referred somewhat at length to the evils o! the present system Since that time the trim inal business of the feJeral courts an I the ex nsc attending it have enormous!)- increased The number of criminal prosecutl ins pending in the circuit and district courts of the United Stales on the 1st day of July. 185. was .8 s, of which 1,881 were for violations of the intern tl revenue laws, while the number of such prose cutions pending on th Is. da r of July, HJ3. was 9,5 ki in which 4.2 d) were for violations 6t the internal revenue laws Th; expense of lhe United States courts exclusive of judges salar ies for the year endiug July I, l8 , was 2.i74,- B.

The business of the mails indie ite with absolute certain!. th condition of th- business of the court ry, and depressions in financial affairs in evitablv and quickly reduces the post.il reve- nu s. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between the post office receipts and ex p -ndiuires is lhe expected and unavoidable re sult of thi depressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmuster-gener al's report At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that tae deficiency on the 30th d w of June, 1833, would be but a little over $1,5)0,0ju. It amounted, however, to more than $',ooo,OJO. At the same time' and tinder the influence of like anticipa tion estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June so, I8JI. which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $72. 245 71. but now in view of the actual rece.pts and expenditures during that part of the cur rent fiscal year already expired the present postmaster-general est nn m that at its close instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearlv $4,003,00.). The post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $7.i,8Jti,933. 19 and its expenditures to S8l.074.l i4 90. This pest office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decre ised if less matter were carried free through the malls. an item of which Is upward of three hundred tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department The total number of post offices in the United States on the Sithda,' of June, 1893, was 8,401, an increase of 1,.'84 over the preceding year, and t these 3. e ) were presidential, an increase in that class of 24 over the preceding fortv-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing. making a total of 6J0. and ten cities and towns provided with free delivery oa Junes', 1893, ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its es tablishment I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions f the present law permits as general introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary and justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller com munities than ar now designated The expense of free del very for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S9I, will be more than 111, OO.ooO and under the administration now existing there must be a constant increase in the item of expenditures. There were 6,4 I ad' ditions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest in crease in any year since the inauguration f the system. The total number of these offices at the close of the vear was 18.131 Thee were 1 ',309,735 money orders issued from these of flees, being an increase over the preceding year of 1.240,293. and the value of these orders amounted to $127,76,433.0-, an increase of 7,- 509,6-12 5S. There were also issued during the year postal notes amonnting to $12,903, 176.71 During th year 19 international mon or der offices were add el to those a ready pro vided, making a to al of 2.4(7 in operation on June 0. 1893, The number of international mo ey orders issued durinj the vear was 1,05-V 99.), an increase over ai precding year of 7J, 525, an I the value was $16 341 8 r7 8d, an increase of $1,221, 506.31. The number of orders paid wa 300.917, an increase over the preceeding year of 13,503, and their value was $ 283.375, an In. crease f $9109183 Fram the foreg in? stita- ments it appears that the total issue of money ord rs and oostal n .tes f ir th ' ear amoun ed to $156,821,348.21. The number of letters ani package mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,375, 633. an increase over the preceding year of nearlv 22 per cent The special delivery sump used upon these letters and packages amounted to $337,569 30 and the messengers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to 26,59 .71 leaving a profit to the government of 9 9:6 9. The rail way mail service not only adds to the promou ness of mail delivery at all offices, but it U the especial instrumentality which puts thestn ilier and way places in the service on an eqn uity in that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of ths postal service h vs. there fore, received much attention from the po- , master-general, and though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high emotency and great usefulness. I am led to agree with the postmaster-general that there i room for its further improvement There are now eon- j neeted with the post office establishment Si.SJi i employes who are in the classified service, and I the head of this great depart ent gives con j elusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, after an experience that renders his judgment absolutely reliable, he expresses I the opinion that without th-i benefit of. this 'system it would be impossible to conduct the vast business Intrusted to turn- The Interior Department.

I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension office should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. very name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pen sions have their origin. Everv fraudu lent pensioner has become a bad citizen affidavits to support of a pension have madt perjury more omm n, and false and undeserv ing pensions rob the people not only of theii money but of the patriotic sentiment which tbe survivors of a war fought for t e p eserva tlon of the union ought to inspire Tuousands of neighborhoods have their we1 1 known fraudu lent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to establish pens on frauds. B.- no means the least wrong. done is to brave and deserving pensioners, wh ought not to be condemned to such associations Those who attempt, in the line of duty, tc rectify these misdoings should not be uc-used ol enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account ol pensions, for the year ending June 'to, 19 ', was $156,740,467. 11 The commission estimates that $l6o,oo;0)0 will be req ired to pay pensions during the year ending June 33. 1894 O r Indians n umber about 248.0JX Most ol them are located on 161 reser ations tontainint,- 80,U6,j21 acres f and About llJ.nio' these Indians have to a arge degree adopted civ:l zeu customs Lands in severalty hav been all tied to many f them Such allotments have been made to !0,l00 individuals during the ast fiscal year, embracing about l.tiu.oou acres me number of Indian g vernment schools open during the year was I9 an lno ease of 12 ovei ihe preceding year.

U-casional I cal outbreaks have been largely such as could have b en effect uallv iruarded aiainst by the owners of the affected cattle. While contaaious p euro pneumonia in cattle has been erad'ca'.ed animil tuberculosis, a dis ease widespread and m jre dangerous to human life th in pleura- pneumonia, is still prevalent Investigations have been made during the past year as to t e means of its cpmmonjcattoti a d the Riethod or its correct atagsoat Much pr gresa has beu made in this directum by the studies of the division of animal patrol ogv. bat work ought to be extended In co operation with local authorities, cnjil the dan ger to human life arising from this cause is re duced to a minimum The number of animala arriv.cg from Canada during the year and inspected by bureau officer was 462.092. and tbe number from tra as-Atlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious disease were found among th imported acUaals. lhe total number of inspections of cat tie far es port during the pat fiseal year was 611.54 The exports show a falling oil cf about S per XBt from the preceding e ir, the decrease occurring entirely in the at half of th year. This supsesta that the falling off may have beea ! largely due to an increase in the price of Amer ican export cattle. Dorin- the year ended June 30. 188 exports of inspected pork agere gated 20,677.410 pounds as against 3s. 152,17 1 pounds for the prectdicg year, ik tauiug la this export is not 4 oEtlned. however, to in spected pork, the total quantity exported for 132 being 65X.49i.618 pounds, while in 1SJS it was only -27,3. a 9 pounds I join the secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for the position of in spector or assistant inspector in the bureau of animal industry be required as a condition pre cedent to his appointment to exhibit to the United States civil service commissiorn'r his diploma from an established regular and r pu table veterinary college, and that this be sup plemented by such an examination in veterin ary science as the commission may prescribe. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal ver ended Juae S i, 1892, attained the enormous figure of tSW.OAt.OW In round numoers. being 77 per cent of our total exports. In the last fiscal year f is aggregate was creatlv reduced, but nev rt el , reached $615 01.000, being 7'xl per cent cf all American commodities exported A review of our a.-rt-cultur d exports ith special refere ce to tfcetr es lnatiou will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and In land absorbs b.- far the larjest proportion. Of cattle the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal vear ended June 30, l', $W,U.0', of which Great Britain took considerabU over $1 . Oj, joj.

Its public itions relate eape tally to the commercial side of farming It is therefore of profound Importation aid vital concern to the farmers of the United States who represent nearly ont-ha f ! our population, and also of direct interest U Hie whole countrv. that the work of this division be efficiently performed and that the inform 1 tion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter for congratulation to kniw that the secretary will not spare any effar to make this part of bis work thoroughly useful In the vear 1839 the congress appropriated ll.uO to be taken from the patent office funds for the purpose of collecting ani dis tributing rare and i i proved variet es cf seeds and for prosecutini agri cultural invest'gatinns and procuring agri cultural statist ics.and from this small beginning the seed division of the department of agricult ure has grown to its present unwieldy and un justifiably extrava;.tnt proportion During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds pun based was $30, )8 61. The rem ilnder of an arp opriation of $1 4. ) was expended In put ting them up and distributing them It sure v ntv-r could have ente ed t v minds of thus; who first sanctioned apt ropriu tiins of public money for the pur ch se of new anl Improved varieties of seeds for distribuiion that from this would grow large appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings wbl b are com mon in all the states and territories and ewry , where easily obtainable at low pr.ces In each 1 state and tertitory an agricultural experiment ! station has been established. These, stations by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with ani te- new varieties of seeds: and yet this lndls- rim inate and wasteful distrlbuti .u by legislation and legislators contlnues.answerinr no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that lb ir representatives are willing to remember them with gratuitous seeds at public cost Under the auction of existing legislation there as sent out from the agrlcu.tural de partment during the last fiscal rear e ough of cabbage seed to p ant 19.20 acre of land 1 sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4. acres beet seed enough to plant 2W acres swee corn enough to plant 7,sjj acres, sumoent cucumber seed to cover 2,02 acres wl h vines and enough musl.melon and watemelon seeds to plant 2.C75 acres The to al quantity of flow or and vegetable seeds thus distributed was co tained in more than nine millton packages and they were Kufttcient If planted to cover 89 9lacrrfS of land.

The continued intelligent execution of the civd service law and the Increasing approval by th people of its operation are most tiualifing. Ta recent rxtension of its limitations and reguia tions to the employes at free delivery post offices which has been honestly and promptly acoomn'.ished by the cotuuilssiiu. with the nearlv cooperation of the postmaster-general. is an immensely important advance in tha use fulness of the system 1 am, if possible, m r.f ban ever convinced of the Incalculable benefi a onforreu by the civil service law, not only in ts effect upon the public service, but also hu is even more important in its effect in e leva tun the tone of political life generally. The law embodying civil service reform found iu way to our statute book more from tear of the popular sentiment existing in its fa vor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and it has lived and grown and nourished In spite of tbe covert as well a open hostility of spoilsmen and notwithstanding the querulous impracticability of m ny self-con- stiluted guardians. B netth all ths va aries an sublimated theories which re attracted to it there uuderiies this reform a sturdy, com mon sense principle not only suited cto this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be ab solutely essential to the Dim successful opera tions of their government, it not to its per petuity. It seems tome to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform as well as ith its best enforcement, to oblige tbe com mission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from othe depwrimeuta There ought not to be such a condition in any department that clerks hired to do work there can be spared to habitually work at another place, and it does not accord with a sensible view cf civil servio reform that p -rson ahould be employed on the theory that thetr labor la necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devot d to entirely dif ferent work la another deoartment I earn estly urge that tbe clerks neoeas ry to carry on the work of the commission be regularly put upon its roster, and that the svstem of oblig ing the commissioners to rel upon the services of clerka belonging to otber departments ba discontinued This ought not to increase the expense to the government, while it would certainly be m-iro consistent ana aaas greatly to tbt efficiency or the commission. Economy in a public expend iture Is a duty that cannot inno -ently be ne glected by those Intrusted with the control of money drawn from the peopl 1 for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently end less resources the familiarity of pur people with immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the ex penditure of public mney should in some man ner be to their immediate and perional alvan tage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a larger part of our taxes are exaotetX and a degenerated sense of official accountabil ity have led to growing extravaganos Id gov erning ,tal appropriations. Tariff Reform. After a hard struggle, tar I IT reform ts di rectly before ua Nothing ao Important claims our attention and nothing ao clearly present Itself as both an opportunity and a duty -an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fel low itlzens and a duty impos d upon us by our oft repeated pro'essions and b the emphatio mandate of the people After full discussion our countrymen have spoken In favor of this reform. ane they have cnnfldod the wc rk of its accom plishment to tbe hands of those k bo are sol emnly pledged tott If there Is anvthlnt In tba theory of a representation in publio places of the people and" thetr desires, if public; officer. are really servants of the people and if political promises and professions have an binding force our failure to give the relief so U g awaited will ba sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or 1: urb our effort un til this reform is accomplialieJ b- wise and careful legislatian While e chould ataun hly adhere to tbe principle that only tbe necessity of revenue ja-tffles the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation and that they should bo lim: by strict economy wa cannot close iur eyes to the fait that condi tions liue if rown up among ' tales in jua. ti e and fairness call for discriminating caret Is the distribution of sjch duliet and taxation, as tbe emergencies of our government actually demand. Manifestly. if we are to aid th people directly through tariff r f irm, one of its moat obvious features should b; a red 10 Hon in present tariff charges upon tbe newasarles of lire The beat efits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantially seen and felt by thousand who would be better fed and belter clothed and bet ter sheltered These gifts should he tbe willing benefactions of a government wbose highest function is the promotion of the wcl.are of the people.
