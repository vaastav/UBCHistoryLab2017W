Dr. Clarke, moth- in-law of S. 0. GriswulJ, Esq., of this city, met with in accident of considerable sever ity yesterday afternoon. She was crossing the street between the F lain Dealer office and the Atwater Building, when sha was run upon by a pair of horses and knocked down, receiving several bad bi nines, though wa understand no limb wai broken, nor any injuries of a dangerous character sus tained. 6he was taken into lha Commer cial Bank and cared fer. and thence to her home.' The man who had charge of the horses was riding one and loading the oth er, and they were running at such speed aa to render it impossible for him to stop them in time to prevent tbe misfortune. Bucb reckless drivine on a rrahltc thoroughfare. where hundreds ara constantly passing to and fro, is in every sense criminal, and those guilty of it should never escape the punishment they deserve. THiSXbOiviMO BikhobT. The Sermcn in pamphlet form, preached by P-ov. T. H. Hawks, in the Second Presbyterian Church, on Thanksgiving Day, ia for sale at J. B. Cobb's, iDgham k Bragg'e, and at Hawks' Kewa Depot. The discourse is eloquent and logical, and replete with inspiring and impressive truthe. It should be resd carefully and underetand ingly by all, for to none will it be found other than of the gteatest profit. We ap pend a few extracts touching the relation of slavery to the war: 'But all the sins that have now been mentioned, yield in magnitude and guilt, to that of holding in bondage fonr millions of men, who nave the same right to freedom, to the snored institution of the family, and to tbe work of God, as ourselves. Every one of them also strike it roots into this, and draws fresh life from t. I shall not enter upon a discue- on of the sin of the nation, in upholding the slavery of the South. It can be Been in the laws of Congrees,tn the decisions of the Supreme Court, in Cabinet cabals, in the resolutions of national party conventions.in the revival of the slave trade, in tbe judg ments of Commissioners' Courts, in the wrotijrsof Kansas, in the establishment of the Missouri Compromise, in the annulling of that Compromise, in the infamous pro visions ot thef ugttiveblave Bill, in tbe aug mented area of slavery, in the war with Mexico, and in the nameless wrongs heaped upon the enslaved race at the hands of cruel masters, and under the operation of State laws for the regulation of he syatem. The nation is reaping as it bas sown, bod ia smiting n in the very part we had done most to strengthen. The judgment is un mistakable. We need no Daniel to Inter- ret mystic characters, and tell us that the Medea and Persian are thundering at our gates, because we have built the throne ei empire upon the unrequited toils and un avenged wrongs, the tears and blood, of our brethren. In the disposition of this problem of slave ry, as it shall be affected by the develop ments of the war, all should ask that God will guide aright both tbe rulers and the people. What he intends to do for the wronged Alrican race in bondage, we do not know. Of one thing we may be aura. If weean ascertain what bis will is, we shall be sale in obeying it. If it be that they go free, then Jetithe word of emancipation be spoken. We need not fear the evils that might louow. . icey couia not D so great that ot proving taise to nis behest. Certainly we cannot plead constitutional obligations, as a reason for sparing the sys tem which has precipitated the war upon us. So fer as the disloyal States are concerned. we are rel aaed from ihnm. What is wisest and best what we ought to do, is the only question that should be agitated." Tbi ITipth BsttiiT.

A. Hale Have lived here four years; re member seeing of Green's arrest shortly alter he was arrested, in tne papers; a morning paper oi Wednesday or 1 hurdav I gueaa: don't know for certain; on the next day but one before, I think, waa nmiug on tne a oca at snou a siauguter nous after dinner; came away perhaps at 6, and per. baps after; aaw two men on a log In an orchard there; sitting en a log; thought they were ti-h Ing; they went away through the orcharo; ten or fifteen minutes after I went out Into the road; 1 saw Minckley go down to th log by the river; have noticed the log, having been there several evenings fishing; the bank under the log has washed away siocs somewuar.

Minckley asked me it 1 knew anytutng aoout tne matter: did not know anything about it; I did notgo in to trap tireeu to get. him to coniess; i was there three or four weeks ago; it was Thura day I think. (To Mr. Adams) Had not heard of Hinckley's indictment before 1 went into Green's shop. L. Mix Am a policeman; assisted In arresting Green and Lynch; it was made about 2 o'clock: got information from Mincklay first ; came around the Weddell House comer, and was look ing down the street, and saw Minckley coming on to the walk near Johnson House; he beck oned to me and started towards him; he said "come, go with me. i want you." We met nearer tbe Johnson than the Weddell; told me he wanted I should go into Johnson House office, and go down the stairs that le.id into the saloon and from thence into the barber's shop. I started in aad he followed me and said, "be sure when you see me go Into barber ahop go down these stairs, and see that no one goes in or out." I went to head of stairs, but could not ex actly see the entrance to barber's ahop through the trout window, and went a few steps toward the front and aaw him la the act ot turning to go down. I went down then into the saloon; a man was sitting there. I think the man tended the bar l went to toe entrance to tne snop ana found th door locked; then went around by the walk iuto the barber's shop. I saw there Green, Lynch and Minckley; Minckley wa between th two ; be took the watch from Greea'a right baud pocket ; than turned to Lynch and sail, " A bat have you got," and commenced search Ing Lynch ; then aaid, "tike these men."

Lynch said alter he was locked up he wanted something to eat and wanted to knw if I couldn't get tometning : saia l could it ne had money; be said be hadn't got any; told me he wanted I should see Col. Ryder, his counsel, and he thought he could find a friend ol his who would let him have some money. Had no con versation with Green. I beard no conversation in tha barber's shop between Minck'ey aud Green about whether the watch waa stolen or not nor about giving up the money.

CAMP QUIGLEY, Dec. 8, 1861. Eds. Lsibis: Kight dark but warm is upon us. The weather ba changed and is now balmy as early spring, and our soldiers are sinking into s'eep and forgetfalness, or rather to dreams some of home, others of toilsome naarchet and hard won battles The marches and battle will no doubt be stern realities ere many moons have waxed and waned. Whether the visions ot victory and home are to be realized 1 yet to be de termined. For one, of the ultimate triumph of our cause I am sure, but of immediate success, though hopeful, I am not sanguine. Buckner ia strongly fortified at Bowling Green, and with a force variously estimated it from forty to one hundred thousand : probably the last figures are more nearly the truth,, while the Union force being at present concentrated against him is from fifty to seventy thousand. I have purpose ly given margin in tha last statement as I have no right to be exact, aud have penned these facta because the tendency is to over rate our own forces and underrate those of the rebels. I do not think our officers do this, but reports are apt to give the public very erroneous ideas, and hence to raise ex pectations which are destined never to be realized and to weaken confidence in those in the field, because they do not accomplish all that ahould b) expected of them were their circumstances what the public are led to suppose them to be. For instance, I have within a week seen it stated in aome of the public prints tbat Buckner had not over twenty thousand men under hia com man, and that tbe'Union forces in the department were over one hundred thousand strong. pectations formed from such data must of course be doomed to fail of being realized. The moral of all this is, don't expect too much of us. We have a big job on hand, and that big job we will yet do; We are for the present assigned to Gen. Nelson's oivision, and move from here to New Havon., Ey. It was expected tbat we were to move on the morrow, but no order to that effect has yet been issued. We are till to be paid, and to receive dress coat Ac. Our band have been down to the city ser enading and created quite a sensation, aa doe also our batallion drills and dress pa rade?, which, since our arrival In this camp, have been witnessed by a very fair repre sentation of the citizens of Louisville, both as to numbers and position. The city itself is one of the finest I have ever aeen. The dwellings are very fine, principally of brick, but many with stne fronts, having a very fine and very substantial appearance. Tbe brick buHdings are, almost without excep tion, painted a light drab color. There are n the city some four or five large hospitals, and several of the first physicians in the place devote their entire lime to the care of the sick and wounded. The nursing in several of them ia done entirely by the Nuns, styled, I believe, "Sisters of Charity," but the ladies of the city prove themselves to many a poor soldier angels of mercy by providing for their comfort in the thousand and one ways which only a lady could think of. The extra police force of the city is en listed for three yeara unless sooner discharg ed, and is liable to be called whenever need ed. It numbers about six hundred, and is on duty every other day The city is very quiet, and business, though greatly curtailed, goea on aa usual. They bought of the North and aold to the South, and hence their custom is cut off, but they are quiet and hopeful. The wages of teachers in the public schools have been cut down Si per cent, but no school has been discontinued, and no teacher has resigned. Few cities have suffered more financially, and none have proved themselves more loyal. Kentucky is worth saving, and it is said will not have a rebel company within her limits by next New Tears, all of which, if I do not steadfastly believe, I at least sin T.

CAMP QUIGLEY, Dec. 9, 1861. Eos. LiaDia; Our Brigade is under march ing orders. We start to-morrow morning at 8 t'ciock for New Haven, this Slate. The baggage of both officers and men is cut down to the lowest standard, and to-day the boys are disposing of extra blankets, Ac. Many a quilt and blanket provided by friends for the volunteers' comfort ha today been parted with for a dime, and many more will probably be abandoned within the next four days. We are to go on foot, the railroad being too full of other army bus iness to allow immediate transportation for so large a force. It is expected that we will form part of the advance column against Buckner. Our sick will be left behind, and we doubtless initiated into the Lterner duties of soldier life. We have the LtiDia ol the 6th inst., and they are eagerly sought for T. Why is it Toliiitzd? The Wheeling In telligencer complains that notwithstanding that city is the headquarters of Gen. Bose erans, that a Union Legislature and Union Convention are in seuion there, that it ia the headquarters of the Fay master's Department for Western Virginia, and that one hundred secessionist are im prisoned there, still secessionist obtrude their sentiment with insulting effrontery upon the public, and that the result is a row of a more or less dangerous, and always troublesome, character every night. The Intelligencer predict " bloody work one of these day," if this sort of thing ia not pnt a stop to by the power of the Federal and State Government. All Eight Aeaia.

A public meeting will b held in Cotton gules Room at 2 o'clock. " The room was crowded to excess. . The Chair waa occupied by James S pence, who read tne tallowing resolutions: Mtiolvtd, That this meeting baring heard with indignation thtt an American Federal ship of war bas forcibly taken from a British mail steamer, certain jasEengers passing under tue inelter or oar nag Irum one neu tral port to another, do earnestly call upon the Government to assert tbe dignity of the Bntisa nag By requrmg prompt reparation tor Ibis outrage. This resolution was received with great entnusiasm. l , The resolution was advocated by the Chair man, who considered he was expressing the ! eel ing or tne people, to press on tbe Ouv- arnmtnt the imperative necessity of vindicat- ng tne Honor and dignity of th British name and flag. - Mr. J no. Campbell considered there was reason to doubt whether the f.icts related and acted on by this me tin, were La reality a breach of International Lw, and refer red to opinions of tbe Law Officers of the Orowa as being in some measure inclined to ihow that such a step as taken with respoct to Southern Commissioners waa justifiable under the existing state of International Law, and urged the propriety of postponing Me consideration of tbe subject till to mor row. Mr. Tow sustained Mr. Campbell's views. The Chairman suggested that to meet the objections of Mr. Campbell, to strike out the "or(l8 ''by requiring prompt iearation for tbis outrage," and thna amended, the resolu tion pa&ed almost unanimously.
