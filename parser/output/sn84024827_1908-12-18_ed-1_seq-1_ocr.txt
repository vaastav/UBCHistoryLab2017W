' ' -r WASHINGTON, Doc. 17. A fluurry was caused In diplomatic circles today on the report that Venezuela had de clared war against Holland. Tho re port had its foundation In a diafpatch which camo to tho stato department by way of Bogota. It is also polnte out however, that the announcement was based on Vice President Gomez's declaration that 'the country is in a stato of defenso because Holland seized a coast guard ship and the Alexis. Officials Interested in the situation profess.io see no actual dif ference between "stato of war and "state of defense." taking the posi tion that it is a caso of "distinction without difference." A revival of dem onstrations against President Castro's administration would not be surpris ing to the state department While it Is premature to speculate, should a feeling against the president ueveiop to tne extent of o(pen revolu tion, the stato department It Is under stood, would lose no time in resuming diplomatic Intercourse with tho new administration to ,tha end that some action might be taken on the unsettled claims against Venezuela, and a re sumption of friendly relations. 

BERLIN, Dec 17. President Castro did not leave tho hotel all day, being busy with his correspondence. Ho re ceded a number of dispatches from Caracas, but nothing confirmatory of the reports with referenco to a revo lutionary movement in Venezuela. which 110111 ho and the members of hl3 suite pertSsti denying.

Thero is no truth in thc"roport that Germany has been asked to undertake negotiations with Holland for tho pur pose of bringing about a settlement of the difficulty. Tho president, who appears to bo In an extremely good humor, and who seemingly Is not suffering very much from his malady, received with his wife three or four personal friends with whom he lunched in his apart ments. 

WASHINGTON. Dec. 17. Vice Pr dent Gomez's recent declaration that Venezuela is in a state of defense, fca- been construed In some circles as mtan'ng a state of war.
