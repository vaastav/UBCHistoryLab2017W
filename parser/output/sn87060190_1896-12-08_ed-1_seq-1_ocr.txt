WILSON TAEIPP BILL DEFENDED. The President Believes If It Were Given Fair Chance Under Favorable Circumstances It Would Fro- duce Sufficient Revenue. Washington, Dec. 7. President Clove land's nnnual message, delivered to con gress Monday, la as follows: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people In tho legislative branch of their government you have assembled at a time when tho strength and excellence of our free Insti tutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest Involving momentous consequences, fraught with fe verish" apprehension and creating aggres siveness so Intense as to approach bitter nets nnd passion, has beeu waged through out our lundand determined by the decree of freo and Independent suffrage without disturbance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness In our national struc ture. In obedience to n constitutional require ment, I herein submit to the congress cer tain Information concerning national af fairs with the suggestion of such legisla tion as in ray Judgment is necessary nnd expedient To secure brevity and avoid tlresomo narration, I shall omit many de tails concerning matters within federal control which, though by no means unim portant, are more profitably discussed In departmental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a Minute recital of many minor Incidents connected with our foreign relations which have heretofore found n place In executive messages, but are now contain d in a report of the secretary of state, which la herewith submitted. nideou and Utoody. At tho outset of a reference to the more Important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers, It would afford me satisfaction If I could assure the congress that the disturbed condition In Asiatic Turkey had, during tho past year, as sumed a less hideous and bloody aspect, and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demands of humane civilization, or as the result of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by trenty to Interfere for the protection of thoso exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking fea tures of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcomlag n soft ened disposition or -protective Interven tion, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton destructlonof homes and the bloody butch cry of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens In Tur key have thus far been killed or wounded, though often In the midst of dreadful ceneB of danger, their safety in tho fu ture is by no means assured. Our govern ment at home and our minister atConstan tlnoplo have loft nothing undone to pro tect our missionaries In Ottoman territo ry, who constitute nearly all the Individ uals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on tho score of Amer ican citizenship. Our efforts In this direction will not bo relaxed; but th best feeling and sympa thy that have been aroused among our people ought not to so far blind their rea son and judgment as to lead them to de mand 'Impossible things. Tho outbreaks of blind fury which lead to murder and pil lage in Turkey occur suddenly and with out notlco, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostllo presenco thero as might bo effective for proventlon or pro tection would not only be resisted by tho Ottoman government, but would be re- Jarded as an Interruption of their plans r tho great nations who assert their ex lefuslvo right to Intervene in their own tfme and method for the security of Ufo and property In Turkey. Filiate and Destruction. Several naval vessels are stationed In tho Mediterranean as a mcasuro of cau tion and to furnish all posstblo relief and refuge In case of emergency. Wo havo made claims agalnBt the Turkish govern ent for tho plllago and destruction of missionary property at Harpoot and Ma rash during uprisings nt those places. Thus far tho validity of these demands has not been admitted, though our minis ter, prior to such outrages and In antlcl-, patlon of danger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our mission ary citizens In the localities mentioned, nnd notwithstanding that strong ovldenoo exists of actual complicity of Turkish sol diers In the work of destruction and rob bory, the facts, as they now appear, do not permit us to doubt tho Justlco of theso claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement, A number of Armenian refugees having Srtlved at our ports, an order has lately sea obtained from tho Turkish govern ment permitting tho wives and children of such rcfugoos to Join them here. It Is hoped that hereafter no obstacle wijl bo, InUriosed vto prevent tho escape of all! those Vfho seek to avoid tho perils which threaten them In Turkish dominions. Our recently appointed consul to Erze-j rw U "'t bis port discharging the du ties ofjrts office, though for some ante tvvfcitftfct Reason his -formal 'exequatur! treaMbt JUlitaji feL Wtoe ', f do not believe thnf the present somber prospect In Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civiliza tion thut belongs to the closo of tho nine teenth century that It seems hardly possi ble that the earnest demand of good poo p'e throughout tho Christian world for Its corrective treatment will remain unan swered. Th Cuban Innnrrectlnn. The Insurrection In Cuba still continues with all Its perplexities. It Is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been mado toward the pacification of the island, or that the situation of affairs as depicted In my last annual message has in the least Improved. If Spain still holds I avnna and the seaports nnd all the con siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of tho In land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the Iniurroctlon seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, as Is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased malltary and naval forces to the task, there Is much reason to believe that the Insurgents havo gained in point of numbers, and character, nnd resources, and are none the less Inflexible in their rcsolvo not to succumb without practically securing the great objects for which they took up nrms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insurgents yet mado good their title to be regarded as un independent state. As the contest goes on the pretense thnt civil government ex ists on tho Inland, except so far as Spain Is about to maintain it, has been practi cal!' abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such n government, more or less imper fectly, In the large towns and their Imme diate suburbs. Hut, that exception being made, the entire country Is cither given over to anarchy or is subject to tho mili tary occupation of one or the other party. It Is reported, indeed, on reliable au thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of tho Insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise Its func tions, leaving that government confessed ly (what there is the beat reason for sup posing It always to have been In fact) a government merely on paper. No Pitched Matties. Were tho Spanish armies nble to meet their antagonists in tho open, or lu pitch id buttle, prompt nnd decisive results might be looked for, and the Immenge su periority of the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline und equipment could hardly full to tell greatly to their advantage. But they aro called upon to fucc a foe which can choose und does choose Its own ground, that from the nature of the coun try Is visible or Invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from ambuscade und when all the advantages of position und num bers arc on its Bide. In a country where nil that Is indispen sable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter Is so easily obtainable, espe cially by tliObC born and bred on the soil, It Is obvious that there Is hardly n limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of the combatants grow more und more Inflamed and excesses on both sides be to in o moro frequent and deplora ble. They ore also participated In by bands of marauders who, now in tho nnme of one party nnd now In tho name of tne otn er, as may be the occasion, harry tho coun try at will nnd plunder its wretched In habitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would Inevitably entail immense destruction of property, even If It were the policy of both partita to prevent It as fur as practicable. Wholesale Annihilation. But fhlle such seemed the original pol icy of the government, It has now appar ently ubuudoued It und la uctlng upon the same theory us the Insurgents, uumoly, thut the exigencies of the coutest requlro the wholesale unnlhllatlou of property, that It may not provo of use and advan tage to the enemy. Itls to the sameend that.ln pursuanceof general orders, Spanish garrisons uie now being wlthdiuwn from plantations und the rural population required to concen trate Itself in the towns. The sure lesult would beem to be thut tho Industrial val ue of the Island Is fast diminishing and that unless there Is a speedy and radical change lu existing conditions It will soon dlsaunear altogether. That value consists very largely, of course, In Its capacity to produce sugar, u capacity already much reduced by the Interruptions to tillage which have taken place during tne last two vears. It Is reliably asserted that should theso interruptions continue during tho current year, and practically extend, as Is now threatened, to the entire sugar-producing territory of the Island, so much time nnd so much money will be required to restore tho land to its normal productiveness that it Is extremely doubtful If capital can be Induced to oven make tho attempt, The spectacle of tho utter ruin tit an ad joining country, by nature one of tho most fertile and charming on tho globe, would engage tho serious attention of the gov ernment and people of the Unltod States In any clrcunistunccs. In point of fact, they havo a concern with It which Is by no means of a wholly sentimental or phil anthropic character. It lies so near to us as to bo hardly separated from our terri tory. Our actual pecuniary Interest In It Is second only to that of the people ana gov ernment of Spain. It Is reasonably estl inntod that at least from $30,000,000 to $30,000,000 of American capital aro In vested In plantations and In railroads, mining and other business enterprises on tho island. The volume of trade between tho United States und Cuba, which in 1880 amounted to about $01,000,000, roso in 1BIM to about ?10B,000,000, nnd In 1804, tho year beforo the present insurrection utoko out, it amounted to nearly $1)0,000,000, Vexations and Costly. nesldes this largo pecuniary stnko In the fortunes of Cuba, tho United States finds Itself Inextrlcubly involved in tuo present coutest In other wnya both vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside In this coun try nnd Indirectly promote tho insurrec tion through tho press, by public meetings, bv tho nnrchase and shipment of arms, by tho raising of funds and by other means which the nature of our Institutions and the tenor of our Iuwb do not permit to be made subjects of nrlmlnal prosecutions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart ni In all the r feelings and Interests. hnve taken ont papers as naturalized citi zens of tho united States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible pro tection by this government, and not un naturally regarded with much Indignation y ibc country u mcir wiikj". , g& 1uid loppo.rtea' by th WidesprtTiU sympathy the people of this country nr ways nnd Instinctively feel for every struggle for the better nnd freer govern ment, nnd which, In the case of tho more ndventurous nnd restless elements of our population, lends In only too ninny In stances to nctlve nnd personal participa tion In the contest. The result Is thnt this government Is constantly cnlled upon to protect Ameri can citizens, to claim damages for Inju ries to persons nnd property, now estimat ed nt many millions of dollars, nnd to n"sk explanations and apologies for the nets of Spanish officials whoso zeal for the sup pression of the rebellion sometimes blinds them to the Imrauultles beVonglng to the unoffending citizens of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States Is compelled to actively po lice a lone lino of seaconst ngnlnst unlaw ful expeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not nlwnys sufHce to prevent. Ponltive Intervention. These Inevitable entanglements of the United Stntcs with the rebellion In Cuba, the large American property Interests af fected, and considerations of philanthropy and hunmnlty In general, hnve led to a vehement demand In various qunrters for some sort of positive Intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed thnt belligerent rights should be nccorded to the Insur gents n proposition no longer urged be cause an untimely and Impractical opera tion clearly perilous nnd Injurious to our own Interests. It has since been and Is now sometimes contended that tho Inde pendence of the Insurgents should he rec ognized. But Imperfect nnd restricted ns the Spanish government of the Island may be, no other exists there, unless tho will of the military officer In temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as n species of government. It Is now also s-tggested that the United States should buy the lland a suggestion possibly wor thy of consideration If there woro any evidence of a dwlre or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It Is urged, finally, thut, nil other meth ods falling, tho existing Internecine strife In Cuba should be terminated by onr In tervention, even at the cost of war be tween the United States and Spnln a wur which Its advocates eonlldently prophesy could he neither large In Its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither nlllrmcd nor denied. The United States bus, nev ertheless, a character to maintain as n na tlon, which plainly dictates thut right nnd not might should be the rule of Its con duct. Further, though, the United States Is not n nation to which peace Is a necessi ty. It Is In truth the most pacific of pow ers and desires nothing so much as to live In amity with all the world. Its own am ple and diversified domains satisfy nil pos sible longings for territory, preclude nil dreams of conquest, and prevent nny cast ing of covetous eyes upon neighboring re gions, however attractive. Our Conduct Toward Spain. Thnt our conduct towards Spain nnd her dominions has constituted no exception to this national disposition Is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present Insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Yarn In 1808. No other great power. It mny safely be said, under circumstances of similar per plexity, would huvo manifested the same restraint nnd the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States toward Spain In connection with Cuba unques tionably evinces no slight respect nnd re gard for Spain on the part of tho Amer ican people. They In truth do not forget her connec tion with tho discovery of tho western hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fall to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to tho national honor. They view with wonder nnd admiration the cheerful reso lution with which vnst bodies of men nre sent across thousands of miles of ocean, and nn enormous debt accumulated, that the costly possession of the Gem of the Antilles may still hold Its place In the Spanish crown. And yet neither the government nor the people of tho United States have shut their eyes to the course of events In Cu ba, nor have failed to realize the existence of conceded grievances which hnve led to the present revolt from the nuthorlty of Spain grievances recognized by the queen regent and by the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish stutesmon without oven regard to party, nnd demonstrated by reforms proposed by the executive nnd approved by tho legis lative brunch of tho Spanish government. It Is In the ussumed temper nnd disposi tion of the Spanish government to remedy theso grievances, fortified by Influential public opinion In Spain, that this govern ment hns hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of compos ing the present strife with honor nnd ad vantage to Spain, and with the achieve ment of all reasonable objects of tho In surrection. Oennlna Autonomy. It would seem that If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, home rulo which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational re quirements of her Spanish subjects, thero Bhould be no just reason why the pacifica tion of tho Island might not bo effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be In the truo Intorest of all concerned. It would at unco stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the Inland nnd making it worthless for whichever purty may ultimately prevail. It would keep Intact the possessions of Spain with out touching her honor, which will bo con sulted rather thnn Impugned by the ade quato redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of tho Island and the fortunes of Its Inhabitants within their own control without sovorlng tho natural and ancient tics which bind them to the mother country, and would yet en able them to test their capacity for self government under the most favorable con ditions. It has been objected on the ono sldo that Spain should not promise auton omy until hor Insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side, that prom ised autonomy, however liberal, Is Insuffi cient, because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled. But tho reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender on tho part of the Insurgent Cubuns beforo their autonomy Is conceded Is not alto gether apparent. It Ignores important features of the situation the stability two years' duration has given to tho insurrec tion, tho feasibility of Its Indefinite pro longatlon In tho naturo of things, and, ag ibowft b)r post experience, tfae utter and Imminent nun or tne island unless the present strife Is speedily composed; above all, the rank nbuses which nil parties In Spain, nil branches of her government and nil her lending public men concede to ex ist nnd profess it desire to remove. During such circumstances to withhold the proffer of needed reforms until the pnrtles demanding them put themselves nt Its mercy by throwing down their nrms hns the nppenrnnoc of neglecting the gravest of perils nnd Inviting suspicion us to the sincerity of nny professed willing ness to grnnt reforms. The objection on behnlf of tho lnsurgets that promised reforms can not be relied upon must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume nnd no reason for nssum tug thnt anything Spain undertakes to do for tho relief of Cuba will not be done ac cording to both the spirit nnd the letter of tho undertaking. Proposition to Spain. Nevertheless, nil renllzlng thnt suspi cions nnd precautions on the part of the weaker of two comhntnnts nre always tinturnl and not nlwnys Justifiable being sincerely desirous In the Interest of both as well ns on Its own account thut the Cuban problem should be solved with the leaht possible delay It wns Intimated by this government to the government of Spnln some months ago, If a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered the Cubnn Insurgents and would be accepted by them upon n guaranty of Its execution, the United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of fur nishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this Inti mation hns yet been received from the Spanish government, It Is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, ns al ready sugcested, no reason Is perceived why It should not be approved by the In surgents. Neither party can fall to see the Importance of early action, and both must realize thnt to prolong the present stnte of things for even n short period will ndd enormously to tho time nnd labor nnd expenditure necessnry to bring about the Industrial recuperution of the Island. It Is, therefore, fervently hoped on nil grounds that enrnest efforts for healing the brench between Spain and the Insur gents, upon the lines nbovp Indicated, may be nt once Inaugurated and pushed to an Immedlntc nnd successful Issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either In tho manner above outlined or In nny other wny consistent with our constitu tion nnd our laws, will always be at the dlsposnl of either party. Whntever circumstances mny nrle our policy nnd our Interests would constrain us to object Jo the ncqulsltlnn of the Isl and or nn Interference with Its control by any other power. " Our Fat.ence Slay IJe Kxhanstr-I. It should be added that It cannot be rea sonably assumed thnt the hitherto expect ant attitude of the United States will ba Indefinitely maintained. While wo are an xious 1o accord all due reEaect to K UOv relemty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict In nil Its featuros, and properly apprehend our Inevitably close relations to it. nnd its possible results, without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn Into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end tho contest, either alone and In her own way, or with our friendly co operation. When the Inability of Spain to deal suc cessfully with tho Insurrection has be come manifest and It Is demonstrated that her sovereignty Is extinct In Cuba for all purposes of Its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for Its re-estub-llshment has degenerated Into a fctrlfe which means nothing more than the use less sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spnln will be superseded by higher ob ligations which we can hardly hctltate to rccognlzo nnd discharge. Duty of United Stntci. Deferring the cholco of wnys nnd meth ods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the pre cise conditions then existing; and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration Involving out- honor and Interest, or the International duty we owo to Spain. Until we face the contingencies suggested, or the situation Is by other Incidents Impel a tlvely changed, we should continue In the lino of conduct heretofore pursued, thus In all circumstances exhibiting our obedi ence to tho requirements of public law nnd our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position wo occupy In the fam ily of nations. A contemplation of emorgencles that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless dlregard of present duty or even an unduo stimulation and lll-tlmed ex pression of feeling. But I have deemed It not amiss to remind the congress that n time may nrrlve when a correct policy and care for our Interests, as well as a regard for the interests of other nations nnd their citizens, Joined by considerations of hu manity nnd a deslro to see a rich and fer tile country, Intimately related to us, sav ed from complete devastation, will con strain our government to such actions. The Venezuelan Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to bo a matter of difference be tween Groat Britain and, tho United States, their respective governments hav ing agreed upon tho substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela, submitting the whole contro versy to arbitration. Tho provisions of the treaty aro so eminently Just and fair that tho assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated. Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are advanced and promise to reach a success ful consummation at an early date. The schemo of examining applicants for cer tain consulnr positions to test their comp etency and fitness, adopted undor nn exe cutive order Issued on the 20th day of Sep tember, 1895, hns fully demonstrated the usefulness of this Innovation. In connec tion with this plan of examination, pro motions and transfers of deserving in cumbents have been quite extensively mode, with excellent results, Coninlur System. Seven woro appointed to places not In cluded In the order of September 20, 1S95, and four appointments, as ahovo stated, Involved no change of Incumbency. Tho Inspection of consular otlloes, pro vided for by an appropriation for that pur poso at the loat session of tho congress, has been productlvo of such wholesome ef fects that I hope this Important work will In the futuro bo continued. I know of nothing that can bo done with the samo slight expense so improving to the service. I desire to repent tho recommendation con tained in my last annual messago.in favor of provldlng-.at public oxpenso.ofllolal resi dences for our ambassadors and minis ters at foreign capitals. Receipts and Expenses. Tho secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, tho receipts of the government from all sources amounted to $409,476,4()8.78. Pur tng tho samo period Its expenditures werp $434,678,654.43, thq excess of exponditurea over receipts thus amounting? to X25.2Q3. 216.70. The ordinary, expenditures during the xeoc were tl.015.S52.Zl less than duruu the preceding fiscal yeuT.
