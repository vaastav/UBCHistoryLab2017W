The Newspaper that Tells What It Knows UNITED PRESS ASSOCIATION SERVICE ROOSEVELT ROARS Consigns Newspaper to Liars' Limbo and Wants Government to Prosecute It. * . WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—Asking the government to prosecute Joseph Pulitzer and the publishers of the New York World for libel upon the good name of the United States in connection with the charges of fraud in the purchase of the Panama canal, Roosevelt today sent a 'igorously worded special message to congress. He also transmitted all the records and papers concerning the deal. The message says: "In view of the constant reiteration and association of corrupt action with the government in the acquisition of the canal, I deem it wise to submit to congress all the information I have. The stories were first brought to my attention as published in the Indianapolis News. The stories are scurrilous, libelous and false." The message continues: "Delavan Smith, publisher of the Indianapolis News, shelters him self behind the excuse that he ac cepted the statements of the World. The real offender is Pullt ser. The great Injury is in the blackening of the good name of the American people. It should not be left for a private citizen to sue Pulitzer, but he should be prosecuted for libel by the govern ment. It is idle to say that the known character of Pulitzer and his pa per Is such that the statements in the paper should be believed by nobody, but unfortunately there are thousands who believe state ments they see printed, even though they appear in Pulitzer's paper. Congressmen are actually Induced to Introduce resolutions with reference to these charges." The president then quoted tho specific charges as published, bringing In the names of Charles Taft, brother of the president elect, and Douglas Robinson, 

MERRITT FILES CHARGES AGAINST JACK O'BRIEN Say* City Commissioner Is Playing Politics to Hold His Job. Definite ehargeß Involving City Commissioner O'Brien in political manipulation of city crematory management are filed today by A. W. Merritt, superintendent, whom Mayor Moore is trying to depose. Here is what Merritt tells the mayor and finance committee in his written statement: Merrltt's statement follows: "Learning, unofficially, that your honorable body has been appointed to investigate the crematory de partment, I beg to submit the fol lowing, so that you may, it possi ble, in your recommendation, recti fy the mistakes made In the early stages of the department and make it possible for whoever is responsi ble for the success of the depart ment to make good. As it 1b now, it seems to be a question just who Is responsible for the success or nonsuccess of the department. "If the board of public works is responsible they should have the power to appoint and discharge the superintendent and all other em ployes. "If, the superintendent is re sponsible he should have the power to select and discharge all employes. "Some one man must be the Judge of the competency or incom petency of all men employed in the department, and if in his opinion any employe is not working for the Interest of the department it should be his duty to dlschurge him, regardless of who his friend Is. "Referring particularly to the appointment of the present assist ant superintendent will say that nominally the assistant superinten dent Is appointed by the superin tendent with the consent of the Q»ayor and board of public works. Mr. Lockhart was never my choice, and in justice to the mayor, not his. After I had repeatedly refused to appoint Mr. Lockhart assistant superintendent, giving my reasons that he had told me personally that he and others associated with him were going to put the department out of business inside of a year, Mr. O'Brien came to me, seeming ly very much Interested In the suc cess of the department, aud asked brother in law of the president. The message continued: "These statements sometimes occurred in the editorial columns and sometimes in the news col umns. They are false in every particular from beginning to end. The wickedness of the slanders are surpassed only by their fatuity. The inventor of the Taft story evi dently supposed that Taft was sec retary of war during some period of the Panama purchase. He did not become secretary until after the transaction was closed. The stories consist of strong, infamous libels. In form, they are in part libels on individuals, Robinson and Taft, for Instance; in fact, they are libels upon the government. It Is a high national duty to bring Pulitzer, who only seeks to connect government with wrong doings of the basest, to justice. The attorney general is consider ing the form of prosecution." The remainder of the message is devoted to a description of the method of the purchase of the canal. me to appoint Mr. as as sistant superintendent as a person al favor to him, as he must have the support of Mr. Lockhart's friend in council to retain his po litical situation. He further stated that if Mr. l.ockhart did not prove satisfactory he would see that he was removed any time that I said the word. I have said the word several times, giving each time a new cause, any of which should have been sufficient, but was al ways told that we could not let him go because we must have the sup port of Mr. lxickhart's council manic friend for something. "The first six months of the op eration of tills department I was not only left nlone as to its man agement but had considerable trouble in securing the necessary supplies and the department seem ed to be considered a joke by cer tain officials. Immediately upon the filing of the report which show ed a profit much interest was shown by these same officials and the old garbage men who were bought out by the city. At this time I was called into Mr. O'Brien's of fice and requested to consult with him every morning with regard to the details of the department. He seemed to be very much pleased with the showing, always assured me that he was with me and al ways sorry that conditions were such that we could not get rid of Mr. iAJckhart. 1 enclose copy of an (Continued on page 2)

SPOKANE, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1908 LABORING IN WANT CHANGE TO IRK AND PAY FOR WHAT THEY GET The meeting at All Saints par ish house last night for the pur pose of devising ways and means of taking care of the unemployed developed a mass of opinion and strong utterance, but no practical method of handling the question was discovered. A resolution was passed asking the city" council to encourage all public improvement work possible, and a committee appointed to interest other civic clubs in the problem. The attitude of the men inter ested on the workingmen's side of the proposition was distinctly In opposition to any charity relief measures. What they wanted was work and respectable wages under self respecting conditions. The idle transients willing to work for food and bed, of which the city has been represented to be filled, were not represented, although the In dustrial Workers' speakers who were present strongly befriended the cause of the "tramp," meaning the man who is traveling about from place to place, homeless and in search of work. There was no chance for misun derstanding as to the terms on which work was wanted. They de manded it at the rate of union pay and union hours. Thomas Maloney Cited the city authorities to means by which the greater part of resi dent labor could be taken care of —the plan of day labor on public work and preference in employ ment to men with homes and fami lies. This Is the solution that ap pears to command least attention at the city hall. Mr. Maloney said: "If day labor were In vogue to day it would take care of 75 per cent of the unemployed. The building of the new four mile water main should be by day labor at decent wages. The work could be apportioned according to a man's needs. We want no soup house proposition. It would only attract people who do not care to labor, but only eke out an exist ence. The city council has power to appropriate money for any pur pose. This new water main could be built at a profit to he city." It was the first demonstration of the kind ever seen In Spokane. James Wilson of the Industrial Workers of the World. J. H. Walsh X J. Tamblin and others did not mince their words. W. I). Roberts, a capitalist, and one of the opposition to grade separation, which would have fur nished employment to thousands this winter, was a prominent fig ure at the meeting.
