WESTERN CANADA FARMER SECURES WORLD'S PRIZE FOR WHEAT A ROSTHERN, SASK., FARMER THE LUCKY WINNER. Sir Thomas Shaughnessy of the Ca nadian Pacific Railway offered $1,000 In gold as a prize for the best 100 lbs. of wheat, grown, on the American con- I tinent, to be competed for at the re cent Land Show in New York. In making the competition open, the donor of this handsome prize showed bis belief in the superiority of Ca nadian wheat lands, by throwing tho contest open to farmers of all Amer lea, both United States and Canada, The United States railways were by no means anxious to have tho Ca nadian railways represented at the show and a New York paper comment ing on the results of the competitions says that they were not to be blamed, as the Canadians captured the most I Important prize of the show. The winner of this big wheat prize wjs Mr. Seager Wheeler of Rostliern, Saskatchewan, and its winning has brought a great deal of credit on the district. The winning wheat was the Marquis variety, and received no more attention from Mr. Wheeler than his other grain, but he is a very particu lar farmer. His farm is one of the cleanest and best kept in the Ros thern district, and this year he won first prize in a good farm competition which included every feature of farm ing and every part of the farm. Last •winter Wheeler was a prize winner at the provincial seed fair in Regina. Wheeler is a firm believer in sow ing clean seed of the best quality pro curable, consequently his grain is much sought after by the best far mers for seed purposes. Wheeler is an Englishman. He is a pioneer of Rosthern, coming here fif teen years ago. In the last six years he has done much experimenting, par ticularly in wheat varieties. His farm resembles an experimental farm. A long driveway, lined on both sides with trees, leads to a modest house, the home of Wheeler, a modest, unas suming man with the appearance of a student rather than a man engaged in commercial pursuits. There are now no free homesteads to be had in this district, and farm lands are worth from $20 to $40 per acre, which a few years ago were se cured by their present owners, either as a free gift or purchased at from $5 to $8 per acre. It is not many miles from Rosthern, where the farmer lives, who secured the first prize for wheat last year at the National Corn Exposition at Co lumbus and West of Rosthern, about 150 miles, lives Messrs. Hill and Son, who won the Colorado Silver Trophy, valued at $1,500, for the best peck of oats, also awarded at the National Corn Show at Columbus in 1910. Not contented with the high honors obtained in its wheat, Canada again stepped forward into the show ring, and carried off the Stillwell trophy and $1,000 for the best potatoes on the continent. This time the winner was a British Columbia man, Mr. Asahel Smith, the "Potato King," of that province. The exhibit consisted of one hundred and one varieties drawn from all parts of the province aggregating in weight one and a half tons. At the recent Dry Farming Con gress, held at Colorado Springs, and at which time it was decided to hold the next Congress at I^ethbridge, in 1912, the Province of Alberta made a wonderful showing of grains, grasses and vegetables. "At the Congress, Alberta got more prizes and trophies, ten to one, than any state of the Union," said Mr. Hotchldss to the Edmonton Bulletin. "We brought back all but the build ing with us, and they offered us that, saying we might as well take all that was going. We would have brought It along, too, if we had had a flat car to put it on. Alberta captured nearly 50 first prizes, 20 seconds, 3 thirds, 9 •cups, 40 medals, 50 ribbons and 2 sweepstakes. The grand sweepstake prize, for the best exhibit by state or province, a magnificent silver cup, was presented to us with much cere mony at a. reception to the Canadians In the Empress hotel. The presenta tion was made by Prof. Olin, chair man of the judging committee, and the cup was received on behalf of the province by the Hon. Duncan Mar shall. A Born Quibbler.

Important General Movement for Broader Arbitration On Part of Powers is Noted—Mexican War Dis cussed—Merchant Marine Needed. Washington, Dec. 7.—Tho flrst of Presi dent Tat't's promised special messages was read in congress today. It deals en tirely with foreign affairs. The message In part follows: The relations of the United States with other countries have continued during: the past twelve months upon a basis of the usual good will and friendly Intercourse. Arbitration. The year Just passed marks an im portant general movement on the part of the powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of international dis putes by arbitration rather than by war. and In response to a widespread demand for an advance in that direction on the part of the people of the United States and of Great Britain and of France, now arbitration treaties were negotiated last spring with Great Britain and France, the terms of which were designed, as expressed in the preamble of these treat ies, to extend the soopf* and obligations of the policy of arbitration adopted In our present treaties with those governments. To pave the way for this treaty with the United States, Great Britain negotiated an important modification In its alliance with Japan and the French government also expedited the negotiations with sig nal good will. The new treaties have been submitted to the senate and are awaiting its advice and consent to tneir ratification. All the essentials of these important treaties have long been known, and It is my earnest hope that they win receive prompt and favorable action. Claim of Alsop & Co. Settled. I am glad to report that on July last the American claim of Alsop & Co. against the government of Chile was finally disposed of by the decision or his Britannic majesty George V., to whom, as amiable compositeur, the matter had been referred for determination. His majesty made an award of nearly $1,000, 000 to the claimants, which was promptly paid by Chile. The settlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations between the republic of Chile and the United States the only question which for two decades had giv en the two foreign offices any serious concern and makes possible the unob structed development of the relations of friendship which It has been the aim of this government in every possible way to further and cultivate. Arbitrations. In further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the princi ple of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation, I am happy to advert to the part of the United States in faciliating amicable settlement of dis putes which menaced the peace between Panama and Costa Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican republic. Since the date of their independence, Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek ing a solution of a boundary dispute, which came as a heritage from Colombia to the new republic of Pannnia, upon its beginning life as an independent na tion. In January, 1910, at the request of both governments the agents represent ing them met in conference at the depart ment of state and subsequently conclud ed a protocol submitting this long-pend ing controversy to the arbitral judgment of the chief justice of the United States, who consented to act in this capacity. A boundary commission, according to the international agreement, has now been appointed, and it is expected that the_ ar guments will shortly proceed and that this long-standing dispute will be honor ably and satisfactorily terminated. Again, a few months ago it appeared that the Dominican republic and Haiti I were about to enter upon hostilities be cause of complications growing out of an I acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had failed to solve. The government of the United States, by a friendly interposition of good offices, succeeded in prevailing upon the parties to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Mexico. The recent political events in Mexico received attention from this government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation created along our south ern border and the necessity for taking measures properly to safeguard Ameri can interests. The government of the United States, in its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the so-called neutrality statutes of the federal government, issued directions to tho appropriate officers to exercise a dill gent and vigilant regard for the require ments of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual armed conflict ex isted, there was no official recognition of belligerency involving the technical neu trality obligations of International law. On the 6th of March last, in the ab sence of the secretary of state, I had a personal interview with Mr. Wilson, the ambassador of the United States to Mex ico, in which he reported to me that the conditions in Mexico were much more critical than the press dispatches dis closed that President Diaz was on a vol cano of popular uprising that the small outbreaks which had occurred were only svmptomatic of the whole condition that a very large per cent, of the people were in sympathy with the insurrection: that a eeneral explosion was probable at any time, in which case he feared that the 440,000 or more American residents in Mexico might be assailed, and that the very large American investments might be injured or destroyed. After a conference with the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy, I thought it wise to assemble an army division of full strength at San Antonio, Tex a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of infantry in the IjOS Angeles district of southern Call fornia together with a squadron of bat tleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a small squadron of ships at San Diego. At the same time through our representative at the City of Mexico 1 expressed to President Diaz the hope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures as to these mili tary maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance which should cause concern to his government. I am more than happy to here record the fact that all apprehensions as to the effect of the presence of so large a mili tary force In Texas proved groundless no disturbances occurred. From time to time communications were received from Ambassador Tvilson, who had returned to Mexico, confirming the view that the massing of American troops in the neighborhood had had good The insurrection continued and resulted in engagements between the regular Mexican troops and the insurgents, and this along the border, so that in several Instances bullets from the contending forces struck American citizens engaged In their lawful occupations on American soil. Proper protests were made against these invasions of American rights to the Mexican authorities. The presence of a large military ana naval force available for prompt action, near the Mexican border, proved to be the most fortunate under the somewhat :rylng conditions presented by this inva iion of American rights. The policy and action of this govern ment were based upon an earnest friend iness for the Mexican people as a whole, and it is a matter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all factions in Mexico and of Blncere Works Splendidly. -How do you like your Ulckel Urst' phone?"

There is no greater tyrant than the '.dealist who, thinking himself to be living in the light of truth, seeks, willy-nilly, to impose his idealism on Mhersj—Kxcbaage. friendship for the neighboring nation, without regard for party allegiance, has been generally recognized and lias re sulted in an even closer and more sym pathetic understanding between the two republics and a warmer regard one for the other. Action to suppress violence and restore tranquility throughout the Mexican republic was of peculiar inter est to this government, in that It con cerned the safeguarding of American life and property In thut country. On May 25, 1911. President £)iaz resigned. Senor de la Barra was ch*sen provisional presi dent. Elections for president and vice president were thereafter held through out the republic, and Senor Kranciscn I. Madero was formally declared elected on October lf, to the ch4ef magistracy. On November 6 President Madero entered upon the duties »»f 1j#h office. Honduras and Nicaragua Treaties Proposed. As to the situation in Central America, I have taken occasion in the past to em phasize most strongly the importance that should be attributed to the consumma tion of the conventions between the re publics of Nicaragua and of Honduras and this country, and I again earnestly recommend that the necessary advice and consent of the senate be accorded to these treaties, which will make It possi ble for these Central American repub lics to enter upon an era of genuine eco nomic national development. Our relations with th»» Republic of Panama, peculiarly important, due to mu tual obligations and the vast interests created by the canal, have continued in the usual friendly manner, and we have been glad to make appropriate expres sion of our attitude of sympathetic In terest in the endeavors of our neighbor 1n undertaking the development of the rich resources of the country. The Chinese Loans. The past year has been marked !n our relations with China by the conclusion of two important international loans, one for the construction of the Hukuang rail ways. the other for the carrying out of the currency reform to which China was pledged, by treaties with the United States. Great Britain and Japan, of which mention was made In my last an nual message. Especially important at the present, when the ancient Chinese empire is shak en by civil war Incidental to its awaken ing to the many IniSuences and activity of inoderization. are %he co-operative pol icy of good understanding which has been fostered by the International projects re ferred to above ami the general sym pathy of view anioictr all the powers in terested in the far New Japarrese Treaty. The treaty of commerce and navigation between the TTnited States and Japan, signed in 1K94. woulA by a strict inter pretation of its provisions have terminat ed on July 17. 1012. Japan's general treaties with the other powers, however, terminated in 1911. anfl the Japanese gov ernment expressed an earnest desire to conduct the negotiations for a new treaty with the United States simultaneously with its negotiations with the other pow ers. There were a number of important questions involved in the treaty, includ ing the immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff and tho right of Americans to hold real estate in Japan. The United States consented to waive all technicalities and to enter at once upon negotiations for a new treaty on the un derstanding that there should be a con tinuance throughout the llfo of the treaty of the same effective measures for the restriction of Immigration of laborers to American territory which had been in operation with entire satisfaction to both governments since 1W8. The Japanese government accepted this basis of nego tiation. and a new treaty was quickly concluded, resulting in a highly satisfac tory settlement of the other questions re ferred to. Europe and the Near East. In Europe and the near east, during the past twelve-month, there has been at times considerable political unrest. The Moroccan question, which for some months was the cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached a stage at which it need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman empire was occupied for a period by strife in Al bania and is now at war with Italy. In Greece and the Balkan countries the disquieting potentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has been the scene of a long Internal strug gle. These conditions have been the cause of uneasiness In European diplo macy, but thus far without direct politi cal concern to the United States. In the war which unhappily exists be tween Italy and Turkey this government has no direct political Interest, and I took occasion at the suitable time to Is sue a proclamation of neutrality in that conflict. At the same time all necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal interests of American citizens and organizations in so far as affected by the war. In spite of the attendant economic un certainties and detriments to commerce, the United States has gained markedly in Its commercial standing with certain of the nations of the near east. Coronation of King George V. The 22d of June of the present year marked the coronation of his Britannic majesty. King George V. In honor of this auspicious occasion I sent a special embassy to London. The courteous and cordial welcome extended to this gov ernment's representatives by his majesty and the people of Great Britain has fur ther emphasized the strong bonds of friendship happily existing between the two nations. Settlement of Differences With Great Britain. As the result of a determined effort on the part of both Great Britain and the United States to settle all of their out standing differences a number of treat ies have been entered into between the two countries In recent years, by which nearly all of the unsettled questions be tween them of any importance have been adjusted by agrement or arrangement:? made for their settlement by arbitration. Recognition of Portuguese Republic. The National Constituent assembly, reg ularly elccted by the vote of the Portu guese people, having on June 19 last unanimously proclaimed a republican gov ernment, the official recognition of the government of the United States was given to the new republic In the after noon of the same day. International Conventions and Confer ences. The supplementary protocol to The Hague convention for the establishment of an International prize court, mentioned In my last annual message, embodying stipulations providing for an alternative procudure which wov:3 remove the con stitutional objection that part of The Hague convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, has received the signature of the governments parties to the original convention and has been ratified by the government of the United States, togeth er with the prize court convention. The deposit of the ratifications with the government of the Netherlands awaits action by the powers on the dec laration, signed at London on February A Trying Role. -Poor fellow.

Fur-Seal Treaty. The fur-seal controversy, which for ne:irly twenty-five years has been the source of serious friction between the United States nnd the powers bordering upon the north Pacific ocean, whose sub jects have been pcvmitt'Ml to engage In pehigic sealing ag.»':i.--: the fur-seal herds 1 in- th'ir hnvtll:-.: croutuls within the Inrlsiiietion of the l":i ted States, has at Wst hern' satlyfaeiorl)v juljusted by the conclusion of the pacific sealing convention entered into between the United States, Grert Britain, .Japan and UuMa on the seve.-.th of July last. Th»* attention of congress is especially called to the ncces.dtv for legislation on the pnrt of the United States for the pur pose of fulfilling the obligations assumed under this convention, to which the sen ate gave Its advice nnd consent on the twenty-fourth day of July last. International Opium Commission. In a special message transmitted to tho congress on the seventh of January. 1911, in which I concurred in the recommenda tions made by the secretary of state In regard to certain needful legislation for the control of our interstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drugs. 1 quoted from my annual mes sage of December 7, 1909, in which an nounced that the results of the Interna tional Opium commission held at Shang hai in February. 1909. at the Invitation of the United States, had been laid before this government: that the report of that commission showed that China was mak ing remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradication of the opium evil that the Interested govern ments had not permitted their commer cial interests to prevent their co-opera tion In this reform: and. as a result of collateral investigations of the opium oiiestion In this country. I reeoinmendcd that the manufacture, sale and use of opium in the United States should be more rigorously controlled bv legislation. Prior to that time and in continuation of the policy of this government to se cure the co-operation of the interested nation-*, the United States proposed an International opium conference with full powers for the purpose of clothing with the force of international law tlie reso lutions adopted by the above-mentioned commission, together with their essen tial corollories. The other powers con cerned cordially responded to the pro posal of this government, nnd. I am glad to be able to announce, renresentatives of all the powers assembled in conference at The Hague on the first of this month Foreign Trade Relations of the United States. In my last annual message I referred to the tariff negotiations of the depart ment of state with foreign countries In connection with the application, by a se rles of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the United States to importa tions from the several countries, and I stated that, in Its general operation, sec tion 2 of the new tariff law had proved a guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there were, unfortunate ly. instances where foreign governments d^alt arbitrarily with American interests within their jurisdiction in a manner in Jurlous and inequitable. During the past year some instances of discriminatory treatment have been removed, but I re- I gret to say that there remain a few cases of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the TTnited States. While none of these Instances now appears to amount to undue discrimination in tho sense of section 2 of the tariff law of August 5, 1909, they are all exceptions to that complete degree of equality of tar iff treatment that the department of state has consistently sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. While the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 190!) has been amply Justl fled by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new, undue dis criminations against American commerce, it is believed that the time has come for tiie amendment of this feature of the law in such way as to provide a graduated mentis of meeting varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of American commerce in foreign countries as well as to protect the financial Interests abroad of American citizens against arbitrary and injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either leg islative or administrative measures. It would seem desirable that the maxi mum tariff of the United States should embrace within its purview the free list, which is not the case at the present time. In order that It might have reasonable significance to the governments of those countries from which the importations into the United States are confined vlr ttially to articles on the free list. The fiscal year ended June 30. 1911. shows great progress 1n the development of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the highest record of exports of American products to foreign coun tries. the valuation being in excess of $2.wo.cno.000. These exports showed a gain over the preceding year of more than SmOOA.OOO. Crying Need for American Merchant Marine. I need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be built up an American merchant marine. This is nec essarv to assure favorable transporta tion facilities to our great ocean-borne commerce as well as to supplement the navy with an adequate reserve of ships and men. It would have the economic ad vantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid foreign shipping for carrving American goods. All the great commercial nations pay heavy subsidies to their merchant marine, so that it is obvious that without some wise aid from the congress the United States must lag behind in the matter of merchant marine In its present anomalous position. Legislation to facilitate the extension of American banks to foreign countries Is another matter in which our foreign trade needs assistance. With these factors and the continuance of the foreign-service established ("depart mental. diplomatic and consular) upon the high plane where it has been placed by the recent rearoganizatlon tills gov ernment would be abreast of the times in fostering the interests of its foreign trade, and the rest must be left to the energy and enterprise of our business men. Improvement of the Foreign Service. The entire foreign-service organization is being Improved and developed with especial regard to the requirements of the commercial interests of the country. The rapid growth of our foreign trade makes it of the utmost Importance that governmental agencies through which that trade Is to be aided and protected should possess a high degree of effi ciency. Not only should the foreign rep resentatives be maintained upon a gen erous scale In so far as salaries and es tablishments are concerned, but the se lection and advancement of officers should be definitely and permanently reg ulated bv law, so that the service shall not fail to attract men of high character and ability. The experience of the past few years with a partial application of civil service rules to the dipulomatic and consular service leaves no doubt in my mind of the wisdom of a wider and more permanent extension of those principles to both branches of the foreign service. I therefore again commend to the fa vorable action of the congress the enact ment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the principles em bodied in section 17o3 of the Revised Stat utes of the United States. In the civil service act of January 16, 1883. and the executive orders of June 27, 1906, and of I November 26. 1909. In Its consideration of this important subject. I desire to recall to the attention of the congress the very favorable report made on the Lowden bill for the improvement of the foreign service by the foreign affairs committee of the bouse of repre sentatives. Available statistics show thut the strictness with which the merit sys tem has ben applied to the foreign serv ice during recent years and the absolute non-partisan selection of consuls and diplomatic service secretaries who indeed I far from being selected with any view to political consideration have actually been chosen to a disproportionate extent from states which would have been un represented in the foreign service under the system wlhch it is to be hoped is now permanently obsolete. Some legislation for the perpetuation of the present sys tem of examinations and promotions upon merit and efficiency would be of greatest value to our commercial ana internation al interests.
