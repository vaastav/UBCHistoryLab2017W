Inasmuch as there lias already been an Indian summer and also an Indian I fall In these parts, In all reasonable Bess the present weather conditions are worthy of belns; styled an Indian One of the horrible results of miscegenation- has occurred In Topeka. !A white woman, the legal wife of a negro. Is dead, evidently having: taken her own life. This catastrophe should not be without Its lesson. Important if true. It Is reported that the members of congress are generally In the best of humor and good feeling' at the beginning of the present session. If they'll only keep that way much good work may be expected from them. The necessity of President Roosevelt sending an Illustrated message to con gress Is not patent. He is one of the few prominent men in the world who never mince words and whose argu ments need no diagrams, unless it is the possible exception of those he cares to make on woman suffrage. Governor Johnson of Minnesota may be classed among the optimistic Democrats. He does not believe that the leaders of the Democratic party ' were cast down by defeat. This is as suredly true of Mr. Bryan, who is willing to run for the presidency again if the "conditions," whatever that may be, warrant it. that official robbery has been the ruination of that land, one of the world's most favored isles. He says that the' military corruption whicn has prevailed In the country has brouH-ht bee-e-arv to the people. He declares that thievery runs riot In all ranks and the late wife of the de posed president. Nord Alexis, was the prime grafter in the earth's chief graftland. If only one-half of the things that Mr. Bonsai writes about concerning the way the affairs of Haytl have been mismanaged were true, and doubtless all of the things he says are the exact truth, it is no wonder that there is a revolution of some sort in Haytl every other minute. 

SCHOOL. BOOKS. Resolutions are pending before the local board of education which will probably be adopted at a future meet ing and which will place the board on record as favoring a repeal of the present state text book law and the enacting of one in its place that will provide for the state publication of text books to be manu factured at the state printing plant. The members of the Topeka board of education do not think the present text books in use throughout Kansas meet the needs of the public schools. That they have been of this belief for some time has been plainly apparent to the parents of school children In this city who have beencompelled to provide them with a set of school books as adopted by the state text book commission and also with a set of supplemental book covering the same studies which the local board of education has deemed necessary. And perhaps if the school books- were printed by the state the same condition of affairs would prevail. The agitation which has been going on for the printing of the school books by the state has not taken the form so much of dissatisfaction with the books which have been selected by the state text book com mission as with the price which is charged for them. The principal argument in favor of the state print ing of school books has" been to the effect that if this plan were indulged in the pupils in the schools would not have to pay near as much for the same class of books as they are now compelled to pay because of as members of the American political and Industrial system. The senate has so far inexcusably resisted the efforts of the administration and the house of representatives to deal equitably with the Filipino producer. It Is time for more enlightened and generous coun sels to prevail." 

JOURNAL ENTRIES KANSAS COMMENT Some actors must get a lot of sat isfaction these days over the fact that eggs are so expensive. Many an individual who has the build of a man fails to come near living up to his specifications. ' Probably it is technically correct In speaking of time to say that it is never more than 12 o'clock. a When a heavyweight Indulges In horseback riding to take off fat he is generally successful as far as the horse is concerned. Perhaps it's all right to urge persons to take an interest in their work but there certainly is a good deal of work that Is decidedly uninteresting. J A YHA WKER JOTS The Hutchinson News thinks that "In the Good Old (Indian) Summer Time" is likely to become a favorite air in Kansas. There is musip in the air around Hutchinson these days but it is in a sad and mournful strain. The Hutchin son concert band has disbanded. Here's the right kind of a newspaper slogan. Charles Garten says his paper at Nickerson will not be bound by party ties nor controlled by any faction. As for the print paper "famine," which the manufacturers predict, the Ottawa Herald says "The prophecy will be fulfilled this way: There won't be a tamine, but the price will go up. Lawrence has something new, or more properly speaking, decidedly old, to marvel at. The skeleton of a prehis toric horse, with three toes on each leg in place of a hoof has been mount ed in the university museum. From the temper of the people as ex pressed through the columns of the Great Bend newspapers something will happen soon if the Santa Fe does not put up a new station in that town. While they're about It the Great Bend ers might start an agitation for a union the J depot to serve as a station for all the ranroaas wnicn it is oenevea win eveni- An agitation has been started by the New York Chamber of Commerce for the appointment of a state com mission to make another examination of the conditions now surrounding the great life insurance companies of the country which are domiciled in the Empire state. Surely they haven't gone wrong again? "Fashion note: Parisian dressmak ers having developed what is known as the straight front In dress are now bending their energies, or rather their customers bodies, to a straight back. This new style, straight in front and back, gives a woman's body the sem blance of a tube. It will probably be popular because it is a new style, but surely not for any continued period. Too much attention to nonreliglous problems, wrong methods in handling boys in Sunday schools, wrong finan cial systems, materialistic ideals and retention of unfit members are among the causes given for the absence of men from the churches by the Rev. John A. Earl, one of Chicago's promi nent Baptist ministers. In a recent sermon. And there is a good deal of truth In his conclusions. Dr. Lyman Abbott, who is to be Mr. Roosevelt's boss when he becomes an associate editor on the staff of the Outlook, has come to the defense of football In a stirring fashion. "I do not know enough about football," he aid recently In a sermon delivered at Tale, "to know whether there are more deaths and accidents than there onght to be in the game, but I -do know that real courage can not be developed without danger, and if real courage Is developed on the football field, the sacrifice is worth the peril." When the rulers of one country visit another they are generally greet ed most effusively and given the best sort of a time. But that is evidently not to be the case with Mr. Castro, the dictator of Venezuela. He is not to be permitted to even land on French soil until he has . formally apologized to France for the expulsion of one of her representatives from Venezuela some time ago and until he makes arrangements for the immedi ate payment of some old debts that Venezuela owes to France. This is Just the way that Castro should be treated. the state printing plant a commis sion of some sort would have to be en trusted with the selection of the books that will be printed for the use of the school children. In all like lihood expert educators would have to be engaged to prepare certain Of the text books for state printing for most of the school books extant In the country are protected by copyright. So it is reasonable to suppose that if the state did engage In the print ing of its own books the selection of them that' might be made would not be agreeable to all of the school authorities in the state and especially to the Topeka school board which has shown such a great predilection In the past for selecting supplemental books to the regular ones adopted by the state authorities. But this prac tice, which is unnecessarily expensive to the parents of school children, can probably be stopped by the state If it undertakes to print the school books, by the insertion of a clause In the law which will prohibit local boards from adopting books supplemental to the ones chosen by the state authorities. Something exceeding novel as an In cident to a divorce, suit has been hit upon by a banker In Lynn, Mass. His wife has sued him for divorce and in order to provide himself with funds to pay the probable costs of the action the gentleman in th'e case has organ ized a subscription dance for which he is selling tickets at $5 per ticket. He expects to sell a thousand tickets. If his hopes are realized in this re gard he ought to be able to turn his divorce troubles into quite a remuner ative affair. The chances are that this scheme will become popular among folks of a certain class who hold the marriage relations lightly and are no more worried over a divorce than the least inconsequential thing on the face of the earth. Stephen Bonsai, a foreign corre spondent of the Chicago Tribune who la now In Haytl, writes to his paper JUSTICE TO FILIPINOS. "Secretary Wright's recent appear ance before the ways and means com mittee of the house of representatives to urge a reduction of the duty on Philip pine sugar indicates that fresh efforts are to be ' made by the administration to have Justice done to our far eastern dependency," says the New Tork Tri bune. "It is a manifest discrimination against that dependency that Hawaiian and Porto Rican sugars should be al lowed to enter the United States free of duty, and that 75 per cent of the Dingley tariff rates should be imposed on sugars produced in the Philippines. Congress has twice shown its intention to incorporate the Philippine archipela go Into our domestic system by extend ing the coastwise navigation laws to commerce between the Philippines and this country. It has been compelled twice to postpone the date on which the extension was to occur, because of the patent impropriety of holding the Philippines to be domestic territory for navigation purposes while excluding them as alien territory from the benefits of untrammeled commerce. "The last Philippine tariff bill, pass ed by the house of represenetatives by a tremendous majority, was defeated by Indirection in the senate. Philippines committee, a body strangely responsive to the exaggerated fears and represen tations' of domestic interests unduly alarmed at the threat of Philippine competlon in sugars and tobacco. So far as sugar is concerned, the impor tation from the Philippines is insignifi cant. At the present tariff rate it does not pay to send Philippine sugar to the United States, and the annual Philip pine production is only a fraction of the amount of sugar annually consum ed In the United States. The domestic sugar producers can hardly hope tc supply the domestic market. They are only holding their own in turning out one-fifth of thaotal supply, while the other four-fifths some from Hawaii and Porto Rico (free), from the Philippines (at 75 per cent of the Dingley duties), from Cuba (at 80 per cent of the Dingley duties), and from Brazil, Java, the West Indies, and Europe (at the full Dingley rates). The Cuban and alien sugars make the market price here, and so long as the Philippines do not send enough to crowd out the alien prod uct or diminish the importation of the Cuban product, they will not interfere with the status of the domestic indus try, any more than Hawaii and Porto Rico have so far Interfered with it. "It is certainly practicable to admit a certain proportion of the Philippine sugar product free, and thus give the Filipinos an assurance that we are ready to deal with them commercially machinations of the book trust. Surely if the legislature should de- ua"y run through mat place cide to have school books printed during th? past five years Z7 employes of the News iave married. Twelve of them were girls, and 15, boys. Both parties to five of the marriages w,ere from the News office. With a single exception these marriages have been happy, and in 14 instances babies have come to bless the union. The News claims it is the best mar riage agency in Reno county. Wichita likens herself as to a camel in comparison with Topeka, for during the month of November the liquor sales in the Peerless Princess as reported by the druggists aggregated about 4,700 while those in Topeka were more than 14,000. An explanation of this may be found in the fact that in all likelihood liquor may be obtained promiscuously in Wichita while in Topeka there is not a Joint of any kind running and any person who wants . liquor has to go to a drug store and sign up for it. There is but. one negro family in Cawker, that of Mrs. Luella Bowen, but it was very fortunate for the com munity that she lived here during the process of construction of the new school house. It was necessary to em ploy a number of colored men from Kansas Citv as helpers on the building, and had it not been for Mrs. Bowen it is probable that the workmen .would not have found a place to board while here. Under the circumstances every body was well taken care of, and the work on the building progressed with out delay. Cawker City Ledger. Tom Clayton has a man at his place shucking corn, Ben Walker, who for five days husked 110 bushels daily ana one day it made 130. Tom was telling about this in the club rooms the other nierht when Jake Miller told of a 11 vear-old boy who started out in the morning on John Woods place and got back in at 7 o'clock Wltn ii Dusneis, It may have been a man who got back at 11 o'clock with B bushels but any wav the way Jake told it he was a cornhusker. This started the talk about cornhusking and Chas. Allison who is some pumpkins himself when it comes to work, decided that he could throw corn out of a wagon by hand faster than any man could husk and throw it in. Reg Russell has a man on his place who he says can beat any man at the game ana cnarue sdoui decided to try him. The meeting broke up when some one told of a man who husked so fast for nine hours that he kept an ear of corn in the air all that time. Great Bend Item-Rustler. . 

GLOBE SIGHTS. ", From the Atchison Globe. It always amuses a woman to see a man fan himself. The poorer the family, the more romantic names given the children. No man would listen to you talk If he didn't know it was his turn next, Men and women who have been brought up as pets, are always dis agreeable. Women who want to marry should keep the fact quiet; men hate a hus band hunter. ' About the only satisfaction poorly married women have is that they are not old maids. An Atchison man thought he was marrying one' woman, but later found he had married three. A woman who can make root beer is as proud of it as . a man who can handlo a shotgun well. When the devil is finally caught, we have a strong suspicion that he will turn out to be a Man. Just before Christmas, a woman sits up late at nignt to maice inmgs ior her best man he won't wear. The women believe that If there Is anyone meaner than the woman who brings home bargains, and refuses to tell what she paid for them, they don't meet her on the average day s journey. Occasionally, I think of things not very creditable to humanity, and feel ashamed of myself for thinking of such things; and then I am startled, when reading, to discover that some other fellow has thought of it..too." Parson Twine. Aagood looking Atchison man, -lack ing in moral courage, is engaged to two different girls, and is having a great deal of trouble. He may finally be compelled to leave town, to -get out of the difficulty. He goes to see one girl one night, and the other girl the next, and is about worn out, in addition to his other trouble. The ex plosion will come when both girls in sist upon his coming to see them every night. 1 FORESTRY IN JAPAN. Just at the time when this country Is beginning to struggle with the problem of husbanding its forest resources, of protecting its mountain slopes, and of Improving the waterways, it is inter esting to know that the Japanese have successfully attacked the same prob lem, Defore the land suffered severely from the evil effects following de forestation. The far-sighted people of Nippon have foreseen the results of de struction of their extensive mountain forests, and have safeguarded them selves by placing all of these under government control. The practice of forestry has been car ried on in Japan for a longer time than in any other country. For 1.200 years the people of Japan have been planting and growing forests, with a success that has been little short of marvelous. Under careful management, the Jap anese forests yield very high financial returns. This high yield is only made possible by the close utilization of every bit of the tree so that scarcely a twig is wasted, and by the improve- ment of the growth of their forests by carefully conducted thinning and tend ing. The woods are first thinned at the age of thirteen years, and then every five years after, that up to the time of the final harvest, at 120 years. It was with the opening of the hith erto inaccessible mountain forests that the Japanese government became most Intensely interested in forestry. The mountains were still government land. so all that was necessary to protect them was to place proper restrictions on the sale and cutting of timber. This" was effected by declaring the forests on the steep slopes as reserved forests, In which the only cutting should be done under government direction. The forests on agricultural lands, not need ed for protection, are classed as avail able forests, and here the cutting is not so carefully restricted. Thus Japan has effectually prevented the stripping of her mountain slopes before any great damage has been done. In some districts, where the mountains are near the towns, the steep slopes have already been cleared, and this has resulted in floods and the washing down of the soil from the slopes on the farm lands. But these cases have been exceptional, and hav. merely served as a warning; which Japan has heeded before it was too late to prevent widespread destruction. Hutchinson Gazette. THE DIFFERENCE. The city government is a business proposition. That being true, the city government needs plain business treat ment. The treatment given it under the old system of ward councilmen se lected through the system provided by city politicians is not businesslike It Is political. The system proposed under the commission form provides for nonpartisan government by trustees or commissioners who would handle tne city's business Just as a business cor poration handles its business. It is the difference between business and poll- tics. Wichita Beacon. FROM OTHER PENS DYSPEPSIA ON THE RUN. The long and "bitter fight between the advocates and opponents of vege tarianism Is being fought out to scientific showdown: In the laboratories of Yale university; - and preliminary reports indicate ft" remarkable, and possibly a revolutionary advance in the science of dietetics. As a result of somewhat startling experiments. Prof. Chittenden announces that there is no limit to our power of producing organic substances by purely chemical synthesis. He has discovered the secret of separating the tissue build ing proteins of both flesh ana vege tables, and by artificial chemical means reproducing the various pro cesses of the stomach and assimilative organs. With such a perfect tool of investi gation, the mysteries of dietetics should soon be numbered with the problems solved. Not only will the conflicting pretensions of the vegetar ians and the flesh eaters be weighed In this new scientific balance, but a host of dietetic fads and fancies, from the gospel of buttermilk to the evangel of raw beef and cereals, will, by this new method, be put to the test of ex actness, and it Is a safe bet that a vast quantity of advertising matter will have to be rewritten. The forecast indicates dark and gloomy days ahead for dyspepsia. Washington Post. o REBATES AND MORALS. Twenty-five years ago there were no railroad tariffs. Every railroad man ager got what he could out of each cus tomer. The maxim current among rail road managers themselves was to charge "whatever, the traffic would bear.!' But that was simply a rule for getting the maximum rate. They also wanted the maximum volume of traffic. and to get that they would make any sort of concession that might be neces sary. Each shipment was a matter of bargaining. So far the Standard Oil was accus tomed years ago to drive sharp bar gains with the railroads that often forced competing oil concerns out of business, it was no worse than other shrewdly-managed shippers. But it is credibly asserted that the Standard Oil continued its practice of extorting con cessions from the railroads after the community began to make laws on the subject, and many of its contracts with the railroads seem injurious not only to the Standard's rivals, but to the railroad's shareholders, for which rea sonthere is some curiosity to know how the Standard managed to get such large favors, and the' commissioner of corporations charges the Standard with low and underhand methods of injuring the business of its rivals. These things account for the keen interest with which Mr. Rockefeller's examination is watched. Philadelphia Record. KEEPING YOUNgTaND OLD AGE. The continued youth of President Eliot of Harvard is one of the most striking and attractive things about him. He has shown none of-that ossi fication of intellect that so often ac companies old; age.- Within the last few months, for instance, he has made a plea for the commission form of city eovernment a comparatively new Idea and has announced his conversion to total abstinence after a lire time of moderate drinking. Ir. this capacity for keeping young he resembles such men as Gladstone and Leo 

XIII. , Unhappily, the number is small. The politician who will adopt a new cause when he is above 70 as Glad stone did in the case of Irish home rule, or the theologian who will keep in touch with modern tenaencies aner ne has nassed three score, as Leo did. Is rare. Fortunately modern research does not condemn men to aging in mind as thev do in body. It is believed that this distrust of men above maturity is a result of an attitude of mind rather than of physical decay. Kansas City Star. ' BRICKS OF STRAW.

Rivals of Panama Canal. Humboldt's report of ten practi cable canal routes across the Americas has never been fully Justified. We have not heard of anybody's seriously proposing to send the Lusitania from ocean to ocean by way of the Missis--sippl, the Missouri, a lock canal over the Rocky Mountains, and the Colum bia river, and while Peru maintains an Atlantic steamship commerce from a port on the Maranon there is no tl. ought, so far as we know, of uniting that river with the Pacific. Neverthe less, the number of transcontinental transportation routes, by rail or canal, is steadily being Increased, and bide fair, one of these days, considerably to surpass the ten of Humboldt's waterways.- The-last few weeks have seen two Important new lnteroceanlo routes completed sufficiently to be put into practical use, both of which are so near to our. own shores as to be of much practical Importance to our commerce, and as they both lie be tween our southern borders and the Isthmus of Panama they must be con sidered as In a measure rivals and competitors of the canal which we are pressing to completion. One of these is a railroad across Guatemala, a country which Is too often regarded as a negligible quantity, but which In fact is of vast wealth and occupies one of the most important strategic po sitions in the western hemisphere. De spite the prejudice which many feel against Guatemala and President Ca brera, this new road is to be reck oned with as an important commer cial and strategic factor. , We have hitherto repeatedly called attention to the Tehuantepec railroad. which follows a route once marked out by Hernando Cortez for an inter oceanic canal. It was a few weeks ago opened for freight and passenger business. It is much nearer to our gulf ports than la the Guatemala route, and Its Pacific terminus is also nearer to our Pacific ports, and It is very accessible to and from the Atlan tic by way of the Bahamas and the Florida channel. That these roads will prove to be important competitors of the Panama canal is not to be doubted. Of course they will not and cannot obviate the need of the canal, for, after' all, they are land routes, and persons and goods carried by them must debark and re embark from and upon ships, with all the Inconvenience involved in those processes, and, of course, they do not in any degree facilitate the transfer of vessels from one ocean to the other. We should be surprised, however, if they did not both secure and hold much patronage of a character to which rapidity of transit is supremely important," for It will, of course, al ways be much quicker to get from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific by way of Tehuantepec or even Guate mala than by way of Panama. But we shall also not expect to see such rivalry make Panama unprofitable. On the contrary, the increase of traf fic which the roads will facilitate will promote traffic on the canal as well, and" the world will see the time when all these and perhaps some additional interoceanic routes are busy to the full extent of their capacity.
