The postoffiee clerk is not getting a square deal. After he has prepared himself for a civil service examination and has secured his appointment, he usually commences work as a substitute with the prospect of occasional, tho not regular, employment. Even when he gets a regular position, he begins at a salary of $600 a year. Advances in pay of $100 a year are made, but do not come regularly. A postal clerk may work several years at $600 without an increase or he may have an increase annually until his wages amount to $1,000 or $1,100 a year. There is no certainty or regularity, however, about the increase and comparatively few reach the $1,000 or $1,100 figure. A great majority receive $900 or less and the advance to $900 or more only comes after years of service and when the clerks have become advanced in years and often have several persons de pendent upon them for their liivng. That this is very meager compensa tion for skilled work and years of ex perience, will be conceded and the in justice and hardship which it involves are made the more conspicuous by the fact that there has been practically no increase in the wages of the postoffiee clerks for twenty years. The present period of high prices and greatly in creased expense for all the necessities of life finds the postal clerk no better prepared to meet them than.he was twenty years ago. The result of this policy is to deprive the government of many of its most ef ficient men in the postal service. They can't afford to work for 'tingle Sam'') because he is not^illing'to pay them' nearly as much as they can,get in out side positions. The desertions of best men from the ranks of^ the postal clerks has become a matter so seriously affecting che ef ficiency of the department as to lead to a definite movement xra the part-of post- H4V* r^:m Carried

Therefore in the opinion of Commissioner Andrews re forestation is a proper function of the state. I is so recognized in Europe and especially in Germany, where near ly all the states do something. Saxony and Prussia take the lead with a re planting of about 60,000 acres annu ally. General Andrews calls attention to the fact that Minnesota has the so called Pillsbury forest reserve ojn which is a nursery containing half a million evergreen seedlings, which will be 3 years old next spring and ready for planting. The state also has the Burntside forest of 20,000 acres, on which in his opinion a nursery should be started. Reforesting is practically a sure crop, yielding 3 per cent com pound interest. The only real obstacle in the way of a crop is forest fires. The principal items in this kind of farm ing are the raising of seedlings in mar series, which cost the state a fraction of a cent apiece, replanting, which costs several dollars an acre and the preven tion of forest fires, which has not called for heavy appropriations up to date. Whether Minnesota shall take re spectable rank in forestry is then a matter for the legislature. I remains to be seen whether the legislators will take hold of the proposition with a de termination not only to make some money for the state, but to wipe out in part the stain that is on the credit of Minnesota as a state which ate tip in two generations what was meant for all time and which took no practical steps to repair the ravages done upon the bountiful work of nature. The opportunity and the duty are both consistent with good business policy. There is no objection to a vigorous for estry policy except the one that ap peals to individuals, that the crop is too far distant. But this objection, poor in the individual, has positively no bearing upon the state, which is a con tinuing body. Thursday Eveni *.**m ^HM^H -*W-'- 1?'-.*$V*''' THE JOURNAL masters of the country to secure favor ble action by congress on the proposi tion to increase salaries. A the St. Louis convention in October a commit tee of nine, including the postmasters of New York city, Chicago and Wash ington, were appointed to present the question to the congressional commit tee on postoffiee and postroads and urge more liberal appropriations for the sal aries of postoffiee clerks, not alone on the score of justice to the government's employees, but on the ground of abso lute necessity in order to maintain the efficiency of the service. The postoffiee clerk is in a peculiar relation to his employer. is pre vented by legulations of the depart ment from making an appeal to congress on his own account. For obvious rea sons the government cannot permit its employees to memorialize it and bring organized influence to bear for the pur pose of boosting salaries. Their only alternative is to leave the service if they don't like the.pay. Many of them, after devoting years of their lives to that kind of work, cannot readjust themselves, and those who can do so at the expense of the service. Mani festly both justice to. the employees and justice to the service require that reasonable, fair salaries be paid. Judged by the score the navy should have a larger appropriation. The Ton-Mile Policy Overdone. Transportation conditions in the northwest and the present inadequate service reflect not only an extreme of economy in operation, but illustrate very forcibly the old law of cumula tive effect. It is true that the ton-mile basis of railroad operative accounting did not originate here* for if railroad history is accurate, a man named Talmage, who held a position of importance with the Goulds, first presented it for considera tion. Yet nowhere has economy of operation been so persistently and suc cessfully followed as in this northwest, and nowhere have such records of low operation cost been made. The north west has taken every idea of worth and has improved upon it. I ability to grasp at a suggestion and all-around comprehensiveness, the northwest is first from the railroad viewpoint."'. I has sent out to other parts and still, retains for itself some of the' ablest railroad men of the country. There is a general striving now for new records and efforts are being made fverywhere to beat the ton-mile cost below that of some other road. There is a difference, however, according to country traversed, condition of roadbed and other things. A locomotive and crew that over some of the stone-bal lasted and double-tracked reads of the east could move a 2,000 or 2,200-ton train with comparative facility, would find itself badly handicapped farther west, where conditions differ. In the northwest even the elements enter into it in more important degree. Roadbeds are not so good, distances between points of supply and replenishment are greater, the water supply is not always of the best and other things too numer ous for partieularization enter into it. Yet it would appear that no one of them, nor even the collective difference, has stood against the policy of strict economy. Cumulative effect comes sooner or later. Three years ago there was occa sional complaint, two years ago com plaints were general, last year there was a lack of facilities afforded the shipper that put hardship upon him, and this year the situation is unbear able. No hardship, no complaints, no growth Of hostile sentiment have here-, tofore influenced the roads. I must have heen evident to the operating heads that the policy of economy ear-^ ried into another year would set the country back, but it would appear that this was not only ignored but that theV pressure for saving was ever greater. The ton-mile proposition is simple. If one locomotive and five men can or dinarily move fifty cars of freight, the earnings of the train, and of every car, and of the locomotive, and the tonnage in- total, and the cost of moving one ton one mile may be figured out pretty closely.in advance. Obviously, if six ty ears be put on, the increased ex-v pense in the way of additional coal con suifted, longer hours on duty and great er compensation for the crew,: addition al iv^earand tear on frhe rolling stock andstrainu.pon the roadbed^: are much more ^han^ offset by the additional rev enue derived from the moving of the greater tonnage on the one train or transportation unit. The liability of wrecks, property loss and damages for loss of life have also to be considered, but with all this it is still inimensely profitable, and the great railroad desideratum of the day is density of traffic and a low l^n-mile 'Hmt^TBB strains' theiroW^sttrVgr traffic along indefinitely, puts hardship upon employeess %ineti!ni|8 rr, and shippers, and ,work ...tbr^feS^" disadvantage, df ^holft'conjniunit^fs4 Btftjii^toet.an nual %pbrt ^ea ^edlit':a^oie's: |o",the' mani^men|ia||d Mrger, Profits. io ]t\^e stqckhuldex,i', if: |ife vfcon-jnile. aost /has been "poundecl'dpwn by", even* a s&all fraction: -^"^i How far' can such a policy consist ently be carried? I there not a duty luc the country from the railroad and are there not certain consictera|ibii| as to adequate service that the railroad is bound to give attention tp These are questions never before raised and .the northwest has raised them. The interstate commerce com mission will probably gather some evi dence along these iines and it may be that the ..question of how far a railroad by practice of extreme econoniy may put a handicap upon a country will yet be debated in the halls of ..congress. Of all the kinds of. cabinet members Cortelyou is the most kinds. The Japanese on the Coast. The determination of the federal au thorities to have a judicial decision of the legality of the San Francisco segregation of the Japanese in the schools will probably lead to a solu tion of the whole difficulty. No one can reasonably blame parents for ob jecting to the presence of Japanese adults in the same schools with their children. There are comparatively few Japanese minors in newcomers are mostly young men who are seeking their fortunes and a west ern education. As the quickest and best way to learn English many of them attend the public schqOls. The decision to separate these adults from the children and require them to attend separate schools would have been unas sailable, if the school board had made age and not nationality the test. Japanese subjects, under the treaty between the two nations, are guaran teed the same treatment as is accorded to subjects of "the most favored na tion"to use the diplomatic phrase, As United States District Attorney Devlin points out, the school law re quiring the segregation of Mongolian pupils discriminates against the Jap anese, because German, Irish and other children of foreign birth are not segre gated. If the California authorities had passed a law or adopted a rule fixing the maximum ages at which pu pils would be admitted to the various grades^ the same object would have been attained, without violating the treaty rights of the Japanese. Neither the authorities nor the students of our universities object to the presence Of Japanese .'students'. On the contrary, the Japanese students are cordially wel comed. This is because they are of the same age as the other students and there is no friction. I is to the asso ciation of adults of alien race and dif ferent standard of morals with Amer ican jjhildien that San.

He hates and fears the bright, resourceful Jap..That hatred is likely to permeate the whole whitfe population of the coastsit is very far from doing so nowif Japanese imm'i' gration continues to grow. The Japan ese government, however, has complete control of emigration and can easily stop the flow before it becomes a tide, S There is nothing in the board of con trol law, and never has been, to prevent Governor Johnson from appointing as many democrats as he pleases to bt members of the board. The Pioneer Press is in error in saying that jiot more than two members of the board can be., of the same political party. .That idea was incorporated in the original board of control bill, but it was cut out before the bill passed by the amendment of Sena tor Stockwell, who declared that the board of control, was a republican meas ure, and he would not stand for a divi sion of responsibility. The original board happened to be bi-partizan, but the whole theory of the law is that it shall be non-partizan, and in Jts treatment of institution affairs and subordinates the board has always eschewed politics. In appointing men to this board their poli tics should not be taken into considera tion, and as far as the law is-concerned, it need not be. tt has been a matter'for some surprised comment that the entire Mansfield en gagement in Minneapolis was not devoted to "Peer Gynt." Not merely the en--- thusiastic appreciation which this city habitually bestows upon afi artistic pro duction, but the large Norwegian element in our population should have disposed the management toward devoting its en tire engagement to the Ibsen poem. It seems, however, that the management was badly advised by some uninformed person, who thru a personal ab^ua^rntanice with Mr. Mansfield was itble to enforce the view that /Minneapolis w)ouidn|i uri-:. derstand or patronizfe: "PJaer^GynL" The sale has already^ fbtpe% a change in the repertory, which^kffords ojs^^nore ^Peer Gynlt'V evening and demonstrates that the massive prodWl6iitry6ui'd'"&i|i^-juh a week herb tp capacity houses^ *Wnspta*cy*"-asrm-hini.

Among the various reforms suggested are the following: Amendment tp the charter/providing tbat the offices of city attorney, city clerk and others shall be filled by- a vote of the people. Provision for separate municipal elections, either in the spiring or in the fall, in alternate years froia the general state election. Provisions for issuing bonds for a filtration plant. purchase of ths gas plant, and for the extension of the sewer system, particularly for the big trunfcline to drain the entire southern part of the city. Provisions for better control of the city's finances, particularly to place on the city coun cil the responsibility of designating public de positories. Fixing the terms of office of street commis sioners and chief of- the fire department at two years to correspond with the terms of all other city officials. Granting greater authority to the city council in dealing with public-service corporations, whose franchises are not drawn in the best interests of the city. These are only a few of the. more im portant reforms that have been sug gested. All of them will not be se cured, but some may pass the two houses. The bond question is regarded as the most important at present. Thru therccent increase in the assessed val uation of the city the council has a leeway of nearly $2,000,000. This mar gin will enable the city to build a fil tration plant and extend the sewer sys tem or to provide for the purchase of the gas plant. It will not provide for the' three. Gas Matter Important. Alderman C. B.

In getting risks for a company, quality is an es sential thing. The poor risks are nat urally the easiest to insure, the best ones the hardest. In sorting out risks, a company only has before it what is laid out on paper in response to interrogations. The agent general ly has a personal knowledge of the ap plicant and can thus form an opinion as to his desirability. The agent to bear a satisfactory relation to his com pany, must be energetic, loyal. He needs courage, as he is daily engaged in a battle with doubt, ignorance, pre judice, and procrastination.

There is a legitimate use for every dollar of the pramium if any-of it is diverted to another channel, which oc curs when a rebate is given, the plan of the management is disturbed and a readjustment has to take 'place. The policyholder who pays his full pre mium is injured by a rebate to another policyholder. The law should make the one who accepts, and who, in fact, usually demands it, equally guilty with tli*1 SHEVLIN HALL PRESENTED Formal Ceremonies of( Transfer to University Take Place Today.
