There vi?a ?? o?.asi.mal outbreak of laughter on the pemocrat?c side, but It sounded mirthless, and iS gad as sobbing; there were occasional con? gratulations of Democrats by Democrats, but these ?rere usually one-sided and not very gay -the "e who received the congratulations on account of his escape from defeat helng obliged to confi?le with the other on account of the let? ter's defeat OB the whole, however, the Demo? crats seemed to have ?letermined to conceal their sorrow chagrin and disappointment, and it is only fair to sn,y that they did so with quite as much ?u. *?ss as could have been expected under the circumstances. On the Republican side joy and hilarity r "ipned triumphant. To their politi? cal opponents the Republicans were <iul?'k and ready to offer sympathy, and to show that mag? nanimity which becomes victors, but ?????>?? tkemselves they gave fren expi*e*salon t.. their joy. Chalnnaa Hahoock, of the Republican Con ?saslonal Committee, came in for hi? full shnre of con??-:-?'.ul.iti..ns. Boiriebody baa said ihn: th?? Republicans would have cartied tbe next House if th? r ? had been no Conff^?easlonal Committee, but Republican? generally consider that a politi? cal Viet..ry such as was won on November I would have been Impossible without th.? rnaenlft cent ani effective work of that committee, Th.

Th?? Iowa men. Whd also mad.? a clean sweep, were as happy a.? the men frcm Wisconsin and Michigan. "Our motto was 'let no -guilty man escape,'" ?aid Major Lacey. Ho warmer or more hearty congratulations were exchansed that those between the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee, all of whom were on hand except ex-Governor Gear. who will move over to the Senate at the expira? tion of this session. Captain Boutelle was radiant, and yet his face wore an inquisitive look, as though he would like to know what the Presi? dent and his Secretary of State would have to say ah .ut Hawaiian affairs. "Well, you seem U> have pulled through all right," said a friend to George W. Ray. of the Hinghamton distri-t. "Pulled through! I should rather say 1 did. My majority was double the biggest majority ever glvea before in the district when there was any opposition at all." was the reply. Cannon and Bltl and Post and all the other Illinois Repub? lic tn? were ..n hand, but not ?-uite as happy as they would have been If two of the thirty Con? gress districts In that State had not b-t-n carried hy the Democrats, whose gerrymander was de? signed to give them fifteen districts with Ironclad Democratic majorities. BARTHoLDT NOT LONESOME ANY MORE. Bartholdt, the lone Republican from Missouri, was jubilant as he explained to his friends that he would have nine Republican colleagues from that State In the LIVth Congress, and that among his Democratic colleagues would not be O'Neill. Champ Clark. Bland. Heard or Hatch. General Unsvenor, of Ohio. wh'?m chairman Faulkner's committee had marked for destruc? tion, and who ?va? returned by sn overwhelming majority, sat in his seat, wearing a pleasant smile euer the recollection of that Democratic rainbow prediction. Th?? Pennsylvania, men? Qrow, Bingham. Brosius. Reyburn and all the rest?were in high feather. "Pennsylvania gave a Republic,, majority l?ig enough te? allow about MM to each of the 24.'. Re-put,li'-ans elected to the LIVth Conffress," said Brost us, in a pruud An ?ther Republican whom Chairman Faulk n<-r. in his rainbow-chasing, had marked to? cer? tain defeat, was Mr. Quigg, who appeared to-day, i ? kiiiK a< Mrene ani happy as though he had never heard ..f Faulkner's purpose or expectation. With a majority about seven times as tug as thai by which he was elected ten months ago, Mr. Q ilgg would seem to hav a risht to feel happy and contented. Th?? Minnesota men were also happy, for there will be ne? ?Democrats 01 Populists among their igues in the nexl Congress Bpeehlng of ? puliste makes one w ?nder srhy thej ever hoped "to hold the baiane?? of power" In case the elec? tion ?if the next President should be thrown Into the?

But th?? vain hvpe n"t only existed, but was. strong arm.ng th?* Populists, and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee fired away his ammutii tlon also in vain. The costosa of sending flowers to be placed on th" desks eif members at the opening <"'f the ses? sion was observed again to-day. The most am? bitious tribute of this sort, and one whir h pro? voked some applause? on the? floor and in the galleries when it was brought forward and placed on the dfsk of Mr. Llnton. of Michigan, was a Kttle red school house, several feet hing and wide, and about thirty Inches in height, over th% d'r.r of which was thf legend, "Our Public 8ohoois." This was said to have e;ome from mem? ber? of the American Protective Association, In recognition of Mr. Union's opposition to appro? priati' -is for the? support of Indian s"hools under the control of religious d?nominations.
