Washington, Dec. 6 At noon to-day tho first regular s-ession of the Fifty-fifth con gress began. Simultaneously at both ends of the capitol. Speaker Reed in the house and Vice President Jlobart in the senate, dropped their gavels and called to order the respective bodies over which they pre side. Tho ceremonies attending the opening of a. congress, though comparatively of a rou- tine character, form' a spectacle which in some respects is regarded as the greatest official event of the vear at the national capital. To-day the weather was propi tious. The sun shone brilliantly from a cloudless sky, making a glorious bright December day, with a tinge of frost in the air to Invigorate tho lungs and a breeze jut strong enough to keep the stars and stripes snapping from the llagstaffs. At the capltol, the crowd swarmed into the corridors at an early hour and choke'd the marble fcteps as they ascended to the gal leries from which they were to view the fchuu-. As is usual on such occasions, the resetted galleries were carefully guarded on both the hoube and senate sides, admls bion being only by card, 'and the public had gnat ditlitulty in wedging Itself Into the limited space set aside lor it. The opening da in the house passed without unusual incident of any character. The formalities attending the inauguration of the session are dry, and except us a spectacle hardly repaid the crowds which thronged the public and private galleries. Yet. with few exceptions, the visitors, sat through the whole proceedings. Mr. Dingle, the floor leader of the ma jority; Mr. Railcy, the recognized leader of the minority, and Mr. Grosvenor. of Ohio, enjojed the distinguished honor of lieicjg appointed to wait upon the president, whose message vas. of course, the event of the day. Its reading was long and tedi ous but it was followed with close atten tion by the members and the spectators in the galleries. There was no demonstra tion until the reading was concluded, when the Republicans Joined in a hearty expres sion of approval. Immediately after the reading of the message, the house ad journed, out of respect to the memories of Senator George, of Mississippi, and Representative Wright, of Massachusetts, who had died during the recess. The representation of a huge gavel in red and w hite carnations stood upon the speak er's table when the members began to gather in the house.

Mr. Bailey, of Texas, the leader of the minority, nr.d '"Silver Dollar" ltland. of Missouri, entered the hall together. Mr. Dingley, the lloor leader of the house, smiling and affable as ever, came in just before the speaker ap peared, f As tho hands of the clock pointed to 11 Speaker Reed, attired In a black cutaway coat and wearing a red tie. pushed through the green baize doors from the lobby and ascended the rostrum. One crack of the gavel subdued the dm on the floor and tho conversation In overhanging galleries. The gavel with which the speaker called tho house to order was presented to him by J. C. Groner. theriff of Knox county. Tenn.. who sent it in the name of the "Stalwart republicans of Hast Tennessee." In the deep silence which followed tho calling of the assemblage to order, the prajer of tho eminent OiVIne, Rev. Mr. Charles A. Ucrry. of Wcaverhampton, En gland, who delivered the Invocation, was i-olcmn and impressive. The speaker then Immediately directed the clerk to call the roll, which consumed a half hour.

"The president." said he.- "was pleased to send to the two houses his respectful salutations and to Inform them that ho would communicate in writing."

Cub i. Tho president's utterances on both subjects seemed o Impress tho members deeplj. but there w is no clcmonstrnttrn of anv kind until the conclusion, when the Republicans joined in a sharp round of ap plause.

C Mrs Susan S Kav. wife of Sheriff William A. Kn, of this city, figures in one of tho queerest ro mances vet recorded in Maine. Mrs. Kay sacrificed her home and children for a ' tramp, whom she had nursed back to llfo while he was confined in the county jail. Charles Sweenj, known by many aliases, illiterate, unpiepossesslng. vulgar and ap parentlv possessing no trait which could appeal to woman, was arrested six weeks ago and confined in tho county jail on a clurge of assaulting a little girl. Whllo awaiting trial Svveenv was taktn seriously 111. Mis. Kay, who acted as mition of the jail, nursed the tramp tendeilj, and he I soon recovered. When his case came up for trial much surprise w is shown when no one appeared to prosecute him, and Sweeny was released. He remained in Houlton, and. although with no friends, he had plentj of inonev. The gossips sOOU started stories about the tramp and Mrs. Kay, and the sherirf began an lnvcstl-M-tlon. with the result that he caught tho couple holding clandestine meetings regu larly on the outskirts of the cit. When they found themselves detected the couple left town, going to Hnlirax, St. John, and then to Bangor. At the latter place Kay succeeded in getting an interview with his viife. and arguing for the sike of his 'children succeeded In getting her to aban don her tramp lover. Mr. Kay will give his wiro separute maintenance so long as she keeps awnj from Sweeny, nnd will al low her to see the children once a month. "BOOTLEGGER IN SKIRTS.

Continued, Prom Third Pngre. spairing view concerning our currency which tho president presents. Whilu there aro some improvements which I should like to see n.ade, I think we shall be able to get along if wo do not get any currency legislation, and as the situation presents itself now. it looks as if it might be Im practicable to secure legislation on the lines of the president's recommendntlons. The recommendations in regard to Cuba are humane and considerate." Senator Hale: "The recommendation in reg trdl to Cuba Is In all respects admirable, and one with which I am much pleased. On the subject of tho finances, the president does not press for immediate action and, as for mjself, I do not believe that such would be .possible under the circumstances." Senator Hoar: "It struckme as a wise, compact and carefully considered docu ment." Senator Toraker: "As a whole, tho mes sage Is an able document, but I no not agree with the president's conclusions on the subject of international law as applied to Cub i. The president's dealing with the currency question is suggestive, but I have not been able to give sufficient attention to it to justify me in expressing an opinion upon it." Senator Chandler: "I am especlallj pleas ed with the president's evident intention to maintain a pohev In the interest of inter n itional bimetallism." Senator Hanna: "It Is a statesmanlike and American paper: impressive and con vincing, and one which will confirm the confidence the country has in the presi de nt." Senator Burrows: "It Is a clear, concise and comprehensive message. It covers all our concerns, nation il and foreign, treat ing them with frankness and great per spicuity." Senator Smith, Democrat: "While some of the president's recommendations with icgard to the currency may be well enough. It must bo evident to him th.it at thp present time they are impossible of enactment. His reference to bonds is painfullv suggestive of the inadequacy of the present tariff law. and while his pol icy in regard to Cuba seems moderate, I hirdly think it is in line with the sup posed policy of the Republican party," Senator Allen, Populist: "1 do not care to enter upon a critic ism of the president's utterance, hut will sav that 1 fail to agree with him on his three principal sugges tions of policy. I do not think It possible to secure the currency legislation which he recommends." Senator Teller, sliver Republican: "I do not believe that anv legislation will he en acted authorizing the letention of tho greenbacks in the treasurv until some bodv Is willing to pav gold for them. The radical advocates of the gold stand ird will not be willing to accept this suggestion, nor will the silver men, so far as I am In formed, favor this disposition of the finan cial question. "It miy be that tho administration will he willing to go further to meet the de mands of the so-called currency reform ers but, judging from the utterances of the secretary of the treasury, he will bo will in'; to make further concession. I do not believe that the suggestion for the tvlng up of the greenbacks will meet the" ap proval of the people, as such a courss would Inevitably result In great contrac tion of the currencj. Indeed, it looks to me as if the suggestions of tne president would not be satisfactory to any great number of people of any party. The pres ident is certainly mistaken when he says that tho government Is obliged to redeem If obligations in gold It has been the" policy of the administration to so redeem, but there is no compulsion on this point " Senator Pettigrew. silver Republican "Tho president proposes to retire th gieenlncks, and In so doing he tries to dis guise tho method bv which it is to be ac complished. It is plain that if the presi dent's pi in is adopted, no more greenbacks can be In circulation than there is sold in the treasury. Thus the greenbacks virtually become gold certificates and will bo immediately retired." 

HOUSE VIEWS ONTHE MESSAGE Republic-mis Generally Approve It, "While Democrats Hnve Only l'nult.fo I'lml. Washington, Dee. C Representative Dol liver. Republican, or Iowa, said: "Tho president's message. Is a clear and conser vative statement of jtho national situation. It will meet generar p'dpuUr approval. As to the currency question, the president's omission to urge in detail the most radical reforms proposed by' Secretary Gage Indi cates tint he will" exercise a good deal of charity toward congress, if that body should fail to get together on the ques tion." Representative Grosvenor, Republican, of Ohio, said: "The message Is an especially able, clear and satisfactory document all tho way through. Tho currency discussion will challenge close examination and in the end will be found to bo wiso and benefi cial. The Cuban section is frank, generous and patriotic Representative Hitt, Republican, of Illi nois, chairman of the committee on for eign affairs: The message shows that tho president has promptly and elTcctivclv act ed on the Cuban question in fulfillment of the sentiments he had previously ex pressed on the Cuban struggle for liberty, and the just expect itlons of the countrj. He has pressed upon the attention of the Spanish government the Injuries our busi ness intciests were suffering, the imprison ment of American citizens, the birbarous warfare under Wcjler and need of change in the mode of government in Cu'vi. The result has been the release of every Im prisoned American, the removal and dis grace of Weler, the end of the concentra tion and starvation policy, and the present ation of a svstem of self-government Inrge l.v bised on that of Canada. When our suggestions havo thus all been accepted and are being carried out in apparent good faith, which is shown by tho opposition in Spain, he wisely thinks that good faith on our part requires that -vro let the mea sure we ourselves suggested be tried at le ist until we can see whether the Cubans themselves will be satisfied. The slttuation is vastly different from that of a jear ago." Representative Walker, Republican, ot Massachusetts, ch lirman of the commit tee on b inking and currency, said, as to tho financial features of the message: "I foar tho message Is not sufficiently specific and does not go far enough to relievo tho situatlnn. It does not lecommend anv thing sh ill bo done until the revenues exceed the expenditure) of the government, which may be many months In' tho futiue. and is far from immediate action. Secondly, tho recommendation that greenbacks be not paid out except for gold when once le deemed in gold, if en icted into law, would permit one man with Jl 

OXI.OOO ot green backs demanding gold ot the treasury and then depositing the gold in the bank for greenbacks and repealing the process 315 times, to retire the whole SSHiOOU.OW In tho time It would take him to oscillate between the sub-treasury In New York and his confederate foreign broker. The recom mend ttion tint hanks be required to re deem thilr notes in gold, with no other pro vision of law, would cause everv bank in the country to surrender its clrculatlon.r.nd then what ngenev would keep the country on a gold basis.' ' Ropicentative lfcnuerson. Republican, ot Iowa: "I am pleased with tho president's messaRo because it meets clearly and squarely e-very vital and pressing ques tion. On the money question he is clear, stating our situation with marked Intelli gence, pointing out our dangers and mak ing certain recommendations that would certainb. If adopted, prevent for the pres ent, at least, dls isters that we have experi enced in the past. On the Cuban question his course has been active, intelligent, pa triotic and wise." Representative Hull, Republican, ot Iowa, chairman of the committee on mili tary affairs The recommend itlons as to currenc.v reform are more moderate than 1 cJ peeled, and It mav be possible for us to come together In some way. Personally I am eppose-d to any action on the currency at this time. I do not believe In the inter national monetary congress. The result of the last vear has to my mind de-monstrated the futllityof anv further effort in this line I cordially indorse the president s position as to tho Hawaiian Islands, hut cannot agiee to his suggestions as to Cubi." Mr. Richaidson. a Democrat, of Tennes see, said: 'Iho message is wholly disap pointing to the countrv. Nothing practicti for financial improvement Is recommended. No increase in revenues provided, while we ale running behind nearlv SlOlOUenjO a month: nothing for Cuba, but all for Spain; Ch v eland's policy of issuing bonds to main tain gold reserve Indorsed; all for Bold and tho single gold standard, nnd nothing for bimetallism or relief to the people." Representative Sayers, Democrat, of Tex as. "The recommendation by the pre-idei't thi-t when any of the United States notes shall bo redeemed In gold thev shall be la pt and set apirt and pain out only in ex ch inge for gold will be. in my judgment if carried out. an indirect method of retiring the greenbacks; and if such policy should prevail, it will be as fatal to the further use ot these notes as currency a-s if they hud been covered Into bonds. In such a policy I do not concur. I also regard that portion of the message concerning Cuba as fatal to any action on the part of this gov ernment looking to the granting of bellig erent rights to the revolutionists." Representative Bland, Democrat, of Mis souri, the retognized free silver leader: "The president's, proposition to re tire the greenbacks by holding them In the treas ury, except for gold deposits, means a con traction of the currencv to the amount of the greenbacks s0 impounded. Ills state ment ot the situation as to international bimetallism will not be .accepted In earnest by anv bodv . 1 here are few serious Inter national himetallists. but among them I suppose- the president may be classed as one. The message on all subjects sounds apologetic, and like an affidavit for eontin u incc." Representative Chimp Clark. Democrat, of Missouri, a member of the committee on foreign affairs: 'The message wjh i(. n great campaign document for the Demo crats. If the recommendations therein con tained are adopted by the Republicans, the Democrats ought to win in l-'i! and llhJO, h inds down." " Representative- Cox. Demoerit, of Ten nessee1, the ranking Democratic member of the committee on banking and currencv: "Tho message. In regard to the currency. In my judgment. Is in utter failure. If the pollcv advocated was carried out into law It could onlv rtsult In the contraction of the crrenc. Under the arguments made by the president, it would be the duty of the government to redeem silver in ROlel on the application of tho holder ot silve'r as readily as It eloes the United States l otes So if ever piper dollar of the gov ernment was retired the raid cotilel be mule on tho treasury just as well with silver. In regard to the recommendations as to banking, thev are of sjh a eharactei that no business bank would do business under such law." Mr. Cannon, chairman ot the committee on appropriations, s-id: "I am much grat ified with that feature of the president's! messige in which he savs; 'It is a eom m inding duty to keep the appropriations within the revenues of the government, .ai. d thus avoid a deficiency.' The sugges tion Is particularly timelv lust now." Chairmin Dingley, of Maine, said: 'The message Is a practical state pmer. which HON. D B. wlll be generally approved. The president presents some excellent practical sugges tions as to the currency. What the pres ident sajs relative to Cuba will. I hive no doubt, meet the hearty approval of the best sentiment of the countrv." Representative Dalzell. of Pennsv Ivania. of the was and means committee: "So fir as the currency part of the messige is concerned, it will not meet the views of those who arc demanding an entire reor ganization of our sjstem. while those who believe us I do. tint any radical leg islation would be unwise at this time, the message will lie accepted ns wise and con servative. The recommendations as to Cub in matters, it seems to me, ought to meet the views of the great body of our people." Mr. DeArmond, of Misou'-i. said: "Tho message should bereceiveel with more favor in Spain than In the United States.

LONDON PAPERSDONT LIKE IT Hate All Manner of Fault to Finil "With President McKinlej's Message. London, Dec. 7 The Daily Telegraph, commenting on President MeKinlev's mes sage this morning, savs: ) "It used to bo America's proud boast that she had no foreign policy. Judging from President MeKinlev's message the New World is no more free from the burdens of diplomatic negotiations th in the Old. "In a document of portentous length, mostly intended for Spanish consumption. President McKinley has devised a specious pretext for gaining time. It contains pis snges that will certainly wound Spain's na tional susceptibilities. 'I he whole tone, though meant to be concili itorv, ravorstoo much ot the magistrate availing himself of the first offender's act to he v cry acceptable at Madrid. Spain mav not be so thick skinned as we are to these delicate usigo.3 of America's diplomatic courtesy. "Moreover, there are serious dangers of revolution In Spain, and the indiscreet ad jectives President McKinley applies to General Wevler's policy will not lessen the hitter's popularity. Much depends upon the attitude of congress, if, .m our cor respondent thinks, the jingces aeiii!escc in the decision of the executive and give the Spaniards a chance, all may jet ho vvtll, but recent experience docs not in ike us" ov er-snngulne." The Daily Mail savs it Is "very s.,tis. factory that I'resident McKinley comes cut so strong against the jingoes." The Dally Chronicle describes the mes sage as "weak and colorless, compared with the vigorous handling of public questions to which Mr. Cleveland accustomed us." It savs: "The expliimtion of this Is simple, Mr. Cleveland was in front of congress; Mr. McKinle is behind it. The president's comments on the currency Issue are posi tively ehildliko in their slniplleitj. It la safe to prophesy that his treatment ot tho Cuban eiuestlon will be received witli a storm rf lie annex itlon ot Culja would be a deplorable mistake, but the reasons for re -training from that conr-v .ire not the milk and water ones Mr. McKlnlev advances." The Morning Tost pivs a tribute to the preslelent's fine iense of dutv. In the face ot domestic trouble, in sending the mes sage at the appointed hour, and praises his tre itmcnt of the currency question. 'the limes sis. "Its tone ot patroniz ing tolerance will make the message not wholly agreeable to Spain. Probably tho president calculates that if he can satlsty the Jingoes for a time with! eloepient de nunciations and warnings, he will find It easier to pursue a moderate policv. "Regarding his currency propos lis. it seems too probable that Mr. McKinley still clings to the notion that something miy be done for silver. So long as he follows that will o' the wisp he can hard ly lie expected to attempt any thoroughgo ing reform of the currency." The Standard sajs: " The best that can be said ot the mes sage is that it is absolutely unexciting. As a distinguished politician, the president lnbored under grave difficulties, and it Is no reproach to his skill that he has failed to surmount them "If Mr. McKinley represent an thing -o far, It is the new tariff, which Is confcs-cil-1 a palpible failure. The whole curren y p'an hangs upon the condition of an ex chequer surplus, but when whl thnt happ dav arrive? "Foreign affairs are treated temperatelj . With regard to Cuba, the president has taken care to keep within the limits of International comity ard cooel feeling." AVIth reference to his declaration that, should America be compelled to Intervene. It wlll'onij le because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to com mand tho support ind approval of the iv illzeel world, the Standard exclaims: 'The Spanish ministry can sleep in peace." Tho Dailv News sivs that the message is chi.racterizcd by a elesiro to displease no brdv. Referring to Secretary Gage's cur rency pi in. the editorial asserts that Mr. Cleveland's similar plan never fouml favor with congress. As to the Cub in question, the Dally News thinks the niessags rings true and promises a fair trial of Spilns new plans more than which the president cculd not be expected! to do. LA

Savs: "The Madrid government awaits the con tents of I'resident MeKinlev's message to congress. It is believed tint its tone will be satisfactory, although the cabled sum mary published here should not satisfy Sp lin patriotism, as Mr. McKinley onlv ad mits that SiMln gives autonomv to Cuba as a step to pacifv the Island, ard savs that, in view of this. Spiln must be allowed sufficient time to obtain the results of her concessions. This, Mr. McKinley points out, was said bv Mr. Clev eland and Secre tary Olney ilso, but these words do not lay the president under any obligation: while thev are vns.atlsfactorj to Spain, as they only indie ite a period of time more or less for" Spain to end the revolt. "It seems that the nresldint recognizes the right of the United St ites to Interfere

In view of this, it is to be ex pectcd.th.it If the revolt does not end In a period of time acceptable to the Americans, thev will Interfere In a more decisive and effective manner than heretofore. "Thus far thu Washington government has met with i o obstacle In doing or undo ing as it pleases.

In response to this new and wary demand, Spain will renlv with such elignitv and en ergy as her indisputable rights, her history, character and feelings demanel." MEXICAN VFW OF IT. Public Opinion Is That the Messnec Will Greatly Strengthen the Sna-nsia Government. City of Mexico. Mex., Dec. C Mexican public opinion regarding President McKin- j lc's utterances on the Cuban question Is that they will greatly strengthen the Sa- gasta government and cnable It to vv'n friends in Spain for its reform policy in the island. The clerical party naturally regards the attitude of the president as wise and prudent, but the masses, who favor Cuba, would have llkeel to seen bel ligerency accorded tho insurgents, ns such a course woulel have led eventually to similar action in Latin-America. Resident Cubans are opposed to autonomv in Cuba, and assert that the fight will go on, and thnt the autonomists In the islind are a feeble minorit. They utterly distrust the promises of Spain. i The Mexlem Herald savs it was for tun ite for the American colonies In tho revolt against Great Britain that the French king did not take the same view of their belligerency as does, the president of the United States ot tho Cuban patrio.s" caurc.

He wisely pises over the detail of method. He Insists up on the retirement of tho Uniteel St ites notes and approves Mr. Gage's plan of dealing with bank currenc. The import ant feature of the message is that he real lyes tint the subject must ! met unel the record made bv bravely dealing with , the question.
