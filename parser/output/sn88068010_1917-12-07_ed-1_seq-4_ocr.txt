MISSOURI Friday, December 7, 1917 Entered at the Tost Oflkc at Keytorille Mo u ecnnd-clasi mail matter. Congress assembled Monday and Tuesday President Wilson delivered his message which pertained almost wholly to war matters. The president advises declaring war on Austria and Hungary and congress wants to go further and include Turkey and Bulgaria. Since we are against all who are against us or who are for those who are against us, why not include all in a declaration of war, especial ly since we are really fighting some of thim at this time? Twelve hundred men for the navy is the number assigned for Missouri to raise. That should be easy. Since the terms for men in the navy are so very good it would seem that there would be an over enlistment. The men must be had for we have numbers of new war craft which must be manned and tho enlistment is purely voluntary, the number required of this state will undoudtedly be forth coming andjon time.

It's the 

ONLY rule you can follow when you come here, because we haven't anything else but GOOD clothes. - "The best is the cheapest" is truer about clothes now than ever before ; and the best clothes are made by Hart Schaff ner & Marx and Clothcraft. Buy them for real economy ; for style ; comfort ; all-wool; flu and the guarantee. STAMPER BROS. ' SALISBURY, MISSOURI. The home of Hart.Schaffner and Marx clothes The bank statements over the entire country show a very healthy financial conditions so far as we have been able to learn but the published statements of the banks in this county last week indicate beyond, question that money is plentful notwithstand ing heavy subscriptions for gov eminent loans. The banks in this city made a fine showing in all respects. The meeting called Monday night by chairman Bond of the Ked Cross Society was a slin af fair but necessary committees were appointed by him and the preliminary move to assist in se curing the 2300 new members called for were made. Mrs. R. W. Rucker is at the head of the drive to complete the quota of this county and C. C. Parkes at the head of the commitee on pub licty and no better leader could have been named. It is up to all of us not only those on commit tees but every one else to lend every assistance to these leaders and that without having to be appealed to the second time for it. Salisbury is out doing every other section of the county in Red Cross work and there is no ex cuse whatever for this city and neighborhood being so backward about getting to. the front.' If there is an organization in the world which should have the hearty support of men and wo men of every station in life, it is the Red Cross. Cut out some of the side show features of the war move and anything and all else which detracts in the least from giving full aid to the society which does material good at the right time.
