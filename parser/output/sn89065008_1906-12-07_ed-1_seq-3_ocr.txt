ROOSEVELTS ANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS President Deals with Some New and Important Subjects and He Also Recommends Much Legislation ASKS FOR INCOME AND INHERITANCE TAX Believes Seek Legislation Is Constitutional and That It Would Curb the Growth of Fortunes to Dangerous Proportions—Asks for Legisla tion That Will Enable Government to Appeal Criminal Cases in Prosecutions of the Trusts—Would Minimize Injunctions in Labor Tronbles—His Views on the Negro Question—Promises a Special Message on Panama Canal—Cuban Intervention, Currency Re form and Many Other Subjects Reviewed. Washington, Dec. President Roose velt'» message to the second session of the Fifty-ninth congress deals with a number of chief of which is the government prose cution of the trusts, the abuse of injunc tions in labor troubles, the negro ques tion, the preaching of class hatred between capital and labor, additional legis lation for the control of large corpora tions, a federal Inheritance and income tax law and currency reform. The message opens with a statement of what the last congress left unfinished, and of this he says: "I again recommend a law prohibiting all corpora dons from contributing campaign expenses of any party. bill has already past fress. Let individuals contribute as they désire; but let us prohibit In effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly. "Another bill which has Just past one house of the congress and which Is gently necessary should be enacted Into law is that conferring upon tho govern ment the right of appeal in criminal eases on questions or law. This right exists In many of the states; It exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for tho de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently In one district where the government had indicted certain per sons for conspiracy In connection with rebates, the court sustained tho defend ant's demurrer; while In another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebate's has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to Impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of Justice ere blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A. failure to pass will result In seriously hampering the government in its effort to obtain just'ce, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. I have specifically tn view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway out remedy for vlolatfc c&Ued labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the Judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues and important subjects, to the Such house of c where employees with of a certain A K f & v. r 1ip. wn \ President Roosevelt. on thé bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon étltutlonal," and then to deny to the government the right to have the preme court definitely decide the ques Evasion by Technicalities. "In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsat isfactory state of our criminal law. re sultlng In large part from the habit of netting aside the Judgments of Inferior courts on technicalities absolutely connected with the merits of the case, and wheré there Ja that there has been any atantlal justice. It would act a law providing something to the effect that: "No judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted in any causen civil or crim inal, on the ground of misdirection of the Jury or the Improper admission or re jection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure unless, In the opinion of the court to which the application Is made, after an examina tion of the entire cause, It shall affirma tively appear that the error complained ot has iwaultsd in a miscarriage of Justice " attempt to show failure of sub be well to en Injunctions. On ths subject ot the abolition ot In junctions In labor disputes, he says: "In my lost message I suggested the en actment of a law In connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention hav ing been eharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply g Injunctions In labor cases should bo holly abolished. It la at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the uee of Injunctions in such cases would stand the tut of the courts; ln which case ot courn the legislation would be Ineffective. Moreover, I believe It would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of Injunctions. It Is criminal to permit Sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding seek to destroy life or property by violence there ehould be no Impairment of the power of ths courts to deal with them In the mut summary and effective way possible. But *o far as possible the abuu of tho power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated Uet year. "In this matter of Injunctions there Is lodged ln ths hands of the Judiciary a :• hecasury power which la nevertheless m fenbjeet to the pueiblllty of grave abuse, ill» It Is a power that should be exercised M 1,1th extrema cars and should be eub ' Jsct to ths Jealous scrutiny of all men, , and condemnation should be meted out M much to the Judga who falls to use It boldly when nocousry so to tho Judge Who usee tt wantonly or oppressively, yt couru, a Judge strong enough to bo it for hie office will enjoin eny resort u violence or intimidation, especially by Conspiracy, no matter what his opinion *»y be of the rights of the original quar must be no huitatlon ln er. But there muet __ no stich abuse of the In ettve power as Û Implied tn forbidding bring sun to strive for their In the law; and If me S mo own bot and lawful ways; be used merely 1*2« corporation In carrying SEtm if to I« I SMMê improperly granted may do irreparable wrong. Yet there are many Judges who assume d matter-of-fact course granting of a preliminary Injunction to be the ordinary and proper Judicial disposition of such cases; and there have undoubt edly been flagrant wrongs committed by Judges In connection with labor dis putes even within the last few years, altho I think much less often than tn former years. Such judges by their un wise action Immensely strengthen the hands of those who are striving entirely to do away with the power of injunction; and therefore such careless use of the Injunctive process tends to threaten its very existence, for if the American peo ple ever become convinced that this process Is habitually abused, whether in matters affecting labor or in matters af fecting corporations, It will be well-nigh Impossible to prevent its abolition." The Negro Problem. The negro problem is given considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to Jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchings, and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of as in the highest degree against tho whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my Judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, tho case with murder; assault with In tent to commit rape should be made a pttal crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow Immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be bo conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by Just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man take part in the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means Just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it. and much additional next generation of pe; and It should be felt offense Is therefore Just trouble for the Americans. "Let Justice be both sure and swift; but let It be justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. Need for Negro Education. "There is another matter which haa a direct bearing upon this matter of lynching and of the brutal crime which sometimes calls It forth and at other times merely furnishes the excuse for Its existence. It is out of the question for our people to rise by treading down any of their those who them for the moment profit by such maltreatment of their fellows will In the long run also suffer. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than, in the fancied Interest of one class, to prevent the education of an other class. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get a good elementary education, lies at foundation of our whole political situ ation. In every community the poor est citizens, those who need the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only received school facilities proportionately to the taxes they paid. This Is as true of one portion of our country as of another. It Is as true for the negro as for the white man. The white man, If he Is wise, will de cline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood without education. Unquestionably ucatlon such as is obtained in our pub lic schools does not do everything wards making a man a good citlxen; but it doos much. The lowest and most brutal criminals, those for Instance who commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority either no education a whole permanently number. B selv tho ed to who have had very litle; Just as they are almost Invariably men who own no property; for the man who puts money by out of his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually lifted above mere brutal criminality. Of course the best type of education for the colored man, ta ken as a whole, Is such education is conferred In schools like Hampton and Tuskegee; where the boys and girls, the young men and young wo men, are trained Industrially as well as in ths ordinary public school branches. The graduates of these schools turn out well in the great ma jority of cases, and hardly any of them become criminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the form of that brutal violence which In vites lynch law. Every graduate of these schools—and for the matter of that every ober colored man man—who leads a life so useful and honorable as to win the good will and respect of those whites whose neigh bor he or she is, thereby helps the whole colored race as It can be helped In no other way; for next to the negro himself, the man who can do most to h«lp the negro is his white neighbor 'who lives near him; and our steady effort should be to better the relations between the two. Great tho the bene fit of these schools has been to their colored pupils and to the colored peo ple, It may well be questioned whether the benefit has not been at least as great to the white people among whom these colored pupils llva after they graduate." wo Capital and Labor, On tbe subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preach hatred to the rich man, as such, . . . to seek to mislead and inflame to mad ness honest men whoso lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to ap preciate the danger In tbe doctrines B reached Is to commit a crime against to body politic and to bs (also to every principle and tradition of Amer tlonat Ilfs." Continuing ou this subject he says: "The plain people who think—the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, tho men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe themselves to remember that tho damaging blow that can be given pop ular government le to elect an un worthy and olnlstor agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever euch an lsiue la raised In this eouhtry nothing can bs gained by flinching from It, for In euch ease dem ocraoy Is Itself on trial, popular aelf it under republican worthy lean n& it to most Itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing aa the tri umph of the escaped one whs. lev In the end tho honest poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by hia fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing, or else performing would set rich. who. for his the common the very government fall into the hands of of either of these two classes, we shall show* ourselves false to America'» past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand in hand. There at tills moment wealthy reaction aries of such obt regard the public plutocracy, and to* have danger avails nothing if we sucuumb to the other. .whether rich lothing but evil, the mob to plunder the from the crafty corruptionist. ends, would permit to bs exploited by no people Tthy. If we er let this morality that they •ant who prose cutes them when they violate the law. ho seeks to make them bear their proper share of the public burdens. as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There is nothing to choose between such a re actionary and such mentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and It is natural that they should Join In opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and Justice to all." agitator; funda Railroad Employees' Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of hours of labor, with troductlon of sists that conditions are they are here that the Introduction of an eight-hour day on tho canal would be absurd, and continues, "Just about as ab surd as It is, so far as the isthmus Is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother k is done by alien black a goal the general in eight-hour day, but in the Isthmus of Panama the different from what to whether the alien yellow Investigation of Disputes. He urges the enactment, of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal Investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory Investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." After referring to the fact that a bill has al ready been introduced to this end ho says: "Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the parties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for their contention. In most Instances the dispute would doubtless be found to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other's rights, aggravated by an unwillingness of either party to ac cept as true the statements of the other to the Justice or injustice of the mat ters in dispute. The exercise of a Ju dicial spirit by a disinterested body representing the federal government, such as would he provided by a commis sion on conciliation and arbitration would tend to create an atmosphere of friendliness and conciliation betw tending parties; and the giving each side equal opportunity to present fully Its in the presence of the other would prevent many disputes from developing into serious strikes or lockouts, and in other cases, would enable the commis sion to persuade the opposing parties to come to terms. "In this age of great corporate and la bor combinations, neither employers ployees should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party to a dls puto-, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be in tho line of securing recognition of the fact that in many interest con strikes the public has itself which cannot wisely be disregarded; interest not merely of general conven ience, for tho question o l a just and proper public policy must also be con sidered. In all legislation of this kind it Is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual results; the step preposed can purely be safely taken, for the decisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legal fashion, and yet would give a chance for public opin ion to exert Its full force for the right." Control of Corporations. A considerable portion of the message Is devoted to the subject of federal trol of corporations In what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already Justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat Inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of Inspection on the packers rather than on the government Continuing this subject or the control of corporati by the federal government he says: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex perience lias conclusively shown the Im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos In the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. Ln some method, whether by a national license law or ln other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corpora tlons-a control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive itnlteation, and that will compel disclosures by each big corporation of its stockholders and of Its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the secur ing of inordinate profits by favored Individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control It as to see that it results ln no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. As a matter of fact It is these reactionaries and ultraconservatives who are them selves most potent In Increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the agitation Is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways Is to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the carriers as w loll. overcap ths eat Interstate com __ do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such Is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain ln con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system—or rather no system—of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as If the exercise of such governmental eontrol would do away with the freedom of individual Initiative and dwarf Indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fall to put a premium upon Individual Initiative, individual capacity and effort; upon the energy, oharacter and foresight which It la so important to encourage In the Individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its extreme form communism, and tne destruction of individual charactsr which they would brin* about, are in p«u;t ach eved by the wholly unregulated competition which results ln a single Individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all othem until his or its rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competl sltion of utter Inferiority and m tors to a po subordinate... ... •Tn enacting and enforcing such legis lation as this congress already has to Its credit, ws are working on a coherent plan, with tho steady endeavor to eecure ths needed reform by the Joint action of ths moderate men, th# plain men who do not wish anything hysterical or dangerous, but who do Intend to deal In resolute commonsenss fashion with th# real and great evils of the present eystsm. The reactionaries end th» vio lant extremists show symptoms of Join ing hands against us. Both assert, for Instance, that If logical, wo should go to govornmont ownership of railroads and tho lilts; tho reactionaries, because on ouch an Issue they think the people would stand with them, while tho ex tremists cars rather to preach discontant and agitation than to achieve solid re sults As a matter ot foot, our position to aa ramsto from that of tho bourbon reactionary as from that ot the Imprac ticable or sinister visionary.

It is not possible completely to prevent it; and If it were possible, such complete prevention would do dam age to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to prevent all combination, such rigorous and adequate islon of the combina but control and superv tlons aa to prevent their injuring the public, or existing ln auch form a* Inev itably to threaten injury—for the mere a combination has secured fact that , ... practically complota control of a nec sarv of life would under any eircu stances show that suotl combination v to be presumed to be adverse to the pub lic interest. It Is unfortunate that present laws should forbid all combi na ttons, instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do /U, Rebates, for instance, are as often due to the pressure of big shippers (.as was shown in the Investigation of the Standard OH company and ns has been shown since by the investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) to the initi ative of big railroads. Often railroads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintain ing Improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general pub lic Such a combination. Instead of being forbidden by law, should be favored. In other words, It should be permitted to railroads to make agreements, provided these agreements were sanctioned by tho Interstate commerce commission and were published. With these two condi tions complied with It is impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the publia at large. It is a publlo ovtl to have on the statute books a law incapable of full enforcement bocause both judges and Juries reullxo that its full enforcement would destroy the busi ness of the country; for the result is to make decent railroad the law against their will, and to put a premium on tho behavior of the wilful wrongdoers. Such a result In turn tends to throw tho decent man and tho wilful wrongdoer Into close association, and in tho end to drag down the former to tho latter's level; for the man who becomes a lawbreaker In one way unhappily tends to lose all respect for law and to be willing to break It In many ways. No more scathing condemnation could be visited upon a law than Is contained in the words of the interstate commerce commission when. In commenting upon the fact that the numerous Joint traffic associations do technically violate the law, they say; "The decision of tho United States supreme court in the Transmississippi Traffic association case has n practical effect upon the railway opera tions of tho country. Such associations, In fact, exist now as they did before these decisions, and with the same gen eral effect. In Justice to all parties, wo ought probably to add that it is difficult to see how our Interstate railways could be operated with due regard to the inter est of the shipper and tho railway without concerted action of the kind af forded thru these associations." This means that the law as construed by tho supreme court Is such that the business of the country cannot be ducted without breaking it. I recommend that you give careful and early consider ation to this subject, and if you find the opinion of tho interstate commerce com mission justified, that you amend the law so as to obviate tho evil disclosed. Is violators of of in to at of and the Joint roduced Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer in some way to his belief In the necessity for the curbing of mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both in come and an Inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should Impose a graduated Inheritance tax, and. If possi ble, a graduated Income tàx. He says: *h a subject as this needs long and careful study In order that tho people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and rnay make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators can work out the project In necessary detail. But I feel that in the near future oqr nation al legislators should enact a law ptovld for a graduated Inheritance tax by which a steadily Increasing rate of duty should bo put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any Individual or corporation. It may be well to make the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefited Is remote of kin. In any event, In my judgment the pro rata of the tax should Increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one Individual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition Is the desire p.:rt of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well off. 1 "I am well aware that ing the to of of a It to of a of _ This object can be attained king the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object snould be to put a con a" tly Increasing burden on the Inher itance of those swollen fortunes which it Is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There can be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining the conditions upon which anr gift or Inheritance should be received. Exactly how would, as an Incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortunes in question It is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress ln this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either In amount or in the extent of tho increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. by far the Inheritance tax Inheritance Tax Constitutional. "This species of tax has again and again been imposed, altho only temporarily, by the national government. It Imposed by the act of July 6, 1797, when the makers of the Constitution were alive and at the heed of affairs. It was a graduated tax; tho small ln amount, the rate was Increased with the amount left to any Individual, exceptions being made in the case of certain close kin. A similar tax was. again imposed by the act of July 1, 1862; a minimum sum of $1,000 ln personal property being excepted from taxation, the tax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness kin. The war-revenue act of June 13, 1898, provided for an Inheritance tax on sum exceeding the value of $10,000, first - f any _ the rate of tax Increasing both ln accord ance with the amounts left and in ac cordance with the legatee's remoteness of kin. The supreme court has held that the succession tax Imposed at the time of the civil war was not a direct tax but an Impose of excise which was both con stitutional and valid. Moro recently the court. In an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice White, which contained an ex ceedingly able and elaborate discussion of the powers of the congress to Impose death duties, sustained the constitution ality of tho Inheritance tax feature of ths war-revenue act of 1898. I» Income Tax Constitutional? "In lta Incident», and apart from the main purpose ralrin* revenue, an Income tai stands on an entirely differ ent footing from an Inheritance tax, be cause It Involve» no question of tho per K tuatlon ot fortunes «wollen to althy essence a question of the proper adjust ment of burdens to benefits.

Nevertheless, the heriltetlen evidently felt by the court as a whole In coming to a conclusion, when considered to « ether with the previous decisions on he subject, may perhaps Indicate the possibility of devising a constitutional Income-tax law which shall substan tially acccomplleh the résulté aimed at The difficulty of emending the con stitution Is eo great that only real ne cessity can Justify a resort thereto.

"Moreover, while In the long run volun tary effort will prove mors efficacious than government assistance, while the farmers must primarily do most for themselves, yet tho government can also do much. The department of agriculture has broken new ground In many direc tions, and year by year It find» hpw 14 Improve Its methods and develop fresh usefulness. Its constant effort is to give tho governmental assistance in the most effective way; that Is. thru soclutlons of farmers rather than thru individual farmers.

Agricultural education is necogsAnly bused upon general education, but agricultural educational institutions are wisely specialising themselves, making their course relate to the actual teaching of the agricultural and kindred solstices to young country people or young city people who wish to live In the country. "Great progress has already boen made among farmers by tho creation farmers' Institute«, of dairy astoela tlons, of breeders' association«, horti cultural associations, and the like.

Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterlUty Is, from the standpoint of the nation, from Btan dpoint of the human race, the one rbr which the penalty Is natio death, race death ; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which is the more dreadful exactly In propor d women guilty thereof are in other respects, in char aoier, and bodily and mental powers, thOBe whom for the sake of the state it would be - well to see the fathers and mothers of many heilthy children, wen brought up in home« made happy by their presence.

The president asks for the enactment Into law of a shipping MU that will place American Interests on the seas on a par with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication with South American porta I sin tlon as the men an Currency Reform. Amendments to the prosent currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are Inadequate because the wide fluctuation of Interest charges, he says: •'The more statement of these facts shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There Is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed chang from consideration b complicated, of the the hus must be ruled ecauio they are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and Interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially Impair the valuo of the United Htates two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issuo of which wus made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I special plan, plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which aro possibly feasible and which certainly your consideration 1« that repeatedly brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary of the treasury, the sential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be per mitted to Issue a speolfled proportion of their oapltal in notes of a given kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted In legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency pre sented by times of stringency. do not press any Various that should receive and It the The bors bo and Ths of ates and Necd of Automatic System. "I do not say that this Is the right system. I only advance it to size the adoption of some system which shall bo automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid ail pos sibility of discrimination and favorit ism. Such a plan would tend to pre vent the spasms of high money and speculation which now obtain In the New York market; for at present thoro is too much currency at certain seasons of the year, and its accumu lation at Now York tempts bank to lend R at low rates for speculative purposes; whereas at other tlmos when the crops are blng moved there is urgent need for a large but temporary Increase In the currency supply, it must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men gen erally quite an much as bankers; es Î iecially Is this trus of stockmen, armors and business men tn the west; for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference in interest rates between the east and the west In from six to ten per cent., whereas in Canada the corresponding difference is but two per cent Any plan Ihust, of course, guard the Interests of west ern and southern bankers as carefully as It guards ths interssts of New York or Chicago bankers; and must be drawn from the standpoints of the farmer and the merchant no lews than from the standpoints of tho city banker and the country banker. The law should be amended so as to specifically to provide that the funds de rived from customs duties may be treat ed by the secretary of the treasury as he treats funds obtained under the In ternal revenue laws. There should bo a considerable increase In bills of small denominations. Permission should be given banks, If necessary under settled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount than S2,06O,tOO a month."

If the elections become a farce, and If the Insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed In ths Island, It Is ab solutely Out of the question that the island should continue Independent; and the United Htates, which has assumed ths sporsoruhip before the civilized world for Cuba's career ns a nation, would again have to lutervsue and to see that tne government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property.
