AT THE WHITE HOUSE] Deaths in Northwest From Shortage of Cars. MILLION Ul" KKUrtKIT LU5I What Senator Flint Told the President Today. AH INHERITANCE TAX State Attorney General Arguing a Case Before the United States Supreme Court. According to information placed in the hands of President Roosevelt today, people are freezing to death in North Dakota and elsewhere in the cold northwest because the railroads claim to be unable to get fuel to those sections by reason of shortage in cars. The President will transmit the information to the interstate commerce commission at once with a request for a searching investigation. A. J. Gronna of Lacota. N. D., who has been before the Interstate commerce commission giving testimony as to the general car shortage in the west, saw the President and gave him a'letter that had been received from A. M. Bevcridge, editor of a paper at Lacota. N. D.' This letter states that the cold weather of the last few weeks I had caught hundreds of people without r I fnpl nrttwithfitnndiner their strucreles to 1 I get it and their offers of exorbitant prices for something to build fires with. "The situation." said Mr. Gronna, "appears to be a.arming, "ana it stms lo uie action should be taken as quickly as possible. I notice where tfc ? railroads have been confiscating coal for their own purposes, thus depriving the people. Conditions are almost as bad as to supplies of all kinds. Millions Lost in California. Senator Flint of California told the President today that the Mexican government is probably responsible for the loss of millions of dollars of property in the United States. This has been caused by a break in the Colorado river which has made a vast lake out of a territory many miles long and wide. The President told Senator ' Flint that the State Department is in communication with the Mexican government, but so far has not received any answer to its communications. "The people of the east have no realization of the situation in the I nperial val ley," said Senator Flint. "There is a ter- < ritory of two hundred miles by fifty which < Will, 11 nit; river IS 

IIUI wjjuuiicu, owuu wc inundated by water 285 feet deep. More than 8,000 persons will be made homeless and millions upon millions of dollars' worth of property will be destroyed, Just because some careless persons across the Mexican border dug a hole in the bank of the Colorado river to draw off water fo. irrigation purposes. They did not properly safeguard the work and the result was that ^he break in the river bank has become 2,.ri00 feet wide and is growing every minute. Unless something is done within the next sixty days it will be Impossible ever to do anything, for the Imperial vaiiey will be filled up and the towns of Imperial BrawIey and Heber will be wiped off the map." rroposea .increase in salaries. A recent statement by Representative Livingstone of Georgia that he understood the President would soon send to Congress a special message advocating an increase of 20 per cent In the salaries of government clerks, cannot be confirmed at the White House. The President has no such message in mind at the present time, but later on may send one of this kind. Figures are being prepared in the departments as to the salaries of government employes and the increase In cost of the commodities of life. When these have been laid before the President it is possible that he may take the matter up with the view of a special message. Senator Allee of Delaware called on the President today regarding an appointment in that state. He also presented three influential members of the Delaware legislature?Dr. John W. Messick, A. O. Benham and J. Cary Palmer. New York's Inheritance Tax. Attorney General Mayer of New York. who is Here arguing tne siock transier lax ( case before the Supreme Court, was es- < corted to the White House this morning by ' Representative Parsons. If Mr. Mayer wins the case it will mean about $7,000,000 ( additional income a year for the state of i New York. "As the total expenses of the 1 state are about $28,000,000," said Mr. Par- | sons, "It would help considerably if the i attorney general wins the suit." New York < is now collecting about $5,000,000 from the , Inheritance tax, so if It comes out all { right on the stock transfer matter it will c mean that 40 per cent of the expenses of the ] state will be provided for."
