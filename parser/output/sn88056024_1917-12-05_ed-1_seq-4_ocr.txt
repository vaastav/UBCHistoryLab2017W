Society Editor, lit* FIRST, THE AMERICAN SOLDIER 3 OR the purposes of\his war the American Red Cross I aims are confined to three general subdivisions. They are stated as follows in the annual report of the war council of the organization: 1. To bo ready to care for our soldiers and sailors on duty wherever and whenever that care may be needed. 2. To shorten the war—by strengthening the morale of the allied peoples and their armies, by alleviating their sufferings in the period which must elapse until the American army can become fully effective abroad. 3. To lay foundations for an enduring peace—by extending a mes sage of practical relief and sympathy to the civilian population among our allies, carrying to them the expression of the finest side of the American character. First of all, then, is the American soldier. That and all the other objects of the Red Cross are certainly most praiseworthy and are entitled to the hearty support of every American citizen ; and* the average man cannot put his mite to better use for the cause of America than to hand it over to the Red Cross. This is an organization of American service. While millions are devoted to relief in many directions, the cost, of administration is so small as to be almost nil compared to the scope of the undertaking. There is no graft, no ex travagance, no opportunity for exploiting. Every dollar is directed straight to the program of mercy. An American soldier is wounded or sick. The Red Cross is there to attend his injuries and nurse him back to health. Refugees are starving. The Red Cross is there to pro vide food. Children are homeless. The Red Cross is there to pro vide shelter. The work of the Red Cross is broadly humanitarian, deeply Christian, universally charitable. Today the Red Cross is after more members to aid in carrying on this necessary labor of love and duty. To join this organization costs only a dollar. What citizen would deny that small sum in the knowl edge of the great service it will perform under the direc tion of this splendid body 1 NO PACT WITH PRUSSIANISM »HERE was nothing unexpected in President Wil son's latest message to congress barring the request for a declaration of war against Austria. There had been some advance information to the effect the president ■would not urge such a step, leaving Austria open as a pos sible pathway to peace. On the other hand, the chief exec utive declared that this country's position with reference to Austria and the American allies was entirely incompat ible. He made it plain that in this fight against autocracy it must be one for all and all for each. The president's virile Americanism punctuates the message liberally. No parts of it will receive more popu lar approval than those that declare the impossibility of any understanding with Prussianism, that reiterate the unselfishness of America's attitude and that scathingly denounce traitors and near-traitors in this country. The president's insistence for a restatement of war aims, if acted on, is a most important feature of the mes sage. If such a course will not serve to release the com mon people of Germany from the hypnotic influence of Prussianism, they will have to be fought as Prussianism is being fought. Above all the message sa vs: 

"AMERICA WILL STICK." THE 10 CENT LOAF F OOD ADMINISTRATOR BICKNELL*is to bo con gratulated, and those co-operating with him are to be commended, for the coming 10-cent loaf of bread. Particularly are the bakers to be praised for their ac quiescence, for any real decrease in profits will be felt by them. The retailer has no money to speak of invested in bread and the spread between the wholesale and retail price represents a profit of 30 per cent. However, the spirit indicated is the element deserving of notice. It is not only the 10-cent loaf that we should consider but the growing disposition to put profit into a secondary place for the period of the war. That is as it should be within reason, for there is small chance of much profit meantime for the most of those who are on the buying side of the counter. WHATCHAMA COLUMN PEPS AT that.

THE BLUNDERS OF GERMANY Germany's Ruthless Devo tion to Self Interest. .By WILLIAM T. HORN ADA Y. ■^TTHEN rapacity moves into the vv next house, It is time to lock your cellar door. Yoke up insatiable appetite with colossal egotism, tnd the Inevitable runaway is only a question of time. While enjoying the benefits of an In dustrial prosperity and a world-wide commerce that had won the admira tion of the world, the Germans com plained about being denied their "place in the sun"; and they reached out . after world supremacy. England and the United States were like twin thorns in the Hide of the kaiser and the German people at large. The pan T Germanists busily plotted against both those nations. Concerning England, a distinguished German-born citizen of New York, Ot to H. Kahn, wrote to a relative In Ger many June 28, 1915) as follows: "England has not abused her power at sea, . . . any more than previous to the present war you have abused your power on land. Not only has she not stood In the way of your develop ment. but on the contrary she has given you fair and free access to her markets, with unparalleled liberality." In fact, it was so "unparalleled" that by August, 1914, German commercial houses had crowded out of Singapore every British house save two! Where ever the British flag went, prior to the war, along with it went the Ger man trader. But. like the horseleech, Germany's cry was for "More"; and to get H "British sea power must be crushed!" Unmitigated rapacity, In men or In nations, ever has been and always will be a colossal blunder. , 

BLUNDER OF WORLD WIDE TREACHERY. While America' was sound asleep In the lap of peace, and England slum bered with only her sea eye open, Ger many armed herself to the teeth, and planted throughout England, France, America. Belgium, Holland, Russia and India the most colossal spy-and traitor system ever developed. She secretly armed her African colonics bo that on receipt of the famous "Wll lie-is-iU" telegram, each one of her colonies instantly was ready to fight. In 1911, while crossing Lake Tangan yika, Central Africa, on a steamer, an American lady said to a German of ficer who sat beside her at the din ner table, "Have you antf your com rade been shooting?" "Not yet!" said the officer, significantly; whereat his brother officer laughed heartily, as if at a good Joke. I,ater it became known that the business of those two officers was the supplying of machine guns to German East Africa. And still later It was learned that those guns were shipped to Dar-es-Salanm In piano-boxes, marked "Pianos." No wonder Dar-es-Salaam wan so ready to begin fighting on August 2, 1914! There are times when the blunder lugs of German "statesmen" are so rrude and raw that, when they harm no one, they are comical. Even amid the horrors of war all America is laughing over the wholesale discom fiture and final undoing of Dr. Dumba, Papen. Boy-Ed (an anythlng-but-pre eocious Boy), and Bernstorff, by a restless American newspaper man with a taste for amateur detective work after amateur crooks. One would naturally suppose that men officially designated by their wise and honorable government to play dirty tricks on the people of a friendly nation would at least have as much Intelligence as ordinary horses and dogs. But, no; not so with that Aus tro-Germnn galaxy of shining stars. One lonesome and harmless Ameri can newspaper man, John R. Rathom. of the Providence Journal, had the gall to plant an employe in a secretarial position at Excellency von Bernstorf fs elbow. Also, he put a bright American girl stenographer (with a red pencil) In the offico of the Austrian consul general In New York. And not content with those outrages, he generously planted an office on each side of the German fake-passport factory In New York, Instead qf on one side only. And it was a Providence Journal man who with most criminal careless ness changed portfolios with the astute Dr. Albert of Austria, and staged a fight on a street car—-without extra charge—while that horrible mistake was being made. And the saddest part of it all Is that nearly 48 long hours elapsed ere the lynx-eyed doctor no ticed the substitution and made a fuss about It. Mr. Rathom's most delightful story Is of his girl stenographer sitting de murely on a big box of Incriminating papers. Just prior to Its shipment to Germany, sharing her frugal lunch with the shrewd Papen, and dreamily drawing two large red hearts on the box-cover, to which the sentimental Von thoughtfully and tenderly added a red transfixing arrow. This spoon ing led to the cheap and easy identi fication of the box In Merrle England. It reads like a foolishly Impossible ro mance; but the Joke of It Is, It Is quite true. "Oh, mon! but It was peetlful!" ■e • » With all their training In treachery, and education In plotting <tnd lying and concealmei^, Dumba, Bernstorff. Papen. Boy-Ed and Albeit were onet and all the meet stupid donkeys that ever came down the pike. Not one of them knew ths first principles of the self-protection system that (tempor arily) keeps expert liars and thieves and forgers from being caught. Jumt fancy keeping check-stubs and re ceipts. and copies of letters IN LAW LESS PROCEEDINGS! Great is "Ger WILL UNCLE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN 'EM OUT FOR HIM? r ,L «OA Stmmm Uncle Walt Has fori You This Evening FOOD CONSERVATION. m 'M cutting out fat living, since folks have let me know that eating pies Is giving much comfort to the foe. I shy at ducks and geescs, and eat things I abhor, since told that fats and greases are needed in the war.

And I am feeling finer than I have felt for years; I've been an ardent diner, consuming roasted steers. I've cleaned the plate and plat ter with gluttonous delight, and kept on getting fatter until I was a sight. But now I'm eating sawdust and boiled excelsior, to help, in manner modest, our country win the war. And I am feeling fitter than since I was a lad; all day I sing and twitter, I am so beastly glad. From here to fjyL Van couver the fat men bear their load, nnd they should hoove with Hoover, since I have shown the road.

Mr. Rathom, who has enough to laugh ovor at the expense of Deutsch land-uber-alles for the rest of his life, has not shown to the world more than one-twentieth of his mirth-provoking materials. But how we do wish that by hook or by ergok William the Wit less might be told Just how stupid his diplomatic representatives really were, and how much their stupidity helped the allies. ... It has been said that liars need long memories; and it can safely be added that they also need as much intelli gence as pet monkeys. A rogue who pays his fellow rogues by checks on his bank account is utterly hopeless. The only proper place for him is the cool ing room of an asylum for idiots. The playgrounds of the great Amvr lean schoolboy have produced many a nugget of worldly wisdom. One or them is the unanswerable admonition that "Cheating never thrives." All mankind hates treachery under the cloak of friendship. After Boy-Ed. Papen, Bernstorff. Dumba and Albert, what will we think of the Germans and Austrians who are sent to us after the war. to represent their govern ments? How can Americans regard! them as anything else than spies and traitors of the same brands as their' predecessors, who will lie to us, and knife us In the back aa often and as deeply as the Interests of their gov-1 ernments may seem to require? All such "diplomats" deserve to be hanged by the governments to which they are sent.
