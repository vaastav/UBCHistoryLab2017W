To tin' Si'naU' and HniM'tif Ilrprcxciiht tirm: In transmitting to you my fourth annual message, it is with thankful ness to the Giver of all good to the Na tion. We have been blessed for the past year with peace at home and abroad, and a general prosperity has been vouchsafed to us. THE lIOSTON HRE. With the exception of the recent de v.vstating fire which swept from the earth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the city of Bos ton, there have been no overshadowing calamities within the year to record. It is gratfying to note how, like their fel low citizens in the city of Chicago, un der similar circumstances, a year earl ier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortune, and the pros pect is that their energy and persever ance will overcome all obstacles, and show the same prosperity that they would have attained had no disaster be fillen them; otherwise wo have been free from pestilence, war, and those calamities which often overtake nations, and as far as human jtulg nient can penetrate the future no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

OENEVA ARBITRATION. "When Congress adjourned in Juno a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperiled the sot tlement by friendly arbitration of the differences existing between this Gov ernment and that of Her Britanic Ma jesty. The Treaty of Washington had been referred to the Tribunal of Arbit ration \>h : .»h met at Geneva, in Switz erland. Thr arbitrators, however, dis posed of the question which had jeo pardized the whole of the treaty, and threatened to involve the two nations in unhappy relations towards each other, in a manner entirely satisfactory to this Government, and in accordance with the views and policy which it has main tained. The Tribunal, which convened in Decemltcr, concluded its laborious session on the 14th of September last; on that day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the Treaty to award a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the in demnity to 1H) paid by Great Britain to the United States for satisfaction of all claims referred to its consideration. This decision, happily, disposes of a long standing difference between the two Governments, and, in connection with another award made by the Ger man Emperor under reference to him by the same Treaty, leaves the two Governments without a shadow on their friendly relations, which it is my sincere hope may forever remain equ ally unclouded. The report of the agent of tae United States appointed to attend the Geneva Tribunal, accompan ied by protocols of the proceedings of the arbitrators, arguments of coun sel of both Governments, award of the Tribunal and apinions given by the sev eral arbirators, ia transmitted here with. I have caused to bo communi cated to the heads of the three friendly Powers, who complied with the joint request made to them under the Treatv, the thanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them respecting it, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named bv them, and my appreciation of the dig nity, patience, impartiality, and great ability with which they discharge their arduous and high functions. Her Ma jesty's Government h:is communicated to mo its appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable indus try displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbi trator najoed on iho.part <\f tbi* Gov ernment, during the protracted inquir ies and discussions of the Tribunal. I cordially unite with Her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the t' lo United States before the 1 ribunal to record my appreciation of the marked übility, unwoaricd patience DEVOTED TO NEWS, POLITICS, THE DISSEMINATION OF USEFUL INFORMATION AND THE PROMOTION OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY. OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON TERRITORY, SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 14, 1872. and the prudence nnd discretion with which he has conducted the very re sponsible and dedicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal in the part of this Govern ment, to express my sense of the tal lant and wisdom which they brought to bear in the argument and upon the re sult so happily reached. It will bo the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may bo entitled to it, of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although it is not payable, until a year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisa ble that no time be lost in making the proper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may bo due. I consequently recommend the creation of a Board of Commissioners for that pupose. THE SAN JUAN QUESTION. By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of the Treaty of the 15th of June, 1847, defining their boundary line between their respective territories, were submit ted to the arbitration of His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of the claims was most in accord ance with the true interpretation of the Treaty of 184(5. His Majesty having been pleased to undertake the arbitra tion, lias the earnest thanks of this Government and the people of the United States for the labor, pains and care which he has devoted to the con sideration of this long pending differ ence. I have caused an expression of my thanks to l>e transmitted to his Ma jesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representa tive of this Government at Berlin, con ducted the case and prepared the state ment on the part of the United States with the ability that his servcies justi fied the public iii expecting at his hands. As a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to the discussion between the Governments, as the Minister to Great Britain when the obstruction now pronounced un founded was tirst advanced, and as the agent and representative of the Govern ment to present the case and to receive the award, he has been associated with the question in all its phases, and in every has manifested a patriotic zeal and c.irnestncss in the mainte nance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended the com mission, after a patient investigation of the case and of the statement of each party. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, on the '2lst day of October last, signed his award in writing de creeing that the claim of the Govern ment of the United State* that the boundary line between the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and the United States could l>e drawn through the De- Haro channel is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on the stli of June, 1848, between the agents of Her Britannic Majesty and the United States. Copies of this case, presented in behalf of the Government, and of the statement in reply to each, and a translation of the award, are transmitted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important archipela go of islands lying between the conti nent and Vancouver island, which for twenty-six years —ever since the ratili cation of the treaty—Great Britain has held, and leaves us, for the first time in the history of the United States as a nation, without a question of disputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is my gratification to acknowledge the prompt and spontane ous action of Her Majesty's Govern ment in giving effect to the award in anticipation of any request from this Government: and before the reception of the award, signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions for the removal of her troops stationed there, and for the cessation of all ex ercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the United States in exclusive possession of the lately disputed terri tory. lam gratified to be able to an nounce that the orders for the removal of the troopß have been executed, and the military joint occupation of San Juan Ims now ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the Uuited State?. It now be comes necessary to complete the survey and determination of that por tion of the boundary lino through Do Haro channel upon which the commis sion which determined the remaining portion of the boundary line were una ble to agree. I recommend the appoint ment of a commission to act jointly with one which may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose. The experi ence of the difficulties attending the determination of our admitted line of boundary after the occupation of ter ritory wi'l it# settlement feythose ewiag allegiance to the respective Govern ments, points to the importance of es tablishing, by natural objects or other measurements, the actual lino between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining possessions of Hor Britannic Majesty. The region is • now so sparsely occupied that no con flicting interests of individuals or of ju risdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or emlNurassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter and occupy the territory, some trivial contests of neigh bors may again array the two Govern ments in antagonism; I, therefore, rec ommend the appointment of a commis sion, to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain, to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the adjoin ing possessions of Great Britain. THE 

FISHERY QUESTION. In my lust annual message I recom mended the legislation necessary on the part of the Uniteil States to bring into operation the articles of the Treaty of Washington, of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries, and to other matters touching the relations of the United States towards the British North American possessions, to be come operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part Great Britain and her possessions. That legislation, on the part of Great Britain and her possessions, had not then been had, and during tlio session of Con gress a question was raised, which, for a time, raised a doubt whether any ac tion bv Congress in the direction in dicated would become important; a question which has since been disposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of the provincial Government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the Treaty 011 the matters referred to into operation. I, therefore, recom mend your early adoptiou of legislation in the same direction, to carry out the part of the Government. THE NORTHWEST BOUNDARY. Tho Joint Commission for deter mining the boundary line between the United States and the British posses sions, between tho Lake of tho Woods and the Rocky Mountains, has been or ganized and enterel upon its work. It is desirable that the force be increased in order that the completion of the sur vey and the determination of the boun dary line may be sooner attended to, and to this end, I recommend that a sufficient appropriation be made. OFU FOREIGN RELATIONS, With France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United State:?; Germany, with whose Government and people we have so many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendlv terms. TUEATV RATIFICATIONS. Since my last annual message an ex change has been made of ratifications of the treaty with the Austro-Hunga rian Empire, relating to naturalization; also of a treaty witli thoGerman Empire, relating to consuls and trademarks; al so of a treaty with Sweden and Norway, relating to naturalization, all of which treaties have boon duly proclaimed. INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS Congress, at its last scission, having made an appropriation to defray tho ex penses of the Commissioners on the part of the United States to the International Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons appointed in that charac ter proceeded to their destination and attended the session of tho Congress. Their report shall in due season be laid before you. This Congress meets at intervals of about three years, and has hold its sessions in several of tho countries of Europe. 1 submit to your consideration the propriety of extend ing an invitation to the Congress to hold its next meeting in tho United States. The Centennial Celebration, to be held in 187G, would afford an ap propriate occasion for such meeting. TIIE VIENNA EXPOSITION. Preparations are making for the In ternational Exposition, to be held dur ing next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and tho eleva tion of industry and labor, and tho in crease of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations. Tho Exposition is to be the first which will have been hold in Eastern Europe, and it is believed that American inventors and manufac turers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their productions, if encouraged In proper aid and protection. At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this Govern ment at the Exposition. The author ity thus given has been exercised; but in the absence of any appropriation there is danger that the important ben efits which the Exposition offers will in a large degree bo lost to the citizens of the United States. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, 'ami recommend thai an adequate "ap propriation be made for the purpose. To further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I would recom mend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our Atlan- tic cities and Trieste, or the most con venient port for Vienna, the articles of exhibition. Since your last session the President, of the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his high character and by his ser vices to his country, has died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the people, a proof of contideuce on their part in his patriotism, which it is be lieved will be confirmed by the results of his administration. It is particu larly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Governments of tlio two republics to strengthen their rela tions as neighbors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to Americon citi zens in various parts of the country are made. The revolutionary conduct in which the neighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some de gree contributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that a more settled rule of order through that Republic, which may be expected from the present government, and that the acts of which just complaint have been made, will cease. The proceedings of the com mission under the convention with Mexico on the 4th of July, 

IHIJS, on the subject of claims, have unfortu nately been checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two Governments, which it is believed will prove success ful. DEPREDATION'S OS THE TEXAS FRONTIER. The Commissioners, appointed pur suant to a joint resolution of Congress, of 7th of May last, to inquire into de predations on the Texan frontier, have diligently made investigations on that subject. Their report upon the sub ject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily in complete, partly onjaccount of the lim ited appropriation made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially; but the press of that country states the fullest investi gation is desired, and that the co-opera tion of all parties concerned is invited to sjcure that end. I, therefore, recom mend that a special appropriation be made at the earliest day practicable, to enable the Commissioners on /the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. It is with regret that I have again to announce tho continuance of the dis turbed condition of the island of Cuba, and that no advance toward the pacifi cation of the discontented portion of the population has been made. While the insurrection has gained no advantages, and exhibits no more of the elements of power or of a prospect of ultimate success than were exhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not suc ceeded in its repression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result, although humanity could not be unmoved by many of its inci dents wherever they might occur. It is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt but that the continued mainten ance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to a continuation of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural result of a terrible evil. Tho abolition of slavery and the introduc tion of other reforms in the adminis tration of the Government in Cuba could not possibly fail to advance the restoration of order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberal Government of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. The law of emanci pation, which was passed more than two years since, has remained unexe cuted. In the absence of regulations for enforcement, it was but a feeble step toward emancipation; but it was a recognition of tho right, and was hailed as such and exhibited Spain in harmony with tho sentiments of hu manity and justice, and in sympathy with other powers of the Christian and civilized world. Within the past few weeks regulations for carrying out the laws of emancipation have been an nounced, giving evidence of the sin cerity of the intention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of IS7O. I have not failed to urge tho consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of a more effec tive system for tho abolition of the groat evil which oppresses a race and continues the bloody and destructive conflict close to our border, as well as the expediency and justice of conceding other reforms of which the propriety is noF questioned. " "Deeply impressed with the conviction that tho counten ancing of slavery is tho most active cause of the continuance of the un happy condition of Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of tho United States, or those claiming to be such, and largo holders iu Cuba of what is 

MEXICO. THE era.;:; REBELLION. there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening con test. In my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend such legislation as may be proper to denounce, if not to prevent and discourage American citizens from dealing in slaves. THE SOUTH AMERICAN WAR, It is gratifying to announce that the ratification of the Convention, conclud ed under the auspices of this Govern ment, between Spain on one part and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith transmitted.— It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent por.c? between the same parties. The differences, which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace between Brazil and tho Argen tine Republic, it is hoped aro in a way of satisfactory adjustment. AYith these States, as with the Republics of Central and of South America, wo intend to maintain the most friendlv relations. CLAIMS AGAINST VENEZUELA. It is with regret, however, that I announce that the Government of Venezuela has made no further payment 011 account of the awards under the Convention of 25th April, 18GG. That Republic is understood to bo now almost, if not quite, tranquillized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose 110 time in providing for the unpaid balance of its debt to the United States, which having originated in injuries to its citizens by the Venezuela authorities, and having been acknowledged pur suant to a treaty in the most solemn form known a-nong nations, would seem to derive preference over debts of a differ ent origin and contract. In a different manner this subject is again recom mended to the attention of Congress for such action as may bo deemed proper. OI R RELATIONS WITH JAPAN AND CHINA. Our treaty relations with Japan re main unchanged. An Embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visited this country during the year that is passing, but being unprovided with powers for the signing of a con vention in this country, 110 conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinion, which took place during their stay in this country, has led to a mutual appreciation of the interests which may be expected when the re vision of the treaty si mil be undertaken. In this coniiG:t:3n I renew my recom mendation of a year ago, that to give importance and add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in main taining the good opinion of these people and secure to us our share of the com merce destined to flow between tlic3e nations and the balance of trade of the commercial world, an appropriation should be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries, to serve as part of the official family of our Ministers. Our Repre sentatives would then bo placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and some other powers. As now, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for the in terpretations and translations upon natives of those countries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employ ees of foreign business houses, or the interpreters to other foreign Ministers. CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF POWER RECOMMENDED. I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion for the transfer to the Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, of all the powers and duties in relation to territory with which the Department of State is now charged by law or bv custom. INDIGENT CITIZENS ABROAD. Congress, from the beginning of the Government, has wisely made provis ion for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar pro vision, however, has been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other Govern incnts to authorize their Consuls to ex tend such relief to their citizens or subjects in extreme cases. A similar authority, and an appropriation to carry it into effect, are recommended in the case of citizens of the United States destitute or sick under such circum stances. It is well known th it our citi zens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of them are able to l>ear the expenses incident to the location, there are some who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have not friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon the charity of foreig iit'i'sj"\n do relieved at tlio priv»iv& charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most benevolent disposi tions, have nothing to spare for such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will bo taken to carry the muni ficence of Congress iiito effect, and that WHOLE NO. 631. it will not be unnecessarily or un worthily bestowed. THE TBLUWRT DEPARTMISTf. The moneys received and carried in to the Treasury during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, were: From cu5t0m5,5210,370,286 77; from sales of public lands, $2,575,714 19; from in ternal revenue, $130,042,177 73; from tax on National Banks, etc., $(>,523,396; 35); from the Pacific Railroad Compan ies, $849,801 87; from customs' fines, etc., $1,136,442 34; from fees of Con-- suls, patents, lands, etc., $2,284,095 92; from miscellaneous sources, $4,412,- 354 71; total of ordinary receipts, $364,- 094,229 91; from premiums on sales of coin, $9,412,(537 65; total net receipts, $374,010,837 50; balance in Treasury June 30th, 1871, $10,935,705 79; in cluding $1,822,835 received from un available assets; total available cash, $384,042,573 15. The net expenditures by warrants drawn daring the same period were: For civil expenses, $16,- 189,079 70; for foreign interests, $lB,- 409,369 14; Indians. $7,054,720 88; pensions, $28,533,402 70; Military es tablishment, including fortifications, river and harbor improvements and arsenals, $31,537,215 72; for naval es tablishments, including vessels and machinery and improvements at the Navy-yards, $21,249,809 90; for mis cellaneous civil expenditures, includ ing public buildings, light-houses and collecting the revenue, $42,957,329 08; interest *on public debt, $118,350,839 72; total, exclusive of principal and premium on public debt, $270,059,695 91; for premium on bonds purchased, $4,958,700 ('•'.:; for redemption of the public debt, $969,153 40; total, SIOO,- 918,520 40; total net disbursements, $377,478,210 21; balance in treasury, June 30, 1872, $107,564,356 94. Total, $384,042,573 15. From the foregoing statement it appears the net reduction of the principal of the debt during the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1872, was $99,900,253 54. The source of reduc tion is as follows: Net ordinary re ceipts during the year, $304,094,229 91 j net ordinary expenditures, including interest on public debt, $270,559,695 91; total, $94,134,535; add the amount of receipts from premiums on sales of gold in excess of premiums paid on bonds purchased, $2,454,470 89; add amount of reduction of the cash bal ance at the close of the year, accom panied with the sale at the commence ment of the year, $337,348 60; total, $99,900,253 54. This statement treats solely of the principal of the public debt by the monthly statement of pub lic debt, which adds together the prin cipal and interest due and unpaid and interest accrued to date and deduct the cash in tli3 Treasuiy. As recorded on the day of publication, the reduction was $100,544,491 28. The source of this reduction is as follows: Reduc tion, principal accounts, $99,860,003 54; reduction on unpaid interest ac counts, $330,057 56; total, $103,290,- 950 50; reduction in cash on hand, $274,640,522; total, $10,544,491 28: on the basis of the last totals, the state ments show a reduction of the public debt from the first of March, 1809, to to the present time, as follows: From March 1, 1869, to March 1, 1870, $3,- 734,782 84; from March 1, 1870, to March, 1, 1871, $117,819,630 25; from March 1,1872, to November 1,1872, (eight months), $04,047,237 84; total, $303,690,999 87. With the great re duction of taxation by acts of Congreac at its last session, the expenditures of the Government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful, however, whether any further reduction of so heavy a burthen upon the peo ple will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure of justice to holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, I would recommend that no more legislation be had upon this subject, unless it be to correct the errors of omission or commission in the present laws, until sufficient tim« hm elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to inset the current expenses of the Gov ernment and pay the interest on the public debt and provide for the sinking fund eatablishe Iby law. Preservation of our national credit is of the highest importance. Next in importance to this comes the solemn duty to provide a national currency of fixed and unvary ing value, as compared with gold, as soon as practicable, having due regard for the interests of the debt or clam and the vicissitudes of trade and com merce, and convertibly into gold at par.
