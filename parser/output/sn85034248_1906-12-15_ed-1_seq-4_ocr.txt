Skip this paragraph, for it is m. ta hackneyed and uninteresting subject: just a reminder that every man be tween the ages of 21 and 60 years who fails to pay his poll tax before the end of the present month will deprive him self of the right to vote at any of the elections to be held in Louisiana during the years 1907 and 1908.

A prominept citizen of the seventh ward. writes to The Chief as follows, under;date of Thursday, Dec. 13: "The first through train from Shreveport to New Orleans over the Louisiana Rail way and Navigation Company's line, consisting of nineteen freight cars and one passenger coach, passed through Gonzales this morning. The firm of Gonzales Bros. shipped two carloads of cotton seed from Gonzales, which was the only freight sent out of that place today. Commencing next Mon day, daily passenger trains will be operated between Godzales and An gola." Fine wines and liquors especially adapted for medicinal and family use, owing to the fact that they are pure and ripe with age, may be obtained in any quantity less than five gallons at Fred.

Reynolds, well known as an able poetiy and prose writer and an excellent practical printer, is editor and proprietor. Mr. Reynolds has been in harness many years, having been connected with The Chief more than siien of them before removing to Plaquemine, where he acqired a "local habitation and a na"i that should assure the success of his latft venture in the journalistic field. The New Enterprise is a non political paper, with a fine showing of advertising patronage, and among its valuable and interesting features is an educational department conducted with manifest ability by Prof. C.

A cogent reason why the Bayou La fourche dam at Donaldsonville should be replaced with a lock as soon as possible has been developed by the forces of nature. The bayou is being transformed from a fresh-water stream into a salt-water canal, and the people of the lower valley, most of whom were supposed to be either indifferent or opposed to the removal of the dam, are now becoming even more insistent on the subject, if possible, than their neighbors of the upper part of the sec tion traversed by the Lafourche. This phase of the question has been brought into prominence through the newspaper discussion engendered by the remarkable contention of the Iber ville South ard West Baton Rouge Sugar Planter that the Atchafalaya and Lafourche levee boards would be justified in ignoring the obligation imposed upon them by their own vol untary pledge to the federal govern ment and by the specific direction and command of the general assembly to replace the dam with a lock. The Iber ville paper recently remarked that the Lafourche Comet, after virtually agreeing with the South, underwent a sudden change of heart and came to the conclusion that the locks are a necessity. "If that be the case," says the South, "why not let us get to gether and try to get the national government to build them just as it is doing at Plaquemine? The general government can do the job better, doubtless, than the levee boards, and without the danger of bankrupting it self and causing a vast deal of prop erty to be placed in danger of inad equate protection against floods. Would or would it not be shameful for these levee boards to bankrupt themselves and place in danger thou sands and thousands of people and a million dollars of property?" To this the Comet replies: "We based our opinion regarding the Iber ville South and the question of locks upon the South's aeclaration that nine-tenths of the people of the two levee districts concerned were satisfied with existing conditions. We find, however, that the South was wrong in its assertion, for it seems that nine tenths of the people desire locks. There is only one reason for this, how ever, and that is owing to the saline condition of the water in the bayou. All admit, singe salt Water has backed up from the gulf, that lqcks are abso lutely necessary. If it were not for the salty and damaging condition of the water in the bayou, and if nine tenths of the people were satisfied without locks, we would still declare it would be a useless expense to have locks. Regarding the proposition that the national government take charge of the locks, we have no objection whatever. Such .a course would un doubtedly relieve the levee boards of a great financial burden, but judging by the length of time taken to build she Plaquemine locks there is no tell ing when ours would be constructed." It cannot be admitted that the trans formation of the bayou into a com paratively useless salt-water canal is the only reason for the strong and increasing popular demand for the construgion of the Lafourche lock. It is one reason and a very good one, to be sure, but there is another equally potent and insurmountable, based upon public morality and the inviola bility of contracts. It involves the individual honor of the members of the levee boards as well as their pub lic characters and obligations. Better by far that these boards should "bankrupt themselves" finan cially in the effort to carry out their agreement and perform their official duty, than to incur the moral bank ruptcy that must follow the deliberate attempt to repudiate the agreement and evade the duty.. -It will be time enough to invoke the assistance of the federal government in the construction of the Lafourche lock after the levee boards have showp their good faith in the matter by mak ing a start at the work. If it then appears that the task is greater than had been anticipated and that its accomplishment within a reasonable time must depend upon the willingness of the general government to come to the rescue, it is quite probable that congress will authorize such action. Providence helps those who.help them selves, and it is not reasonable tp ex pect Uncle Sam to do more than that. Isn't a Reduction in OrderZ A reduction of the exorbitant rates of fire insurance levied upon the prop erty holders of Donaldsonville, we mean, The specific promise was made on behalf of the companies represented here that when the improvement and extension of the municipal waterworks should be completed in accordance with the plans recommended to and adopted by the town council, a very material reduction would,be made in the prev alent fire insurance.rates. The work has been finished in good shape. Besides being provided with a waterworks system that comprises more and larger mains, more and better hydrants and increased pres sure, we have a supply of new hose distributed among the town's three alert and active hose companies, while the hook and ladder company is well equipped with the paraphernalia ap propriate to such an organization. Several opportunities have been of fered for a practical display of the efficiency of the waterworks and tie fire department since the improvements herein briefly noted have become available, and the result in each in stance has been of the most gratifying character. Donaldsonville has carried out her part of the agreement with the fire in surance companies to the full, both in letter and spirit. The party of the second part should now come to the front with a similar performance of its share of the obligation. The President's Messages. A summary of the salient points of the message sent to congress by President Roosevelt at the opening of the present session is- published on the first and eighth pages of today's Chief, and it is scarcely necessary to say that the doc ument is characteristic of the compre hensive ability,knowledge and obser vation of its disthigiished author. Even those of his most uncompromising and critical political opponents find diueb more to praise in the paper than to condemn. The president has sent in a special message on Porto Rico, rec ommending among uther things that the rights of citizenship be conferred upon the people of the isla.d, and this will soon be followed by a special mes sage on ,ab @bject of .hae Panama canaL 

SUGAR SQUIBS. Items of Interest from Field and Factory. Grinding Campaign Nearing an End in Ascension and Elsewhere. The Belle Helene central factory terminated the grinding campaign Thursday afternoon, and Col. Jos. S. Webster's Point Houmas is now the only Ascension house still in operation. Owing to lack of space an interesting resumb of the season's work at Belle Helene is crowded out of today's issue, but will appear next week without fail. St. Emma finished grinding at noon Wednesday, after having been in operation since Monday, Oct. 29. The cane handled aggregated about 11,000 tons, against 14,000 tons ground last season, and it is probable that no other plantation in the parish has made a better comparative show ing in' this respect than St. Emma. No figures are yet available as to the yield of sugar per ton of cane and the total number of pounds of sugar produced. The following paragraphs are quoted from this week's Ascension letter to the Louisiana Planter: "Germania factory crushed the last of 6000 tons of cane on Thursday, the 6th inst., and while the showing is a poor one as compared with last year's work, which embraced the manipula tion of 13,000 tons of cane, there is no repining at Germania and plans are being laid to make up in 1907 for the crop shortcomings of 1906. "O. B. Danjean's Richbend factory, in St. James parish, finished grinding last Saturday and got through boiling at noon, M.,l], +v. The campaign ex tended throe , A,irty-one days, during which time 5,77 tons of cane were sent through the will. The output includes syrup, open kettle sugar, molasses, etc., and therefore cannot be definitely reckoned in pounds. Joseph F. Oubre, of Donaldsonville, officiated as chief sugar-boiler at Ricbbend, as in former years, and John Latil of Union, was his assistant. Ernest and George Chauvin, well-known St. James me chanics, were chief and assistant engineer respectively. The machinery moved smoothly throughout the entire season. "The St. Joseph Planting and Man ufacturing Company's St. Joseph factory, also in St. James, wound up the season's work last Saturday eve ning after an unprecedentedly short run. Approximately 6150 tons of cane were ground, from which something like 800,000 pounds of sugar were produced. Last year St. Joseph turned out a total of 1,500,000 pounds of sugar, and in the splendid season of 1904 about 2,000,000 pound. Rene Simon, of Feitel, was in charge of the -sugar--b-oilng dopartvmnt, while Cals T. Chapman and Robert Chapman, both of Darrow, respectively filled the posts of chief and assistant engineer. "Charles S. Mathews' Georgia fac tory in Lafourche parish began grind ing October 25, when the cane was very low in saccharine content, testing 7.51 sucrose and 59.1 purity. The mill continued under slow bells until No vember 4, crushing about 500 tons of cane per day so as to keep field and factory hands employed, After the 4th cane began to improve. The weight of cane ground during the suc ceeding weeks was as follows: Third week, 5550 tons; fourth week, 4000 tons; fifth week, 6052 tons; sixth week, 7170 tons; seventh week, 6200 tons; making a total up to the 9th of December of 35,415 tons, which has yielded an average of 137.81 pounds of commer cial sugar to the ton. There remained approximately 12,000 tons of cane to grind, and it is planned to finish this up before Christmas. Last year Geor gia ground 70,000 tons of cane, mak ing over 11,000,000 pounds of sugar. Mr. Mathews was away nearly all the summer for the benefit of his health, and has returned looking fit and fine. The factory crew at Georgia comprises E. F. Dickenson, general manager; Fritz Frese, engineer; T. J. Burke, sugar boiler; John Fuchs, chemist. '.'The Godchaux Company's Raceland central factory, also in Lafourche parish, start6d the work of the grind ing season on the same date Georgia 1 began-October 25. Raceland's rollers I have turned without interruption] every day, the only stops being twelve t hours on Sundays to wash out, and it is expected that this clip will be kept up until the 1st of January. An aver- t age of 900 tons of cane per day is I being put through one seven-foot mill. i Stubble cane has averaged about 12 tons to the acre and plant about 18 tons. The sugar yield cannot be cor- v rectly estimated, as it has been found I profitable to make only syrup during E the past two weeks." For Over Sixty Years MRS.

Revival of steamboating on the Mis sissippi river and its tributaries is a cause that should receive the support' and encouragement of everybody. Not only the people of the great Mis sissippi valley, but those of all other parts of the nation will feel the bene fits of the restoration of these mighty natural arteries of transportation and trade to the degree of importance they once possessed with relation to the country's commerce. The constantly growing demand for increased facili ties for handling our crops and pro ducts justify congress in lending all possible aid towards the deepening of channels and otherwise improving the navigation of the rivers of the United States ingeneral and of the Mississippi and its tributaries in particular. John Sharp Williams says that Go.. Vardaman is a monomaniac on the negro question and doesn't understand southern sentiment with reference thereto. Don't you believe it, John. There's method in Injun Vardaman's madness and he knows the calibre of Mississippi's Democracy. He got into the governor's chair over the heads of several better men by cussin' the nigger, and he's not unlikely to capture a senatorial seat by the same tactics. Vardaman's nigger cussin' gets closer to the hearts of a raft of Mississippians than Williams' sound logic and enlightened statesmanship ever will.

Octave Thiac, of New Orleans, and Miss Eleanore Truxillo, an attractive young woman of Paincourtville, were married at the St. Francis of Assis slum Catholic church in Smoke Bend Thursday of last week, the 6th inst., BRev. Charles Tessier officiating. After the ceremony the happy couple re paired to the residence of the bride's brother, Santiago Truxillo, in Nich oils avenue, where a sumptuous repast was served and a pleasant time enjoyed. Subsequently Mr. and Mrs. Thiac left for their future home in New Orleans, taking with them the cordial felicita tions and good wishes of a host of friends in this community and else where. Ascension Council No. 1087, Knights of Columbus, held an interesting meet ing in the old Catholic church building at the conclusion of high mass last Sunday forenoon, a large number of members being in attendance.

The attention of holiday buyers is directed to the advertisement of Fred. 1 Linde, the well-known Railroad ave nue jeweler, which appears elsewhere in today's Chief. On account of re tiring from business, Mr. Linde is dis posing of his tasty and attractive stock of watches, diamonds, jewelry, I silverware, bronze novelties, leather goods, etc., at prices hitherto unheard of in Donaldsonville, and the bargains offered in appropriate Christmas presents for men, women and children are particularly tempting and desir able.
