His views were mostly taken by himself on his travels around the world, or else they were taken by other members of his party and exchanged. The Archdeacon has a valuable col- kong, Canton, Korea (including Che mulpo, Fusan and Seoul), Japan and the Inland Sea, Port Arthur and Vladi vostok. He also has some excellent photographs of prominent Russian of ficers both naval and military. In connection with his Canton pic tures, the Archdeacon spoke of the fact that nearly every Chinese in Ha waii or the United States is from Can ton. He also remarked that two con suls, the retiring and tne incoming one (presumably American consuls), told him that during the late war the guage, familiarizing themselves with u..,.i v.

The practical importance - of this movement can readily be appreciated. It will involve much expense, but the immediate addition to our population of a thousand families, of JSuro- - pean extraction and capable of rapid assimilation, will sensibly and materially improve the business conditions of Hawaii. But this is only one of the measures tending to arrest the departure of American citizens and to promote the increase of that most desirable class. The land policy of the territorial government has been liberalized, and there is a prospect of large sections being opened to settlement. If a bargain is struck -with the proposed Russian emigrants from southern California, who are intelligent, moral and thrifty, and in no respect identified with the ignorant and now turbulent masses of Muscovy, the, ranks of Hawaiian producers will iirrQ normQTipnt nn1 most welcome addition.

This declaration, sustained by facts and figures, should have a wide influence and should be energetically and systematically backed up by the territorial authorities, who can thus meet the prevalent arguments in iavor of the relegation of the public lands to Fedeial control. The policy of Asiatic exclusion is almost unanimously sustained upon the mainland and in Congress and has received the direct sanction of the adminis tration. It rests upon grounds that have been lately grouped together in the columns of the Advertiser, over' the signatures of well-known citizens. It is also vigorously supported by territorial, state and national organizations of wage-earners. The prospect is that it will not be modified but extended, proba bly with the sanction of the Japanese Empire, to Japanese and Koreans, in fact to. all Asiatics. A determination is also evinced to stop the intrusion of Asiatics, with their peculiar and un-American economics, into the mechanical industries and even into trade and commerce, within the United States. It is claimed that Americans and American firms and corporations that employ citi zen labor are unable to reduce their expense accounts to a scale that will enable them to compete with alien Asiatics, wherever the latter exist in suffi cient numbers to organize raids upon business. American mechanics are at least equal to any mechanics in the world. But they are accustomed to liberal wages and to comfortable homes, and they can not and will not come down to Asiatic standards. If they are erowded out of employment, in Hawaii for instance, on an American basis, they will go, as they have gone, elsewhere. The same facts and reasoning apply to small trading and even to commercial enterprises of ' came so accustomed to this sort of utility, and importance. It is insisted that America is principally for the, Americans, that they are not to be excluded from different occupations, to which they have the first right, and that it is the plain duty of the Federal government to sustain the American people against aliens who are incapable of naturalization. ' : These propositions are being discussed by leading newspapers and by all classes of citizens, but especially within the ranks of unionized labor, here and on the mainland. They are pressed upon Congress, which is quickly responsive to. public opinion, and have attracted the active interest of the heads of de partments and of the Chief Executive of the Nation. It is highly probable that drastic legislation will be enacted that will operate throughout the Union, and that, in the territories and other possessions, where the national legislature ia virtually supreme, Asiatic competition with citizens will be at least controlled and, perhaps destroyed. Meanwhile it is an auspicious fact. that, in Hawaii, the process of Americanization has been accelerated by the efforts of its own people. o 

JOHN H. MITCHELL. The death of Senator Mitchell ends his career in the best way. Torn from high plaee by legal process there was nothing' for him to live for. To such a man a conviction of felony must necessarily be a death warrant, sooner or later. In Mitchell's case it was sooner. Remembering the kindly ways, the benevolent looks and the cheerful philosophy of the Oregon Senator it is difficult to say of hira what justice de iinands. Men worse than he have been able to take refuge behind the humane admonition, De mortuis nil nisi bonum; and we may well' let him hide there in - his unhappy fellowship. But as a warning his life may serve a useful purpose as' showing where the national tendency towards what vre have come to know as "graft" must lead. What more fitting comment on the school of polities to which John II. -jiitcbell belonged than these words of Nicholas Murray Butler: Put bluntly, the situation which confronts Americans today is due to lack of moral principle. New statutes may be needed, but statutes will not put moral principle where it does not exist. The greed for gain and the greed for power have blinded men to t&e time-old distinction between right and wrong. Both among bus iness men and at the bar are to be found advisers, counted shrewd and successful, who have substituted the penal code for the moral law as the standard of conduct. Eight and wrong have given way te the subtler distinction between legal, not illegal, and illegal; or fcetter, perhaps, between honest, law-honest, and dishonest. The iew triumph of mind over morals is bad enough in itself ; but when im addition, its exponents secure material gain and professional prosperity it becomes a menace to our integrity as a people." t,i n , wtv. toticm v 911,1 lnnllv is thorouehlv customs auu muue . ui uiuusni ui uarcu vr. uiiuiii, ' 1 i.v w 1 1- . . .... . . . - - CT. . ly expected, had the war lasted long enough, to have not only taken Ko rea, but Canton and part of China as well. The harbor of Chemulpo is exceed ingly shallow' and with a tide of thirty five feet, it is dangerous, but the Rus sian warships risked it when the Japa nese would not. They staid outside and demanded that the Russians come out and fight on equal footing. In Ko rea there are no temples, the Arch deacon remarked, but there are plenty of "devil-posts" intended to be so hide ous that even the devils will be fright ened away. That kingdom is called "The Land of the Morning Calm" and the name is well given, as the people are almost too lazy to breathe. The speaker related an amusing in cident in connection -with the Korean Emperor, who is so afraid of his life, after the murder of the Empress, that he spends haf the night leaning over his garden wall adjoining the Amer ican legation and imploring the Amer icans to protect him. The American soldiers on guard at the legation be- thing that they finally got into the habit of singing out familiarly to His Imperial Majesty, "Oh, go to bed, dad, we will keep our eyes open." An interesting side light on the lib erality of the Japanese was the pic ture of Japanese converts to the Greek Catholic faith made by the captured Russian Bishop. Among them were of ficers of the Japanese army in full uni form, sitting alongside Russian soldiers and priests. A group of the aborig ines of Japan was unique. They are dying out like the American Indians, but they have the largest brains of any people in the world. A case of big head and little in it. ...f WILLIS, JR., BANKRUPT. LOUISVILLE, Nov. 21.

When Mother Parker was born there was not, it is believed, a four story house on the continent. She antedated the locomotive, the telegraph, the sewing machine the cotton gin, the steamship, the steel pen, the photograph, the fast printing press, the horse car, illuminating gas, applied electricity, machine-made wares of nearly every kind, most of the medicines now in use and a thousand and one comforts and utilities as common now as soda water, ice cream and the lucifer match. Before her has passed the most remarkable spectacle of growth and progress in material things the world has ever looked upon. o The never-failing objects of sympathy in Hawaii are the lepers at Kala,, papa.
