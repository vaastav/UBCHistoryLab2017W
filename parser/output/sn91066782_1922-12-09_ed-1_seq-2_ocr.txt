Oeorges Clemen ceau, closing his visit to Washington yesterday afternoon with a "formal" address, expressed the hope that diplo macy would find the way to bring America back into European affairs through what he interpreted, as an overture' by President Harding in the annual message which the execu tive had read to Congress afew hours earlier. "I am greatly comforted," said the war-time premier of i ranee, "when 1 read in the message of your president the following lines. They are not very long, but tbey are very suggestive." The four-power pact, which abol ishes every probability of war on the Pacific, has brought a new confidence in maintained peace, and I can well be lieve it miirht be made a model for like assurances wherever in the world any common interests are concerned.' "So you see," continued the Tiger, "that even those who are supposed to disagree, really agroe at the very bot tom of the feeling and reasoning, pow er. That is what I ask, and I hope this is something like an" overture, that some light will be coming and I will be vry glad if it comes from America, and I hope that diplomacy will have something to say about it, and talks may be engaged in which I am sure can bring nothirtg but good for us aUV When Clemenceau's reference to the president's message was called to the attention of the White House it was said that there was no comment to be made and that there was no intention of elaborating on the president's state ment to Congress. Clemencesu's address, delivered be fore an audience which included many diplomats; government officials . and members of both houses of Congress was. in its essence, the "peace messaire" he first delivered in Chicago. But, ap parently sensing that official Wash ington would judge of him and his mis sion by his speech he spoke deliberate ly, and chose his words with great precision. I do not ask for money.
