A second and third new route w II he proposed lor the consideration of Congress, namely, by an extension of the Kanawha *nl James river Ctoal to the Oftio, and by the extension of iba Cb? 8'tp ake and 0 ? io ctnal. I am not pr?p*red io recommend what the gov ernment sha I do to these or other en* t--r>Ti-es until it is clearly shown that they aren^t only of eattooal interest, but tha1, when completed, they will be of a value commensurae wi'h their cost.

I would ibereiore sug gest that a commission be authors d to c insider th a whole question and to re port to Congress at some future day tor its better gu dtnce in legiilaiing on this important ?ti ' j -ct. Tue railrcalsof the connirv have been rapidly expended du r ng the last few year* to meet the growing demand of products, ardrtfl ct mu:b credi; up<m the capital sts and i managers engaged in their construction. In addition to these, to facilitate com merce t>v the building of a ship canal ?r und Niagara Fills on the United S ate* s d?*, which has been agitated Icr mar y years, will no doubt be called to vour attention at this session.
