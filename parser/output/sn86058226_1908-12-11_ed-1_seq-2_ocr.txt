A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT BYES OF THE SPORTING WORLD ' ARE NOW TURNED TOWARD BOUT TO BE HELD TONIGHT DEMETRAL HAS FUTURE. , Charles Ol&on has a very gooi rea son for wishing to defeat Demetral, the Greek demon, in the match at the Coliseum this evening. It is announced that arrangements have been practically completed for a match In -the near future between 01 son and Fred Beel at the' Chicago Col Iseum for a purse of $1,000. Beel, with out doubt is one of the most wonderful wrestlers in the world, however, not long ago he dropped a large sum of money by failing to throw Demetral in an hour. Should Olson be able to de feat the Greek, he will feel confident that he has a good show of winning from the Kio pound Wisconsin marvel Richmond people probably do not appreciate the fact that 7 this evening when Olson and Demetral meet, one of the most important events in the sport ing world will be pulled off. Both men are of championship calibre and the result of the match will be watch ed with keen interest throughout the country. Olson is, without doubt, one of the best wrestlers of his weight in the world. The same is true of Demetral, who has a record of only eight defeats In his career. His victories is a long list, having defeated not only Olson himself, biit such men as Leo Pardel- lo, John Rooney, Chris Pearson, Wink ' elboefer,, All Hamlt Carl Pons, Bob Douglas, Farmer Burns, Dan McLeod, Carl Busch, Wassan and Turner. ' In Europe, Hackenschmidt, whom Qotch defeated for the world's cham pionship, failed to throw him once In an hour. Gofch failed to throw him in forty-five minutes and he defeated Jim Parr, English light heavyweight champion for the- English light heavy weight championship. His champion ship belt is now: on exhibition here. ' Demetral has a wonderful future ahead of him. He Is only 23 years of age and has not yet come into the full strength of his jnagnificent manhood. Lean of shank, he Is, but his chest and arms are marvels ot development. The man who makes the mistakes tonight is the one who loses. Prior to the big match Prank Prindle and Joe LaSalle will meet.

The date for the meeting of the city board of finances has been changed from December SO to Jan imnr 4. 9 ' K ' A WILLIAM DEMETRAL AND HIS Affairs of the Evidently the wolf is steering clear of Ownie Bush's door. The Detroit champions paid him a full share of the world's series money, $Sk. For play ing twenty games with Detroit (win ning for them the American league pennant) he received a salary of $250. A rich Tiger rooter, who won heavily on them, gave him a $350 diamond and then he received numerous gifts, such as clothing, overcoats, etc. Hugh Jennings has Bush slated for third base next season, benching the veteran Coughlin. Moreover, Ownie has a roar coming. He says he will play at shortstop or no place. Maybe he will change his mind. "That boy is a wonder at third base," remarked Clarence Jessup, who "discovered" him. "When I took him to Saginaw, I played him at third. I never saw such handling of bunts, line drives, etc. I will be he makes as big a sen sation at third, if played there, as he has at shortstop." And now they say that Cincinnati is to figure Schlei, its star catcher, in a three cornered trade. Report has it that New York will trade Bresnahan to St. Louis for Pitcher Raymond, Out fielder Murray and Catcher Ludwig. New York will then turn Ludwig over to Cincinnati for Schlei. Stung. Clark Griffith has not yet come to terms with Cincinnati. He is holding out for $10,00 salary, but Hermann can't see it. If Griffith does take the fierce job of handling the Reds, he will have full sway over their destinies sAmething no other Red manager ever had. THE THEATER Vaudeville New Phillips. The sketch at the New Phillips be ing played this week, "The Girl Ahead", one of the best written play lets on the boards today, is none too good a vehicle for Mildred Williams and Frederick Force. Actors in a one act play must be good to keep up in terest. Merc jokes cannot stimulate the audience, and here is where this pair is strong. Force gives a splen did character study, and Miss . Wil liams' musical genius is so naturally woven in, that the mesh can hardly be noticed. She is a wonder in her line, and her novelty feature, "The Human Ocarino'' is altogether new. The rest of the bill keeps up the standard of the headliner. "A Knight for a Day." The attraction at the Gcnnett Thurs day, Dec. 17. will be "A Knight for a Day." Miss May Yokes heads a cast o fabout 70 engaged in the presentation Produced initially in Chicago about two years ago, the production won a run that consummated 007 perform ances uninterruptedly, at the Whitney theater. Brought direct to New York early last autumn, the production caught on instntly at Wallack's thea ter, where it attracted turnaway crowds steadily up to the end of the theater's regular season In May. Transported to Boston with the close of the New Yck run. the gaiety re mained the attraction at the Tremont theater all through the summer. Scen Ically and spectacularly, too, the pro duction is uniformly conceeded to dif fuse rare charm. Contrary to the suggestion possibly imparted by its ti tle, "A Knight for a Day" has nothing to do with interests mediaeval. The knight of the story isn't a knight, but a waiter posing as a nobleman. Serv ing a modern knight one day and fail ing to be tipped, the waiter tips him self to the knight's credentials and goes a treatirre t roving for twenty four hours. Bat It Is In unexpected adventures and misadventures that the laughs of the conceit are evoked. A special feature of the production are the electrical effects, which with out doubt, are the most beautiful epeo- 4A WRESTLING PARTNER. Sporting World Cy Young is unlike most players who bay, "this will be my latst sea son." The grand old man of the di amond says "after next season I will retire." We would like to suggest that Cyrus will probably be on the mound for many years. He Is like wine improves with age. It Is said that Bobby Lowe, for many years a big league star, playing with Boston, Chicago and Detroit, suc cessively, may manage the New Castle team in the Ohio and Pennsylvania league next season. Last year he was manager of the Grand Rapids team in the Central .league. He would be the most expensive manager in the O. and P. league. Charles Comiskey of San Antonio, drafted by the Washington American league club, made a unique ,1JMW rec ord. He led the regular outfielders, and also the shortstops in outfielding. was second in the league in stolen bas es, having sixty-nine to his credit, set the mark for the league in runs scor ed with and batted .287.

It has developed that one of the causes of the squabble between Frank Chance and Charley Murphy was the manager's complaint about the way the world's series tickets were han dled In Chicago the same scandal that has been taken up by the national commission.

THEPR0SECUT0R Jessup Had Birthday Anniver sary Thursday. It was an unusual birthday honor accorded Prosecutor Jessup at the city building yesterday afternoon. Jessup was thirty-two and he was spanked good and proper by the members of the police force. He refused to make a speech and thereupon the "nippers' were applied to his wrists. He was taken to the front office of police headquarters and upon promising ever afterward to be a "perfect lady" was released. CITY IN BRIEF Public invited it. H. S. Fall Festival tonight.

Weighs 300 Pounds and It Will Be Hard to Move Her to The Hospital. WAGON SEEMS NECESSARY SHERIFF MEREDITH PERPLEXED AS IT FALLS UPON HIM TO SEE THAT SHE IS TAKEN TO EAST HAVEN. Less than five feet tall, weighing COO pounds and insane, Adelia Weaver presented a perplexing problem to the county sheriff today. Provision for her admittance to the Eastern Indiana Hospital for the insane had been made, but the sheriff knew not how to transport her to the institution. Miss! Weaver resides in the country about four miles north of the city. Because ; of her size thirty incres across, the woman could not be placed in a coach. She would be unable to enter the door. Her weight was so great she could not j be placed In a wagon that was very j high from the ground without the aid ; of a hoisting machine. The sheriff endeavored to secure a wagon u.sed for the moving of pianos and this after noon said unless he secured such a ve hicle, he did not know how he would solve the question. Miss Weaver was in the hospital some time ago and released as cured. At that time she weighed about 10O pounds. Since returning to the home of her parents, she has amassed flesh so rapidly that she weighs fully oX pounds. It is imperative that she be taken to the hospital. Her parents have found it impossible to control her. When in a prostrate condition she can not be raised except of her own ac cord. When in a tantrum she will not permit herself to be touched and pushes out with her hands in resist ance. Her great bulk makes it a dif ficult proposition to induce her to do anything against her will. Sheriff Meredith admitted this morn ing he was in a quandary and was ac cepting all kinds of suggestions as a solution. He had been told by the young woman's father lie could not take her to the asylum. The law makes it necessary for the sheriff to attend to the transportation of the insane to the hospital, so the position of the sheriff is not hard to realize.

In the past there have been considerations, political and oth erwise, which made It advisable that there be mutual restraint In the ex pression of tnese views. These con siderations are now largely removed, and the country may settle down to have a good time observing the ex changes of "hot shot." The president lead off with that lit tle paragraph in his annual message about members of congress being afraid of the activities of the treasury secret service and congress was not slow to resolve upon a counter blow. As there are not likely to be any ser ious casualties, let the war proceed merrily. So no Need of Ships. The naval committees of congress do not seem any more disposed than they were last winter to agree with the president upon the necessity of authorizing the construction of four battleships a year. The program is advocated again in the president's message and in the annual report of the secretary of the navy, but the vet erans of the naval committees and in senate and house remain unimpressed. It is true that there is today a larg er number than ever before of indivi dual members of congress who favor a larger program of naval construc tion, but they are well night power less so long as the naval committees remain as now organized. Consul R. E. Holaday. of Santago de Cuba, reports that the orange crop of Cuba this year will be the largest in the history of the island and will reach 500,000 boxes. Until the last three years large quantities of oranges were annually imported into Cuba from Florida and California, and while the scientific cultivation of the fruit is yet in its infancy, its developement has been so rapid and generally pro fitable that it is believed that in an other year the industry will have pro gressed sufficiently to cupply the lo cal demand for the fruit. The busi ness of orange culture in Cuba is al most entirely In the hands of Ameri cans.
