The only incident of the trip was a storm off Hatteras. Capt- ' Davi3 be lieves the wireless messages were faked. FAKE PERPETRATED. Washington. Dec. 10. Suspicion that fake wireless messages may have been sent out by some amateur, reporting disaster on the steamer Rio Grande has led tbe bureau of navigation of the de partment of commerce to start an in vestigation. The penalty is fine or Im prisonment or both. The messages were received at New York and Nor folk Sunday night telling of fire aboard the Rio Grande and saying 197 pas sengers had been taken off the vessel and later returned. The dispatches, read by many wire less operators about Virginia Capes, were transmitted to the revenue cut ter service which immediately rushed two cutters to sea and later called them back after communicating with the Rio Grande herself and being as sured she was In no need of aid. A confusion of ship's names also per plexed would-be rescuers. The dis patches said the Rio Grande's passen gers were taken off by the steamer Swanmore. which was at that moment at her wharf in Baltimore. The res cuers then raised the Merchant and Mirers, liner Suwanee, thinking she might be the rescuing ship, but her captain knew nothing of the report. !

WAYDfl Nick Mackers, Conducting Store at Corner of Garden and Spring, Shot by Young White Man When He Fail- ed to Throw Up His Hands When Commanded. When Nick Mackers, a Greek, pro prietor of a store at the corner of Spring and Garden streets, failed to throw up his hands at the command ot a highwayman last night, he received n bullet in the back, but It Is not thought that his wound will prove fatal. There were two other Greks In the store at the time, but they became so excited when the shot was fired thai they were unable to tell the, police in what direction the would-be robber went after the shot was fired. The Greeks say that the party who did the shooting is a young white man, about 22 years of age, and that they believe they would recognize him if they saw him r- ain. Officers went to the store immediately after Mackers was wounded, but the man who fired the shot has not yet been arrested. According to the three Greeks' state ments, the young man stood on the sidewalk in front of the store and with a drawn revolver demanded them to throw up their hands, but all of them except one obeved. The three Greeks were at different places in the store, Mackers being In the rear por tion and .the other two up toward the front. When the man outside told them to hold up their hands, one of the Greek" asked him what he meant, and he re plied that he meant business. At thi? moment Mackers turned his back toward the man, one. of the other Greeks made an effort to raise his hands, but the third one says he does not remember wh?t he was doing at this time, according to the report made by the police. As Mackers turned, the man on the sidewalk fired, the bullet striking him in the back entering a little above the kidneys. He was carried to the Pensacola sanitar ium, where he was attended by Cits Physician Nobles. The man who fired the shot did not attempt to enter the store after he wounded Mackers, but immediately left the scene. He called at the store about 10 o'clock.
