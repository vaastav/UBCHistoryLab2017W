SENSIBLE DISCUSSION OF LABOR QUESTION, ALMOST EVERY MATTER OF PUBLIC INTERESTED ADVERT TO IN LONG AND ABLE DOCUMENT. Washington, December 5. President Roosevelt was noti- fled at 11 o'clock today by a joint commission consisting of Senators Allleon and Morgan and Representatives McCleary, Littaurer and Williams that congress had assembled and organized and was ready to receive any message he might desire to deliver to it The president expressed gratiflca- Hon at the convening of con- gress and requested the com- mittee to present his compll- ments to the two branches and say he would communi- cate to them at once in writ- Ing. The president's message was read soon after the convening of the senate. There was an exceptionally large attendance t of senators, and moat of them followed closely the reading of the message by Secretary Ben- nett and his assistants, who read as follows: , To the Senat and House of Repres entatives: v,.: , ;:.v. ,i ;,:;v.:;.,v. The people of this country continue tq enjoy great prosperity. Undoubted ly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more on less by all members of the community, both by the deserv ing and the undeserving. Against the wrath of the Lord the wisdom of man can not avail; In times of flood or drought hqman ingenuity can but par tially repair the dlsaste-. A general failure of crops would hurt all of ns. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the sepeculatlve folly of part of the business commu nity would hurt the whole business community. But such stoppage of welfare, though It might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country is the high Individual character of the average American worker, the average Ame rican citizen, no matter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he be farmer or wage-worker, business man or professional man' In our Industrial and social system the interests of all men are so closely Intertwined that In the Immense ma jority of cases a straight-dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingen uity and Industry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man of great productive capacity who becomes rich .by guiding the labor of many other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could produce without his guid ance; and both he and they share the benefit, which comes also to the pub lic at large.' The superficial fact that the sharing may be unequal must never blind ns to the underlying fact that there Is this sharing, and that the benefit conies in Bonie degree to each man concerned. Normally the wage-earner, the man of small means and- the average comuinii", as well s the average producer, are all alike helped by making 'conditions such that the man of exeepiional business ability receives an exceptional reward for, his ability.. Something can be done by legislation to help tli Jtren eral prosperity; but no such help of a permanently beneficial character can be given to the bssbs fclven to the les able and Icfb fortunate, nave as the reults of a policy whlrh shall Inure lo the advantage? of a'l Inoustrlous and effleirnt ppople whoact decently; and this Is only another way of saying thrt any bennfit which conies to the lss fortunate must of necessity come to the more abb and fortunate. If, therefore, the less fortunate man I moved by envy of Us more fortunate bro'.her to sfrik? at tha conditions un der which thry have both, thonsh tin equally, pronered, the result will as suredly be that while waning may rotite to the one struck at. it win visit wi:h an evtn heavier load the one who strikes tiio.blow. Taken as a whol we must all go up or go down together. OF 

PRESIDENT THEODORE If III TOW TO THE FIFTY- llllllll ON THE RATE REGULATION QUESTION. DEFINITE POSITION ASSUMED THAT THE FIX A MAXIMUN RATE IS WITHIN THE LEGITIMATE FUNCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT, HONESTY EXALTED, Yet, while not merely admitting, but insisting upon this, it is also true that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision some of the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that, are for the common good, but in ways wnich UH against this common good. " Corporations. ' The fortunes amassed through cor porate organization are now so large and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to' give to the sovereign that is, to the government, . which represents the people as a whole some effective powe of supervision over their corporate use. In order to Insure a healthy social end industrial life every big corporation should be held responsible by, and be account able to some sovereign strong enough to control its conduce , I am in no sen He hostile to corporations. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all comblnat'on will bo not only useless, but in the- end vicious, because of the orotempt for law which the failure to enforce law in evitably produces. We should, more over, recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by corporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidelity devoted ,to their service, and thei?fore- noriwitUy the sen ce of thrubl bv th7l7of fleers W ' 'lotion competition from and directors.

Kacn can do and, atlon w,u vrvrwt other -abuses has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. - But each shold be shraply checked where it acts against law and justice. .. . 8o long as the finances of the na tion are kept upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which the congress has the power to deal begins to approach In impor tance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the individuals and es pecially the great corporations doing nZ h.,oina.B Th makers of our national constitution provided especially that- the regula tion of Interstate commerce should, come within the sphere of the general government. Tne arguments In favor of , their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger today, In view of the enor mous development of great business agencies usually corporate In form. Experience has shown conclusively that It Is useless to try to get-any adequate regulation and supervision of "these great corporations by state actlon. Such regulation and super vision can only be effectively exer cised by a sovereign whose JuTisdlc- " " nv" I- tlon is coextensive with the field ofjl,,c ...... work of the corporatlons-that Is, by I Via natlnnttl o-nvornmonr I not Iavo that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, it will certainly be neces sary ultimately to confer in fullest form, such power upon the national government by a propc amendment of the constitution. It would obviously bo unwise to endeavor to secure such an amendment until It is certain that the result can not he obtained under the constitution as it now Is. The laws of the congress and of the sev eral states hitherto, as passed upon by 'the courts, have resulted more of-tof ten In showing that the states have no power In the matter than that the national government has power; so 'hat there at present, exists a very unfortunate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an Interstate business occupy the po sIMcn of subjects without a sovereign, wither any tat government nor the national government, having effective rcntrol over them. Cur steady aim should he by legislation, cautiously and carefutly und rtnen, but resolute ly prseVeed In. to assert the sover f"Mv n' the pBtkmal government by affirmative action. , This Is only In form sn Innovation. In substance it Is merely njestoraflon; for from if- curliest time such legis lation of Industrial activities has been recornlzd In the action of the law making bodies; and all that I propose la to meet the changed conditions In such fppnner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power It has always po'srsscJ. rot only In this country but also In England before ( 

ROOSEVELT COIOESS OF THE UIIITEO STATES and since this country became a sep arate nation It has been a misfortune that the national laws on this subject have hitherto been of a negative or prohib itive rather than an affirmative kind, and still more that they have in part In their prohibitions coufounded what should be allowed -and what should not be allowed It is generally use less to try to prohibit all restraint on competition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreaaonable: and where it Is not useless it is generally hurtful Events have shown that it Is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law of this kind by incessant appeal to the courts. The department ol justice has for the last four years devoted more attention to the enforcement of the antitrust legislation than to anything else. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked has been the moral effect of the proscutlons; but it Is lncraslngly evident that there will be a very insuf ficient beneficial result la the way of economic ' change. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another de vice to accomplish the same purpose What is needed is not sweeping pro hibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to restrict com petition, but such adequate supervl Vision and regulation as will prevent in no way connected with restriction of competition. Of these abuses, per haps the chief, although by no means the only one, is overcapitalization generally it self the result of dishonest promotion because of tha myriad evils it brings in its train; for such overcapitalization often means an in flation that invites business panic; It always conceals the true relation of the profit earned to the capital actual ly Invested, and it creates a burden of interest payments which is a fer . tile cause of Improper reduction in r limitation Df wages;. It damages the small investor, discourages thrift, and encourages garobljng and specu latlon; while perhaps worst of all Is the tricklness and dishonesty which it Implies for harm to morals Is worse than any possible harm to material Interests, and the debauchery of of politics and business by great dis honest corporations Is far worse than any actual material evil they do to the public. Until the national govern ment obtains, in some manner which j the, w,8dom ' the congress may sug- gest, proper control over big corpora tlons engaged In Interstate commerce that is, over the great majority of I .. ,, 1. 1, I I iw""om to ' iy who iu ryilB. I am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that I am suggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action In securing it. I should emphatically protest against Improperly radical or hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the corporations engaged In the busi ness of interstate .transportation. As I said In my message of December 6 last, the Immediate and most pressing Ing need, so far ns legislation Is con cerned. is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents the government such supervision and regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country en gaged In Interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the Imposition of unjust or unreason able rates. , It must include putting a complete stop to rebates In every shape and form. This power to reg tila'e rates, like all similar powers over fSe bitslnes world, should be ex ercised with moderation, caution, and self restraint; but It should exist, so tint It can be effectively exercised when the need arises. The first consideration to be kept In mind Is that the power should be af affirmative and should he given to some administrative body. created by the congress. If given to tho present interstate commerce commission or to a reorganized Interstate commerce commission, such commission should he made unequivocally administrative. I do n.Tt believe In the government In terfering with private business more than necessary. 1 do not believe In the government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left In private hands. But neither do I be I lleve in the government flinching from ' nvoranplnir nnv work when It heeomea evident that abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there Is governmental supervision. It Is not my province to Indicate the exact terms of the law which should be enacted; but I call the attention of the congress to cer tain existing conditions with which It Is desirable to deal. In my judgment the most Important provision which such law should contain Is that con fering upon some competent admin istrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad Is reasonable and just, and If It is found to be unreasonable and un just, then, after full Investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reason able rate, as It Is commonly called this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high but thai a favored shipper Is given too km a rate. In-such case the com mission, would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum; and It would need only one or two such decisions by the ; commission to cur railroad conTjsmes of the" practice of alviaf Improper minimum rates, f call your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to give the commission power to Initiate or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon com plaint and after investigation A heavy penalty should be exacted from any coroporatlon which fails , to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. The first necessity is to secure it; and unless It is granted to the commission there Is little use In touching the subject at all. . Illegal transactions often occur un der the forms of law. It has often oc cured that a shipper has been told by a traffic oft leer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after It has been bought an open reduction is made In the rate, to take effect Imme diately,, the arrangement resulting to the profit of the one shipper and the one railroad and to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not be forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad in the - niatter of rebates. The law should make It clear so that anybody can fail to understand that any kind of commission paid on freight ship ments, whether in this form or In the form of fictitious damages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced pas senger rate; or payment of brokerage, Is Illegal. It Is worth while consider ing whether It would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator al lowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demoralllzng and are used as rebates. The best possible regulation of rates would , of course, be that regula tion secured by an honest agreement among the railroads themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for Instance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or big railroad to discrim inate against' or secure advantages over some rival; and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested In the government to put a stop to agreements to the det riment of the public should In my Judgment, be accompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and careful supervision, agreements clearly In the Interest af the public. Rut, In my Judgment, the necessity for giving this further power Is by no means as great ns the necessity for giving the comlsslon or adminis trative body other powers I have en umerated above; and It may well be Inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power In the commission or other administrative body until It si- .

The "Marriage of Kitty," presented by sprightly Miss Johnson and her clever company, was given last night at the Duncan under difficulty. Never theless, the fair sized audience en Joyed the performance. The company arrived late and in order to keep the audience from waiting beyond 9 o'clock came on for the first act In their street clothes. Miss Johnson was 111 from over work and the pri vations of a belated , trip, and while she carried out her role superbly, she fainted on the stage near the close of the last act, and the curtain was rung down. The audience applauded warmly when Miss Johnson retained and finished the play. ' The play itself is uproariously fun ny In spotsand the cast Is good, al though the gentleman who played Sir Reginald Belslze, made a melancholy attempt at the portrayal of the man nerisms of an English noble. He Is a fair actor, too, and some of the coin ed y passages he did exceedingly well. James Wrlaht. a boiler maker hInar at the local Santa Fe shops, met with a quite serious accklent yesterday morning.
