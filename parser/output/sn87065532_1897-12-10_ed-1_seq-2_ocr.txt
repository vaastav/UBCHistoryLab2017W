Stratum, editor of the Liberty Herald, has gone to Washing ton to act as private secretary to Hon. Wm. P. Love. When our State Legislature meets ngain, there will be six new members in both houses-two in the Senate and four In the House. The late campaign In Ohio is said to have cost Mr. Mark Hanna &j0,000. In the language of the race track, he got "a mighty p.ior run for his money' Now is the time for the calamity howler to plant himself down before the saloon stove and cry out with a loud voicp: "The country has gone to the devil." The ex-prevailing fever at Biloxi "touched" ligtitly Capt. John IT. Mil ler, editor of Liloxi Herald, before it let go. However, we are glad to learn he is up again. The cotton growing farmers of this State are claiming that it don't pay to rai.'.e 5-ecnt cotton. Why don't they raise more hog and harmony and less cotton, then? James Hill, Register (.f the Land Office at Jackson, has been appointed custodian of the government building at that place, which has heretofore been filled by the postmaster. Those who wish to Impeach the Governor should remember the words of our Savior to those who wanted to stone the fallen woman: "Let him that Is guiltless cast the first stone!" Gen. Wade Hampllon will devote his time to an important military book, which has been long a cheer ished plan of his. It is entitled "The History of the Cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia." Hon. T.

Ex-United States Senator B. K. Bruoc,of this Stale, has been appoint ed by the President Register of the Treasury. Theappointment was made at tho Instigation of Mark Hanna, but nevertheless it is a good one. We have before us the Meridian Commercial, an interesting weekly in pamphlet form, by Mr. Wm. F. Gray.

The Grenada Sentinel says: "A now capliol building, a road law, an Insur t . at) co bill and the national quarantine question are among the subjects sug gested by the Slate press for legisla tion at the coming session of tho Mis sissippi solona." A subscriber In Jasper county, In making a remittance for two years' subscription to the Dbmocrat-Stak, says: "Wo enjoy your paper, and know the whole country is better for the In fluence of such a clean, biave paper. It Is gratifying, indeed, to receive such words of commendation of the course of the "Old Reliable." Archbishop P. L.Chnppelle has been transferred from tho see of Santa Ft, New Mexico, to that of New Orleans, to succeed the late lamented Arch bishop Jansscns. He Is a native of France, and It Is stated one of the luvibt learned divines in the country. 

LOCAL F20SPEEITI. General S. D. Lee, president of the Mississippi A. and M. College, closed an able address by saying: "What we need most of all is immigration, and In the supplying of this great need we solve all the other questions of less importance." While it is true that Immigration is essential to the greatest prosperity, it is equally true that those external agencies of development must be brought Into co-operation with estab lished local enterprise. These home conditions should manifest such a measure of intelligence, industry and sobriety as will be a proof to nil new comers of a degree of prosperity com mensurate with the resources and attractions that influence their com ing. Will not the importance of this much needed immigration largely de pend upon the personal thrift of the home rul ks? If it be true that birds of a feather flock together, the kind of immigration any community will be likely to secure, will undoubtedly be the result of local conditions. Let prosperity begin at home; let every man give proof of personal en terprise; then strangers will be pleased with the evidence of your industry and success; will buy your surplus lands, enoy the benefits of your ex ample and experience and prove t he great blessing predicted by General Lee. We venture the statement that the six to eight thousand people of Scran ton, Moss roint and l'ascagoula have but a faint conception of the com mercial, manufacturing, transporta tion at. (I municipal possibilities of this u:ost Inviting fluid, which are based upon most favorable natural con ditions. Every step in the right di rection opens t lie way to greater pro gress. The most urgent present need Is that our business men combine to se cure by theiraclive co-operation, Slate or government appropriations that would make of Scranton and l'asca goula the central port of entry of the Mississippi coast. Bypropof effort additional rail transportation to th,c interior markets of the State may be secured. Tho natural conclusion from the above statement Is that this county offers great many advantages to sun dry manufacturing enterprises, and it only rests with our citizens to lay these facts before capitalists seeking Investments. When will our citizens tiwakc to their vast opportunities and start the wheels of local prosperity? Secretary Cage, in his report to Con gress, mentions $2,000,000 as the amount of the treasury deficit, esti mated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898. Seven men are dead and seventeen more are expected to die, at Maplcs ville, Ala., on account of drinking a combination of wood alcohol and bad whisky. A woman gave birth loan infant on a Mobile and Ohio train the other day and threw it out of the car window, after wrapping it up with newspapers. The crime was committed near Ruth erford, Tenn., and the authorities have taken steps to ferret out the affair. State Superintendent of Education Kincannon has ruled that public school teachers who are exempt from examination must pay annually an institute fee of fifty cents, which should be collected by the county superintendents when contracting with such teachers. According to a recent estimate made by Col, J. L. Power, Secretary of State, there are 300,000 children enrolled in the public schools of Mis sissippi. Of this number the daily average is 210,000. There are 6,500 schojls and 7,855 teachers. The Fifty-fifth Congress was called to order Monday at 12 m. Simulian- cously at botli ends of the Canit.r.l. Speaker Reed In the House and Vice rresmcni liobart id the Senate drop ped their gavels and called to order the respective bodies over which they preside. The Natchez Democrat is opposed to agitating the Question of a npw State House before the present Leg islature, but wants to wait until after the next general election before. Mm question Is again agitated. It wants ine oia rooKcry recovered, and says that a Chicago firm has offered to do the work for $73,000. We are utterly opposed to wasting any more of the people's money In repairs on the old Dunning, it would bo nionev thrown away, and it surprises us that the able and astute editor of tho Democrat favors it. The old building has been pronounced 'as unsafo and Is onlv a question of time when it topples'over, and putting a new roof on it will not prevent it from falling. Last spring the floods came, the flood-gates of heaven were opened and the rains descended and overflowed some of tho most fertile farming re gions of the South, and theory among the farmers thus afflicted that no crops could be raised this year and starvation would bo the result. How ever, large crops were raised on the overflowed section. A contrary result will be regarding this coast country on account of the yellow fever fiasco. It is predicted by some that the scare will havo the effeet of killing It as a resort. We do not share in such gloomy foreboding, and wo have (treat raitn that the coast towns will soon overcome the damages Inflicted and people will again flock to their shores as of yore. .

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The first regular message of Tresl dent Mckinley was transmitted to Congress last Monday. It is a volum inous document, and in discussing the affairs of State could have said what he did say in fewer words. In our opinion it is rather a weak State paper, and docs not appear to eminate from a man having decided opinions, but shows a va.-oilatlog and indecisive spirit and entirely devoid of that firmness which should charac terize a man at t tie head of a great nation In dealing with questions of great moment. He alludes to tho tariff very briefly, and says it has not been a law long enough to prove its beneficial results. In discussing tho financial quest Inn he clearly sees that the government will have to issue gold bonds in order to replenish chegold reserve. He says ho hopes something will bo done for bimetallism. This Is, however, mere bosh. He does not hope or wish to see anything of the kind. He treats the Cuban question at some length, but advances no hope that the present ad ministration will give the struggling patriots relief from Spanish tyranny. The Hawaiian annexation scheme Is approved by the President because the Republican party favors it. The other questions treated in the message arc of minor importance and of no Interest to tho people here abouts, and to review all would con sume too much of our time and space. The Actions of the Negroes in Two Cases. Jackso.i Co., Miss., Due. 5, 1R07. Editor Democrul-S.ar. I spent a few days In your town last week, and noted tho actions of the negroes in two cases that came to my notice, That of Miss Ellda Glande, their assistant teacher, and Elder(?) John Johnson, tho forger. In the first case, by petitions and slanderous insinuations, they did all in their power to have the trustees not employ Miss Ulaude, who is, to my knowledge, tin excellent teacher, and a young woman worthy of esteem. She has been their teacher for three years, and. so far as I can ascertain, gave general satisfaction. The trustees did exactly right by not noticing the petitions, etc., but put the right girl where she really belongs, In Scranton colored public school. Those same negroes, who were so anxious to destroy the character of thcirchihlren's teacher, were foremost in rletending ''Brer" Johnson, the forger doing all 'in their power to screen him, to save him, and, with the convicting evidence before them, rush forward to "bond him out." Their excuse is that he " 'longs to our 'ciety and we's got to protect him." Good Lord deliver us from all such societies. I would not be surprised to learn that Brer Johnson had "jlnecl'' the "ciety"of escapes before the grand jury met. It would about serve his bondsmen right, I think. This needs no comment, but written to show how the leading(?) negroes of Scranton act when their bosses say "do." I am doing different tilings now for a living, most particularly nothing, but I guess I'll be nll.right when I sell my hogs, at which time I'll write again. Wishing for yon and vours, "the devil" included, a Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year, I am, Yours trulv, "Maus Billy." County Suprintendent J. River Wade, of Jefferson, has prepared some amendments to the school law which are worthy of notice. He proposes to abolish county institutes and thus 8 ive to the counties an aggregate for the State of $7,500. Edueable children to be enumerated every four instead of every two years, saving $11,040.90 Abolish fall examination; the one ex animation of tho year to be on the Thursday and Friday of the first foui weeks of April. Applicants could thus get back to their homes on Saturday. Tills change will save about $3,000 to the school fund In the State. These and several other amendments equally meritorious have been submitted to the Governor and will doubtless be referred by him to the Legislature. Capt. Frank Burkitt acknowledges that the special election held in Chick asaw county last week, for chancery clerk, was an honest one, and that the Populist candidate was fairly and squarely beaten by his Democratic opponent. The captain threatens to quit politics and retire from the news paper business. The delta can beat the hill section on cotton, but when it comes to living at home, the hlll-blllles have the crl on 'em. The Greenwood Enterprise says: ' There Is no home-raised corn for sale lu the delta this year that we have-been able to locate. Our planters will nearly all have to buy more or less corn next year." "In tho beginning God created the heavens and earth. Then He made the editor, tho liberal advertiser, and prompt-paying subscribers, and It was good. The next day a blizzard set In and He created the man who didn't believe. in advertising, and another who didn't take his home paper, then Ho rested. The devil then got Into thomouldlng-rooin and he created the fellow who takes tho naDcr for vears and then falls to pay for It. The devil then rested, but the editor hasn't had any rest since."

J There has been a frost thrnuirhout the South and it is about time that government officials who were afraid of yellow lever, and dodging from one place to another, went back to their original headquarters. This applies especially to the collector of customs at l'ascagoulii, Miss., who had his office removed to Scranton, 4 few mites up tne creeK, in consequence or there being several cases of fever at l'ascagoula where the custom house was located and properly belongs. We understand that the collector of the Port of l'ascagoula is at Washington exerting his influence to keep the custom house inland at Scranton, much to the Inconvenieticeofsbipplng and all interested in the Port of Pas- goula, with the exception of a few property holders and trades-people who want the custom house in 1 his little Interior village. It Is believed that the Secretary of t lie Treasury will send this presumptive collector oaca to N:ranton with instructions ti move Ins office to Pascairoula. Miss where it properly belongs. New York marine Journal, Dec. 4th. The writer nf tho foregoing article is off bis (?)base. Scranton is the center of commerce of the Port of Pascngutila. The reason for removing the custom house from the village of Pascagoiila was on account of the threatened 'shot gun quarantine, and not from any fear of yellow fever. County Superintendent I). D. Cowan has obtained permission from the State Superintendent to hold another examination, thus giving an onnor i tunity to those who have been kept away by the prevailing fever and quarantine vn obtain license to teach By reference to our advertising col unins it will be seen that Mr. Cowan has given notice that a regular exam ination will be held here on Friday and Saturday, 17th and 18th lust. The Senate will have the appoint nients of about 73S presidential post masters on lis hands for confirmation during the present month. All but 100 of these have been made by the president since the clost of the extra ordinary session of Congress. The postmaster at Detroit is among them Of tho remaining 100 cases 40 are ready to bo sent by the president li tho Senate at the opening of Congress and GO of these are expected during UIU IUUUl.ll. Several members of the Legislature will go to Jackson full of gall and bit' terness, and perhaps a knife up one sleeve for our Governor, another for the State Board of Health and so down the line to other officials. In our Judgment the coming session will be a nolsyj 'do nothing body. But thank heaven, the session will evi dently be a short one, unless the Gov ernor orders it, and we don't think he will. Thirty days is allowed, and $5 a uay xor cacn member and mileage. We hope the Capitol question will be finally settled at the coming meet Ingof the Legislature in January. If the State Is to have a new State house, let us have It, and let the talk stop. If the Legislature thinks the old hulk will' stand the storms, and Is good enough, let It say so In plain, unmls takable language The people are tired of hearing the building of a Capitol discussed.
