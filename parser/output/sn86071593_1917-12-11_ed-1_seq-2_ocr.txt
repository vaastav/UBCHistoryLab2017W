A local representative of the food ad ministration says that at least 1 ,'K)0 men must be released from the selec tive draft if Lehigh county, Pa., is to have normal crops next year. Farms have been abandoned because owners could geUno help. For the same rea son cows have been killed. The farm labor problem is a very difficult one, both here and abroad. In France, where this year's crops were the smallest known in half a century, the minister of supply recently pro posed the release of "."0,000 men from the army for plowing and sowing, ex pressing a hope that their place would be taken by American troops. But the uw ol our soldiers there reduces the supply of farm labor at home, where a surplus for France and England must be produced. The urgent, immediate demand here is for men in the pkip yards, war factories, and mines. If possible, it should be s.vti."fied. But those who strive to do this should be thinking of the farms and planning to help the agriculturists, whose food out put next vear will have great war value.

Let congress apply this acid test to every public question: What will best aid in getting -soldiers, sailors, ships and supplies quickest to France, so that they may soonest take their part in staying the surge of barbarism which threatens the world? What will best aid the President ind the fighting arms of the nation in con quering the Hun?

PAPE The Appalachian club of lloston will rendezvous at Bristol, Dee. ti, and for five days will enjoy mountain climbing and other outdoor sports. Vermonters ought to get a le.-ton from the visitors. The air is never so invigorating and life-giving as in winter, but because the lirst blasts cause the cheeks to tingle and to send shivers down the spine most people who live in this climate hibernate like the bear at the coming of cold weather, with the result that there is a generous crop of grip, pneu monia and other ca.sevs for the doctors to attend to in January and February.

Our farmers must be encouraged to produce next year crop even larger than those rece.i'.lv harvested. At the resent time there is an inclination to reduce acreage be cause the supply of help was insufti- cient in the recent season and the shortage continues. Assertions have come from some parts of the country where much aid was given by loans from the Patriotic Fanners' fund that potatoes have been left in the ground, corn standi unhusked in the fields, and land that should have been plowed be- A Black Week. (Rutland Herald.1) Lust week wa a German week, &o far a advantages go. To begin with, there wsis a formidable increase in sub marine sinkings announced, and the announcement of an armistice with Kussia. Then in iiick succession came the following: Knglish retirement with loss from advanced positions before Cambrai; Italian retirement with losses from ositionf on the Piave; Announcement of American casual ties in France; The Halifax disaster; The destruction of the destroyer Jacob Jones. It was one of those weeks that try men's souls, but it is rather significant of the new spirit in the I'nited .States that most men. instead of wasting tini" in useless lamentations, have quietly looked each other in the eye :wid said: "We must get busy over there." Several months ago, the Herald asked whether it would be necessary for the American public to begin reading war casualties in the newspapers before we came to a realization of what war meant. ' Well, there had been a considerable (Pennington Paimer.) It would seem as though it ourrht to be possible to fill the Vermont regi ment again now that the war depart ment promises to keep it together. The plain facts of the case are that Liu war is not going well for the allies. The Italians are hard pressed aud the big Hritish drive did not do what wr.s hoped. More American soldiers are needed and must and will be had. The work of classifying men under the draft is already in progress and all those in the 1st das' will have to go sooner or later. By enlisting in 'he Fir-t Vermont it will be possible to es cape th bitter winds, colds and snows of Camp Devens and train at Char lot U North Carolina, where the winter i.-t about like our Vermont October. The men who enlist in the First Ver mont get -if 10 per month more than those who are drafted. Their fare is paid to Charlotte and they are s;nt bai-k at government expense if not ac cepted. The state is promised credit on its next quota for all those who en list before December 15. Beyond the-te reasons this is the greatest one of all the country talks for more soldiers. The task we have tackled is proving biager taan was expected. President Wilson in hi.s message to congress has said that the I'nited States will eee it through. This call is for men who dare to light and to f-vre in the ranks as our fathers fought at lienninglon, Bunker Hill, Saratoga and at Yorktown. It is a grand thing to help the Red Cross, the war ean'p funds, the Liberty loan and all those other things but they cannot win the war without fighting men. Men on th' draft list, not actually called, can en list and also all others hetween the ages of 18 and 41. The time is brief as this enlistment campaign is to clo'v on December 13. The President says we must right it through. The country calls tne brave and the true. Fill up the regiment, young men of Vermont. Our country is- worth fighting for, worth living for, worth dying for. In LSiil the answer was "We are coming, Father Abraham, lioO.OOO strong." Let the reply now be "We aie coming, Cncle Woodrow, three millions if v;,u need us. " The Deliricus Reporter. (Charlotte, X. (.'..

It. G. Koney, one of Wilson 's most oiomiiient and influential business men, for in his noble life cf splendid usefulness he has exhibited the resplendent virtues of loftiest citizenship. And as Miss Koney has richly inherited his virtues and the charms and grace ot her ele gant mother, she is one of the most popular and lovable maidens in Wil son. And in addition a vast array of the most ravishing personal ehnrms she has musical talent of the highest order, being a vocalist of sublimest powers, for she has a highly cultured voice of richest melody and rarest sweetness, and her seemingly heaven tuned not:s are as pure and as sweet as the image of the morning star, when bathing in the dewdrops that lie nestling in the fragrant petals of the flower. And Mr. Brett is a high toned geiitb-man. and is woithy of the brilliant jewel that is to sparkle in the basket of his love and devotion, and he is indeed to be con gratulated,' for under her eyelight e-. ery scene will be a picture of iara dise, every word a poem of enchant ment, and every sound an echo of celes tial harmonies, for with the love of such a jewel won, heaven with its rrpt ure has on earth begun.
