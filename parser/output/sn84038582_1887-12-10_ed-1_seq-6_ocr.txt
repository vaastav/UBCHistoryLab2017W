In ooaelderlnf tha question of i rOttCBASIMO 

BONDS aa a meejia of restoring to circulation tha sur plus money accumulating in the Treaaury, it should beoorno in mind that pramiuma must, of eourae, ba paid upon such purohaae, that there may ba a large part of tbssa bonda held aa Investments which cannot ba purchased at any prise, and that combinations among hold ers who are willing to sell may unreasonably eahanoe tha cost of aucb bonds to the Uovern aneal It has bean suggested that the) present bonded dM might ba refunded at a leas rwteof interest, and tha dMfferenoe between the old and new eenrtty paid In cash, thus finding uia for tha surplus In the Treaaury. Tha success of this plea, tt la apparent, muet depend upon tbe voll tloxvof tha holders of the pre sent bonds ; and It la not nttrely certain that tha Inducement high must ba offered tbaa would result la t Ha receive! at tho deak of his eraplorar hit wasea. and perhaps befure ba reaches hi! bom 4s obliged, iu a pnrobaas fur family use of aa article which embrsoea his own labor, to re. turu in tbe payment of tbe in.'reale in price which the Ur.U periuita, tbe hard-earned oom peuaatiou of many dayi of toil. ba i-niiuMT ron ranuias. Tbe farmer and tba agriculturist who mann faoture nothing, but who nay the Inoreaied prloe wbich tbe tariff imposfs. upon ary agn cultural linplemsut. upon Vfl be wears and upon all bs usss, and owns, exoept tbe Increase of hia flocks and hards and auoh things as hi husbandry prod ace from the soil, is invited to aid In maintaining tea present situation, and ha is told that a high uui on imported wool la necessary fur tbe liensnt of those who have keep to shear, .n order tnat the price of their wool may be increased. They, of course, are net reminded that tne fa.uu r who baa no aheap la by Inn scheme obliged iu his pur Chases of o'o.kiug aut woolen goedi to pay a tribute to ins fellow farmer as well as to the manufa.tursr aud mer chant; nor la auy montuiaj made of the fact tbat tha sweep ewners themselves and their bousaholds must wear clothing and use ether articles iueoufe tured from the wool tbey sell at tariff pricea, and thm aa consumers must return their share of this increased prise to tbe tradesman. ... k . , 1 think it may br faiily asHiimed that a large pro)ortiou of tha ibeep ownod by the farmers throughout the uounuy ura found in ima.ii flocks uumbcring from twenty live io fifty. Tha duty on the grade of Imported wool which theaa aheap viold is 10 cnta each per pound if of tha vulno of W centa or less, and 12 ceuta If of the val.n' of moro than 3 IceuM. u tho liberal eHtiuiKtw of s x pounds be allowed for each fleece the duty mereon would betwor 7a ceuta, aud this may l e tken as the utmost enhancement of it price to the farmer by reason of this duty, r.tghtuan dollars would thus represent the increase! price of the wool from twenty-live sheep, and . that from the wool of filty abeep, and at present values thla additiuu would amount to about oue-thlrd of ita pl ica. If, upon it! aala, tha farmer receives thla or a lee tariff profit, tha wool leaves bis hauda charged with pre cisely that sum, which, iu all lta changei, will adhere to it until it n-acbea the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods aud material for use, its coat ii not only increas ed to the exteut of tba farmer's tariff profit, but a further sum ba been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under tbe operation of other tariff laws. In tha meantime, tbe day ar rives wban the farmer uuda It neoeasary to purchase woolen gooda and material to clothe himself and family for the winter. When ba ....... , i,.n.n for that Duruosehe discov ers that be Is obliged not ouly to return in tha way of Increased prices, dm iariu pruu. uu h and which theu perhaps list be fore him In manufactured form, but that ba must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a ..i.a. in.. in nut ranaed br a tariff duty on tbe manufacture.

Tbe people oan hardly bope for any eonaideration In the operation of these selfish Schemes. If, however, in tno auseuce oi nucu oomuina tion a haalthv and free comiwtition reduces tbe prioe of auy particular dutiable article of home production oeiow mo ihuh wuicu i might otherwise leach under our tariff lawi, and If, with auoh reduced price, its manufao tuie cuntiniies to thrive, It is mitirely evident that one thing ba In en discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation. ..... Tbe aocas.ity of combination to maintain tha price of anv commodity to the tariff point fur nuhea proof that soiuo ouo is willing to accept lower pricea for auch commodity, and that such pricea are remunerative, and lower prices pro duced by competition prove tbe sums thing. Ibus, where either of there conditions exist a case would seem to bo presented for an easy re duction of taxation. The considerations which have been present ed touching our tariif lat a are intended ouly to enforce an earnent recommendation thut the lurplua reveuue of tho Government be prevent ed Ly the 

BEDUC-I WN OP OCR, CUSTOMS DUTIKS, and, at the same time, to empliaHlzo a sugges tion that in accomplishing thia purpose we may diacharge a douide duty to our people by grant ing to thorn a measure of relief from tariff taxa tion In quarters where it ia moat needed, and from source whore it cau be moat fairly and juatly accorded. Nor cuu tha presentation made of Such con siderations be, with any degree of falraoss, re garded aa evidences of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing Interests, or of any leak of appreciation of their value and importance. These Interests count tuto a leading and most Substantial element of our national greatness, and furiilah the proud proof of our country's progroas. Dot if, iu the emergency that preaios iiimii tie. our manufacturers aio aaked to urreiiiler BoliU'thiiiu for the public good I uud to avert diaastur their patriotlam, a well as . u grateful recognition of advantages already I ulfordoil, should lead tlmm to willing co-opura- I tion No demand is niado that tliey shall fore- ' go all tho buneilts of governmental regard ; but they can not fail to bo ailinoiiiahed of their duty, as well aa their enlightened nelf Interest and safety, when they are remiudod of tba fact that financial pnuio and collapae, to which the pres ent condition tends, atlord no greater shelter or protection to our manufactures than to our other iniuortant enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful aud deliberate reform is uow oiTered, and none of us ahould ba unmindful of a time wheu AN A1IUBKD AND 1HH1TATKD l'KOPLK, heedless of thole who have resisted timely and reasonuble relief, may insist upon a radical and sweepiug rectification of their wrongs, Tbe dillkiulty atteudlug a wlae ana fair re vision of our tar ill laws Is not underestimated. It will require on the part of our Congress great labor and care, aud especially broad and na tional contemplation of the subject, aud a patri otic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and reckless oi ciis weiiare of tbe eutlre couutry. Under our present law a more than four thou sand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not In any way compete with our own manufactures, aud many aro hardly worth at tention as subjects of revenue. A considerahla reduction can be made lu the aggregate by add ing them to the free list. The taxation of lux uries presents no feature of hardship, but the ueoeasarlos of life used and oonsumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened, Tbe radical reduction of the duties impoisd on raw material used in manufactures, or its free Importation, 1 of course an important far. tor lu any effort to reduce the price of these neceaaaiios: it would not only relieve them from the increased coat caused by tbe tariff on i auch material, hut the manufactured prodoet, , bo ug thua cbeaiHiued, that part of the tariff ( uow laid upou aucb produota as a compeusa-! tion to our manufactuiera for tbe presnut price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Huvh reduction, or free Importa tion, would aerve beside to largely re duce the revenue. It is uot apparent how aucb a change can have any Injurious effect upon our mauufaoturera. On the contrary, It wuuld appear to give them a better chance In foreign markets with the manufacturers of oth er countries who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people might have the op iwrtunltv of extending their tales beyond the limits of boms consumption saving them from tbe depression, Interrupt Ion In business, and loss caused by a glutted doineetio market, and affording their employes mora certain and steady labor, with lu resulting quiet and sou tentoisnt. Tbe question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached iu a spirit higher than pertisanabip, aud considered in the light of tbat regard for 

PATWOTIC DUTY, wbiob should characterise the action of thorn Intmated with the weal of a confiding peep fa. but the obligation to declare party polloy and principle It not wanting to Orgs prompt and effective action.

The failure of the Congross heretofore tu pro vide agaiuit the dangers winch It was quite ev ident the rery nature oi the difficulty must neceaiarlly produce, enised a condition of financial diatroaa and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and etped. elite within execu tive anntrol, and these appear now to be ex hausted. If disaster results from tbe contin ued inaction of (.'ongieaa, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. '1 hough the aituation thus fsr oonsidsred Is fraugM with danger wliioh ibould be fully re alised, and though it preaents features of wrong to tba people as well as peril to ths coun try, It is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent oaasa, eon atantly produolug the same alarming oirsum atanoss a congested National Treasury and a depleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated that, while the present aituation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicenieut in the future by the removal of ths eauss. SI 

BKMB or TAXATION. Our scheme of taxation, by means of which this ussdleaa surplus is taken from tbe people and put Into the publlo treasury consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad, and internal-revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquor a. It must be conceded tbat none of the things subjected to Internal-revenue taxa tion are, strictly speaking, necessaries; there apiears to be no Just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. Mnt our ere sent tariff laws tha vleiout, In equitable aud illegal source of unnecessary tax ation ought to be at once revised and amend ed. Theae laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles Imported and autiject to duty by precisely tha sum paid for such tjhU'is. Thus the amount of tha duty tusaauruS tbs tar paid by those srha purchase for naa these imported articles. If any of these things, how ever, are raised or manufactured in our own country, aud tbe duties now levisd up on foreign grains sWid fjuroducte are oallsd pro tection to wese DUiue masuiactures, Because they render itpossfwlt for thoae of our people who are marrfacturars to mATa tbess taxed ar ticles and sill thJtn foTaTpruM equal to tbat demanded (or tue imported goods tbat have paid customs duty. Ho Tt liappena that while comparatively a few use tbe imported articlss, mulioua of out pantile, who never use and never saw tiny of tlit Imported products, purchase and use thna of he earns kind made la thla country, and pay there for nearly or quite the same enhaneed price which tha duty adds to the imparted articles. Those who buy leports pay tbe duty charged thereou into the pubHo Treasury, but ths great majority of our citlmus, who buy do mestic artloteeof tueaanie glass, pay a sum at leaat approximately equal to this) duty to the horns manufacturer. Thai reference to ths op eration of our tariff laws la not made by wxy of restriction, S at in order that we maybe con stantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden npou those who cousums do mestic products as well as those who consume imported articles, and tUus create a tax upon all our people. It is uot proposod to entirely relieve the coun try of this taxation. It must be extensively con tinued as the source if the Government's in oouie ; and iu a readjustment of our tariff the in terests of American labor engaged in manufact ure should bo carefully considered, as wallas the preservation of our manufactures. It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships snd dangers of our present tarifl laws ahould be devised with espe cial precaution against imperiling the existence of our manufacturing interests. Hut this existence should not mean a eondition which, without regard to the public wulfare or a national exigency must al ways insure the realization of immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. As the volume ami diversities of our national activities increase new recruits are added to those who desiro a continuation of the advan tages which thry conceive the present system of tariif taxation directly alfords them. ho stubbornly have all efforts to reform the pros ent condition boon resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus eugngod that they can can hardly complain of the suspicion, enter tained to a certain extent, mai more exists an 

OUOANIZKD COMBINATION along the lino to maintain their advantage. We are In the midst of centennial celebrations aud with becoming pride ws rejoice in Ameri can skill and ingenuity, In American energy and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantage! and resources developed by a cen tury's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to Justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upou every consumer In the land for the benefit of out manufacturers, quite be yond a reasomiblu demand for governmental regard. It suits the purpose! of advocacy to call our manufactures infant industries, still need ing the highest and greatest degree of favor and fostering care that van be wruug from Kcdoral legislation. THR WOKKINOMAN'S POSITION. Tt Is also said tbat tho increase In the price of domestic manufactures resulting from the prestut tariff is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our workingmsn em ployed in manufactories than are paid for what is called the pauper labor of Kurope. All will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compen sation of our laboring people, Our labor Is honorable iu tbe eyes of every Amer ican citireu, and aa it lies at the foun dation of our development and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hy pocrisy, to tbe utmost regard. The standard of our laborers' life ahould not be measured by that of auy other country less favorsd, and they are entitled to their full share of all our advantages. by the last oensus it ii made to appear that of the 17,3U3,0W of our population engaged in all klndi of industries, 7,bIO,4'J3 are employed in agriculture, 4,014, in professional and per sonal sorvloe ('2,044,87a oi whom are domestic, servants and laborers), while 1,810,856 are em ployed in trade and transportation, and 8,837, 11 j are classed as employed lu manufacturing and mining. For present purposes, however, ths last num ber given should be considerably reduced. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be oonoeded that there should be deduoted from those which It includes 373,143 carpenters and Joiners, iiHS.tea milliuers, dressmakers and seamsussaea, 17J,7'Jn blacksmiths, 133,750 tailors and tellorosees. VJ3.4T3 masons, 78,241 butchers, 41,309 bakers, 82,084 plasterers, and 4,881 engaged In manufacturing agri cultural Implements, amountlug in tbe ag gregate to 1,314,083, leaving i.SAObV persons employed In such mauufaoturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff. To those tba appeal Is made to save their employment aud maintain their wages by resisting a change. There sbould be no dis position to auswer such suggestions by the al legation tbat ther are in a minority among tbose who labor, and thereby sbould forego an advantage. In tbe interest of low prices for tha majority; their compensation, as it may be affected by the operation of tariff law, should at all thna ba acrupuloaslr kept in view; and yet with slight refraction they will not over look the fact that they are consumers with tne rest; and tbey, too, have their wants and those of their families to supply from thefr earning, and that the prioe of the necessaries of life, aa well as thttamonnt of their wages, will regulate tba measure of tbelr welfare and comfort. But tbe red notion of taiation demanded ahould be so treasured as not to necessitate oi Justify either tba loss of emplovmeat by the workingman nor the lesssniug of bit wages ; and the profits still remaining to tha xnaamt eoturer after a oeceiiaay readjustment, boald furnish no eieues for tba seertnee of the Interests of bis employee either In tbelr oppor tunity to work or In tbe dlntlnutlo oi their aompensatioo. Nor can the weaker Ut tstann f eslu res tail to underatand that, wbllo at high tariff Is claimed to be necessary to allow the Myment of remunerative wasea, it certainly results In a very laraw Increase in tha price tat nearly all sorts of manufaetaree, wblcb, to almost countless forme, ba weeds for tbe use of himself and bla family. or. promised lta correction ; and neither (at eltixsai nor as partisans are pur eonnUymen In a mood to ooudonc the deliberate violation of these pledges. , , Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be Improved by dwelling upon the theories of preteotion and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithet. It ia a condition wbiob confronts us, not a theory. Belief from this con dition msy in vulva a slight reduction of the ad vantages which ws award oar home prod actions ; but the entire withdrawal of lueh advantages should not ba eouteniplated. Tbe question of free trspto Is absolutely Irrelavaat; and the pertietasxtelaiin mads in certain quarters, that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnsosasary taxation are schemes of so-oallsd frse traders, is mischievous and far removed from any consideration lor tha nubile good. Tbe simple and plain duty which we owe tha people is to redaee taxation to 0 necessary sinenses of an economical administration of tbs Government, and to restore to the businssa of the country the ssoney which we bold In the Treaaury tbroagh tbe perversion of govern mental powers. These thiags can and should be done with safsty to all oar industries, with out danger to the opportunity far remunerative labaw which oar workmen nssd. and with ben efitto them and all our people, by cheapening tbelr means of ssbiliteacs aud increasing the measure of tbelr souiforts. TnTARirWAa Ai.r,-mPOTANT. The Constitution provides that ths President shall from Urns to time givs to the Congress Information of the lUte of the Union."

COMMENTS OS THE MESSAGE. What Leading Journals Think of the President' Address. New York Times: Mr. Cleveland tuts done an act of statesmanship in tha best sense. Rerognizlng a great duty, he has performed it with courage, with finances, and at the right time. And he has performed It so tbat every boneet man must see that it is an hon est act. Judged by an ordinary standard of political expediency the President's act is in expedient. He has forced upon bis party an issue aa to which tbe party is divided, and so divided tbat unless tbe minority yield, it can defeat the will of the majority. It places Mr. Cleveland far above any of tbe leaders to whom the Republican party has of late lent a bearing, and above most of tbe leaders of bis own party. New York Sun: It is uot a commonplace document, for it U simple, Intelligible, and coherent. Mr. Cleveland has never before in a public paper taken sides squarely upon this tbe tariff question. Lie bus done so now in a manner tbat leaves room for io misunder standing. It is a bold tiling to do, and tbe President deserves credit for tbe plainuess of his speech. No one can accuse him of hedg ing, or haggling, or juggling with words. Do far does be go on the familiar lines of the free trade speeches in Congress or elsewhere, that we find him betrayed here and there, no doubt unconsciously, into an exhibition of slight irritation against American manufac turers as a cla-ss, almost as though they were conspirators and public enemies. New York World: Tho admirable mes sage of the President has given to the Demo cratic party what it has long lacked an issue and a leader. The issue is tax reform; the leader is the President It can hardly be that the President bos not at this juncture influence enough to secure the union of tbe Democrats in the Houj upon a measure of revenue reduction and tariff reform. Chicago Inter Ocean: The President has issued a free-trade pamphlet in which no argument is educod that has not been used by all the Cobden Club organs till it has be come stale and threadbare. Chicago Tribune: The message is able and statesmanlike; luminious in style; prespicu ous in statement; clear in its reasoning; and irrofutable in its conclusions. It is moderate protection doctrine such as has been exempli fied more than once in the public utterances of botli the great political purties. Chicago Times: The President's message to the Fiftieth Congress is a new departure, original and unique. It is the beginning of tbe new and better method of inviting the attention of Congress briefly to some sugges tions on a single topic of leading importance on which, in the judgment of the adminis tration, legislative co-operation in a certain directionjis necessary, or of high importance. In electing this course, there is much ground for the opinion that tbe timely and excellent suggestions from the White House will not be passed over with the customary legisla tive disregard of suggestions from the consti tutional bead of the Republic. Chicago News: There is uo partisanship, no free trade, no appeal to class prejudice, no special hobby, in the President's message. It is plain patriotic common sense from open to close. lie has done well in confining it to the one subject of tarifl reform. His action must focus public attention upon the neces sity of a systematic reduction of the tariff without prejudice and without favor.
