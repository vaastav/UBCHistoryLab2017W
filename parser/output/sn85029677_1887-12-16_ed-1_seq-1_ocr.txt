To the Congroba of the United Bttee: Yoa ere confronted at the threshold of four leK'L-.lntivoa dutit-9 witn a coiuution of tlie national nnances;which imparativeiy d iiiands inmieUiaui and carelul cxnidoration. I'liu aiiioant of money annually exacted, tlirout'ii the operntiuu of iresent luwa, from the Industrie: and Necessities of the i)feOie, largely exceeds the sum necessary to meel the expenses of tl;e t'OVemujent. heu we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoy uiont of all the fruin of his industry and eu turprne, with such deduction aa may be hla share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the government which pro tect him, it ia plain the exaction of more than this ia iudispeusible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrony, iutiiotcd upon tho&e wiio bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs multiplies abroad, with evd consequences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit convey ing the people's tribute to the legitimate ob jects of exendiLure, becomes a hording place for meney needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus cripplina our national energies, investments in pro ductive enterprise, threateriny tiuancial dis turbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder. Thi condition of our treasury is not altogether new, and it has more than once of late been submit'.ed to the people s representatives in congress, w ho alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situation still continues, with airi;ravaied incidents, more thau ever premizing financial convulsion and wide-spread disaster. KKVtNL'KS AND EXPENDITtJKKS. It will not do to neglect this situation be cause its dangers ar not now now probably imminent and apparent. 'They exist none ttie less certainly and await the nnforseen Hud unexpected occasion, when, suddenly, they will be percipnated upon us. On the Join day of June, i.", the excess of revenue over public expenditures, after complinjj with the annual requirements of the binkiuij fund act, was 17, tVj, 73 ''.i. Djriuii tho year ended June 30, IS-m;, such excess amounted to '4L, -105,6' ,".0, and during tiie year ended June 0. 17, it reached the uin of J.Vi,'V;7,MJ..1. The annual contributions to the sinking fund during the three years above spec-Hied ammouuting in the ayre t;ate to i:a,oi.S;','.u:4, and deducted from the surplus as stated were made by calling in fir that purpose outstanding 3 per cent bonds of the government. During tlie six months prior to June ;-0. Is7, ttie surplus ruvenue bad grown so large by repealed ac cumul itious and it was feared the with drawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of tlie country that the sum of J7'.),M.4.1uO of such surplus was appl ed to the payment of the principal and interest of the ii per cent bonds still outstanding, and which were then payable at the option of the govern ment. The precarious condition of tiuancial atfnirs among tlie people still needing relief, immediate) alier the ;otii day of June, lSf7, the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then outstanding, amount ing with principal and interest to the sum of !lt,st7,iu0, w ere called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these opera tions of the treasury department representa tions of distress in business circles uot only continued, but increased, and abaolute per ils seemed at hand, lu these circumstances the contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the expenditure of !27,t4.Js3.ro in the pur chase of government bonds not due, bear ing 4 'i per ceut interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent for the for the former and K per cent for tiie latter. In addition to this the interest accruing dur ing the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the government was to some extent anticipated and banks se lected as depositories of public money were permitted to somewhat increase their depos its. H hile the expedients thus employed to release to the people the money lying idle in the treasury served to avert immediate danger. Our surplus revenues have continued to accumnlate, the excess for the present year amounting on tho 1st day of December to ?5;,2r.S,7o.llJ, and estimated to reach the sum of $li;S,uuO, 1)00 ou the :ioth of June next, at which date it is expected this sum, added to prior accu ulations, will swell the surplus in the treas ury to .14',(AAJ,ou). There seems to be no assurance that witn such a withdrawal from use of the people's circulating medium, our business community may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced from tiie same e iuse aud. while the functions of our nation al treasury should be few and simple, aud while its best condition would be reached, 1 believe, by its entire disconnection with pri vate business interests, yet when by per version of its purposes it idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seeins to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means be de vised by the government to restore, in an emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. Nil 

EXEC'UTIK POWCU OF BELIEF. If -uch an emergency arises there now ex ists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of S percent, bonds, which were payable at the op;iou of the government, has afforded a means for the disbursement of tlie excess of our revenue, but these bonds have all been retired, and there are'uo bonds outstanding, the payment of which we have the right To insist upon. The contribution to the fink ing lund which tuinishes the occasion for expenditure in the purchase of bonds has been already made for tho current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In tho present state of legislation the only pre tense of any existing executive power to re store at this time any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its expenditure, conits in the supposition that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power could be found is in the appropriation bill passed a number of years ago: and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as temporary and limited in its application, instead of confer ring a continuing discretion and au thority. No condition ought to ex ist which would justify the grant of power to a single official upon his judg ment of its necessity, to withhold from a re lease to the business of the people in an nn usuid manner, money held in the treasury and thus a.tect, at his will, tlie financial sit uation of the country; and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture -to pur chase bonds, it should be plainly vested aud provided as far as possiole, with snch checks and limitations as will define this ofticial's right and discretion, and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating in the treasury, it should be borne in miud that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which sauuot be purchased at any price aud that jombiuatious among holders who are wili ng to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the government- It has been suggested that the present bonded de.bt might be refunded at a less rate of in terest and the diilereuce between the oid and new security paid in cash, thus finding nse for the surplus ia the treasury. The success of this plan, it is apparant, must depend upon the volition of the holders of the present bonds; and it is 'not entirely certain that the inducement which must be offered them would result in more financial beneut to the government than the purcha-se of bonds, while the latter propo sition would reduce the principal of tne cebt by Rctual payment instead of extend ing it. The proposition todeiiosit the money held by tne government in banks through out the country for use by tlie people is, it eems to me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as establishing too close a rehi tiouship between the operation of the gov ernment treasury and the business of the country and too extensive a commingling of their money, thus fostering an uim.tumi reliance in private baainea upon publio funds. If this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a temporary expedi ent to meet an urgent necessity. Legisla tive and executive eifort should generally be in the opposite direction and should have a tendency to divorce, as much and as fast as can safely be done, tlie treasury depart ment from private enterprise. Of course it is not expected th.t unnecessary and ex travagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue, buch expenditure be side the demoralization of all just concep tions of public duty which it entails, stimu lates a habit of reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and beneficieut ideas of our government. IMS 

OKAVITX OF THE SITUATION. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen as well as the attention of their represenatives charged with the responsibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our tiuuncial situation. Tlie failure of congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quae evi dent tho very nature of the dilhculty must necessarily porduce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your laat adjournment which taxed to the utmost all tiie authority and expendients within executive control, and those appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inaction of congress the responsibility murt rest where it belongs. Through the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to the peopie aa well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing out of a perfect and apparent cause constantly re prodLcing the sameularming circumstances a congested national treasury and depleted monetary condition in the business of I he country. It need hardly be 6tatodthat while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by tne removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the peo ple aud put into tne public treasury, consists of a taritf or duty levied noon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxation which are, strictly speaking necessaries, there appears to be no just cause for complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tar itf laws, the vicious, inequitable and illogi cal source of unnecessary taxation ought to be at once revised and amended. These luws, as their piimary and plain effort, raise the price to consumers of all articles im ported and subiect to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by thosd who purchase for use these imported arti cles. Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured ia our own country and duties levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home manufactures, because they render it possi sible for those of our peopie who are manu facturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for tlie imported goods that have paid duty, bo it happens that where comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people who never use and never saw any of the foreign products purchase and use things of the same kind made in this coun try and pay therefor nearly or quite the fame enhanced price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy im ports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who buy domestic articles of the same class pay a sum at least approxi mately equ-tl to this duty to the prime man ufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of in struction, but in order that we may be con stantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who con sume domestio products, as well as those v ho consume imported articles, and thus j create a tax upon all our people. It is nut proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively con tinued as the source of the government's in come, and in a readjustment of our tanrf the interests of American labor engaged in manufacture shonld be carefully considered as well as the preservation of our manufac turers. It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the ha.d ships and dangers of our present tarilf laws should be devised with special precaution against imperilling the existence or our manufacturing interests. THK LAbOB 

QUESTION. But this existence should not meau a con dition which, without regard to the public welfare or national exigency must always in sure the realization of immense profits in stead of moderately profitable returns, as the volume and diversity of our national activities increase, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuance of the advan tages which they conceive the present sys tem of tariff taxation directly affects them, bo stubbornly have all eff orts to reduce the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged, that they call hardly compluin of the suspicions enter tained to a certain extent that there existed an organized combination all along the line to maintain their advantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and en terprise, and in the wonderful natural advan tages and resources developed by a century's national growth, yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon ever consumer in the land, for the benefit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for gov ernmental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our manufactures infant in dustries, still needing the highest and great est degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from federal legislation. . it is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures resulting from tiie present tan Li is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our working men, employed in manufactures than are paid for what is called the pauper labor of h-urope. All wiil acknowledge the force of an argument which involves tiie welfare and l.berai compensation of our labor is honora ble in the eyes of every American citizen, and as it lies at the foundation of our devel opment and progress it is entitled, without any affectation and hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. T he standard of our laborer's lives should not be measured by that of any other country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of ail our advantages. By tht last census it is made to appear of the n.X'L'.Gyy of our population engaged in all kinds of industries 7,t;7u,4y3 are employed in agriculture, 4,074, 2 S iu professional and personal service, (2,lio-,87G of whom are do mestic servants and laborers,) while 110, 2fi are employed in trade and transporta tion, and 3,si7,lL2 are classed as employed in manufacturing and mining. For present purposes, however, the last number given should be considerably reduced, Without attempting to enumerate fcil it will be con ceded that there should be deducted from these, which includes 375,143 carpenters and joiners, N,-401 milliners, dressmakers and seamstresses, 17,7Li blacksmiths, 133,170 tailors and tailoresses, 10-:,473 masons, 7o,--'il butchers, 41,3uu bakers, ,03 plasterers, and 4,b.H engaged in manufacturing agrh cuitural implements, amounting in the ag gregate to 1,14,01:3, leaving 2,uii,tiMl persons tm ployed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefitted by a high tar iff. To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain theirwages by re si.-.ting a cliange. There should be no dispos tion to answer such suggestions by the alle gation that they are in a minority among those who labor, and therefore, should fore go an advantage in the interest of low prices lor the majority; their compensation as it may be affected by the operation of tarilf laws. should at all tiinej be scrupulously kept in view; aud yet with slight refiection they will not overlook the faci that they are con sumers with the rest. They too, have their own wants and thOBe of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the prices of the necessaries of life as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate the measure of their welfare and comiort, but the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or jus tify either the loss of employment f y the workiaguien nor the lessening of his wagrs and the profits still remaining to tiie man ufacturer alter a necessary readjustment, should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of the interests of his employes either in their oppori unity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the worker in manufactures fad to understand that while a h'gh tarilf is claimed to be necessary to a low the payment of remunerative wiei, it certainly results iu a very large increase in tiie price of nearly all sorts of manufac tures, which, in Almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself and his family. He receives at tne den of his enipioyer ins wages, and perhaps before he reoci.es Lis homu in obi-ed,iua rurci-ase for f;uii,; ua. of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariff permits, the hard earned compensation of many days of tuii. THE 

FABMKB AND WOoL OSOffXS, The farmer and the agriculturist who manufactures nothing but who pay the in creased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural implement upon ail he wears and upon all he uses and owns except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry produces from the soil is invited to maintain the present situation, and he is told a high duty on un posted wool is necessary tor the benefit of those who have sheep to shear in order that the price of their wool may be increased. They of course are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged in his purchase of clothiug and woolen goods to pay a tribute to the his fellow farmer as well as to the manufacturer and merchant. Nor is any mention made of the fact that sheep owners themselves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices aud thus this as consumers must return then share of the inei eased price to tradesmen. I think it may be f airly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country, are found in small docks numbering from twenty-five to fifteen. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents for each pound, if of the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 cents if of the value of more than 3d cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be CO or 70 cents, and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Kighteen dollars would tl;us represent the increase! price of the wool from twenty-five sheep, and j3U that from the wool of fifty sheep and at present values this addition would amount to about one-third of its price. It upon its Eale tlie farmer receives this or a less taritf profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in ail its changes will adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer. When manu factured into cloth aud other goods and ma terial for use its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmers' ttriff pr- fit, but a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the farmer Unas it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himself and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return, in the way of in creased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cont caused by a tariff duty on the nianu'acture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the taritf scheme which, when he sold his wool, seemed so profitable an increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the taritf profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all the farmers in the country and the small proportion they bear to our popula tion is considered, then it is made apparent that in the case of a large part of those who own sheep the benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory aud above all when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a bur den upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young and eld, and that it constitutes a tax winch, with relent less grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land. Rea-ons are suggested why removal or re duction of this duty should be included ia a revision of our tariff laws. THE CliOWTH OV 

"MUSTS." Tn speaking of the increased cost to the con-s-iiner of our home manufactures, resulting fr jin the duty laid upon imported articles of t a 5 same dcsr.ption tne fact is no: overlooked mat compettou among our uoinestio pro ducers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit alio a ed by such duty. But it is noto rious that this competition is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time and frequently culled "trusts," which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consid eration in tne operation of these selfish schemes. If, however, in the absence of such combination a healthy and free compe tition reduces the price of any particular du tiable article of home production below the limit wiiich it might otherwise reach under our taritf laws, aud if with such reduced price its manufacture continues to thrive it is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scruti nized in an effort to reduce taxation. '1 he necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to taritf poiut furn ishes proof that some one is willing to ac cept lower i rices for such commodity and that such prices are remunerative and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus where either of these con ditions exist a case would seem to be pre sented for an easy reduction of taxatiop. AN APPEAL, TO MANlTACTUBEES. The considerations which have been pre sented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation tlmt the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the reduction of our custom duties and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this pur pose we may discharge) a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources which it can be most fairly and justly accord ed. Nor can the presentation made of such considerations be with any degree of fairness regarded as evidence cf uuiriendliness to ward our manufacturing interests or of any lack of appreciation of their value and im portance. These interests constitute a lead ing and most substantial elerrent of our national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. But in the emergency that presses us on, our manufacturers are asked to sur render something for the public good, and to avert disaster, their patriotism as well as a grateful recollection of the advantages al ready afforded should lead them to willingly co-operate. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of government al regards, but they cannot fu.il to be ad monished of their duty as well as their en lightened self interest and safety when they are reminded of the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present condition tends, aff ord no greater shelter or protection to our manufacturers than to our other im portant enterprises. An opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is now offered, and none of us should be unmindful of the time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may insist up on a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. 

ILFFICCL.TI9TO OVEltCOLiE. The difficulty attending a wise and fair re vision of our tariff laws is Mot under-esti-mared. It will require on the part of the congress great lab-r and care, and espe cially a brond and national contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unrea sonable and reckless of the welfare of the entire countr. Under our presentlaws more than 4,(AXJ articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures and many are hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable reduction can be made ia the aggregate by aduing them to the free, list T he taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship: but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction of the duties imposed upon raw material used in manufactures, or its free importation, is of course an important fac tor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries; it would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariil on such material, but the manufactured pro duct being thus cheapened, that part of the tarilf now laid upon such product as a comparatton to our manufactures for the present price of rw material could be ac cording modified. Such reduction or free importation would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any in jurious effect upon our manufactures On the contrary it would appear to give them a better chance ia foreign markets with the manufacturers of oilier countries who cheapen their wares by free maieriaL T fins our people might save the opportunity of extending their sales beyond the litmus of home consumption, saving tiiem from tLe deijret-jion, inwiTupuoa iu b assess aiid So.s caused by a glutted domestio market, and affording their employes more certain aud steady labor, with ita resulting quiet and contentment. 

PARTISANSHIP SBOUTLD BE FOBGOTTKN. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those insrusted with the wealth of a confiding people. But the obligation to declare party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now rep resented iu the government have, by re peated and authoritative declarations, con demned the condition of our laws which permit the collection from the people of un necessary revenues and have, in the most solemn manner promised its correction; and neither as citizens ror partisans are our coun trymen ia a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be im proved by dwelling upon the theories of pro tection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condi tion which confronts us not a theory. Kelief from this condition may involve a light reduction of the advantages winch we award our home production, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages ahould not be contemplated. FBEK TRADE IB RE LEVANT. The question of free trade is absolutely ir relevant and the presistent claim made in certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders is mis chievioas and far removed from any con sideration for the public good. The simple and lain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expense of an economical operation of the govern ment and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of govern mental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our in dustries, without danger to the opportu nity (for reuumerative labor, which our workingmen need, and with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. T iie constitution provides that the presi dent shall from time to time give to con gress information of the state of the union. It has been the custom of the executive, in compliance with this provision, to annually exhlfcit to the congress, at the opening of its session, the general condition of the country and to detail with some particularity the operations of the different executive depart ments. It would be especially agreeable to foilow this course at the present time, and to call attention to the valuable accomplish ments of these departments during the last fiscal year, bt t I am ro much impressed with the paramount importance of the subject to which this communication has thus far been devoted, that I shall foregore the addition of any other to i 10 and only urge upon your immediate n.insiuerafr'on, tlie state of ths uu iou rs hown in the pre.-ent condition of cur trens ury and our general fiscal situation upon which every element of our safety and pros perity depends. The reports of the head of depart ments which will be submitted con tains full and explicit information touching the transaction of business intrusted to them and sucn recommendations relating to legis ation in the publio interests as they deetn advisable. I ask for these reports and rec ommendations the deliberate examina tion and action of the legislative branch of the government. The are other subjects not embraced in the depart mental report demanding legislative con sideration and which I should be glad to submit some of them, howerer, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recoiii6Uuaiious. As the laws makes no provisions for UDy report from the depart ment of state a brief history of the trans actions of that important department, together with other matters which it tuny hereafter be deemed essential to commend to the attention of the congress, may furn ish the ocoassioa for a future communi ;atiou.

Under the head of recommendations of the board, the re port states that the building of numerous additional railroads iu the state has giv.a rise to numerous applications to the board for the location of depots and stutions iu ad dition to those supplied by building compa nies. Wherever it lias appeared lo the board upon an iuvestigition lhat the application was reasonable and tlmt a real public con venience would be thereby subserved, the supply of the facilities petitioned for has been recommended.
