SPIRIT OF JEFFERSON. OHABun Town, Jbftbhsox Coo*tt, W. Va. TUESDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 10. 1805. Judge Peckham's record is in op position to trusts. Thanks to Hon. W. L. Wilson for Report of tbe Smithsonian Institute for 1889, and Reports on the Fish In dustries of the United State9. Postmaster-General Wilson made the opening address at the great teachers' fair and bazaar in Conven tion Hall, Washington City, last ?reek. _ The Kentucky Legislature is a tie on joint ballot, a special election in the fourth legislative district Satur day having resulted in favor of the Democrats. The sixtieth birthday anniversary of Mr. Charles Broadway Rouss, Febuary 11th, 1896, will be appro priately celebrated by the Union Fire Company of Winchester. The President nominated Rufus W. Peckham, of New York, to be as sociate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to succeed the late Justice Jackson, of Tennessee. Farmers who de3ire copies of the West Virginia Farm Reporter, which ?will be sent free, should send their names and post office address to C. C. Brown, Secretary State Board of Agriculture, Charleston, W. Va. Governor O'Ferrall, of Virginia, devotes a portion of his annual mes sage to the race track and gambling evils prevalent across the river from Washington, and makes some vigor ous and striking recommendations in regard thereto. The Charleston Mail does not favor an extra session of the Legislature. The Mail, q?ite likely, thinks the unenviable reputation won by this Republican body in a brief session last winter quite sufficient, without risking another exhibition previous to next fall's elections. Senator Faulkner has introduced a bill author izing the secretary of the Treasury to pay to the estate of A. H. Herr, deceased, late of the Dis trict of Columbia, ?17,288.53, al lowed the estate of A. H. Herr by the Secretary of War for the use of his premises, known as Herr's Island, near Harper's Ferry, by the army during the late war. The principal feature of President Cleveland's message is a recommen dation that the present drain upon the national finances be remedied by the retirement of the greenbacks and the outstanding treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the act of 1890, the Sherman act. Foreign relations are treated in an able manner, and departmental mat ters are left to be noted by the houses in the form of the annual reports of the cabinet officers. The message closes with an appeal to Congress to promptly and effectively consider the critical financial situation, and the President declares that he is pre pared to co-operate with the people's representatives in perfecting aDy other measure than that which he suggests, should such an alternative be preferred. Mrs. Rosa Wright Smith gave an enjoyable tea in Washington Satur day iu honor of Mrs. Craighill, wife of Gen. W. P. Craighill, chief of en gineers, United States Army. Mrs. Wright, mother of the hostess, as sisted Mrs. Smith in receiving the guests. The other ladies of the re ceiving party were Mrs. John M. Wilson, Mrs. Alexander, Miss Wal ler, Mrs. Handbury, wife of Major Handbury; Mrs. Elliott, wife of Colonel Elliott, and Mrs. Vincent, wife of General Vincent. Among the guests were Secretary and Mrs. Lamont, Secretary and Miss Morton, Secretary Herbert, Postmaster-Gen eral and Mrs. Wilson, Surgeon-Gen eral and Mrs. Sternberg, Professor and Mrs. W. D. Cabell, Commander and Mrs. Lamberton, Miss Washing ton, General and T. H. Stanton, General and Mrs. Marcus J. Wright, Mrs. Benjamin Micou and Miss Bay lor, Miss Sherman, General and Mrs. Van Viliet, and a number of other persons promiuent in Washington so ciety. The stockholders of the Shenan doah Valley Agricultural Society, at their reeent annual meeting, passed the following resolution: That the stockholders here assem bled* voicing as we are assured, the sentiment of each and every member of the society, renew as we have so often had occasion to do, our sincerc thanks to Mr. C. B. Rouss for his continued liberality in aid of our As sociation. "May he live long and prosper!" is our heartful wish. President McCann in his report of the last fair said : Our warm friend and patron Mr. Chas. B. Rouss not only honored us with his welcome annual visit, but made his usual munificent donation to the Society's funds; without which assistance during the past ten years candor compels me to say that we would not have been able to attain our present enviable condition. No mark of honor and respect which this Society can extend to Mr. Rouss can possibly discharge the lasting obli gations which we owe him.

Robert McDowell,colored, charged with burning the dwelling of Sheriff Eugene Baker, was tried in the cir cuit Court last Tuesday and Wednes day, Col. Forrest \V. Brown and Mr. \V. F. Alexander representing the State and Mr. J. F. Engle, Col. B. D. Gibson and Mr. U. S. G. Pitzer ap pearing for the prisoner. The case was ably contested on both sides, and the jury, after being out but a few minutes, returned a verdict of guilty, with confinement in the peni tentiary. This under the law will be a life sentence; whereas a simple verdict of "guilty" would have im posed the death penalty. The jury in this case was one of the best we have ever seen empaneled in Jefferson county. At a former trial the jury disagreed standing 9 for hanging to 3 against. Motion for a new trial. The case of Moses Bennett, a ped dler, against the B. & O. R. R. Co. for $2,000 damages for alleged in juries received in getting off a mov ing passenger train at Duffields, about two years ago, was concluded, with a verdict for defendant. Thi9 was the second trial of the case, the former trial resulting in a hung jury. Brown and Alexander for plaintiff; Baylor and Wilson for defendaut. A Welcome Usher of '96.

The north bound train due at 7:41 was also de tained here a short while. . Cancer Of the Breast Mr. A. H. Crausby Is one of the best known and most highly respected citi zens of Memphis, and resides at 158 Kerr street in that city. Some years ago his wife noticed a small lump in her breast. She thought nothing* 01 it, but it increased in size rapidly, and soon broke through the skin and commenced to discharge. She was at once put under treatment of the best jJhysicians, but they very soon found that they could do her no good, and simply prescribed antiseptics to keep the place clean. Both her grandmother and aunt, by the way, ad died with cancer, and when ap prised of this fact the doctors said that they would not attempt to save her; that she was incurable. Although the cancer had by this time become deep seated and her health very low, one of the most noted specialists of New York then treated her. After treating her awhile, this doctor admitted that the MRS. A. H. 

CRAUSBY. case .was hopeless and further treat ment useless. "It is difficult to im agine how despondent we all became," said Mr. Crausby, "knowing- that she must die and unable to give her any relief. I had spent over five hundred dollars with the best medical skill to be had, and felt that there was no further hope. "One day I happened to read an ad vertisement of S. S. S., recommending that remedy for cancer, and in view of the failure of the most eminent physi cians in the country, I confess I had little faith left in any human agency. However, I purchased a bottle of S.S.S., and to my delight it seemed to benefit her. After she had taken a couple of bottles the cancer began to heal, and astonishing as it may seem, a few bot tles more cured her entirely. You can probably better understand how re markable this cure was when I explain that the cancer had eaten two holes in the breast two inches deep. These healed up entirely, and although ten years have elapsed, not a sign of the disease has ever returned, and we arc assured of the permanence of the cure, which we at first doubted. "As my wife inherited the cancer, I certainly regard S. S. S. as the most wonderful remedy in the world, and it is truly a Godsend to those afflicted with this terrible disease. You may be sure that I shall always be grateful to that remedy, for without it my home would now be desolate and my chil dren motherless.* * The above is but one of many re markable cures being daily made by S. S. S. Cancer is becoming alarm ingly prevalent, and manifests itself in such a variety of forms, that any lump, sore or scab, it matters not how small, which does not readily heal up and dis appear may well be regarded with suspicion. We will gladly send to any address, full accounts of several other cures fully as remarkable as this one. Por real blood troubles, S. S. S. has no equal. It wipes out completely the most obstinate cases of blood diseases, which other remedies do not seem to touch. S. S. S. gets at the root of the disease, and forces it out permanently. S. S. S. is guaranteed purely vegeta ble, and is a positive and permanent cure for Scrofula, Eczema,' Cancer, Rheumatism and all traces of bad blood. Our valuable books will be mailed free to any address. Swift Specific Co., Atlanta, Ga. Items of Interest. Bernard C. Gerling, merchant, of Martinsburg, is dead. Hon. A. S. Dandridgo has lost a number of hogs by cholcra. Mr. Snowden Files and Mrs. Eliza Files, his wife, died Dec. 2, at the home of their son, Mr. John B. Files, in Berkeley county. Mrs. Files died at 8 o'clock'in the morning n?d her husband's death occurred at 6 o'clock in the evening. He was ninety-one years old and she was eighty-eight, and they had spent nearly seventy years of married life together. Mr. Charles Broadway Rouss has again illustrated the magnificence of liis liberality by his contribution of S25,000 to the re-establishment of the library of the University of Virginia. This donation will stimulate the friends of the University all over the United States, to vigorous and self denying efforts towards the upbuild ing of that famous institution. It is safe to say that Mr. Rouss has justly acquired the reputation of being the greatest living American philanthrop ist. He does good in his life. Most men postpone tiieir generosity for a post-mortem occasion.?Win. Times. The barn of Mr. A. P. Reinhart, about three miles southeast of Shep herdstown, was destroyed by fire Friday night, with most of its con tents. Mr. Reinhart got all of his horses out of the barn, but a cow was burned to death. He also lost several hundred bushels of wheat, a large quantity of fodder and hay, eighty bushels of apples, all his har ness and some farming implements. It is not known how the fire origina ted. His barn was insured for 51,000 and the contents for S500, in agency of Washington & Alexander of this plane, through sub-agency of Mr. J. S. Fleming at Shepherdstowu. A Significant Departure. With tlie departure ol another year when a review is luuiie of the coudition of affairs, it is only right that Mill](3 thought he given to the physical body which cnablee everyone to hat lie with life's problem and figure for them selves the profit or loss on the trial balance sheet. Though the bunk account may be large and each one'simatcrial gain he great, it would not be surprising if it suddenly dawns upon many that good health has been greatly impoveiished by the low condition of the blood. It is in this state that the lactic acid In the vital fluid attacks the fibrous tissues, particularly the joints, making known the iocal manifestations of rheumutlsm.
