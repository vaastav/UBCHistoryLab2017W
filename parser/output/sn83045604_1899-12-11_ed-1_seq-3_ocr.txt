"WHATCOM, Dec. 10.—A test of a sec tion In ths revsnus laws of 1899 that Is of !nt*est to ths larger cities of the state _,,7 be msde by ths city of Whatcom, unless County Treasurer Roeder recedes Smnhls position In the matter. An Interpretation of the law by the eouitty treasurer hut placed the city In an •mbar raising position In regard to the garment of old warrants, as the amount to sontroversy '.a a sum between MO.OOO god 160,000. In the large payment of de- Hiwoent taxes In the county this year the dt* property of Whatcom paid approxl ■tfly CM. o **. this nearly 150,000 was tfce" Interest penalty of 6 per cent. Treas urer Boeder haa paid this penalty Into the county current expense fund Instead of ti the city. He bases his action on a portion of section six of the new law, v hlch reads: "There shall be an allowance of 3 per cent rebate to all payers of taxes who titan pay the taxes on real property In «nt payment and In full on or before the Bth dey of Msrch next prior to the date Sf delinquency. All rebates allowed under this section shall be charged to the county current expense find, and all collections from penalties and Interest on delinquent taxes shall be credited to the current ex ptttss fund." Ike city contends that the last sentence «f the section refers only to the taxes of ]M and subsequent years, and therefore the city Is entitled to the Interest penal tics on the taxes In question. Inasmuch ii they are for the years prior to 1899; that the provision was made solely as an offset to the payment of the 3 per cent, (elate out of the same fund. The treas urer takes the stand that the clause la retroactive. The embarrassing situation is this: War rants have been drawn up to the full lim it of amount that could be realized from the tax levlea of the years In question. These warrants have been drawing Inter est, and aa the penalty was supposed to provide for the payment of that IntereM ho levy was made therefor. If Treasurer Roeder Is sustained by the owirti this city and others will have to ■take additional levlea to take up a con siderable portion ot. their old warrant In debtedness. as the Interest thereon will have eaten up a large share of the levy and left the later warrants without pro vision for their payment.

RAVENCOITBT GOEB ASHORE. Yellow Fever Ship la Quarantine* at Port Townaend Driven Ashore la Pleree Oale ot Wlad. Special Dispatch to the Poat-tntelllgencer. PORT TOWNS END. Dec. M.-Miafor tunea thick and fast are following In the wake of the big British ship Ravenscourt, now on her llrst voyage io thla aide of the world, and shipping men are becoming confirmed In the belief that the vessel is suffering from a hoodoo of some sort. Three months ago the Ravenscourt arrived at Panama, Just In time to run Into the epidemic of yellow fever then at Ita height In the equatorial sonea. Eight men abord. Including the master and first officer, were stricken with the disease, and four of the number succeumbed. The officers and two of the forecastle hands aurvlved the rav ages of the disease, and all haste waa made to get away from the epldemlc atrlcken oort. The Ravenaeourt arrived here on Thurs day last, after encountering soms of the terrific weather that has prevailed off the coast for the past two months, and dropped anchor, only to find that. In stead of proceeding without delay to her loading port. It was necessary bsfore the customs authorities would permit her to enter to pass through the ordeal of fumi gation at the hands of tha United States quarantine officers to prevent the admis sion Into the Sound country of any of the germs of the dreaded yellow Jack. To accomplish this the vessel had to be taken to the government station at Dia mond point, south of here, and there not only undergo thorough fumigation for the men and quarters, but also discharge all ballast and have It subjected to the steam process through which the disease germs hue killed. On SatSriJay morning the Ravenscourt was towed down to the station by a tug. The master of the towing vessel adm'on lshed Capt. Scott against depending upon the government buoy off the quarantine station for an anchorage, but that this good advice was not heeded became ap parent late Saturday night when a tele graphic message from the quarantine officer In charge brought information that a fierce gale prevailed, and the vessel was slowly but surely dragging ashore on the rough beach. No tug was in port, and Oven tha reve nue cutters could not be secured at the time. loiter, however, Capt. Bailey, with the big Tyee, waa dispatched to the relief of the vessel and succeeded In securing her for a tow to safe anchorage up the bav a few hours after the vessel's stern had struck. She was pounding hard when the tug arrived, and only the great power of the Tyee prevented her becom ing a total wreck. As It Is, the vessel Is so badly damaged that she will have to go on the drydock for repairs. It at first looked aa though the govern ment would be called on to settle dam ages for the injuries sustained while In the hands of the quarantine officials, but the prospects of this, or even of the Insurance people losing anything, are de cidedly slim, according to the story nar rated by a man who visited the scene. Instead of heeding Capt. Bailey's advice about the buoy. It would appear that Capt. Scott had taken no further pre caution, and It Is said that even while the stern was grinding on the beach the anchors were swinging Idly over the side. While the holding ground Immediately about the buoy Is not of the best, mari ners say Capt. Scott could have, and should have, taken steps to save his ves sel from grounding by dropping out his heavy anchors. The fumigation process has been delayed by the accident, and It is now an uncertainty as to the date when the vessel will finally be discharged from the custody of the quarantine of ficials and permitted to proceed up Sound to take on cargo. PLECKY DEPUTY SHERIFF. Shoot* Hsrie From Vader Escaping Prlaoaer and Captarei His Maa. PORTLAND. Dec. 10.—A special to the Oregpnlan from The Dalles says: Deputy Sheriff Howell, of Wasco coun ty, had an exciting experience today with two men. Brown and Wilson, whom he had arrested on the Canyon City road on charges of horse stealing in this county and highway robbery in Port land.

St. Paal Clergymaa Preaches Against Women's Work. ST. PAUL, Minn., Dec. 10.-Rev. Dr. S. O. Smith, pastor of the People's church, in this city, whose recent statements in regard to the women wage-earners and their in terference with men workers have attract ed wide attention and criticism, tonight re plied to his critic* in a sermon. Dr. Smith ■aid In part: "It was In savage times that woman was the slave and served her master in menial tasks. We are fast on the road to a new savagery. The problem began when the discovery of machinery and the factory system took the place of the man and tool. Greedy employers bade the delicate lin gers of woman and the dimpled hand of childhood to grasp the fallen task. "Economic conditions have no chivalry and human avarice have no sense of hon or. The majority of working women in this country, now four millions of them, are between the ages of fourteen and twenty flve. The great fact of the last decade, however, Is the enormous Increase among the number of girls under sixteen years of age. "We are devouring the possible strength of the nation by draining the life of Its fu ture mothers. Forty-flve per cent, of the manufacturing In the United States Is now done by women. "Make our women beasts of burden and the doom of our strength is at hand. No army Is any more vigorous than the moth ers who bore them. The tendencies of times when enormous increase of woman labor and of Immature young women. Is the economic, social, moral and physical evil of our time, and It is the most serious menace to the nation's life." CONTRAST IN CONDITION. Six-Day Bicycle Racer* In Good Physical Shape. NEW YORK.

MO PEAR lIT BERLIN OP PERMA NENT TROUBLE. Clrcalatloa Too Saturated With Gold to Be Greatly Deranged— Agrarlaa Press Begins Attaolc oa MeKlaley'a Message to Coagresa. BERLIN, Dec. 10.—The money market situation continues to be the chief con cern of the Oerman business world. Lon don exchange continued to rise all last week. Gold exports are now possible and therefore an Increase In the bank rate Is considered virtually certain. The offi cials of the relchsbank were In consulta tion yesterday on the subject, and there was a general sentiment In favor of an advance to 7 per cent. A definite decision Is likely to be taken Tuesday. The relchsbank statement yesterday showed much less Improvement than Is usual at this time of the year. Private discounts, after rising to a point near the official rate, eased off somewhat yes terday, but the rise In the London private rate causes an expectation here that the Bank of England will make yet another advance. Thus far, however, money market con ditions do not Inspire a fear of perma nent trouble In Berlin, a feeling of assur ance arising from the fact that German circulation Is so thoroughly saturated with gold that nny considerable derange ment Is Impossible. Today a high financial authority gave the correspondent of the Associated Press an estimate of the gold In circulation In Germany, placing this at 2,500,000,000 marks, and predicted that the Industrial situation would continue very strong. A leading official of the relchsbank ex plained that the Industrial boom had not yet reached Its culmination, but was now extending to the textile Industries. "Iron prices," he said, "continue to rise. The syndicate of rolled wire manufac turers have advanced prices ten marks a ton. A Franco-Belgian syndicate, with a capital of $10,000,000, has acquired the Westphalia coal mine and Intends to es tablish immense modern furnaces and steel mills on the Dortmund-Ems canal. A motion will be Introduced In the retch stag concerning the organisation of Ger man chambers of commerce in foreign cities, in which particular Germany now lags behind."^ The packet post between the United States and Germany Is a success. Dur ing the month of October 3,000 packages went from Germany, and during the month of November, 5,000. as against 11,- 000 during the whole of 1897. After keeping silence at first, the Agra rian press now begins to make a united attack upon that part of President Mc- Klnley's message to congress relating to the Joint commission proposition. The Deutsche Tages Zeltung says today: "Such a proposition Is wholly unaccept able. It Is monstrous. Its outcome would be that the shrewd Yankees would bam boozle the German members of the com mission about American meat with cal drons double bottomed and similar tricks, while the Americans here would manu facture evidence against beerß and wines. President McKinley's claims as to the healthfulness of American meats Is pre posterous after the scandalous embalmed meat trial." The leading editorial of the National Zeltung today commemorates the forth coming centenary of the death of Wash ington. Emperor William returned to Berlin last evening and spent today with the Imperial family at Potsdam. The report that Herr Rose, formerly German consul at Apia, will become gov ernor of Germany's share of the Samoan Island Is without foundation. He will soon re-enter the consular service, with an appointment of Importance. 

EYES AND NO EYES. Nature's Are Not Given to Every Paaaerby to piacover. That keen observer, John Burroughs, illustrates in the Century the difference between the naturally acuta observer and the on© who sees only what he sets him self to observe. If we think birds, we shall see birds wherever we go; if we think arrowheads, as Thoreau did, we shall pick up arrow heads in every fleld. Some people have an eye for four-leaved clovers; they see them as they walk hastily over the turf, for they already have them In their eye». X once took a walk with the late Prof. Eaton, of Yale. He was Just then spe cially Interested In the mosses, and he found them, all kinds, everywhere. I can see him yet, every few minutes upon his knees, adjusting his eye-glasses before some rare specimen. I once spent a, summer day In the moun tain home of a well-luiown literary woman and editor. She lamented the absence of birds about her house. I named a half dozen or more I had heard or seen in the trees within an hour—the indigo bird, the purple finch, the yellowbtrd, the veery thrush, the red-eyed robin, the song spar row, etc. "Do you mean to say you have seen or heard all these birds while sitting here on my porch?" she inquired. "I really have," X said. "I do not sea them or hear them," she replied, "and yet I want to very much." "No," said I, "you only want to want to see and hear them." You must have the bird in your heart before you can tlnd it in the bush. I was sitting in front of a farmhouse one dixy in company with the local nlm rod. In a maple tree in front of us I saw the great crested flycatcher. I called the hunter's attention to it, and asked him if he had ever seen that bird before. No, he had not; it was a new bird to htm. But he had probably seen it scores of times—seen it without regarding it. It was not the game he was in quest of, and his eye heeded It not. Human and artificial sounds and objects thrust themselves upon us; they are within our sphere, so to speak; but the life of nature we must meet half way; it is shy, withdrawn, and blends Itself with a vast neutral background. We must be initi ated; It is an order the secrets of which are well guarded. Her Point «( View. "Darling," exclaimed the happy hus band. after the minister had pronounced them one.

BRADLEY REPLIES TO BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. Sara >• Did Wot Equip Levi on That It Mick* He Urd M the Polls- Acted So That tbe Orders at Jtdce Toney Woald Be Enforced. FRANKFORT, Ky., Dec. 10.-Oov. Bradley gave out a lengthy statement to night, in which he Hays: "The state board of election commis sioners, after having expressly stated that they possessed no power to go be hind the returns, has seen lit to express their serious disapprobation of my con duct In calling out the state guards. It Is a source of profound regret that these gentlemen do not approve my course, for nothing Is to be so much desired as their approval. "Not contenting themselves with an ex pression of disapproval, however, they characterize my conduct as reprehensible and yet they say that they should not form opinions, and have not the right to form them on ex parte affidavits. Either these gentlemen formed their opinion <sn ex parte affidavits, or, what is worse, the reports of a partisan press, agreeing with the board that they could not go behind the returns In certifying the re turns In certifying the result. No effort was made to present the facts concern ing calling out the state guard. But as they have seen proper to overstep their duties in order to express condemnation, I will now give to the public the facts In the case." Gov. Bradley goes on to say that he did not equip the Legion In order that they should be used In this election, but that several companion had been organized and equipped months before the election. One, the Legion (or First Kentucky regi ment), had been unable to obtain an armory until one week before the elec tion, and for that reason they were not furnished equipment until that time. "The statement that I went to Louis ville to call out the guard," says Gov. Bradley, "was and Is a malicious false hood. Appointment were made for me to speak at three places In the city on Sat urday night before the election, and I went there to (111 them. After having r,pok«n. a number of the citizens asked me to remain over and speak at the Aud itorium Monday night, which I agreed to do, and the fact was announced. "Meanwhile, before Monday night, the press of the city showed very great bit terness and excitement. The mayor Is sued a proclamation saying bloodshed was apprehended and extra police were appointed. On Monday some eighty-sev en election officers were summarily re lieved and this added greatly to the In tense excitement already prevailing." Gov. Bradley says that he only ordered troops to assemble In Louisville and later at Covington after affidavits had been presented to him by citizens stating that soldiers were necessary to help the civil authorities maintain order and protect the lives and property of the people. In Louisville the troops were not permitted to go to the polls, except after they had closed them, only when Judge Tone? Informed him that his orders admitting Republican Inspectors to witness the count had been contemptuously Ignored. "I ordered out the troops to enforce the orders of Judge Toney, but owing to delays and misunderstandings they did not leave the armory until after 7 o'clock. When they did leave nearly every polling place In the city had been de serted and in no instance did they use any force or Intimidate any human be ing." "In no Instance," concludes he, "did I order the election to be Interfered with, or soldiers to be sent to the polls, but gave only such orders as were necessary to preserve the public peace and the lives and property of the citizens." 

MORMONS OPPOSED ROBERTS. Political Enemy of Ctah'a R'P"- aentatlve Makes a Statement. NASHVILLB, Tenn., Dec. 10,-The middle Tennesse conference of Mormons in session here was addressed by Benja man O. Htch, president of the Southern propaganda of his church. President Rich has charge of mission work in eleven states. Speaking tonight of the case of Representative-elect Roberts, of Utah, he said: "The case of Brlgham H. Roberts is being tried at Washington. Let congress .letermine the matter. I was one of Roberts' most bitter opponents and stumped the state of Utah against him. I did this merely because he was a Demo crat. I was working In the interest of my party. I know of many Mormon apostles who also vigorously opposed the election of Roberts, and on the stump supported the other candidate. The strongest and most influential supporters Roberts had in his campaign were non- Mormons. "I name one as Judge O. W. Peters, who was appointed by Grover Cleveland to a judgeship before Utah's statehood, and who Is a bitter enemy of the Mor mon people, having seut scores of them to prison for polygamy. He supported Roberts because Roberts was a Demo crat. The Republicans will attend to the case in a few days, which, in my Judg ment, will give the next electoral vote of Utah, Wyoming. Idaho and Montana to Mr. Bryan. I do not believe Roberts will be seated."
