T TIE PR IEIDIENT' MESSAG~iE. The annual message of President McKinley to congress was presented last Monday. It is an able document, reviewing briefly all notable events that transpired during the war, and clearly states the present existing con ditions. Everything is set forth clearly, in plain language, and on broad and non-partisan lines. The in crease of the standing army and the interests of labor receive brief recom mendations, but the scheme of the In diauapolis monetary convention is en tirely left out, and no mention is made regarding it. The message is a straightforward presentment of the affairs of the nation, in a business like manner, and is characteristic of the firm and impartial position which marks the past record of the president. The state board of canvassers has completed its labors and Judge Brantly has been declared elected chief justice by a majority of 157. TIlE 

ENDI O(i TIliE '.At. Spain will sign the treaty. Every de mand of the United States is conceded. The protocol stands exactly as written. The Philippines are ours. 'Their control, disposition and form of government have been determined and will be Amer ican. Porto Rico is a part of our terri tory, and Cuba is entirely released from Spanish sovereign'y and claim. Thus ends the war of 1898 with supreme tri umph on the field of battle and in the treaty nego iations. The power of the people of !he Uni ed States in a right eous cause has again been shown to the world, and more impressively than ever. It was no par y or faction that forced the war. The people decreed it. Their indignant sentiment swept over all bar riers. They asked that the reign of atrocity in ('tba be ended and, united in nil! 'lo stat cs. pressed forward to fill the reitirecnents of the governmen'. On April 23d c'war was declared: on May 1 ]) :.wey won a marvelous victory in Ma nilla bay; on July 3 the Cervera fleet was destroyed; before the month was out Santiago surrendered with 24,000 men; on August 12 the protocol was signed, and on November 28 the Spanish peace commissioners assented to the treaty proposed. The war lasted 219 days, a few days beyond seven months. Among the ballots rejected at Garnet was one where the voter had marked circles in place of crosses opposite the names of the several candidates on the Silver Republican ticket. The court held that the ballot was legal and should be counted. Judge Durfee jok. ingly remarked that this voter must have been an A. P. A. and opposed to the sign of the cross. The president's message is before congress and Charlie Hartman has proclaimed his disapproval. Mr. Hart man is subject to a chronic desire to fnd fault with or object to everything done in congress, and if his influence would be as far-reaching as his gall, we should not be at all surprised to learn of the message being referred back to the president for correction, to meet Mr. Hartman's views. How ever, our Charlie is one of those un fortunate . amples who kick about everything but accomplish nothing. 

WILL ADVANCE SILVEIR'S CALME. Several Democratic papers have just discovered what The Mail has claimed and advocated for months past. Now that the acquisition of the Philippine group of islands by the United States is a certainty they admit that silver is the chief medium of exchange in our new colonies and that for the be.t interests of the peop'e and commerce ths islands must remain on a silver basis. Just so; their geographical situation, the pecu liar needs of their residents and the commercial rela ions exis ing with silver using countries of the far east demand that silver be used as money, and under Republican rule it is safe to predict that such will be the case. Not alone will silver be used as money in our new colo nies, but the cause of bimetallism will also be advanced materially in the United Sta'ee and the acquisition of the Philippines is an Important step in that direction. The success of the Republi can party is also a victory for silver. The residents of this state have cer tainly no cause for complaint as far as the conditions of the weather are con cerned. For several weeks the Atlantic coast and middle states have been sub jected to the most terriffic storms known in history, a; d many lives were lost through sutffering from the intense cold; while here in Montana we have enjoyed excellent heather. Almost every one of the old set lore of the state experience the fac. when away from home that no other state or country can beat Montana cilmate at any season of the year, and the remark is often heard that Mon tana is a Paradise compared with many other parts of the country. 

VAI.UAIII.E IUSHIES. An eastern paper prints an extract from the director of the mint which claims that silver has bean produced by the Granite Mountain mining company at a cost of 121 cen's per ounce. The next thing we expect to learn is that sil ver can be grown on bushes at consider able less than the above figures since the expense of mining would be saved entirely. Over in the Philippines a shrub has been discovered which pro duces precious stones, and by some sys tem of grafting it might be made to pro duce silver. For an experiment, our silver miners should import some of this gem-growing shrubbery and by plant ing a bush or two in the lower levels of the Granite mine the product might be silver instead of opals or diamonds. In time the whole Granite hill cou'd be covered with this kind of shrubbery and all the expense attached to producing silver would be the gathering in of the crop. BSALLOTS THAT WlER.E C'OUNTEI). For the benefit of the public generally and for the guidance of judges of elec tion in the future we publish a few rul ings that were made regarding the marking of ballots in the contest case or F. J. McDonald vs. George Metcalf, involving the office of sheriff. A ballot marked with a cross in the circle at the head of the Democratic ticket and also with a cross in the circle at the head of the Populist ticket was counted for Mr. McDonald, the Demo cratic-Populist candidate, whose name appeared on both tickets. A ballot marked with a circle within the circle, instead of a cross, at the head of the Democratic ticket, was counted for Mr. McDonald. A ballot marked with small circles iL stead of crosses, opposite and to the right of the names of tLe several candidates upon the Silver Re publican ticket, was counted for Mr. Metcalf. A ballot marked with crosses oppo site, but to the right of the names of toe several candidates upon the Silver Re publican ticket, was counted for Mr. Metcalf. A ballot marked with crosses opposite the blank spaces just below the names of the several candidates upon the Sil ver Republican ticket was counted for Mr. Metcalf. A ballot marked with a cross in the circle at the head of the Silver Republi can and with a cross in the circle at the head of the Republican ticket was counted for Mr. Metcalf. A ballot which had the names of every candidate on the Silver Republi can ticket (except Mr. Metcalf, whose nanme was substituted by that of Mr. F. J. McDonald) written in the blank spaces below the printed names on the Silver Republican, Democratic and Pop ulist tickets, voting the same names on all three tickets, with a cross opposite each name, was counted for Mr. Mc Donald. The Democratic and Populist tickets were a fusion upon the county offices Santa Claus' ...Headquarters... @ Iron Toys, Dolls, Drums, Pianos, Cradles, Doll @ o Carriages, Chairs for Children, Wagons, Wheel- @ barrows, Sleds; in fact, everything in this line. _ Choice Assortment of Fresh Confectionery , Allgretta & Co.'s Delicious Chocolates in 1 or ,/-lb. pkgs. PRICES LOWER THAN ANYBODY CHAS. WILLIAM S and the Silver Republican and Populist tickets were fused on state officers. The Republican tieket had only the state officers upon it, there being no county ticket under that head. Col. Wilbur F. Sanders and W. E. Moore appeared for George Metcalf, the Silver Republican candidate, and Judge D. M. Durtee, Wingfleld L. Brown and Governor Bob Smith, represented Fin lay J. McDonald, Democratic-Populist candidate. Judge Woody, of Missoula, acted as referee, and deciled what bal lots should be counted. TIHE ENEMIES OF BIMETALLISM. John Lind, the recently elected Demo. cratic guvernor of Minnesota, is quoted as saying that the silver question was settled in 1896, and that he proposed to give the gold standard people a chance. Mr. Lind is the first Democratic gov error who has been elected in his state in forty years, and during the campaign his especial efforts were directed against the principles of bimet allism and he ooenly expressed his views on that subject while a umping his state. This is just another verifica'ion of the assertion that silver was used as an issue only in certain localities or geographical spots by Ihe Democrats, and for a double purpose. In silver producing sections the Democrats ad vocated free coinage and in other parts of the country they were opposed to free coinage ana in this manner they ex pected to meet the demands of all and carry the election. Now that the elec tion is over they call this double dealing good politics and glory in the result ac complished in this state. There will be other elections coming, however, in the future. and the voters of Montana will need no instructions as to which party, if placed in power, will do most for the cause of bimetallism, Which is wholly a Republican issue, and will only be at tained through the continued success of that party. KILLED A LARGE MOOSE. A Rock Creek Resident Secures an El egant Specimen. The first moose killed in this county this season is reported to be a prize se cured by Mr. P. A. Shilling, of Ross' Fork. The animal is said to be a very large bull and an extra fine specimen. Moose are pretty scarce, and a good head is quite valuable. Thomas Treveaille came up from Missoula last Tuesday, on business that required his attention. 

VALLEY NOTES. Col. G. W. Morse is in Philipsburg this week on business. J. A. Featherman went to Philips burg on Monday of this week, on busi ness. Col. G. Morse is building a new barn, to be used for the purpose of storing baled hay. Frank and J. A. Carnegie drove to Philipsburg on Tuesday of this week returning on Wednesday. A. Tinklepaugh spent several days of the past week in Philipsburg, getting a troublesonme tooth repaired. The Sunday school at Hall is making arrangements for a Christmas tree on Christmas eve, at which time Santa Claus will be present with presents for the little ones. Those who have crippled horses corns, bunions, contracted feet or run down at the heel-take them to Griffith, the blacksmith, at New Chicago, for a new pair of shoes. Evangelists Thompson and Acheson have been holding meetings in the Hall school house for the last week, where they have had large congrega tions to listen to the gospel call, and it is hoped much good will be the result thereof. W. J. Griffith and family, formerly of Blumfield, Iowa, have arrived in New Chicago, where Mr. Griffith has engaged in the blacksmithing business, and the ranchers who favor him with work in that line will find him a first class workman. IN MlE~ORIAM. At a regular meeting of Burnside Post, No. 22, G. A, R.. held at their hall this 7th day of De cember 1898, the following was unanimously adorted: 'Whereacs. As it has pleased the s8preme Com mander of the Universe to summon to the last roll call the soul of our worthy comrade, the ionj. II. T. lRombauer; therefore, be it Resolved. That in the death of Comrade IRom baner, Burnsidet post has lost a worthy and pa triotic member and the community an honor able citizen; and while we cover his frailties with the broa: mantle of charity, we would not be unmindful of his nmny sterling qualities and the loss we have sustained. Rexolved, That our charter be drledl in mourning for thirty dlays. and these resolutions be embodicdl in the adjutant's report and pub lished in the city papers. -W. T. Allison, -J. K. Pardee, -L. C. Degenhart, Comnmittee. Philipsburg, Mont., Dec. 7. 1898. 

SCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT. It Was Largely Attended and Proved a Success in Every Way. The entertainment given at the school house last Friday evening proved a complete success, financially and other wise, and only about $89 more were needed to pay for the piano, which is already at the school house. The school board decided to contribute the missing $89 dollars, so the entire amount may be paid at once. thereby getting the benefit of a cash discount of $25 The school will repay the amount subscribed by the trustees from pro ceeds of entertainments to be given in the future. Following is the condition of the piano fund: Proceeds of Bob Burdette entertainment.$ 6 50 Donated by Mrs. A. A. MoDonald ........ 500 Receipts from entertainment ............ 204 20 Donated by Mrs. Tessy Weinstein........ 10 00 $225 70 Less expenses for entertainment....... 14 60 $211 10 Contributed by trustees .......... ..... 8 90 $250 00 The original cost of the piano was $315, but after deducting special and cash discounts the net price is $250, which amount has been provided as above. A throng of people filled the rooms and corridors of the spacious school house and all seemed anxious to con tribute their share to provide a piano for the high school. Our institution of learning is rapidly establishing for it self a reputation of which not alone the district but the entire county may just ly be proud, and the residents of the district deem it a privilege to be per mitted to contribute individually to wards its success. The special features of the entertain ment were presented alternately in the different recitation rooms up-stairs. In the southeast room, Mrs. Darby's Wax Works attiacted the attention of the large audience. This department was under the directorship of Miss M. C. Ryan, and called forth no small amount of commendation. In the north east room the Ruggles family, in charge of Mrs. R. Lee Kelley, was engaged in entertaining the audience, and many compliments were heard to the credit of those taking part, and the able man agement of the department. Another feature of the entertainment that cre ated considerable amusement, was Un cle Sam and his recent acquisitions. Mr. C. W. Cross, dressed in the regular striped pantaloons, bespangled coat, and white hat, acted the part of Uncle Sam, and Miss Florence I aylor as Queen Lil; Johnny Wilson, dressed like a Cuban, and Carl Jacky as a Philippino, repre sented his new colonies. They all re ceived their share of praise and their several parts were well carried out. A candy department in one of the recitation rooms did a flourishing busi ness and the supply of the sweets was exhausted long before the audience commenced to disperse. A flower booth, where bouquets were sold, was equally well patronized and the stock of posies was hardly sufficient to meet the demand. Exceilent music was furnished in the hall by Miss Piper, of Pioneer, and Mrs. W. E. Moore and J. T. Pardee, of this city. Delicious re freshments, consisting of ice cream, cake, coffee and sandwiches were served in the southeast room on the first floor. This department did a land office busi ness, and the management deserves es pecial mention and much credit for the very satisfactory manner in which its many patrons were entertained and served. Prof. Cook and his corps of teachers deserve much credit and the highest praise for the, able manner in which the entertainment was planned and successfully carried out, and to the generous public which so liberally con tributed and assisted, either financially or otherwise, are due the thanks of the entire district.
