It is interesting to note the wondrous chan that has taken place, in the pop­ ular* estimate of the Darwinian theory. It has been well said that a new theory has often to run through three different phases. In the first place, every one exclaims that the theory is not tiue then it is urged that the theory is con­ trary to religion and, lastly, that every­ body knew it long ago. The great doc­ trine of datu al selection promulgated by Darwin has run through these courses. At its publication it was re­ ceived with an outburst of incredulity among the unthinking part of the com­ munity. Every one recollects the de­ nunciations it received and the ridicule which the new doctrine h?.d to encoun­ ter. But the theory of Da win has sur­ vived that stage. It has also survived the attacks ot those who denounce'the theory as contrary to religion. The truth inherent in the principles of Dar­ win has quietly brushed aside such op­ position, and now we hear but little of it. The funeral of Darwin at Westmin­ ster Abbey must be regarded as mark­ ing a momentous epoch in the history of" thought. That the great doctrine would one dav be accepted was a nec­ essary truth, but I do not think that any one who recollects the publication of the ''Origin of Species" could then hqve anticipated the enormous change in educated opinion which the next quarter of a century was to disclose. Still Jess likely would it have seemed that the whole nation would have so far acknowleeged Darwin that with one accord they demanded that his remains should be interred in the national mau­ soleum. The Princess Beatrice is the favorite child of Queen Victoria, and many say that she is, in fact, the real Queen of England, as her mother delegates a great deal of authority to her.
