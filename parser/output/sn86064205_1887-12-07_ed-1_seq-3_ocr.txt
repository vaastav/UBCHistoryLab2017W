DANGER There seems to be no assurance that with such a withdrawal from vse of the peoples circulating medium our business capacity in the near future may not be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced from the same cause and while the functions of our na tional treasury should be few and simple and while its best condition would be reached I believe by its entire disconnec tion with Drivate business interests yet when by a perversion of its purposes it idly holds money uselessly substracted ficm the channels of trade there setm3 to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the government to restore in an emer gency without waste or extravagance such money to its piice among the peo ple RELIEF NECESSARY If such an emergency arises there now exists no clear and unduubttd executive power of relief Heretofore the re demption of three per cent bonds which were payable at the option of the gov eminent has afforded a means for the dis bursement of the excess of our revenues but these bonds have all been retired and there are no bonds outstanding the pay ment of which we have the right to insist upon The contribution to the sinking fund which furnishes the occasion for the expenditure in the purchase of bonds has been already made for the current year so that there is no outlet in that direction In the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing executive f zy t expenditure consists in the supposition that the Secretary of the Treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed upon AN 

ALTERNATIVE The only provision of law from which c power could be derived i3 found in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago and it is subject to the suspi cion that it was intended as temporary and limited in its application instead of conferring a continued discretion and au thority No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official upon his judg ment of its necessity to withhold from or release to the business of the people in an unusual manner money held In the treas ury and thus affect at his will the finan cial condition of the country and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary cf the Treasury the authority in the present juncture to pur chase bonds it should be plainly vested and provided as far as possible with such checks and limitations as will define this officials right and discretion and at the same time relieve him from un due responsibility THE 

QUESTION OF PURCHASING BONDS In considering the question ot purchas ing bonds as a meanB of restoring to cir culation the surplus money accumulated in the Treasury it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such Durchase that there may be a large part of these bonds held as in vestments which C3n not be purchased at any price and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell may un reasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the government It has been suggestsd that the present bonded debt mightfbe re funded at a less rate of interest and the difference between the old and new secur ity paid in cash thu3 Hading use for the surplus in the Treasury The success cf this plan it is apparent must depend upon the volition of the holders of the present bonds and it is not entirely certain that the inducement which must be offered them would result ia moe financial benefit to the govern ment than the purchase of bonds while the latter proposition would reduce the principal of the 6ebfc by actual payment instead of extending it TO 

DEPOSIT SURPLUS IN BANKS The prpjsiiion to deposit the money held by the government ia banks through out the country for use by the people is it seems to me exceedingly objectionable in principle establishing too close rela tionship between tbe operations of the government treasury ancr the business of the country and too extensive a coming ling of their money thus fostering an un naiural reliance in private business upon public funds If this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a tem porary expedient to meet an urgent ne cessity Legislative and executive eff rt should generally be in the opposite direc tion and should have a tendency to di vorce as much and as fast aa can safely ha done the Treasury Department from private enterprise EXTRAVAGANT APPROPRIATIONS Of cuure it is not expected that un necessary and extravagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess f revenue Such expenditure beside the demoral izitionof all just conceptions of public duty which it entails stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence not in tne least consistent with the mission cf our people or the h gh and beneficent purposes of our government THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen as well as to the attention cf their representatives charged with the responsibility of legislative re lief the gravity of our financial siuation The failure of the Congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident from the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily oe produced caused a condition of financial distress and apprehensions tince your last ad journment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within ex ecutive control and these appear now to bs exhausted If disaster results from the continued inaction cf Congress the re sponsibility muat rest where it belongs The situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should be fully realizd and though it presents fea tures of wrong to the people as well as peril to the country it is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause constantly repro ducing tbe same alarming circumstances the congested national treasury and de pleted monetiry condition in the business of the country A REMEDY FOR THE SITUATION It need nardly be stated that while the present situation demands a rmedy we can only be saved f rom a like predicament in the future by the removal of Us cause Our system of taxation by means of wnich this surplus is tsken from the people and put in the public treasury consists cf a tariff or duty levied upon importations from from aoroad and internal revenue taxes Lvied up m the consumption of to bacco and spirituous and malt liquors It must be conceded that none cf the things subjected to internal revenue taxation are strictly speaking necessities There appears to be no just complaint of taxa tion by consumers of these articles and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without Hardship to any portion of the people But our present tariff laws the vicious iniquitous and il legal source of unnecessary taxation ought to be at once 

REVISED AND AMENDED These laws as tneir primary and plain effect raise the price to consumers of all articles imported and subject to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for ue these imported articles Many of these things however are raised or man ufactured in our own country and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home manufacturers because they render it possiole for those of our people who ere manufacturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duties So it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported articles millions of our people who never use and ntver saw the foreign products purchase and use things of the same kind made in tnis country and pay therefor nearly or quite the tame en kjs THE GAZETTE PORT WORTH TEXAS WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 7 hanced price which the duty adds on the imported articles THE DUTY IS A TAX Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury but the great majority of our citizens who buy domestic articles of the same class pay a sum at least ap proximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruc power to restore at this time any part oftijn but in order our surplus revenue to the people by its i stamly reminded of that we may be con the manner m which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic products as well as those who consume imported articles and thus create a tax upon all our people It is not proposed to ENTIRELY RELIEVE THE COUNTRY of this taxation Is must be ex ensivcly continued as the source of the govern ments income and in a readjustment of our tariff the interests of American labor engaged in manufacture should be care fully considered as well as the preserva tion of our manufacturers It may be called protection or by any other name but relief for the hardships and dangers of cur present tariff laws should be de vised with especial precaution against imperiling the existence cf our manu facturing interests But this existence should not mean a condition which without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency must always insure the realization of Immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns As the volume and diversity of our national ac tivities increase new recruits are added to those who desire A 

CONTINUATION OF THE ADVANTAGES which they conceive the present system cf tariff taxation affords them So stub bornly have all efforts to reform the pres ent condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus engaged that they can hardly complain of the suspicion entertained to a certain extent that there exist3 an organized combination all along the line to maintain their advantage We are in the midst of centennial celebra tions and with becoming pride we rejoice in the American skill and ingenuity American energy and enterprise and in the wonderful natural advantages and re sources developed by a centurys national growth Yet when an attempt is mado to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer and for the benefit of our manufacturers quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard it suits the purpose of advocacy to call our manufacturers infant industries still needing the high est and greatest degree of favor and fos tering care that can be wrung from fed eral legislation It is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manu factures resulting from the present tariff is necessaiy in order that higher wages may be p id to our workingmen em ployed by manufacturers than are paid for what is called the pauper labor of Europe All will acknowledge the force of argument which involves the welfare and liberal comptnsation of our labor is honorable in the eyes of every American citizen and as it lies at the foundation of our development and progress is en titled without aSsctation or hypocrisy to the umost rt gird

THEIR MINORITY SHOULD MAKE NO DIF FERENCS To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change There should be no disposiion to answer such suggestions by the allegation that they are in a minor ity amoDg those who labor and therefore should forego an advantage in the inter ests of low prices for the majority Their compensation as i it may be affected by the operation of tariff laws should at all times be scrupulously kept iu view and yet with slight rtflction they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers with the lest that they too have their own wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings and to elevate the price of the necessaries of life as well as the amount cf their wages will not regulate the measure cf their welfare and comfort But the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the los3 of employment by the workiugman nor the lessening of his wages and the pre fits still remaining to the manufacturer after a necessary readjustment SHOULD FURNISH NO EXCUSE for the sacrifice of the interests of his employes either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their com pensation Nor cax the v oikfr in mauu fac uresjfa 1 to underused that while a high tariff la claim id to be necessary to allow the paymtnt of remunerative wages it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts ot manu factures which in almost countless formshe needs for the use of himself and his family He receives st the desk of his employer his wages and perhaps be fore he reaches bis home is obliged in a purchasefor his family use of an article which embraces his own labor to return in the payment ot the increase in price which tbe tariff permits the hard earned compensation of MANY DAYS OF TOIL The farmer and agriculturist who manufacture nothing but who pay the increased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural implement upon all he wears and upon all he eats and owns except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things as he in his husbandry produces from the soil is Invited to aid in maintaining the pres ent situation and he is told that a high duty on imported wool i3 necessary for the benefis of those who havo sheep to shear in ordtr that the price of tneir wool may be increased Tney of course are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged in bis purchases of clot Ing and wool n goods t pay a tribute to his fellowfarmer as well as to tie manufacturer and mer chant Nor is any mention msde of the fact that the sheep owners themselves and their households MUST WEAR CLOTHING and use other articles manufactured from tne wool they sell at tariff prices and thus as consumers must return their share of this increased price to the tradesman I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sJieep owned by the farmers throughout found in small twentyfive to fl cks fifty the grade of imported these sheep yield is 10 the country are numbering from The duty on wool which cents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents If the estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece the duty there on would be GO or 72 cents and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty Eighteen dollars would thus represent the increased price of wool from twentyfive sheep and 36 that from the wool et fifty sheep and at piesent values this ad dition would amount to ebout onethird of its price upon its sale The farmer re ceives this or a less tariff profit Tne wool leave3 his hands charged with pre cisely that sum which in all its changes will adhere to it until it reache the con sumer When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmers tariff profit but a farther sum ha3 been added for the benefit of the manufacturer and the operations of other tariff law In the meantime the day ar rives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods to clothe himself and family for the winter When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discov ers that he is obliged not only to return in the vay of increased tariff profit on the wool he sold and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form but he must add a considerable sum therefor to meet THE FURTHER INCREASE IN COST caused by a tariff duty on the manufac ture Thus in the end he is aroused to the tact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme wnich when he sold his wool seemed so profitable more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profi he received upoa the wool he produced and sold When the number of fsrmers engaged in wool raising is compared with ail the farmers in the country andjthe tmsll pro portion they bear to our population is considered when it is made apparent that in the case cf a large part of those who own sheep the benefit of the present tariff on wool is Indirect and when it must be so conceded that the inceasq of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes s burden upon those with moderate means and the poor the employed and the un employed the sick and the well and the young and the old ana that it constitutes a tux which with relentless grasp is fastened upon the clothing of every man woman and child in tae land reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of tnis duty should be included in the revision of our tar > ff laws THE 

COST TO THE CONSUMER Speaking of the increased cot to the consumer 01 our home manufacturers re sulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description the fact is not overlooked that competition among our domestic producers some tlmea has the efftct of keeping the price cf their products below the highest limi allowed by such duty But it is notorioua that this competition ia too often sir Angled by combinations quite prevalent at this time and frequently called trusts which have for their objecs THE RKGULATrON OF THE SUPPLY and price of curamudiues made and sold by memoers of the combination The people can hardly hops lor any considera tion in the cperatKn of these selftah schemes If however in the absence of sach combination s healthy and free competition reduces the piice of any du tiable article of home production below the limit which it mgut otherwise reach under our tariff laws and if with such re elucecl price manulacinre continues to thrive it is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should ba carefully scrutinized ia an effort to reduce taxation the neces sity of combination to maintain the price of any c mimodity The tariff furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity and that such prices are remunerative and lower prices produced by competition have proved that same thing Thus whores either of these conditions exist a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction of taxation TO PREVENT SURPLUS REVENUE The considerations wnich have been presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to emphasize an earnest recommendation tnat the surplus reven ues of the government bo prevented by the reduction of our custom duties and at the same time to emphasize a sugges tion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discbarge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure cf relit f from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can bo most fairly and justly ac corded Nor can the present action made of such consideration with any degrees of f iirnes be regarded as evidence of un friendliness toward our manufacturing interesB orol any lack of apprtcistion of their value and impor ance Tnesi in ttrests constitute a leading and most sub stantial eiement of ournationel greatness and furnish the proud proof of our countrys progress But if in the emerg ency that presses upon us our manu facturers are asked to surrender some thing FOR THE 

PUBLIC GOOD and lo avers disaster th = ir patrioticm as well as a grateful recognition of the ad vantages already afforded should fead them to willing cooperation No tte JR V mend is made that they shall the benefits of government they cannot fail to be admonished duty as well as their enlightened sedfrin terest and safety when they ere rem ffided of the fact that the financial panic and collapse to which the present condition tends affords no greater sh Iter or pro tection to our manufactures than to our other important enterprises Opportun ity for safe careful and deliberate reform is now off > rded and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people heedias of those who havo resisted timely and reasonable relief may insist upon a radical and sweepng rec iflcation of their wrongs THE 

DIFFICULTY OF A REVISION The d flioulty attending a wise end a fair revision of our tariff laws is not underestimated It will re quire ou the part of Congresf great labor and care Gnd especially a broad and mtionci contemplation of th subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreason able and reckless of the welfare of th entire country Uader our present law more tb = n 4000 articles are subject u > cta y Many of these do not in any ws it IJoliakTi fM oO i compete with our own manufactures and nnny are hardly worth at ention as sub jects of revenue A considerable reduc tion can be made in the aggregate by adding them to tho TrrtT list The Taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all the people the duty upoa which adds to the cost cf living in every home should be greatly cheapened The radi cal reduction of the dnlie3 imposed upon raw material used in manufacture or its free importation is of coare an impor tant factor in eny effort to re duce the price of these necessaries It would not only relieve them from the increased costcaused by the tariff on such material but the manufactured product beinsc thus cheapened that part of the tar ff now laid upon such product 3 a compensation to our manufacturers on the present price of raw material could be accordingly modifl d Such reduction or free importation would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue NOT 

INJURIOUS TO MANUFACTURERS It is not apparent how such a casnge can have any injurious effect UDon manu facturers On the contrary it would appear to give them a better chance ia foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries who cheapen their wares by free material Thus our people might have the opportunity of exending their sales beyond the limits cf home consump tion saving them from depression inter ruption in business and loss caused by a glutted domestic market and affording their employes more certain and steady labor with its resulting quiet and NOT PARTISAN BUT PATRIOTIC contentment The question tnus imper atively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than par tisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a conQdinir people But the obligation to declared party policy and principle iu not wanting to urge prompt and effrctive action Both the great political parties now rep resented in the government by repeated and authoritative declarationscondemned the condition of our laws wnich permit the collection from the people cf unnec essary revenue and hivo in the most sol emn manner promised its cor rection and neither as citizens or partisans are cur countrymen in a mood to condone the deliberate vio lation of these pledges Our progress toward a wise conclu sion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories cf protection and free trade This savors too much of bandy ing epithets It is a condition which con fronts us not a theory lieiief from this coudition may involve a slight reduction of tee advantages which we award our home productions But the entire withdrawal of such advantages should net be con templated NOT FREE TRADE The question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant and the persitem claim made in certain quarters that all efforts to re lieve the people from unjust and unneces sary taxation are schemes cf socalled irte traders is mischievous and far re moved from any consideration for the public good The simple ai d plain duy which we owe thd people is to reduce tax ation to the necessary e xpensss ol an economical operation of the govern ment acd to restore to the busi ness of the country the money which we hold in the Treasury through tbe provisions of governmental powers These things can snd should be done with safety to all Gur industries without dan ger to the opportunity for thea working men and with benefit to them and all our people by cheat ening their means of sub sistence and increasing the measure of their comforts ONE THING AT A TIME The constitution provides that the President shall from time to time give to the Congress information cf the state of the Union It has been the custom of the xecuuve in compliance with this provis ion to annually exhibit to the Congress at the opening of its session the general condition o the country rnd to detail with some partlcularity the operations of the diffrent executive departments It would bi especially agreeable to follow this course at the present time and to call attention to the valuable accomplish ments of thece departments during the lart fiscal ytar but lam o much Impress ed with the paramount importance of the subject of vVhich this communication has thus far been devoted that I shall forego the addition cf any other topic and only urge upoa your immediate consider ation the state of the Union e3 shown in the present condition of our Treasury and our general fiscal situation upon which everv element of our safety and prosperity depends The reports of the heads of the departments which will be submitted coctiin
