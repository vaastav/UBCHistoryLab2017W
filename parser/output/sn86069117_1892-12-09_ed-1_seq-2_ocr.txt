It has been hastily as sumed by some journals that, in view of the probable repeal of the Ocean Mail Subsidy law, there would be no induce ment ier the International Navigation , Company te build in American shipyards vessels costing" $1,500,000 each.

The responsibility for haullilg down that flag by hostile legislation would be a very serious ene for any political party ie assnme. Fortunately, it will be im practicable for the triumphant Democ racy te undertake, under existing con tracts, se unpopular a policy. As a measure of National economy this transfer of the Inman steamers te the American flag ought te command the support of Democratic legislators. Four fine vessels of large tonnage and of the highest speed will be added te the auxiliary navy in consequence of this policy, and will be nt the disposal of the Government whenever they are needed. That privilege alone is worth all that the mail contracts will cost, since it diminishes the necessity for building additional cruisers of high speed for the Navy and of keeping them in commission at great expense te .the Government.

His Republicanism is the Re publicanism of conscience and patriot ism. His devotion te Republican prin ciples is nnshaken by defeat, because he believes these principles te be eternally right. The President's message Is a striking epitome of the matchless industrial progress that has come te this Natien under Republican rule. Democratic leaders will de well te note with clese attention the significant statement at the clese: This brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the country will give us a level from which te note the increase or decadence that new legislative policies may bring te us. There is no reason why the National influence, power, and pros pres pcrity should net observe the same rates of increase that have characterized the past thirty years There ere no near frontiers te our pessible develop ment. Retrogression would be a crime. Retrogression in prosperity, If it should come te the United States, will come solely as the result of Democratic policy. It will be a crime against the people; and the people will punish the criminals.
