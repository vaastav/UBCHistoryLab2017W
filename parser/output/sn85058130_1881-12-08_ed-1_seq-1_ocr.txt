changes in the cabinet it may be ffutnofitutiveiy s ated that the only change contemplated at present will be the nomination of a secretary of state When a change is made in the attorney generalship which however will not be for some time yet Brewster will receive the nomination The first party contest it is believed will occur in Congress over the admission of Campbell or Cannon contesting Utah delegates Democratic leaders claim that the certificate by using the words being a citizen implies that the Gov ernor of Utah has recognized the fact that some one else not a citizen received more votes than Campbell ahd that is without the jurisdiction of the Governor but is a matter for the committee on elec tions to decide There are a number of democrats particularly Chalmers who were sworn in on prima facie evidence embodied in the possession of a certifi cate and these men are particularly anxious that Campbell should be seated on the same showing They will probably however be overruled by their party The republicans take the same ground and will claim that the precedent set in cases of contested democratic seats should be followed in this Camp bell though democrat will receive the solid support of republicans as the first gun in the battle against polygamy Cannon will receive the democratic sup port because the Mormons have made common cause with democrats in their fight for supremacy on the Pacific Coast The battle will be a hot one Another Railroad Company San Francisco 7A new railroad company has been formed under the name of the Arizona and Nevada Rail road

GUITTEAU TRIAL i Washington 1The criminal court WAS densely crowded this morning Among the audience were General Sher man and Rev DeWitt Talmage Today the prosecution commenced in rebuttal They will retraverse the ground gone over by the defense and favor the stand point of the prosecution will thoroughly ventilate Guitteaua past life and habits beginning with his early life in Freeport and concluding with a vast amount of the best expert testimony attainable in the country As soon as the court was formally opened Guitteau addressed the court in a rather imperious tone thus May it please your honor the American people do not desire that this case should be tried again and I do not desire it I say with the utmost respect to this court and jury and my counsel Scoville that I am not satisfied with the political situ ation as developed here in this case That is the gist of this alleged offence The President of the United States would never have been shot if it had not been for the political situation which existed last May and June and I say I have the right as a matter of law of ap pearing as my own counsel I ask your I honor that General Grant Senators i Conkling and Platt and President Ar thur and those kind of men who were 180 down upon Garfield they would not speak to him on the street and would not go to the White House shall be put on the stand I have the right to show my personal relations to those gentlemen that I was cordially received by them and that I was well dressed and well fed at the Fifth Avenue Hotel I want to show my personal relations to those men I dont want to except to your honors ruling but I shall be obliged to do so and I have no doubt the court in bane will give me a new trial Judge CoxYour exception has been noted Scoville then called up the subject of President Arthurs testimony and said ha had not yet received any response to his interrogatories that the Presidents evidence was absolutely essential to the defense Guitteau interrupted him excitedly with I dont think it at all necessary for General Arthur to be here To Sco ville I dont caro what you want Im doing this myself I ask as a personal favor that he shant be dragged into court I think a goad deal of General Arthur and he is President of the United States and I dont think he should be bothered with this matter striking the desk vio lently He is President of the United States and I made him so and I think I should have something to say in this matter It was agreed between the counsel that the Presidents answers should be i > ut in as evidence nt any stage of the trial and Scoville called GenerAl Sherman The witness simply read the orders he had issued for the disposition of troops ut tho time of the assassination Ho identi fied a letter written by Guitteau and said he supposed all the time there might be a conspiracy but afterwards con cluded that the shooting was the act of one man n as he left the stand Guitteau baid 1 thank you general lor hav ing ordered out those troops that day If it hadnt been for you I should not be here today I owe my life to the protection which you and Gen oral Crocker gave me during that pe riod when the riot spirit was rife At this the general smiled grimly Edward H Barton a lawyer A Ti Green and GW Tandie all of Freeport Illinois testified that they knew the Guitteau family and considered them all sane Dr B P Buckley of Freeport testi fied that he was Guitteaus family doc tor Ee never saw any indications of the slightest mental derangement in him nor in Abraham Guitteau Mr Atkinson of the Freeport Repub lican confirmed the testimony of pre vious witnesses as to the sanity of the Guitteau family upline II I I I Greenfield Mass7 David McMillan who shot Father McCarthy reached hero last
