J* PAGE TWO FLATS PUBLISHER President Sends Hot Message1 to Congress. PURCHASE OF PANAMA CANAL Executive Brands the Newspaper Charges as False. Washington. Dec. 15.—President Roosevelt today transmitted to con gress a special message regarding the charges published by certain newspa pers thai several Americans profited by the purchase of the property of the Panama Canal company of France. The message, in part, follows: In view of the constant reiteration of the assertion that there v,-as some corrupt action by or on behalf of the United States government in connec tion with the acquisition o: the title of the French company to the Pan ama canal, and of the repetition of the story that a syndicate of American citizens owned either one or both of the Panama companies, I deem it '.vise to submit to the congress all the in lormation I have on the subject. These stories were fim bro'ught to my at tention as published in a paper in In dianapolis, called the News, edited by Mr. lielavan Smith. The stories were scurrilous and libelous in character and false in every essential particu lar. .Mr. Smith shelters himself be hind the excuse that he merely ac cepted the statements which had ap peared in a paper published in New York, the World, owned by Mr. Jos eph Pulitzer. It is idle to *ay that the known character of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that the state­ ments in that paper will be believed by nobody unfortunately, thousands of persons are ill informed in this respect and believe the statements they see in print, even though they appear in a new.-.papc-r published by Mr. Pulitzer. A member of the con press has actually introduced a reso lution in reference to these charges and I therefore lay all the facts be fore you. Sums Up Newspaper Charges. The story repeated at various times by the World and by its fol lowers in the newspaper press is sub stantially as follows: That there was corruption by or on behalf of the government of the United States in thr- transaction bv which the Panama canal propertv was acauired irom its French owners: mat tnere were im proper dealings some kind be r.w-f-n aaent.-: the government an: outside persons, representing or act ing or an American syndicate which had gotten possession ot the French corn pan v: that anions-' tnese person-, who. it was alleged, made huge j-ronts. were Mr. Cnarles P. Tait, a brother of Mr. William H. I ait. then candidate tor tne presidency, and Mr. Dou'-'la: Robinson, rev brother-in-law that Mr. Cromwell, the counsel for tm- Panama Canal company in the negotiations, was some wav impli cated witn the r.nited States govern ment autnorities these important transactions: that the government ha o' 1 n^trjc lift 1 •j oesrroved. or procured or asrreed to the destruction of. certain documents: that Mr. U. raft was secreiarv ot war at the time that nv an agree ment. between the I.mted .-states i'ov ernment and the beneficiaries or the «eal all traces thereof were "wiped out. uv transferring all the archives and secrets to the American govern ment pist before the hohnng of the convention last June and at. which Mr. Taft was nominated. The state ments are false in everv partic ular trom besiinnintr to end. The wickedness of the slanders is only Euroa'-sed bv their fatuitv. String of Infamous Libels. Now. these stories, as a matter of fact, need no investigation whatever. .NO shadow of proof has been, or can be. produced on behalf of any of them. 7 hev consist simply of a string of in famous libels. In form t.hev are :n part lil.els upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft and Mr. Robinson for instance. Hut inev are in fact wholly and in form partly a libel upon the Lrnted States government. I do not believe we should concern ourselves with the particular individuals who wrote the jyinjr and libelous editorials, articles Irom correspondents, or articles in the news columns. The real offender is Mr. Josepn Pulitzer, editor ana proprietor ot the World. While the criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer has been guiltv is in form a libel upon individuals the great injury done is in blackening the good name of the American people it should not be left to the private citizen to sue Mr. Pulit zer for libel. He should be prose cuted for libel by the government au thoritieB. In point of encouragement of iniquity, in point of infamy, of wrong doing, there is nothing to choose between a public servant who betrays his trust, a public servant who is guilty of blackmail, or theft or financial dishonesty of any kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph Pu Jitzer has been guilty in this instance It is therefore a high national duty to bi'ng to justice this villifier of the whole American people and the at torney general has under considera tion the form in which the proceed ings against Mr. Pulitzer shall bo brought The president then details at length transactions in connection with the purchase of the canal property. 

RESENTS LANGUAGE USED House Committee to Consider Portion of Annual Message. Washington, Dec. 11.—Immediately after the convening of the house Rep resentative Perkins of New York in troduced a resolution which had here tofore been agreed upon providing for the appointment of a special commit tee of five members to consider the proper means of dealing with that portion of the president's message which criticises the course of con gress in prohibiting the detail o£ secret service men to duty outside of their own bureau. The resolution is preceded by a preamble reciting some expressions of the message. No effort is made to give voice to the feeling of the house. In presenting the resolu tion Mr. Perkins made a brief state ment, saying that he was satisfied that the house would not hesitate to take such action as the dignity of that tody required. He said that some of the president's expressions were un fortunate. The resolution was adopted and Messrs. Perkins (X. Y.), Denby (Mich.}, Weeks (Mass.), Williams (Miss./ and Lloyd (Mo.) were ap pointed on the committee. 

DAVIS DECLARED NOT GUILTY Verdict in Dr. Rustin Murder Case at Omaha. Omaha, Die. 10.—After thirteen hours' deliberation the jury in the oase of Charles E. Davis, charged with the murder on the morning of Sept. 2 of Dr. Frederick T. Rustin, agreed upon a verdict of not guilty. Judge Sears received the verdict and ordered the discharge of the prisoner. This case has attracted unusual at tention not only on account of thc prominence of the victim of the kill ing, who was one of the leading physi cians and surgeons of the city, and the mystery surrounding the tragedy, but because of the family connections of the defendant. Although himself holding but a minor position in the First Xational bank Davis is the brother of the vice president and uncle of the president, cashier and other officials of that, institution and related to men prominent in finan ial affairs in Xew York c-itv. 

DUTCH SEIZE GUARDSHIP Capture Venezuelan Vessel Off Puerto Cabello. V.'illemstad, Island of Curacao, Dec. 14.—The Dutch cruiser Gelderland came into this port towing the Vene zuelan coast euardship AIi: witn the Dutch flag flying and a Dutch crew on board. The Gelderland captures the Alix off Puerto Cabello on Satur day. At that time the Alix was lvir.g close shore and. notwithstanding the threat which the enezuelan gov ernment had made to fire upon any or the Dutch warships committing a hostile act. the Geluerland steamed at full speed toward the guardship and sent an officer and guard in a launch to seize ner. This they did without resistance and no shots came from the forts on land. THE The crew of the Alix was put ashore anu th" Dutch officer and marines re mained on board. Tne seizure of the Alix was ac cordance with the plans of the Hol land government when instructions were issued to the three Dutch war ships now in these waters to make a demonstration oft the coast of Vene zuela and to capture any Venezuelan ships of war or euard vessels that thev might find. EXCITEMENT IN CARACAS Caused by Canture of Venezuelan Guardship. Caracas. Dec. 13.—When news of the capture of the enezuelan coast uardshio Alexis bv the Dutch cruis er Gelderland became known at Cara cas a big crowd at once assembled in the Plaza Boliver and demonstrated in support of the government. Then a crowo of citizens, including a larse number of students, went to the office of El Oonstitutcional, the organ of President Castro, and in dulged in a counter demonstration. The feedings of this crowd were plainly hostile to Castro and to the policy adopted by Acting President Gomez, who has issued a decree placing the republic in a state of de fense 

IMPORTS WILL BE LIMITED Free Traae With the Philippines Agreed Upon. Washington, Dec. 11.—Free trade with the Philippines was one of the most important matters agreed upon by President-Elect Taft and the Re publican members of the ways and means committee at a conference on tariff revision. While Mr. Taft favors free trade with the insular posses sions without any restrictions it is understood that in order that there shall be no dissention he has agreed that the amount of sugar and tobac co which should be allowed entry free of duty should be restricted. With that end in view It Is expect ed that the sugar interests have agreed to a compromise by which 300, 000 tons of sugar will be admitted from the Philippines annually free of duty and that all sugar over that amount will pay the present rate of duty, which is 25 per cent less than the duty imposed by the Dingley tar iff on sugar from other countries. j1 r- s9vsf(ev .'«••*!* Not Compelled to Answer Cer tain Questions. 

FEDERAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION Materially Narrows Scope of In terstate Commerce Law. Washington, Dec. 15.—In deciding the cases of Edward H. Harriman and Otto H. Kahn vs. the Interstate Com merce Commission, the supreme court of the United States held that the commission is not entitled under the interstate commerce law to press questions relative to private transac tions, even though they involve deal ings in the securities of interstate railroads, when the investigation of which such questions are a parr has been begun upon the commission's initiative. The opinion of the court was an nounced by Justice Holmes and dealt with the refusal of Messrs. Harriman and Kahn to make reply to questions put by the commission in the course of an inquiry concerning the dealings of Mr. Harriman as president of the Union Pacific railway in the stocks of other railroads, many of which are competing lines. In the course of his opinion Justice Holmes said that the commission's inquiries should be con fined to cases in which complaint had been made. He said that privacy should be properly regarded in pro ceedings begun by the commission for its own purposes. He also said that the powers conferred in the interstate commerce law exceed any which have ever been delegated by a constitution al body of lawmakers. In a dissenting opinion, which wa concurred in by Justices Harlan and McKenna, Justice Day declared that the effect of the opinion of the ma jority of the court, would be to mate rially narrow the scope of the inter state commerce law. These three jus tices took the position that the ques tion of the commission so far as they were sustained by the United States circuit court for the Southern district of Xew York, were entirely proper under the law and should have been answered by Harriman and Kahn. Justice Harlan went, even farther and held that all of the commission's ques tions should have received responses. Justice Moody did not participate in the case.

J., Dec. 15.—When court adjourned after two long ses sions consumed in wearisome exami nations of talesmen, six jurors sat. in the jury box competent t.o try Thorn ton J. Hains, author and story writer, on charges of being an accessory in the killing of William E. Annis. an editor, shot down at the Bay Side Yacht club last summer by Captain Peter C. Hains, Jr., of the United States army. The difficulty of secur ing a jury because of opinions formed became apparent in the examination of talesmen and Justice Crane de cided that a night session be held. Justice Crane hopes that the trial may be concluded by the end of the week. WRECK OF THE CLEMS0N Sister Ship Picks Up Hatches on Whitefish Point. Fort William, Ont., Dec. 11.—The steamer Weils, the sister ship of the Clemuon, lost in a recent storm on Lake Superior, brought here two hatches of the ill fated vessel.

FOUND GUILTY OF BRIBERY Abraham Ruef, Ex-Boss of San Fran cisco, Convicted. San Francisco, De-c. 11.—Abraham Ruef, former political boss of San Francisco, has been convicted o: bribery. The verdict was returned after the deliberations of the jury had been prolonged throughout a peri.id of twenty-four hours. The warning. of Judge William P. Lawler and the vigilance of the police checked all at tempted demonstrations, although the excitement in the courtroom was so intense that men were thrust down into their seats or held in the grasp of detectives as they rose to obtain a better view of the proceedings. TWO SCORE ARE KILLED Terrific Explosion of Dynamite on Canal Zone. Colon, Panama, Dec. 12.—Two score or more persons were killed and about fifty injured when SO,000 pounds of dynamite exploded at Bas Obispo, a railroad camp fifteen miles from Pan ama, practically demolishing the camp. Fifteen bodies already have been recovered and from fifteen to thirty more are believed to be buried under tons of debris that marks the spot where the camp was. Of the fifty in jured many are believed to have re ceived fatal injuries. Xearly all of the victims so far re ported are Spaniards or native half breeds, all of them having been labor ers employed on the work of the canal or Panama railroad. Just before the dynamite let go with a terrific roar a train bearing several American engineers and officials of the canal zone passed the spot. The force of the explosion was so great that the tracks immediately behind the train were torn up and the win dows in the rear cars shattered. Aside from a few minor bruises and cuts no one on the train was hurt. GRAIN AND PROVISION PRICES Minneapolis Wheat. Minneapolis, Dec. 14.—Wheat—Dec., $1.04% May, $1.07% July, $1.07%.

PREPARES A MODIFIED BILL Church Federation Will Again Try for County Option. The defeat of county option at the late election has not dampened the ardor of the supporters of the move ment in the least, as is noticeable by the action of the Federation Council of Christian Churches of the state, which met in session at Mitchell last week, and among other things started the movement looking to another vote on the option measure. The new bill is much shorter than the one that was voted on in Xovem ber and many of the restrictive ideas have been eliminated from the new bill, which was framed by the mem bers of the federation. The initiative and referendum will be invoked on the new proposition, consequently it rill not need the sanction of the state legislature. Several thousand copies of the bill have been printed in the form of a petition and these will be circulated in all parts of the state to secure the signatures of bona fide voters. After these have been secured the petitions will be filed with the secretary of state. Th-3 bill provides for an elec tion to be held in the county upon the question of whether liquor shall be ^jg sold by securing signatures ot 10 per cent cf the voters to the petitions and which shall be presented to the county commissioners, who shall de termine the sufficiency of such peti tion and if found sufficient the vote on the question shall be ordered. FRAMING UP LEGISLATION Heavy Appropriations Needed for the State Institutions. The last legislative session provided new buildings for practically every one of the state institutions and it was thought that there would be but little demand for such improvements in the way of increased building room for the institutions from the coming session the capitol commission felt that the way was clear for them to ask the necessary funds for the com pletion of that work, with the fitting up of the building and grounds. For that purpose they will ask for approx imately $400,000. The state univer sity will ask for §345,000: the agricul tural college wants 5185,700: the Red field asylum for feeble minded is will ing to get along with $3 27,00u and tin rest, of the institutions think that from ?100.0% down would about fit out their pians in a proper manner for the present. The coming session will have pre sented to it a proposition for a state tax commission to look after the mat ter of assessments and equalization, instead of the present system, in which the officials who are expected to do the work have their time taken up with oiher official duties and can not put in the time necessary for a proper handling of the situation.
