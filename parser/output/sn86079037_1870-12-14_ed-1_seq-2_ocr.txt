It is stupid reading and povcrystricken, as the New York Sun truly says "the weak effort of a weak man, and . will be acceptable ouly to the bond-holder, the national bank er, and New England manu facturer." And we might also pay that tlieio is not only no .intelligence of the country's actual condition in it, but it is tilled with lies stupid and nu'an lies, to boot. It pretend- that they are pnying ff the debt, when everybody knows that it will never be paid, or never Avill besought tc be paid. It pretend"', also, to increased economy in public affairs, when everybody knows thnt within the past year somewhere from one to five hundred millions of . the national property lias been squandered on railroad thieves nnd robbers. But after all, there is a redeeming feature in Giant's ludicrous policy of the annexation of Santo Domingo, lie thinks that if we annex tie one hundred and twenty thous and Mongrels real blood and bones mongrels of that "Re public," tliey will be sure to re store American commerce, and moreover, enable U3 to pay the public debt, and finally, Cuba will be forced to "abolish slavery," in order to compete with "free labor, or in other words, that the people of Cuba will be Jorcecl to abandon then control over their negroes to compete with the neggers and Mongrels ot ban Domingo, that never labor at all I Remember that the last few thousands of dollars stock to the Gallipoli", McArthur & Columbus Railroad will be the most difficult to raise.

The only claim offered in extenuation of the notorious deficiencies of Grant's adminis tration is that he has reduced the public debt ever so many millions of dollars, as is shown by the fraudulent public debt misstatements issued monthly by Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury. Now these state ments are totally delusive, pur posely designed to deceive, and receive no more credence in well informed financial circles than would the unsupported assertions ot a hot house dem ngogue. But even if these statements were as true as they are raise, what would be th resulting benefit to the pcopl at large of this alleged reduc tion of the public debt V Simply nothim good. An ovcrtaxet and sorely oppressed peopl are being squeezed to deat to pay unauthorized debts be fore they are due; or, in oihej 1 T i 11 li woru3, jjoutwcn is making capital for Grant by pressing tne hfeblood out ot industry and business to pay boudhold ! ! .11 1 n mg iiueiicss ana enemiuacy cx tortionate interest. This is the only claim presented to justify Grant's candidature for a re election. It is, like all his claims upon public endorsement, fraud and a swindle, and must eventually prove one of the most potent reasons why so narrow-minded and utterly ridiculous demagoguery fchould be emphatically repudiated at tue polls.

H. Langley, of Gallipolis, writes to the Giilhpoli's Dis patch, as follows: Geo. D. Hebard, Dear Sir: The McArthur people ap pear to be wakinor up to the lmnnrtance and necessity of more action m behalt ot our railroad enterprise. Mr. Thom as B. Davis, the worthy and energetic solicitor of Subscrip tions, writes under yesterday's date, that their subscription list is now going ahead, and trial within a few (lavs, he has, aid ed bv Daniel Will," Esq., ad ded several thousand dollars to ilieir list and will use his ut most endeavors to keep' the list growing daily until the amount necessary to finish gra ding the road from the point at which it shall cross the Ma rietta road to Logan shall be subscribed. This looks and sounds like work, lie says that. he has some good and cn. ergetio men til work assisting him, and that he intends Keep ing the ball rolling. Here our list of subscribers is steadily increasing, and scarce ly a day passes without adding something to our list. As far as people has been called on in the county they have generally responded promptly by making liberal subscriptions, many or them promising to double the amount as soon as they can see their way clear, and some say they will double the amount as soon as they see a certain pros- pec.t ot the roau ocing ouut. Tn Riifh I would beg leave to say if you wish to make the success ot the road a certainty, double your subscriptions at the start which would encour age others to strain a point or two, and make their subscrip tions larger, and by that means, the required amount would be sooner secured, aud consequent ly we would be sooner ready to commence work on the road. It is very desirable that we should be ready to commence work early next Spring, if at all practicable. For by that time, much or the torce now employed on the Chesapeake and Ohio road, will be through with that work, and I have no doubt that more favorable ar rangements can lie then made for labor and grading material, than at a later day. The road can, and rau.-t be built. But whether it can be done in one, two, three, five or ten years, depends altogether upon the amount of subscriptions, aud the promptness with which they ire made. As stated above, the citizens of the county are re sponding freely, according to their means, aud there is plen ty of room on the city list for many thousand dollars to be added to their present (in most cases) liberal subscriptions. What do you say, citizens ot Galhoolis i Will you add a few hundred or a few thousand dollars more to your present subscriptions and thus hurry the matter along? and, also, by so doing, encourage the cit izens of the county to increase their list by additional names, and by adding to their sub scriptions already made ? As I have repeatedly said before, I have not a doubt but there is plenty of surplus means in the counties on the route between here and Logan to grade the road without subjecting any one to serious inconvenience, if every one will subscribe what their means aud their interest in the enterprise will justify thcra in subscribing, and I have t , i j . i 1 no doubt out tneir subscrip tions will pay better dividends than any stock now held in Ohio, whether National, State, or Railroad stock. I do not think there are a dozen men in the county, as far as they have been called upon, who have re used to subscribe. But there are probably that number and x?sibly a tew more who. have taken more time to consider, and I have not much doubt ut these will subscribe in good time, letters ot lNov. 2btn, and Dec. 1st, from Col.

And ' unless I am very much mistaken you will fiud that just as soon as we can get ready, and break dirt for building our road that other roads will seek connection with the Chesapeake and Ohio, road at this point over our road, and as soon as it is known that the building of our road is a fixed fact, I have but little doubt but the New Lisbon and Galli polis road via Pomcroy win be soon put through to this point, aud very probably continued on down the river to Catlcts burg, Ky. Think for a moment what advantages our citizens would be at this moment, deriving from the coal trade alone, if wo had our road in operation to the coal beds of Raccoon. Every bushel of coal that the road could carry, it worked to its utmost capacity night and day, would find a profitable market along mo river, ior while there has been plenty of water from this point down, throughout the fall for moder ate sized coal barges, there has not been water enough above to keep the markets below well supplied with coal, aud, as a consequence, at many points the price has materially ad vanced. From inquiries and estimates I have made with our road completed to the coal beds of the Raccoon, we can put coal on our barges cheaper than it can he delivered in bar ges opposite our Handing, from any point above this, and of quality equal to the best Pitts burgh or ilonongahela coal, and it can be delivered on the plat of the town of G.dlipolis full (2) two cents per bu-mel cheap er than from any point on the Kanawha or OIho river?. These are facts that should not bo overlooked by our citizens, and are clearly demonstrated to any person that will take the trouble to iuhrm themselves ot the facts. The quantity of coal . T T 1 1 1 in the Kaccoon Valley is al most inexhaustible for all time to come. 'From inquiries made of Mr. Chas. Green and Mr. McCarley, of the Keystone Furnace, while there in June last, 1 learned that commencing in the bed of Little Raccoon at that point and going to the tops ot the lulls, there were five (5; different veins of coal amount ing in the aggregate to about 20 feet of coal ; then from their remarks there must be a vein of cannel coal tbat underlies these veins, and from what in. formation I have since gained from other sources, I think there is one or two heavy veins that underlie all these veins named above; but without them consider for one moment the immense amount of coal supe rior quality lying within 20 miles of us only requiring cheap means of transportation to deliver it in our town, and by its movement of the inex haustible quantities of iron ore that lies with it. To induce population and capital to come among us, and thereby revive and increase the business of our town and the whole coun ly, in every department, once more I urge every person that in tavor ot the enterprizc to do all you can, and as promptly as practicable, and all doubts about succes3 will soon vanish.

THOMAS, Sec'y. Members present reported quite a number who would join the Society, butwere prevented from attending tbi3 meeting, 011 account of pressing business; and undoubtedly we may ex pect a large addition before A. S. COMBS. Wife Trading. One of our citizens was down iu Vinton county, recent lv, for a short time, on business, where he learned the particulars of a little traue, as follows : Iwo men, ono named T. and the other 15., lived neighbors to each other, and were on quite friendly terms so friendly, in deed, that the project of tra ding wives was ngitated. - T , (who had three children, while B had none) wanted a little "boot," and B- , af ter some "chaffing," offered nn iron wedge, as being about the difference between the two wo men. This was accepted, and the trade consummated, the wives apparently having no ob jections in fact, as a proof of affection, Tatmau's wife gave 15 s wife a new dress. When the consummation of the trade became known, the people in the neighborhood talked of doing a little mob- binsT in the case, but B sent word that if they annoyed him he would blow some of their heads off, stating that it was a fair trade and all parties were satisfied, and it was no body else's business, etc., etc. So B was let alone, and still lives there. T man, however, moved away. The affair occurred about a month ago. Chillicothe Register. We are informed that the trading parties arc residents of Jackson township. The moral and sober editor of the Regis ter is sadly needed in that wife trading community to deliver lectures on female trades. ii We present a fac simile of the fowl which played such an important part at the battle of Lake Erie, in 1813, while Coin mod re Perry's fleet was engag ed with the British fleet. Just in the midst of a desperate struggle when each of the commanding officers were do ing their utmost to conquer, and while the shot and shell were pouring clown upon the Commodore's vessels at a 'des perate rate, a ball from one of the enemy's guns struck a cocp, I iu wincn was a iowi, or wiiicn the above is a true represents tion, tearing tho coop to pieces, aud scattering it in every direc tion. Meanwhile the fowl eseap ed unharmed. At this iuno turc, the tide of battle seemed to be against the Commodore: his men becran to desnair of victory, when, all at once, this lovvl sprang upon an elevated position and crowed, loudly three times three. A dead sil ence pervaded tho whole fleet. Uomniodore Terry stood for a moment meditating, and then turning to his men said: "Men. do you hear that not conquer ed yet I" In an instant, as if by magic, every man at his post ngain. The battle was resumed; the contest was severe, but in a very 6hort time the enemy's guns were silenced. and Commodore Perry and his men were crowned with vic tory. And tho men who com posed that noble crew ever af terwards paid duo reverence. and, in fact, almost idolized 11s towlship; and even at this ate period in our country's listory, thousands of our people yet pay all duo respect to his noble qualities.
