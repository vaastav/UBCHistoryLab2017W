The memorial Thanksgiving exercises ol the high school on Weinesday afternoon reflected great credit upon the teachers and scholars and famished instructive en tertainment to many visitors. That it was the vote of the Prohibitionists that gave the electoral vote of Connecticut to Cleveland is shown conclusively by the fact that on the result for congressmen the Republicans have a handsome majority of 776 in the State. Over one thousand Japanese were brought to Honolulu by one steamer last month for work on sugar plantations, and another equally large cargo is expected in a few weeks. The native Hawaiian prom ises soon to go to the wall. The "tips»" given out by the Democratic candidate and his immediate friends on the eve ot the recent election were alto gether based on the amount of money ex pended in the canvass—an extraordinary sum, estimated by the managers to exceed five times the Republican expenditures. It is a condition and not a theory, at the South, that confronts the people of this country, and a pretty serious condition too. If the negro is entitled to be counted in on the apportionment of Congressmen, why should he be counted out when it comes to elec tion? There is very little theory and very much of a condition about this matter. The New Jersey Prohibitionists drew off enough votes from the Republicans to give the Democracy control of the Legis lature of that State, thus insuring the re peal of all the temperance legislation en acted by the Republicans. In New York their thirty thousand votes defeated the temperance Republican, Miller for Gov ernor, and elected their hated enemy, Hill. A fearful and wonderful creation is the Prohib. The entire population of Palestine at present is only about two-thirds as great as that of Chicago and only about 7 per cent of that is Jewish. With the progress of power in the Western World, we may yet witness the rejnvination of the Old World. What a glorious thing it would be for the United States to inscribe among its future works to be accomplished the en franchisement and regeneration of Pales tine. We owe a debt to Greece and Rome, bnt a still greater one to Palestine. The Queen of Austria would be a good example to American ladies in one respect. She is a great walker. Her daily mini mum is ten miles and is frequently ex tended to thirty. Our American women would retain their health and strength and beauty much longer if they wonld take more open air exercise. If the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Women's Rights Association would take hold of some such practical reform within their reach and control, we think they would show a greater per cent, of profitable re sults. Congress meets next Monday and it will be a solemn occasion for a great many. Much transient curiosity will be attracted to the President's message. It is not likely that it will astonish the country or materi ally influence legislation. One point of in terest will be what he has to say of Minis ter West. Of Congress there is a possible hope that the Democratic House may see the folly of further resistance and forward the early admission of the Territories as States. A favorable revision of the tariff can hardly be expected and the matter might as well be left to an extra session of the next Congress. The decoration of the Presbyterian chnrch for the union services on yesterday was rather of a novel idea, bnt in its ap propriate snggestiveness could not have been well surpassed. Sheaves of wheat and piles of fruit and vegetables were elo quent witnesses of Divine bounty and standing challenges for general thanks giving. There was a better attendance than we ever remember to have seen on any similar occasion in the history of our city. The sermon by Rev. Berry was ex temporaneous, appropriate and well receiv ed and the singing of old familiar Thanks giving hymns was very effective. We qnite agree with the Pioneer Press that the Republicans have no right to ask President-elect Harrison.to assume all the responsibility of calling an extra session of the newly elected Congress. It would be no great work to get signers to a call, when the situation clearly indicated the necessity for it. That would relieve him of much of the responsibility. In addition to the signatures of Congressmen, those of Republican Governors should be added. It is j ust barely possible that the prospect of an extra session may persuade the Dem ocrats to take snch action in the present Congress that will make it necessary to make snch a call. Kansas promises in five years to pro duce all the sugar and syrup for her own people and in fifteen years to be able to supply the whole country west of the Miss issippi river. In this connection Califor nia is coming to the front under the ma nipulation of Spreckles as a sugar produc ing country. The beet sugar experiment is turning out beter than was anticipated and is likely to assume proportions corres ponding to that of France and Germany. In view of these possibilities, it is not un likely that the dnty on sugar will be re tained, at least to a degree to give .protec tion to such an important and promising industry. a of It the this is on the and any the late its in ly to her If to THE 8TAK OF 

EMPIRE. Since Bishop Berkley's day ''the Star of Empire" has continued to pursue its west ward course even more rapidly than it did to the prophetic eye of the author of that familiar quotation. Not staying to note the fulfillments of that prophecy in the continued growth of our country in all the main elements of strength, we call attention now merely to the fact that since 1SS0, the date of our last census, the population of the country west of the Mississippi has increased nearly or quite 5,000,000. About one fourth of this increase has been in Missouri, Ar kansas and Texas, but full three-fourths has been in the Northwestern States and Territories. A greater than the usual per centage of this western emigration has been made up of voters. It is reckoned that 1,200,000 among these emigrants are voters and that 500,000 of these voters have settled in the Territories|and thus their votes have been lost to the North in the choice of President. The only wonder is that under such a drain the North has been able to hold its own so well in the greal crucial political conflict just closed. The places of these voters who have moved west were filled by the growth of younger generations and by foreign immigration. It is generally reckoned that the Democrats get the most of the newly naturalized votes and this would leave the inference that most'of the young voters are Republican. At the last election there were more Englishmen na turalized and voted than ever before and the majority of them were undoubtedly Democratic. Notwithstanding the consid erable antipathy between Englishmen and Irishmen at home the majority of both in this country give their support to the Democratic party, for some unaccountable reason, evidently a misunderstanding fcof the principles and tendencies of both par ties. By the way that the residents of the Territories have voted, it would seem as if a large majority of those who moved w T est of the Mississippi from the older States were Republicans. To maintain their Re publican majorities in the face of this heavy drain upon their resource shows what a successful effort the Republicans of the Northern States have made, and they are entitled to the greater praise for the result. But these 500,000 disfranchised voters in the Western Territories will mostly be re stored to the voting strength of the nation four years hence. They are only a little in advance of "the Star of Empire" as it rises higher and still moves steadily westward. It has now been upwards of Twelve years since Colorado, the last State admitted to the Union, took her place among the sister hood of States. In that time nearly twenty millions have been added to our population, and our wealth increased nearly one-third. This exhibit only emphasises ity it her of the injustice done to the Territories. In the organization of the Northwest Terri tory it was specifically agreed that when ever any portion thereof possessed a popu lation of 60,000 it would be entitled to ad mission as a State. Yet Dakota has more than ten times that population and is still denied Statehood. Even Montana has three times the number that was once established as a just claim to State privi leges. Have the rights of American citi zens grown less in the advance of general intelligence ? The stars in their courses declaim against this rank injustice to the disfranchised American citizens in the Territories, and more loudly than all the rest, the Star of Empire. _ The disgruntled Gen. Palmer, defeated candidate for Governor of Illinois, has been discharged from the Grand Army of the Republic. Under the rules of the order he is dissolved from all connection with the fraternity, as though he had never been a member, and forfeits all past rank or honor on account of any official position held in the order. Because the veterans of Illinois voted against him, Palmer attributed the circumstance to political action within the Grand Army. As expected, the officers and members of Stephenson Post, Spring field, emphatically deny that there was any political organization of any kind in the Post for or against him or any other candidate._ A Herald correspondent from Ubet in quires of us the matter in dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain. It is the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana, which adjoins it on the east, a line which has never been accu rately determined. Great Britain acquired this portion of South America from the Dutch as long ago as 1803. It is or ly of late years, by the introduction of East In dian coolies, that the country has proved of value, and now Great Britain is endeavoring to expand its borders and pretends to claim a por tion of the valley of the Oroncco up to the river. Valuable gold mines exist in this disputed region, which Englishmen natur ally covet. Venezuela has such confidence in her claim that she has offered to sub mit the case to arbitration by some friend ly power, but England refuses to arbitrate, showing the weakness of her claim. Under these circumstances Venezuela has appealed to the United States to aid her in maintaining her just claims. England would make short work of the controversy but for a dread of our interposition. When the Con gress of the American States meets in Washington next summer, no donbt, this will be one of the subjects of consideration. If there is any life left in the Monroe doc trine and the United States means to stand to it at all hazards, and prevent any European nation from gaining farther hold upon this continent then will be the time to demonstrate it. The report is that Gov. Leslie wentallthe way to Gallatin in search of a Democratic county wherein to eat his Thanksgiving dinner. _ Children Cry for Pitcher^Castoriai of did of of of to our of in a HOW 

8TATES ARE ADMITTED. The great impending question ot oar ad mission as a State is leading to the stady of precedents. The case of Michigan is one that presents many novel features and the little volume in our Public Library, by Judge Cooley, in the "American Common wealth" serits will furnish our inquiring statesmen with much novel information. Michigan was organized as a Territory in 1805, but was not admitted as a State until 1837. The people did nit want early admission and voted down the proposition prior to 1832. In the tall of that year a large majority declared for a State government, but the movement was arrested by tfie Black Hawk wars and yet more by the cholera which raged tearfully in Detroit and more or less all over the settled portion of the State for two years. Gov. Porter dying of the disease in 1834. In 1835 a convention was elected to form a constitution, the population at that time being a little less than 90,000. At the same time that the vote was taken on the acceptance of the constitution, State offi cers and legislature were provisionally elected and entered at once upon their du ties as soon as it appeared that the consti tution had been adopted. Judges were appointed and courts organized. The leg islature met, chose senators and enacted general laws The Acting Governor'Mason, under fed eral appointment, was chosen governor by the people so that there was no conflict at first on this score, but President Jackson was much disappointed at the action of the people and appointed John S. Horner, of Virginia, as governor. He came on and tried to enter upon his official duties,but was wholly ignored, and though directed by the President not to recognize the State officers or courts, the people refused to re cognize his authority and drove him out of the State. The situation at this time was further complicated by a boundary dispute with Ohio. The act establishing the southern boundary of the Territory of Michigan had fixed upon a line drawn due east from the southern point of Lake Michigan, but it was found that the Lake extended further scuth than was supposed and the line drawn due east from the southern extrem ity wonld include much of Ohio's and with it the rising city of Toledo. The U. S. Attorney General decided in favor of Michigan's claim, but Ohio had influence enough to prevent the government from carrying the decision into effect. Congress, in order to settle the dispute, offered to give Michigan the upper penin sula beyond Lake Michigan in lieu of the little corner claimed by Ohio and admit her at once. The friends of the adminis tration in Michigan's in party conventions and caucusses proceeded te elect members of a convention which met at Ann Arbor December 6, 1836, and in the name of the people of the State assumed to accept the proposition, and upon no farther authority the Democratic maj ority in Congress de clared the terms accepted, and the admis sion was completed January 26, 1837. So far as possessing even the form or pretense of regularity, this Michigan con vention, known in contemnoraneous his tory as "the frost-bitten convention," had no more standing than an ordinary politi cal convention, but its acceptance of the conditions offered by Congress was recog nized by the dominant party as the action of the people of the State, was the basis of admission and was recognized as fixing the boundaries of the State. The conclusion of the matter is that nothing is too irregular to be recognized and validated by Congress. But the his tory of Michigan farther shows that the people of a Territory may create a State government for themselves and sustain it in spite of Congress and the National Ad ministration_ The British Parliament about a year ago appointed a silver commission, made up equally of bi-metalists and mono metalists. Their report, which has just been made public, shows that nothing has been decided. Neither perty has con vinced the other. The mono-metalists ad vise the removal of the duty on silver plate and negotiations with other govern ments for a more extended use of silver for currency. This failure on the part of Great Britain to agree upon any thing ought to be notice to our country to act for herself and at once, without wait ing for the action of any European coun try. We could form an American Mone tary Union that would embrace every por tion of North and South America. It would be more extensive than the Latin Union among the nations of Southern Europe and might he expected to exert a greater influence upon the value of silver. With a common currency among all American countries it wonld do very much to pro mote our trade and with the establishment of steam-ship lined between our ports and those of South America, and our com trac tion of a respectable navy, we could soon control all the trade of this continent. This is already large, but its future development will soon distance all former attainments. The emigration from Europe to South America is growing rapidly and (would astonish the world but for the fact that it escapes attention in the greater growth of the United States. Onr material interests, no less than our national pride and secur ity, demand that we neglect nothing to advance our influence on this continent. A monetary union is one of the means and opportunities._ Sick Men Improving. Berlin, December 1.—The Emperor is suffering with an ear affection.

LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATE. Beyond the presiding officers little is heard so far of contestants for positions in the organization of the Sixteenth Legis lative Assembly. It is learned that Yel lowstone county will present a candidate for Enrolling and Engrossing Clerk of the House in the person of H. D. Arkwright. Mr. Arkwright, it will be remembered, was one of the official force bounced from the postal service soon after the incoming of Grover—one of many similar acts of the Democratic administration which so con fused and demoralized the mail handling of the country that it has never been able to recover from it since. In the Fifteenth and extra legislative sessions Mr. Ark wright was the Enrolling and Engrossing Clerk of the Council, acquitting himself in that position with the utmost satisfaction to that body and great credit to himself. Since then Mr. Arkwright, devoting him self to the study of the law, has been ad mitted to the Montana Bar, and is at pres ent the City Attorney aud Clerk of Billings. He will be a strong and probably success ful candidate for the place he aspires to fill. _ A very noticeable fact is the large in crease of attendance at all our American colleges Oberlin College opens with an attendance of over 1,100 and is expected to reach 1,500 during the year. And this is not exceptional, for a corresponding in crease is noted everywhere, in every sec tion of the country. All of the old col leges are crowded, are adding new accom modations, establishing new departments and raising the standard of scholarship still higher. But the new colleges that are opening were never so numerous as now. It no longer takes a generation to found a new college. They spring forth as Minerva from the brain of Jove, full grown and armed for immediate service. Millions are given every year for the foun dation of new colleges and better endow ment of older ones. Better still, the doors of onr best colleges are opening to the admission of women to the highest departments of study. We have not only colleges of the first rank, like Wellesley, Smith and Yassar exclusively for women, but the old est colleges in the country like Harvard and Columbia have provided annexes for the admission of women. If we were to include in this great work of educational advancement the establish ment of public libraries, the increase of the publication of new books, cheaper and better than ever before, the multiplication of newspapers and magazines, we begin to see what a tremendous growth is being made in educational advantages. Europe may boa9t of older institutions and larger libraries, but from the comparative rates present growth she will soon be dis tanced in this as in other respects. And our education is both more general and more practical than it is in Europe. 

UNFORTUNATE MINE. The Calumet and Hecla Again on Fire. of The Calumet and Hecla Again on Fire. Calumet, Mich., November 30.—A fire was discovered in the Calumet and Hecla mine this morning. A large party of men were working. The fire made rapid head way. All made a rush for the surface, but eight are missing. That they are dead is certain. The mine is completely covered with a dense smoke and the fire looks worse than did the la9t one, but being nearer the surface it is believed the dam age financially will not be so great. The company is making desperate efforts to control the flames and rescue the miners, but it looks as if the case is hopeless. The men are all Cornishmen. The scene about the mine is heart-rending. The families of the men aie cognizant of the extreme likelihood that the men will I never come out alive, and to their grief and lamentations is added the most frantic confusion on the part of all except the trained employes of the company. Detroit, November 30.—At the Calu met fire Christ Rule, one of the miners who was at work in the 10th level of No. shatt, says that about 11 o'clock lai t night he saw and smelt smoke. He at once called the attention of the others to it. Charles G. Carson and Henry Burkilinki, who were thoroughly familiar with the Calumet branch of the mine, at once start ed up the ladder as far as the 10th level and then went south to the main engine shaft and rode up to what is called the grand 6th level. They then crossed to No. 3 shaft where they saw the shaft all ablaze. Burkilinki at once went to the valve of the water pipe and opened it, straightened out the hose and was ready to fight the fire at the risk of his life, but there was no water there. He says that, however, had there been water it would have helped matters none. Nothing is known of the where abouts of eight men who are missing. They were working 1,700 feet deeper in the main engine shaft and it is supposed that, smelling the smoke, they tried to es cape and were smothered. The fire is be lieved to be ot incendiary origin. Over 100 men were in this portion of the mine at the time, but escaped. It would be foolish to attempt to approx imate the loss as the fire is in every way much worse than that of la9t year and it is liable to barn for months. Calumet, Mich., December 1.—The burning shaft of the Calumet mine is left open and the mine management is confi dent it will be of short duration. The temperature at the mouth of the shaft is very much lower today. No clue has yet been obtained to the origin of the fire. Little Sympathy for the Movement. New York, November 30.— The Sun prints interviews with leading Democrats of the G. A. R. in various parts of the country.

St. Louis, December 1.— At an early hour this morniDg the friends of the late Mrs. General Sherman began to assemble in the Union depot to receive the funeral party. The train entered the depot at 7:45. The special car was detached and the friends of the family entered and paid their respects to the mourners. After breakfast at the depot the funeral party returned to the private car _and remained until the time for the fanerai cortege to move. The pall-bearers were Maj. Gen. John Pope, Brig. Gea. John G. Henderson, General John W. Noble, Major Henry Hitchcock, James Yeatman, F. A. Drew, Theophile Patin and D. R. Francis. There were two wagon loads of floral offerings at the hearse when the coffin was placed therein. The funeral party entered carriages at the entrance of the depot, and the cortege proceeded to St. Xavier's church. At the church the casket was borne to the altar, where the bier, with candelabras at the head and foot, had been placed to receive it. The church was crowded. When the family anil relatives were seated the Rev. Father Brongeest, began the celebration of mass. In accordance with a request of the deceased the celebra tion of mass followed by the simple ser vice of the dead. No sermon was preached. The music was the ordinary accompani ment for such service. The church was heavily draped. At the conclusion of the brief services the casket was returned to the hearse and the cortege proceded to Calvery cemetery where the services at the grave were brief and simple. THEY CAN'T AGREE. Another Session of the Transconti nental Freight Agents. New York, November 30.—The Times says J. Gould and President Cable of the Rock Island road had a protracted confer ence yesterday in regard to the proposed railroad trust. Cable opposed it believing it would not work successfully. It is un derstood, however, that Gould made an im pression on him and it is jbelieved that at another conference which has been ar ranged for will bring him over. Chicago, December 1.—The transconti nental representatives yesterday further considered the proposed revision of the Pacific Coast freight tariff. The question of grading rates, or, in other words, of making rates from Chicago 80 per cent, of the rates from New York, took up most of the time. Representatives of the Rock Island and Burlington tried hard to ob tain the concession of General Tariff Man ager Stubbs, of the Southern Pacific, who strongly opposed the proposition. He showed that the present method of making rates from all points to the Missouri river the same as from New York was rather for the benefit of Chicago than otherwise, and he could not comprehend why representatives of Chicago lines were trying to bring about the adoption of the graded system. The if he the adoption of the graded system. The latter, if adopted, he said, must be general. Under the system St. Louis, Omaha, Kan sas City and all manufacturing points west of Chicago would be entitled to lower rates than Chicago. By adopting a flat rate from all points east of the Missouri river Chicago would be on an exact equality with St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha and more westerly points, in which event Chi cago's unequaled facilities would give it command of the situation. Its competitor was not NewYork or New England, but the business centres west of Chicago. The present rates were certainly low enough and satisfactory to shippers, as he had heard no complaints and did not think Chicago people desired to have the graded system adopted. It would give western competition a material advantage in rates. _ _ 

WOULDN'T APOLOGIZE. A Sensation in the British Commons. London, December 1. —In the House of Commons to-day the Speaker ordered E. Graham (Advanced Liberal) to withdraw from the House because he accused Smith, government leader, of conniving at a dis honorable trick and refused to retract the accusation. As. Graham was leaving the House a member shouted, "Bravo, Gra ham !" In an interview Graham explained that the trouble arose over the action of Brooks Robinson (Conservative) in patting a motion on paper to prevent discussion upon the chain makers' grievances. Gra ham characterized this as a dishonorable trick and expressed the belief that the government instigated Robinson to per form it. He refused to withdraw this statement, hence his dismissal. Graham says he will not apologize, no matter what the result may be. Sherman on Annexation. New York, December 1.—In an inter view with the Sun's Washington corres pondent Senator Sherman, speaking of union between the United States and Can ada eaid: "My belief in the failure of a common destiny of the two English-speak ing nations of America has never wavered I was led to form it by my failure to find a less radical remedy for perennial occasions of serious dispute between the two counties. The fisheries dispute and the question of the right of free transit of American goods over Canadian railroads are types of the disputes that have vexed the two nations for a century, and will continue to disturb them so long as the present conditions exist. To get rid of these questions we must get rid of the frontier." Murder and Suicide. New Haven, December 1.— Two days ago John B.

ANDREW'S DINNER. The Caledonians of Helena Meet at the Festive Board to Honor the Memory of their Patron Saint. The Caledonian Club of Helena cele brated the anniversary of St. Andrew yes terday evening by a dinner at the A. O. U. W. hall. Covers were laid f>>r seventy and fully that number partook of the repast. Among those present were Hou T. H. Carter, Col. Wilbur F. Sanders, Surveyor General Greene, Col. A. C. Botkia. R. C. Wallace, Walter Mathe9on. Geo G. Martin, H. Dallas, A. Smith (piper), A. Devine, Ben Folk, Henry Guthrie, A. McKay, F. McRae, A. O. Simons, John McCabe, D. Datenport, D. C. Ross, A. McMillan, D. Sillers, F. P. Lindsay, R. H. Beckwith, Prof. Beggs, J. D. McDonald, John Mc Phee, Thos. Gilchrist, N. Phillips, H. Mc Kinnon, A. McIntyre, D. Fraser, T. D. Crayon, A. Morton, S. Douglas, Dr. Mckay, Dr. McDonald, J. Smith, R. Calkins, J. Featherly, J. Steele, J. McIntosh, S. Whyte. The spread was a veritable feast, the menu opening with oysters and closing with hot Scotch, wines and cigars. It was prepared and served by the efficient caterer James H. Morton. In the absence of the Honored Chief, I. D. McCutcbeon, Walter Mathe sin made the opening address. He said it was the first festival of St. Andrew ever celebrated in Helena, but hoped that the observance of the day here would develop some of the Scotch thistle qualities; once take root, and it is hard to get rid of them. He thought it would be a good thing to bring Scotch men together. The observance of the day was once local; bat now in all lands and climes, "from Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strand," the day is observed by the Scot, who never forgets his own country, and, being loyal to her, is all the better qualified to become an American citizen. Without trespassing on their time Mr. Matheson said he would introduce A. Campbell Botkin as the toast master of the evening, who responded to the toast, "The day and a' who honor it." Col. Botkin spoke in a happy vein of the nature of the festival, sprinkling his re marks with a few pointed witicisms. In closing he said: "It is said that the Scotch are clannish. If this is true, it is not trne as a reproach. They are good citizens of whatever coun try they live in; but they are proud of the land with which they are connected by birth or parentage and are fond of coming together to do her honor. And in this broad clanship we who meet here in this remote mountain land, loyal citizens of the United States and never failing in onr gratitude for the institutions which we en joy, may yet upon this anniversary of onr patron saint of Scotland let our hearts leap mountains and span oceans while we lift our voices aud our glasses to "The day and a' wha' honor it.' " At this juncture a song was called for and Mr. T. D. Crayon sang in in imitable style "The Laird o' Cockpen," a humorous ballad, which was so highly ap preciated that he was forced to respond to an encore and gave "The Barring o' the Door,'' all present joining in the chorus. Fineley McRae, secretary of the club, responded to the toast, "The Land O'Cakes," and made a humorous, interest ing speech. It was well delivered and re ceived generous applause. O. C. Dallas, who was on tb? programme for a song, exensed himself on account of a cold and instead gave a recitation of a parody on Sheridan's ride that brought down the house. The toast "Onr Country" was responded to by Col. W. F. Sanders, who made one of his happiest after dinner speeches. He touched upon the national characteristics of the Scotch, lauded their thritc ana per severance and said America was ever ready to welcome them among her citi zens. The Colonel's wit found ample scope for exercise in almost every sentence aud his auditors frequently interrupted him with applause aDd laughter. Here Mr. James A. Smith, of Butte, one of the ablest pipers in the country, was in troduced. He was attired in lull High land costume aud gave a fine selection on his bag pipe. Prof. James Simpson responded to the next toast, "The Poetry of Scotland." He said he was proud of the privilege of ad dressing such an assemblage, bnt would have been prouder had the secretary, who had shown himself to be a canny Scot, given him au opportunity of preparing himself. Prof. Simpson spoke in an easy, graceful mauner, relating several anecdotes of Scotch wit. which created hearty merri ment. in ment. Clansman McIntosh sang the seng, "A Wee Drappie Hot," in a rollicking voice, the clansmen joining in the chorus. "Our Guests" was responded to by Hon. Thomas H. Carter in a happy manuer. He said he imagined Col. Sanders was one of the gne9ts, but after having heaid him speak be wrs convinced that the colonel was as Scotch as Robert Bruce himself. He had nobody with him but Messrs. Mar tin, Hugh McQuaid aud Gen. Green. Mr. Carter showed himself thoroughly conver sant with Scottish history and embellished bis remarks with several quotations from Burns. Clansman Lindsay sang that beantifnl old song, "Ye Banks and Braes o' Bonny Doon," after which Geo. G. Martin respond ed to "The Press." Mr. Martin dispelled an illusion of Mr. Carter's by denying that he was a guest, but entitled to be a mem ber of the club, as he was bern under the shadow of Edinburg castle. R. H. Beckwith, who was on the bill for a song, declined with thanks and presented his excuses in a brief, hnmorons speech. The toastmaster said the next speaker would be furnished with a text, and quoted : "a nd Nature swears, the lovely dears Her noblest work she classes, O; Her 'prentice ban' she tried on man. And then she made the lasses, o! ' Dr. McDonald was called upon to res pond. He said the probable reason the toast was assigned to him was. that he was a bachelor, and therefore, knowing noth ing about his subject, was the better quali fied to speak upon it H* proceeded in a happy vein, relating a number of anec dotes. Clansmen McIntosh and Crayon Mac Donald sang "Willie Brewed a Peck o' Maut," in inimitable style. A Scotch reel in which Clansmen McRcs, McIntosh, Simpson and Smith took part, was danced with a vigor which showed the lads en joyed it. "March of the Cameron Men," was sang, and the banqnet ended by all joining in singing "Anld Lang Syne " The Inauguration Ball. Washington, November 30.—A con tract has been signed by Governor Black and Chairman Britton, of the inaugural committee, for the use of the pension build ing in which to hold the inaugural ball. Mr. John C. Dougherty, secretary of the committee, has arranged for quarters and place in the inaugural procession for the committee which is composed of one dele gate from each State, Territory and the District of Columbia.

TERRITORIAL ADMISSION. Senator Mitchell, of Oregon, Talks on the Subject of New States. The following is part of an interview with Senator John H. Mitchell, 0 f Oregon published in the Portland News: ' It has been suggested by some of the Democratic members of Congress that the Northwestern Territories will not have to wait until the fifty-first congres* for ad mission into the Union. It is conceded that the Republicans will admit these Ter ritories as soon as the next congress is or ganized, and the Democratic party will gain nothing by delaying the matter onlv a single year. It is urged that the Demo cratic House might a3 well consent to the admission of these new States at once, and thus give the administration the credit for it. If the matter is delayed until the fifty-first congress Dakota will come in es two States. Montana as one, Idaho as another, Washington as a fourth, a id possibly New Mexico as a fifth. Dakota is Republican and so is Idaho. Washington Territory and Mon tana have been represented by Democratic Delegates, and New Mexico is Democratic. Montana and Washington, however, bo'h went Republican at the recent election, and Democrats believe it was because of the refusal of the Democratic administra tion to admit them into the Union. If Re publicans can get the credit of their admis sion they will all, with the possible ex ception ol New Mexico, feel bound to sup port the Republican party. This would give the Republicans tea .new Senators, conceding New Mexico to the Democrats. The Demociats will probably vote for the admission of the Territories, but will demand that Dakota be admitted as one state. A MUCH NEEDED INDUSTRY. First Class Soap Manufactured in Helena. A Herald reporter seeing a handsome cake of laundry soap at one of onr grocers artistically branded "Montana's Own" was led by inquiry to the place of its manufac ture near the round house ol the Northern Pacific Railroad in the Sixth ward of the city. At this point is located tne soap factory of C. T. Perry & Co., who ha ve at considerable expense erected a new build ing and put in steam machinery for their purpose. Being invited by the courteous Mr. Perry who is the principal partner in the plant to inspect the operation of soap making, our reporter invaded the oleagi nous precincts with some misgivings as to what the effect would be upon his olfac tories. While in the midst of the manu facture in ail its J manipnlations, there was no disagreeble odor even while inhaling the steam from the great soap kettle boil ing, sputtering and loammg with an eight ton charge of Montana tallow and other material used a9 ingredients. The whole place was clean and sweet and neat enough for a visit of ladies and gentlemen who might have the curiosity to witness the wholesale manufacture of soap in Helena. The reason that the place is so free from all disagreeable odors is that the material used in the process of soap making is en tirely pure beet tallow, resin and eocoanut oil. The process of soap making by whole sale is a very interesting operation; at least it proved to be to our reporter. The great kettle has a capacity of ten tons of tallow, resin, etc., and is heated by steam and kept boiling for about three days upon one charge, which is drawn off after a three days' pro cess of settling into a mixer, where it is perfumed and ran into iron moulds hold ing about 1,000 pounds each. Tne compo sition here dries and hardens into pure soap, and a consistency that enables it to stand alone. The moulds are then taken off and the huge lorm^of soap is wheeled into place, and cut into slabs, five f»et long and three by sixteen inches wide and deep. Each slab is then cat by a single automatic motion into 90 cakes and put upon frames to dry. After this the cakes are put under a press, one by one and stamped with the trade mark "Mon tana's Own" and wrapped in papers by small boys and packed lor commence. The reason that "Mentana's Own" so far excels its eastern competitor is, that it is made of pure tallow, a material which makes it hard enough without the addition of talc, silex and other clay used in hard ening the disgusting offall of which most laundry soaps are made iu the east. The purity of the material obtainable here for soap making will warraut Messrs. Perry & Co. in adding to their present business the manufactuie of toilet toaps. To say that the business of soap making in Helena is not an advance in the pro gress of our city would be to lessen the dignity of a much needed industry in our midst. midst. Opium Conspiracy Case. Auburn, N. Y. November 29.—The U. S. Court continued in session to-day, the object being to complete the opium con conspiracy case as soon as possible. John W. Stone, one ofthedefendants, who turned state's evidence, stated that Haynes had made a proposition to him last March while they were both attending the U. S. Coart at Utica, as counsel for Gardner in the smnggliug case, that they should bribe the necessary custom-house officers at Og densburg and substitute a spurious article for imported opium. He identified tne letters which be had written to both Haynes and Gardner, and detailed at length how the opium was taken from the custom house at Ogdensburg aud shipped to Chicago aud similar cans containing wood in blocks put in their place. He identified the cans found in Gardner's pos ses9ion in Chicago at the time of his arrest as the ones taken from the custom bouse at Ogdensburg Judge Brundage, counsel for Haynes, subjected the witness to a rigid cross-examination which will be continued to morrow. Auburn, N. Y., December 3.—At the opening ol the U. S. Court this morning Judge Brundage summed up lor Haines in the opium smuggling conspiracy case The great weight of his argument was the de nunciation of lawyrr Stone, of Ogdenburg, who turned states evidence, and in eulogy of Haines' good character.
