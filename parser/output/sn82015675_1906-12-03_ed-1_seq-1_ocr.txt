Judge IT. S. Martin of Dayton, O., was orator of the occasion; the ritu alistic services were conducted by the Elks officers and the music was by the Elks' lodge In chorus and by a special mixed choir. Decorations of a lavish character had transformed the stage of the the atre into a beautiful picture. Above the pyramid seats which held the members of the lodge, bunting dis playing the stars and stripes had been formed Into a canopy. Across the front of the stage was a bank of palms and flowers and as a central figure directly in front of the presid ing omcer s desk was the head or a fully-sntlered elk, an incandescent el ectric lamp at the tip of each prong. One of the effective electrical dis plays was an illuminated clock dial. the hour hand at II, and below, upon the face of an illuminated glass panel, were the names of the members of Richmond Lodge of Elks who have died since the organization.

REPORTED THAT THE SHOCK IS THE MOST SEVERE THAT HAS VISITED THE MEDITERRANEAN IN MANY YEARS. Second Session of the 59th Congress Will Begin at Noon Today With Absence , of High Tension. MATTERS THAT WILL BE BEFORE NATIONAL H0US2 Growing Unfriendliness of the Japs Will be One of the Sub jects Which Will Furnish Oratory. Publishers' Press. Rome, December 2. Advices re ceived here tell of a tremendous earth quake which devastated the city of Milazzo, In Sicily, Sunday. The earth quake is reported to have been the most serious that ever visited tha Mediterranean section in many years. Nearly every large structure in the town, which has a population of about 17,000 is reported to have been destroyed. Reports are very meager and com munication was almost immediately cut off. People were flying in panic to the outlying country and fires had broken out in the ruins of a number of ruined edifices. It is impossible at this moment to state whether there has been any loss of life. Milazzo is a fortified seaport city in the province of Messma on a promon tory 21 miles by rail west of Messina. It has a good trade in fruit, wine, cat tle, fish and sulphur. Milazzo is the ancient Mylae off which in 260 B. C. the Romans won a great sea fight from the Carthaginians. Its population is 16,122. DEATH FROM STARVATION Parents of Little Babe Unable to Buy Sufficient Food to Keep Their Child Alive. Publishers' Press. Washington. Dec. 2. Hotel lobbies are crowded tonight and each in coming train brings a batch of nation al legislatures. Although the second session of the 59th congress will begin at noon, to morrow there is an utter absence of the high tension which usually marks the approach of the event, which is accounted for in a measure by the well defined impression that there will be little general legislation ser iously attmpted aside from the pass age of the great supply bills. Philippine Tarriff Bill. Nearly every subject that is to re ceive serious consideration in the forthcoming session, has already been talked black In the face. The administration will again press for the enactment of a Philippine tariff bill and hopes for success. That the Senate will vote upon the right of Reed Smoot to retake his seat, is op enly conceded. Chairman ' Burrows of the committee on privileges and elections declares that he will call the matter up at the first session and push it to a speedy termination. Be hind closed doors the Senate will re sume discussion of the Algeciras treaty and after it is disposed of be fore the first of the year, will likely secure action upon the Santo Domin go treaty, which proved such a per plexing problem at the last session. There is a belief however, that the record for oratory in a three months session will be broken before the final adjournment, March four. The Cub an revolution will be one storm cen ter. The dismissal from the army of i three companies of negro troops will be another. There will be any amount of talk on the subject of cam paign contributions and the land offi ce scandal will be a frightful theme for discussion. Japan Trouble to be Up. The international differences be tween this government and .Japan over the school question in San Fran cisco, will, in all probability be work ed overtime. It will be taken advant age of by the advocates of a greater navy to support their demands for the construction of monster battleships. While the so called J THE BEGINNINGS OF BATTLE.

Judge Martin, of Dayton, in his memorial address, was handicanned from illness, leaving his bed at the vVeseott hotel a short time before the services opened. He acquitted him self well, however, his address beinsr a departure from the usual type of me.Terlal tributes delivered at the Elks' annual services. His one en deavor was to show that in gathering together in a public way to pay re spect to the departed, the Elkt' exem plified the. cardinal principles of its organization, which made it the ideal fraternity, one in which all men of whatever belief. whatever class. might meet on a common level. In part he said:. "Today hundreds and thousands of the members of this organization which we call Elks, are meeting to gether and are standing with bowed and uncovered heads, figuratively speaking at the graves of their re- rmbered dead. And while Elks in 'his manner express their saduess ov- r the fact that brethern whom they admired have died, nevertheless ther f!nd reasou to rejoice in the fact that (hose brothers once lived and were imcng them.

WINDOW DEDICATED TRIBUTE FROM THE JEWS N Magnificent Stained Glass Window in Keneseth Israel Temple Unveiled And Eulogies Sang to the Late Sec retary of State. Publishers' Press. Philadelphia, Dec. 2. The magnifi cent stained glass window dedicated to the memory of the late John T. Hay, secretary of state, was unveiled today in Keneseth Israel Temple, the Jewish church of the city, with cere monies participated in by leading dig nitaries cf the nation. Those participating included Secre tary of State, Elihu Root, Oscar Strauss of New York, recently nam- f ed by President Roosevelt as secre- Congress to See Work "in Being." "When President Roosevelt start ed out on his Panama trip it was with i the determination to see everything possible in the time allotted and to study the situation at first hand, even under the most adverse conditions. These conditions, no matter how he found them, he was determined to portray as faithfully as he could be fore congress and the public general ly. "For this purpose a special photo grapher with an elaborate photo graphing apparatus was sent to Colon a few days ahead of the president. He arrived there almost simultan eously with Chairman Shouts, under whose personal direction he set about making pictures. Almost everything from Colon to Panama had been pho tographed before the president's ar rival and then the photographer fol lowed him across the isthmus, photo graphing everything again as Mr. Roosevelt saw it- '"The president's special message on the subject of the canal is expect ed to be eloquent, but these photo graphs will be even more so." Publishers Press. Herkimer, X. Y., Dec. 2. Orders have been issued for the thirty-first seperate company of Herkimer, to hold itself in readiness tomorrow to suppress disorders or attempts at lynching should the jury disagree in the trial of Chester Gillette, charged with the killing of "Billy" Brown. The company will assemble in the armory here and await orders of Dis trict Attorney Ward. Fears are expressed because of the oner, should the jury find him not guilty or be unable to agree upon a verdict, a mob would be ready to take the law into their own hands. Militiamen will be given several rounds of amrjunitionand will be hurried to the court house at the first indication of trouble. It is learned that if the jury remains out more than an hour iii its deliberations, the militia will march at once' to the court house. All the entrances will be guarded and a platoon of soldiers will be flung across the street from the jail to the court house to protect Gillette when he passes from the jail to hear the verdict. Even effort will be made to get the case into the jury room by night fall and a late verdict is expected. Gillette thinks the worst outcome of tha trial will be a disagreement. He told a keeper today that he was innocent and thought the jury would find him so. "I certainly hops they won't disa gree" he said. Xone of his counsel visited him today.
