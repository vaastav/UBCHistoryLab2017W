We have si ways found means to do tbat aud shall Hud them whenever It Is neces earv without calllim our people awuy from their uecessnry tasks to render compulsory military service In times of peace. Allow nie to speak with great plain ness and directness upon this reui matter and to avow my convictions with deep earnestness. I have tried to know what America Is, what her people think, what they are. what the most cherish aud bold dear I hope that some of their tiuer pussions are in my own heart some of the great con ceptions and desires which crave birth n thla nmrnpiiti.iii.l ui4 n.liii.H hufu made the voice of this people a voice of peace and bope and liberty anjunt! the peoples of the world, and that, speaking my owu thoughts. I shall, at least In part, speak theirs also, bow ever faintly and Inadequately, upon thla vital matter We are at peace with all the world No one who speaks counsel based oh fact or drawn from a Just and candid Interpretation of realities can say thai there Is reason to fear that from any quarter our Independence or the tnteg rlty of our territory Is threatened Dread of the power of any other na tlon we are Incapable of We are not jealous of rivalry In the fields of com merce or of any other peaceful achieve ment We mean to live our own lives as we will, but we mean also to lei live. We are. Indeed, a true friend tc all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the posses slons of none, desire the overthrow ol none. Our friendship can be accepted and Is accepted without reservation, be cause It is offered in a spirit and foi a purpose which no one need evei question or suspect Therein lies oui greatness We are the champions ol peace and of concord. And we should be very Jealous of this distinction which we have sought to earn. Jusi Bow we should be particularly Jealous of It, because It Is our dearest presenl bope that this character and reputation may presently. In God's providence bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been vouchsafed any nation the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconcillatloc and a healing settlement of many matter that has cooled and Interrupt ed the friendship of nations. This is the time above all others when wt should wish and resolve to keep oui strength by self possession, our lnflu ' enee by preserving our ancient princl pies of action. From the first we have bad a clear ! end settled policy with regard to mili tary establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our present ' principles and Ideals we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked. . Are you ready to defend yourselves? we reply. Most assuredly; to the ut most. And yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives makinu soldiers of themselves. There is an other sort of energy in us It will know bow to declare Itself and make itself effective should occasion arte ! And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to make oui moral Insurance against the spread ot the conflagration very definite and cer tain and adequate Indeed Let us remind ourselves, therefore of the only thing we can do or will do We must depend in every time of na tional peril.

The farmer who does better than the average today is not tl'C man who grubs a liiri; out of thtf soil anywhere and in any old way without scientific methods or without business-like man agement. :j; The modern farmer is a business man who makes his farm a factory and studies his soil, his seeds, his market, the range of prices, his transportation facilities, and the manner in which he operates his enterprise with the purpose of making not only a liv- S? ing but a profit. That is what the manufacturer does who buys cotton, wool, wood and iron and manufactures them into forms for & business use. He has to study his job from every angle to be sue- cessful and that must be the case with the farmer. Trusting to the Lord and luck does not pay. .1, themges Co-operation between proficient business men and practical fnrmprs will eliminate milch TllisiinrlpretsinHino' iffnnranmi nnl nm. -u iudi(.e.

Putnam County has not yet -K beneficent movement. I noted the other day that western corn was selling in Jackson- ville for $1.75 per hundred pounds, and corn brought from Argentina, 6,000 miles away, was' quoted at $1.70. Corn Club bovs in Florida and hundreds of them in other states, have records of growing 100 bushels 5,600 pounds of shelled corn to the acre. This at the Ar- -r gentina quotation represents $85.00. In Florida especially the -!- Palatka-Hastings district it is possible to raise $100 worth of -it Irish potatoes on this same acre, besides a crop of hay worth $20 -B or more, and all in the same year. This is not possible under guess work methods, but by scientific ones taught by farm advisers. No more kindly conditions exist anywhere in America than in -K Florida. Prof. P. H. Rolfs, director of the Florida Experiment 4t Station, has told me tlmt every month in this state can be made to Provide something for the table high, grown on a Putnam County farm, are on exhibition at the Pa- latka Board of Trade rooms.

Benjamin Disraeli, a European Statesman, said: "Man is not the creature of circumstances, circumstances are the creatures of man. We are free agents, and man is more powerful than matter." A study of the situation shows that Florida is a state in com- mand of all that can be reasonably desired in the matter of advanta- ges. It has an abundant rainfall, a wonderful supply of under ground water in easy reach, the best climate in the United States, a soil capable of intensive cultivation with a great variety of crops, and cheap and quick access to the largest markets of the country-, ?U No state in the Union has equal access to the sea. Sir Walter Ral- eigh ruid: "The nation in command of the sea commands the world." The present war in Europe is largely due to the desire of Germany and Russia to get access to the sea. Emerson said: "America is another name for opportunity." Where are there greater opportunities than in Florida? Florida needs the man. $ 

MOSES FOLSOM. i.XXXXXXXXXXX3KU!ll!XSixXXXXXXUXXllfluslf!VM'- 'INTERLACHEN. The Camp Fire Girls of Lagonda Camp Fire gave an original and unique entertainment in the town hall on Thursday evening. The stage was decorated to represent a very realis tic woodland scene, and the first di vision of the program was a repro uction of a Camp Fire Council, with all the members in full ceremonial regalia, presenting a very pretty pic ture. Camp Fire songs were sung around a bona fide camp-fire, and many of the program features, inclu ding the "Woheto Song" and the "Council of Lagonda" were the origi nal work of members of the Lagonda Camp. After a musical inteilude, the second division of the program was given, consisting of a series of tab leaux typifying the Seven Points of the Camp Fire law and the program closed with the singing of the "Good Night Song" of the Order. Friday evening a party of over thirty of the friends of Miss Gladys Bischoff went in a body and gave that popular little lady a genuine surprise, in honor of her birthday. The evening was replete with fun from start to finish. Mr. Bischoff who was in the secret and helping along the plot, had a generous supply of fine fresh oysters ready and these and other tempting viands proved most acceptable to the fun-makers before starting homeward through the chill night air. Rev. W. V. Bethea filled the last appointment of his year's pastorate in the M. t,. church here last Sun day. Mr. Bethea leaves his charge here, in order to devote himself to the wider field of evangelistic work, and will be greatly missed from our community.

Its record here has certainly never been approached, and it is well' that it has not. If all the other great public corporations should learn to use the press as this telephone corporation has used it,, the people would have real cause to fear indus trial enslavement. "Very early in the fight a literary bureau was estab lished at the Boston headquarters of the Bell Company, which had for its mission the dissemination of matter that should mold public opinion along the lines desired by the trust. It was hoped to establish these false premises in the public mind: "That the telephone is a natural monopoly. "That a dual or competing telephone system is a hardship on the people and that it brings no advantages in the end to the subscriber. "That the Bell Company was alone equipped for giv ing a satisfactory service and reasonable rates. "That competition was wasteful and must necessari ly increase rates in the end. "That persons investing in Independent securities must inevitably lose their money. "That the Independent companies were simply being promoted by scheming manufacturers to unload worthless apparatus. "That the Bell Company could furnish long-distance connections and that, without such connections a tele phone service was worthless. "That Bell telephone securities alone offer safe in vestments in this industrial field. "That the Independent companies are going into bankruptcy almost as fast as organized, and "That the whole Independent movement is small, un important, and doomed to early extinction. "How well the Bell press bureau has done its work, every reader of this article may ascertain for himself. Ninety-nine men out of every hundred, in communities where the Independents are not in actual operation, will affirm every one of these propositions, though without ex ception they are untrue. And, even in places where the Independents are actually at work, plenty of people may be found who hold to these false ideas. Ask them where they get their opinions on the subject and they will be un able to tell you, except that they 'know them.' They are unaware that the impressions they are giving out as facts have been carefully drilled into them by the agents of the Bell Telephone Company operating through the newspa pers and other publications that are willing to lend them selves to this sort of work for a money consideration The process is as simple as it is effective. As soon as telephone opposition threatens to manifest itself in a community there will suddenly appear, in that section of the local press that is willing to sell its reading columns for a good price, a grist of articles detailing most minutely the 'se vere financial loss that has come in other places to invest ors m Independent securities.' These articles, all of them paid for at the highest 'reading matter' rates, generally appear under such headlines as these, taken from the New York 'Press' of June 25, 1905: LOSSES IN. TELEPHONE FIELD. Investors in Independent Companies Suffer Through Many Failures. "In the course of a year I have received through the clipping bureaus as many as two thousand articles of this nature They came out of all classes of papers, from the poor cheap country weekly to the metropolitan daily. Most of the articles were exact reproductions, even to paragraphing. Invariably they were full nf faio .t,t. ' ments.' THE PALATKA AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE CO. $ 4t $ A & a a a ... ... Helpful Work in Christian Endeavor. Dear Florida Workers in C. E.: It is almost time for Santa Claus to come. Upon our own generosity depends whether the famous little old man with his pack and reindeer comes to the homes of the friendless and the friendless having no homes, in Florida. The Lord told His first followers to work in their own cities and coun try as well as in far-off regions. The call for Christian Endeavorers of our State this month, Dec. 1914, is to help in the Christmas giving for the Children's Home Society, having for State headquarters, 361 St. James Building, Jacksonville. We .are not left in doubt how this command for tithing and other means of unselfish ness should be fulfilled. It is by hav ing in every town where there is a Young People's or Junior Endeavor Society, a "Save a Baby Club." If our localities or church fields are large enough, let us not only encour age other clubs being organized, but see that our individual C. E. socie ties have them "of their very own." We will have this week a letter and sample literature sent to each society known of in the White State Union. It is expected that after reading these letters our workers, if not so already, will be enough inter ested to send at once to Mr. Mar. cus C. Fagg, for more literature ex plaining all about why and how the clubs are to be made a success. Of course times are closer now than most years in "Our Land of Plenty," but only those best posted realize what they mean to the very poorest people and their benefactors, like those giving their lives in daily sacrifice "to make ends meet" at the Children's Home. In order that these "ends" will meet was the club plan started. Societies around Tampa can give half of their club money to the local City Orphanage. Our societies have given little for this, our special Home Missionary cause, this year. But there is one month yet. Let me know if vou are working up clubs, please, either di rectly Endeavor or in general- work with other good people of your towns.
