LIMA AND RETURN. On last Friday, in common with Knnt i Finn r.f thn citizens cf Fre- PUVHI V. v mont-Fostoria. Findlay, Bluff con and other places along the line of the road, we availed ourselves of the very kind invitation of the citizens cf Lima to come over and take dinner with them. According to the pro gramme a free train over the L. E. & L. RE., wss due at this place at 10 o'clock A. U , but it was fully 11 when it arrived. A large crowd Of our citizens lad assembled at the depot, bnt the lrHa was crowded to it reached here, and not over half of those who intended tr trn were willins to take their chances for pleasuie in the already overcrowded cars. In fact, some of the Fremonters got tired of the jam and ended their trip here. Owing to the kindness and atien tlon tit Mr. I. H. Bureoon, Assistant Superintendent of the road, we se cured excellent accommodations, and we will here state that that gen tleman did all in his power to make every one enjoy the trip. All along the route knots of people were gath ered, who signaled the train, but it was useless to stop, as there was not even standing rocm on the train At the different stations large crowds were con predated, many of whom were obliged to indefinitely postpone their trip. Arriving at Lima we found every thing in readiness for our reception. Six laree tables were spread in the City 11 all, which were loaded down with eatables. There was bet one tiling that marred tjg enjoymett of the occasion. It aa cold as 'Greenland's icy mountains," and the transit from the cars to the 11 all was attended with red noses and tingling ears. Unfortunately for the excursionists, the citizens of Lima had no control over the elements, Up the broad staircase and into the lflTSi ipTTi iiinn Hsll surged the cold and hunfirrv crowd, and the tables were speedily filled, with "more standing at the door. The citizens of Lima did their utmost to make the occa sion an enjoyable one to their guests. There was plenty to eat, but truth and candor compels ns to add that there were few fragments left when that hungry crowd was filled. We judge that between 1,500 and 2,000 persons were accommodated at the tables. If an body imagines that the feeding of a couple of thousand hungry pco pie is a small job, just let them try it. It is astonishing how rapidly a very large pile of provisions disappears on such an occasion. One wonders where it all goes to. After the dinner bad been thor oughly discussed, the immense crowd straggled back to the depot There was neither time nor inclination to "do'' the city, as we should have been happy to do had the 6tate of the thermometer been propitious. We had just lime to esy "had d'ye do'' to Parmenter and Fisher of the Gazette and' Democrat, and no time to culti vate their acquaintance. They both looked happy. Well, as we remarked, the crowd straggled back to the de pot, and several hundred red noises (all lrom the effects of the cold, mind ye) got aboard the cars again, and we were soon homeward bound, where we arrived about 8 o'clock. Ilad it not been an excessively cold day the tiip would have been very pleasant one. As it was, we congratulate the citizens cf Lima that they succeeded in making com forlahle the immense assemblage which accepted their hospitality. DEATH OF HORACE GREELEY. Sinceour last issue Horace Gree ley, the great journalist, and late Lib eral candidate for the Presidency, has breathed his last His deata was caused by nervous pros'.ration, the result ot the recent death of his wife, &ud the excitement ci the late cam palgn. He died at a ripe old age, though he retained his physical and mental visor until a very recent period. Mr. Greeley was one of the greet est journalists of the age, and in his capacity as editor cf the New York Tribune perhaps wielded a greater influence than any man in his sphere. Ilis recent action politically, alicnat ed from htm many of his lifelong ad mirers, but no one will aeny turn a place in history as one of the great raon of the American Republic. At this time when the epidemic among horses is fast becoming gen eral, and attacks, without warning the faith Jul beast on whom we rely hoth for business and pleasure, it is a. satisfaction tor us to be able to call the attention of onr readers to remedy that has been thoroughly tried in the largest cities of our Slate, and found to be the most efficacious of anything used. We refer to Fur cmoa's Wonderful Oil, and call at tention to the adveritsemcnt in an other column, where are testitnoniolfl from Cleveland and Cincinnati, which tells its virtues far better than we can. Castoria a substitute for Castor Oil is a physic which does not dis tress or gripe, but is sure to operate when all other remedies have failed. Yo may confidently rely upon the Castoria in Stomach Ache, Constipa tion, Flatulency, Croup, Worms, Piles or daranged Liver. It contains neither Mineral,,- Morphine, Opium nor Alcohol, but u purely a vegeta ble preparation, perfecUy harmless, and above all, pleasant to uke. The Castoria Booths and quiets ihe sy. tern, and produces natural sleep, it is a wonderful thing to assimilate the food of children and prevent them lrom crying. A 50 cent bottle will i the work for a family and --' Hfl save President's Message Tot the Senate and House of Representatives. In transmitting to you ray fourth annual message it is with thankfulness to the Giver of all Good that as a na tion we have been blessed for the last year with peace at home and abroad and a general prosperity, vouchsafed to but lew people, with tie exception of the recent devastating are which swept from the earth with a breath as it were iunaou ii k.iuivm wealth in the city oi Boston. Ihere have been two over shadowing calain nitics within the year to record. It is gratifying to note here, that like their fellow citizens f theVatyof Chicago, under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are ral lying under their misfortunes, and the prospect is that their energy and per severance will overcome all obstacles and show the same prcerity soon that they would have shown had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise, we have been free from pestilence, war and calamities which Hen overtake nations, and, as far as human judgment can penetrate uie iu-.urc, no caune seems to exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

ALABAMA CLAIMS ARBITRATION. a When Congress adjourned in Juno last a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperilled the settlement by friendly arbitration of the differences existed between this government and that of Her Brittanic Majesty .which by the Treaty of Wash ington had been referred to me i riDunai ot Arbitration which had met at Geneva in Switzerland. The arbitrators,how- ever, disposed of tho question which had jeopardized the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations .m most unhappy relations toward each other, in manner entirely satisfactory to this government and in accordance with tho views and the policy which it had maintained. The tribunal, which had convened in Geneva in Decem ber, concluded its laborious session on the 14 th day ot September last, on which day. bavins availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross- It made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Ureal lintatn to tho United States, for the ratifica tion of all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long standing difference between the two governments, ana in connection with another award made by the German Emperor under a ref erence to him by tho same treaty, leaves these two governments without a shadow upon tho friendly relations which it is in y sincere hope may for ever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva tribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of Ihe arbitrators, the arguments ot the counsel of both governments, the award of the tribunal, and the opin ions given by the several arbitrators, is transmitted herewith. 1 have caus ed to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers who com plied with the joint request made to them under the treaty, the thanks of this government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them respect fully, and also my thanks to tuo erm nent persons named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality and great ability with which they discharged their orders and high functions Her Majesty's government has communicated to me its appreciation by her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry dis played by Mr Adams, tho arbitrator named on the part of this government during the protracted inquiries and discussions ot the tribunal. I cordi ally unite with her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the agent ot the United Mates before the tribu nal to record my high appreciation ct the marked ability, unwearied patience and the prudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very re- sponsibleand delicate duties committed to lum, as it it is also due to the warn ed and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this gov eminent, to express my sense of the talents and wisdom which ihey brou ht to bear in the argument of tho result so happily reached. It will be the providence ot Congress provide for the distribution among thove who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date ot the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of the severu cases in in which indemnification may be due. I consequently recommend the crea tion ot a board of commissioners for the purpose. By tho 3 ith article ot tho treaty ot Washington the reepec tive claims ot the United Stales and of Great Britain in their construction of the treaty of June, 1840, defining the boundary line between tneir re spective teritories were submitted to the arbitration and award of his filajes ty, the Emperor of Germany, to decide which cl those claims is most in ac cordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1S4G. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the arbi tration, has the earnest thanks ot this government and of the people of the United states tor the labor, pains and care which he has devoted to the con sideration ot this long pending differ eiice. l nave caused an expression of my thanks to be communicaledjto His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the rep resentative ot this government at Ber lin, conducted the case and prepared the statement on the part ot the Unit ed States, with the ability that his past service justified the public in ex pecting at bis hands As a member of the cabinet at the date ot the trea ty vhich has given rise to the discus sion between the two governments, as tho Minister to Great Britain when the construction now pronounced on lounaea was nrst advanced, and as the agent and representative of the government to present the case and to receive the award, tie has been associ ated with the question in all of its phases, and in every 6tare has mani fested a patriotic zeal and earnestness in the maintenance of the claim ol the United Slates ; he is entitled to much credit tor thesuccess which has attend ed the submission. After a patient investigation ot tl.e case and ot the statements ot each party, bis majesty the tmperor, on the 2 1st day ot Oc tober latt, signed his award in writing, decreeing that the claim of the gov ernment ot the United States that the boundary line between the territor ies of her Bn.annic majesty and the United States should be drawn throuirh the Haro channel, is most in acordance with the true interpretation ot the treaty concluded on the 15th of June 1848, between tne agents ot her int annic majesty and the United States. Copies of the case presented on be half of each government, and ot the statement in reply, ot each,and a trans lation of the award are transmitted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important archipelago of Islands lying between the continent and Vancouv er's Island, which for twenty-six years, Great Britain has contesled.and leaves us tor the first time in the history ot the United States a nation without a question of disputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is my graceful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action ol Her Majesty's government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any request from this government, anil betore the reception in the United States of the award signed bv the Emperor.ller Maiestr bad mvn in. tructiOM tor the rotnntrol nf hnr troops which had been stationed there ' or en of jurisdiction, so as to leave 1 theUnii iiv.ea in exclusive pO".o- j sionof the latclv disputed territory 1 r,.,.r,,linl.all,'iii(i ar.tiiinnrei - 1 I that the orders for the removal of .he troops have been executed, and the military joint occupation ot San Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive poe;ioa ot the United States. It now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of that portion of tne boundary Una through the Haro channel, on which the commission which determined the remaining part ot the line were uaablc to agree. I recommend the appoint ment of a commission to act jointly with ono which may be named by her Majesty for that purpose. THE 

ALASKA BOUNDARY. Experience of the difficulties attend ing the determination of our admitted line of boundary a!tr the occupation ot the territory and its settlement by those owing allieganceto the respect ive government's points to tho impor tance of establishing by natural objects or other monuments the actnl line be tween the territory acquired by pur chase lrom liussia and the adjoining Dossesssions ot her Lritannic maiesty The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests ot indu-ia uals or of jurisdiction ara likely to in terfere to the delay or embarasr-ment of the actual location ot the line. If deterred until population shall enter and occupy the territory, some trival content ot neighbors may a2ain array the two governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appoint ment ot a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminous posses sions of Great Britain Id my last annual message I reeommened the leg islation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty of Washing ton ot May, 1871, relating to the ush eries and to other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part ot Great Britain, and its possessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not then been iiad,and during a session of Congress a ques tion was raised which tor the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the direction indicated would bsorae important. 1 his ques tion hss jSince been disposed ot, and I have received notice that the Impe rial Parliament and the legislature of the provincial government have passed laws to carry tho provisions ot the treaty on the matters referred to into opeiation. I therefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this government. The joint commission for determin ing the boundary line between the United States and the British posses eior.s, between the Lake of the Woods and the I iocky Mountains, Las organ ized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that tho torce bo increased, in order that the completion ot the survey and determining of tho line may be attained. To this end I rec ommend that a sufficient appropriation be made. OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE. With France, oar earliest ally; Rus sia, the constant and steady friend of the United , States ; Germany, with whose government and people we have so many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe, our relations arc maintained on the most friendly terms. Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratifications of a treaty with tho Aus trian and Hungarian empire, relating to naturalization ; also, of a treaty with tho German empire, respecting consuls and trademarks ; also, of a treaty with Sweden and Norway, relating to naturalization, all cf which treaties have been duly proclaimed. THE VIENNA EXPOSITION. Congress, at its last session, having made an appropriation to defray the expense ot commissioners on the part ot the United States to the Interna tional Statistical Congress at StPeters burg, the persons apjwinted in that character proceeded to their destina tion and attended the sessions ot the congrss, their report shall in due sea son be laid before you. This congress meets at intervals ot about three years, and hasheld its sessions in several of the countries ol Europe. I submit to your consideration the propriety ot extending an invitation to the Congress to hold its next meeting in tho United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1876 would afford an ap propriate occasion ior such meeting Preparations ro miking for tha i;i ternational ex osition to be held dur ing the next year in Viennaon a 6cale of very great magnitude. The ten dency ot these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and of the elevation of industry, of labor, and of the increase of human happi ness as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations. As this exposition is to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe, it Is believed that American manufactur ers and inventors will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their produc tions, if encouraged by proper aid and protection. At the last session ot Congress, authority was given tor the appoin ment of one or more agents to represent this government at the ex position. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of any appropriation, there is danger that the important benefits which the occasion offers, will, in a large degree, be lost to the citizens of the United States. I commend the subject strong ly to your consideration, and recom mend that an adequate appropriation be made tor the puqxise. To further aid the American exhib itors at tho Vienna exposition,I would recommend, in addition to an appro priation of money, that the secretary ot the navy be authorized to fit nn two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port, to V lenna and Dacii their articles tor exhibition THE POLICY WITH MEXICO. Since your last session the President ot the JUencan republic, distinguished by his high character and his services to his country, has died. His tempo rary successor has now been elected with great unanimity bv the Den!i proof" of confidence on their part in his patriotism aua wisdom, which, u is believed, wid be confirmed by the re ..i. -fi.:. - -r. . wiih ui uia auiuiDisirauon. it is par ticularly desirable that nothmsr should bs left undone by the government ot eimer repubuo to strengthen their re lations as neighbors and friends It is much to bo regretted that manv lawlesa acts continue to disturb the quiet ot the settlements on the border between our territory and that of Mexico, and that complaints of wron? to American citizens in various parts of tho country are made. The revolu tionary condition in which the neigh boring republic has so long been in volved has in some degree contribu ted to this disturbance. It is hoped that with a more settled rule of order throughuot the republic, Khich may Je expected from the present govern ment, the acts,of which jun complaint is made, will cease. The prooeedmgs of the commission under the convention with Mexico oi the 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claim, have unlortunately been checked by an obstacle for the remov al of which measures have been taken by the two governments, which, it is believed, will prove euccessluL ihe co Lmissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolutions of Congress of the 7th ot May last to inquire into the depredations of the Texan frontiers have diligently made investigations in that quarter. Their report upon the titiit will bo cwomnnicited to von ' m ' Their researches were necessarily in complete, partly on account ot the! united appropriation made by Con j . , .1 ,i . 1 . "Tea?. Jiexico. on iue parw ui ma. government, lias appointed a simuzx commission to investigate these out rages. It is cot announced officially, but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired. and that the co-operation of all par tics concerned is invited to secure t'.iat end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made at the earnest day practicable to enanie tne commissioners on the part oi tne United States 1 1 return to their labor without delay. THE 

DISTRESS OF CUBA—THE OBVIOUS CAUSE. It is with regret that I have again I ) announce a continuance of the dis turbed condition oitheisland of Cabx No advance toward the pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made, while the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no more ot the elements of power or of the prospect of ultimate success than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its suppression, and the parties hund apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent as to its result, although humanity could not ba unmoved by many of its incidents, wherever they might occur It is, however, at our door. 1 cannnot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba i3 anion'' the 6trong inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause ot a terri ble eviL The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration ot peace and order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberal government of Spain will vol untarily adopt this view. The law of emancipation, passed more than two years since, has remained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It was but a feeble step towards emancipation, but it was the recognition of right, and wasbiiled as such, and exhibited Spain in b. xmony with the sentiments ot humanit and of justice, and in sympathy with the other powers ot the Christian and civ ilized world. Within toe past few weeks the regulations for carrying out tho laws of emancipation have been an nounced, giving evidence of the since rity of the intention of the present gov ernment to carry out tho la wot 1870. 1 have not tailed to urge tho considera tion of the wwdom,the policy and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition oi a great evu wmuu op nroed a race and continues a bloody contest close to our border, as well as the expediency and justice ot conced ing reforms of which the propriety is not questioned. Deeply impressed with the conviction that slavery is one of the most active causes of the con tinuance of the unhappy condition ia Cuba, I regret to believe that citizsns ot the United States, or those claiming to bo such, are largo holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as property, but, which is forbidden and denounced by the laws ot the United States They are thus in defiance of the spir it of our own laws, contributing to the continuance ot this most distressing and sickening contest- In my last unnn-il message. I referred to this sub ject, and I aain recommend such leg- lslation as may oo piupei w ucuu. and if not prevent, at least discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves. It is gratifying to announce that the ratification ot the convention concluded under theainpi ces of this government, between Spain on t::e one part,aud the allied Repub lics of the Pacific oa the other, provi ding fcr an armistice, have been ex changed, and a copy of the instrument isherewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a per manent peace between the same parties. 

DIPLOMATIC POLICY WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace between Brszil and tho Argentine Republic, it is hoped, are ia the way of satisfactory adjustment. With these States, as with the Repubiics ot Cen tral and South America, we continue to maintain the most friendly relations. It is with regret, however, I announce that the government of Venzuela has made no turther payments on account of the awards under the convention o! the 25th ot April, 18G0- That Republic is now understood to be al most, it not quite tranquilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time in providing for the unpaid bal ances ot its debt to the United States, which, having originated in injuries to its citizens by Venzuelan authorities, and having been acknowledged pur suant to a treaty in the most solemn form known among nations, it would seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and con tracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. Oar treaty relations with Japan re main unchanged. An imposing em bassy from that interesting and pro gressive nation vitited this country during tho year that is passing, but being unprovided with powers for the siting ot a convention in this country, noconclosion in that direction was reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions which took place diring their stay in this country has led to mutual appreciation of tho interests there, which may ba promoted when the revision of the existing treaty shall bo undertaken In this'connection I renew my recom mendation of one year ago, that to give importance and add to tbo effi ciency OI OUT aipiomauc reiauuuj with Japan and Chin3, and to turther aid in retaining the good opinion of these people, and to acure to the United fetates its share oi tne com merce destined to flow between these nations and the balance ot tho com mercial world, appropriations be made to support at least tour army youths in each ot these countries to serve as a part of the official lamily ot our min isters. Oar representatives would not even then be placed on an equality with the representatives ot Great Britain or some other power. As now situated our representatives in China and Ja pan have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives ot those countries who know our language im perfectly, or procure tor the occasion the services ot employees in foreign business houses, or the interpreters to other foreign ministers, I renew the recommendations made on a previous occasion of the transfer U the department of the interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the territories with which the department of state is char ged by law or custom RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS ABROAD. Congress, from the beginning of the government, has wisely made provis ion for the relief ot distressed seamen ia foreign countries, o similar pro vision, however, has hitherto been made for tho relief of distressed citi zens abroad, other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with oth cr governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain cases A similar authority, and an appropriation to 2&rry it into effect, are commended in cise of citizens of the United States, destitute or sick under such circum stances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of them are able to bear the expense incident to locomotion, there are some, who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless and have no friends at home l.l in tmwir tbm. iif.on racist eitccr ci ih or cist themselves upon the ci.iritv of foreigners, or be returned at the" private charge of our own t ficers, who usually, even with the m-jst benevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare, were such their pur poses. Should the authority and ap I ropriation asked for be given, care will be taken to carry the manScecca of Congress into effect, so that it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.

From the foregoing statement It ap pears that the reduction ot tho priaci cipal ot the debt during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, was $ 99,900, 253 61. The source of this reduction is as follows ; Net ordinary receipts during the year, S30,4C9,229 91; net ordinary expenditures, including in terest ou the public debt, 270,559, 695,91 ; total, 041,304,534 00. Add amount of receipts from premiums on sa'csot gold, in excess cf tho premi um paid on bonds purchssnd, $2,454, 470 89 ; add the amount f the reduo tion ot the cash balance at the closo of tho year, accompanied with the same at the commencement of the ear, 3 371,343 05; total, 99,900,253 54. This statement treats colely of the principal ot tho public debt. By the monthly statement of tho public debt, which adds together tho principal and interest due and unpaid, and interest accrued to date, due, and deducts the cash in the treasury, as according on the day ot publication, tho reduction was $100,544,491 23. The source of this reduction u a3 follows : reduction in principal account 99,900,003 51 ; rrdnction in unpaid interest amount, 3,330,952 90 ; total, 103,290 J5G.50 ; reduction in cash on hand, 2,740,- 405 22: total, 3l00,544,tri 23 On the basis of the last table the state ments show a reduction of the public debt from tne 1st t ilarch, 1S09, to the present time, as .follows: From March 1, 1309 to March 1, 1870, 57, 134,782 84; from March 1, 1870 to March 1,1871, 8117,019,030 25; from March 1.1S71 to March 1, 1872, 94, 895,348 94 ; from March 1, 1872 to IS ovem ber 1 ,1 8 1 2, eieht months, 864 047,237 84 ; total, 303,090,999 87. With the great redaction of taxa tion I)? the acts or Congress at its last session, the expenditure of the government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful, how ever, whether any farther reduction of so vexatious a burden upon any people will be practicable for t1 e present At all events, as a meas ure of justice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, I would recommend that no more legislation be had on this subject, unless it be to correct errors of emis sion end commission in the present laws, until sufficient time ba elaps ed to provo that it can bs done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the current expenses of the govern ment, pay the interest on the pub lic debt and provide for the sinking fund established by law. The pres ervation of our national credit is of the highest importance. Next in importance to this comes a solemn du'y to provido a natiooEl curren cy of a fixpd, unvarying vabirs as compared wUh gold and a3 soon as practicable, having due regard for the Interests of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade and com merce, and ccnvcrtablo into gold at par. WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year end ing June 3, 1861 to be 835,793,971 82 ; and for the fiscal yesr ending Juno 30, 1S72, to be 35,372 157.20 shoeing a reduction in favor cf the last fiscal voir cf 127,834 72 The estimates for military appropriation for lha next fijc.il year, ending Jane 30, 1871, ore 3,3S0,137,878. The est imates of the chief engineer are submitted separately for fortifications, river and harbor improvements and for public bail lingi and grounds, and the Washington aqueduct. The af fairs of the Frce:licen'a Bureau have all been transferred to the War De partment, and Ilia regulations have been pat into execution for the speedy payment or bounty due col ored soldiers properly coming under that bureau. All war accouats for money and property prior to 1S7I, have been exwiined and transmitted to the treasury for final settlement. Dur ing the IhcsI 3 car there have been pid for transportation on railroads, 81,300,000, cf which S0,857 was over tha PAcific railroads. For trans portation by water, 62.637,352, and by stage 13,975,81, and for the purchase of transportation animals, wagons, Lire of teamsters, etc., 921, 650 64. About 8370,000 have been collected from southern railroads during the j ear, leaviag about 4,-1 000,000 still due. The quartermas ter has examined and transmitted to the accounting officers for settlement 36,717,272 ct claims by loyal citizens for quartermasters' etores taken dur ing the war. . The eubsislisg supplies to the amount of 89,013 12 have been issued to the Indians. The annus! average of mean strength ot the army was 24,101 white and 2,493 colored soldiers. The total deaths for the year reported were 367 white and 54 colored. The distribution of the medical and surgical hist cry of the war is yet to be ordered by Congress. There exists an aosoiuie necessity lor a medical corps of the loll number es tablished by act of Congress of July 23th, 1866, there being now fifty nine vacancies, and the number of suc cessful candidates rarely exceeds tight or ten in any one 5 ear. Toe liver and harbor improvements have been carried on with energy and economy. Tnough many are only partially completed, the results have saved to commerce many times the amount expended. Tne increase of commerce with greater depth of channels, greater secuiity in naviga tion and the saving of time, adds millions to the wealth of the country and increases the resources of the government. The bridge across the Mississippi river at Rock Iilar.d hs9 been com pleted, and the bridge at LiCrcsse.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS. The favorable al'ention of Congress is invited to toe fcllonia reeoraiaend- siioas or lue becretarv of War : A discontinuance of the appointment cf extra lieutenants lo serve as adju tants &nd qaarisrmasters. Tiie adop tion of a code providing specific pen alties for well-de!incd,-:if;i;cjs so tt at the inequality ot sentences adjudged by ccuits-miirtial may be adjusted.; the c5nsoli. lation of accounts under which expenditures are made as a measure of economy; a reappropria tion ol the money for the construe tion ot a depct at San Antonio, the title to the site being now p?rlectcd a special act placicg the cemetery at the City of Mexico on the same basis as of-.er national cemeteries; author ity to purchase sites lor military posts 1:1 Texas ; the appointment of com missary sergeants from con coramis !ioned ofiicers, as a mea3ure for se curing the better care and protection cf supplies; aa appropriation for the dialogues to the anatomical section of the army medical musaum, a re cj propriatioa cf the cmcunt lor the manufacture cf breech loading arnis, stioiilJ the selec'.ion be so delayed by thsjbe-ardof officers as to leave the for mer appropriation unexpended at the close of the fiscal year ; tho sale of such arsenals east of the Mississippi &s csn be spared, and the proceeds applied to the establishment of one large arsenal cf construction and re pair upon the Atlantic coast, and the purchase of a suitable site for a prov ing experimental ground for heavy ordnance; the abrogation of laws which deprive inventors in the Unitetl States seivice from deriving any bent-fit from their inventions; the repeal of the law prohibitiog promotions in staff corps ; a continuance of the work upon the coast defenses ; the repeal ct the seventh section of the act of July 13, 1866, taking from engineers and soldiers the per diem granted to o'.Ikt troops; a limitation of time for presentation of subsistence ot sup plies, under an act or July 4th, 1864, snd a modification in the mode of the selection of calets for the military academy, in order to enhance the use- lirlsess of the academy, fthicu is im paired by reason of the large amount of time necessarily expended in eiv- iag new cadets a thorough knowledge cf the more elementary branches of learning which they should acquire betore entering tho academy; also, an appropriation for philosophical appa ratus, and increase ia the number and pay of tha Military Academy band. Tac attention ot Congress will be calicd during the present session to various enterprises for tho more cer tain and cheaper transportation of tho constantly increasing surplus of tbc western and southern products to the Aii'-.aiic seatxr.aru. 1 he subject is one that will force it&elf upon the legisla tive branch of the government soor.cr or later, and I suggest, therefore, that immediate steps be taken to cain all available information to in3uro equit able and ju3t legislation on a route to connect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charleston, South Car olina, aad Savannah, Georgia, by wa ter, by the way ot the Ohio and Ten nessee rivers and canals and slack water navigation to tbc Savannah and O&cmulgce rivers has been surveyed a:id a report made- by an accomplish ed engineer officer of the army. Sec- ord and third new routes will be pro pose;! for the consideration of Con gress, namely : by aa extension of the Kanawha and James river canal to the Ohio, and by an extent-ion of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I am not prepared to recommend government aid to these or other enterprises until it is clearly shown that .they are not only of national interest, but that whea completed they will be of value commensurate with their cost. That production increases moie rapidly than the means of transportation in onr country hs been demonstrated by past experience ; that unpreceden ted growth in population and pro ducts of the whole country will re quire additional facilities and cheaper means for the more bulky articles of commerce to reach tide water, and a market will be demanded in the near future is equally demonstrable. I would therefore suggest either a committee or commission be author! zed to consider this whole question and to report to Congress at some fu ture day for its better guidance in leg islating on the important subject. The railroads of the country have been rapidly extended during the last few years to meet the growing de mandi of producers and re flee much credit upon the capitalists and mana gers engaged ia their contraction. In addition to these, a project to facil itato commerce by the building of a sui canal around IS iagara t alls, an tated for many years, will no doubt be caiieu 10 yonr attention this ee3sion. Looking to the great future of the country, the increasing demands of commerce, it might be well while on this subject not only to have it exam lacd, ana report upon the various practicable routes for connecting the Mississippi with the Atlantic, but the feasibility of an almost land-locSed navigation from Maine to the Golf of Mexico. Such a route along ourcoast weald be of great value at all times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war. Nature has pjevided the greater part ot this route and the ob etacles to be overcome are easily within the skill of the engineers. I have not alluded to this subject with the view of having any further expen ditures of public money at this time then msy be necessary to procure and place all the necessary information before (Joi gress in an authentic form, to enable it hereifter, if deemed prac ticable and worthy, to legislate on the subject without delay. Tae report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith accompanying, ex plains fully the condition of that branch of the public service.its wants and deficiencies, expenses incurred daring the past year, and appropria tions for the same. It also gives a complete history of the services of the Navy for the pa&t year, in addi tion ita regular services. It is evident that unless steps are ukento preserve our navy, that in a very few 3 ears the United States will be the weakest na tion upon the ocean of all the great powers. With an energetic, progress ive, business people, like ours, pene-1 trating and forming business relations with every part ot the known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect cf our dig abroad is necessa ry for the full protection of their rights. I recommend a careful con sideration by Congress of the recom mendations made by the Secretary ol the Navy. 

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General furnishes a fall and satisfactory exhibit of the opera tions of the Postcfllce Department during the year. The ordinuy revenue of the department for the Cecal year, endinz Jme 30, 1372, amounted to 21,915 426 37, and the expenditures to 826.658,192 21. Compared with the orevioai fiscal year the increase of revenue wu 9 1,0 1 0.00 j no oth. at - At O O nnt A- g rt . Der cent., and the increase of ex pen ditures 2,268,088.23, or 9 20 per cent Adding to the ordinary revenue the annual appreciation ot 700,000 for free-matter, and the amounts paid I !t. lie sab3idies on mail steamship i:ne3 from special appropriations, the deficiency paid cnt of the general Treasury was 83,317,765.943 excess of 3,359,707.28 over the deficiency or the year 1S71. Other interesting statistical information relating to oar rapidly extending postal service is furr 13 ed in this report. The total leng'h of railroad msil routes on the 30th of June, 1372, w&s 57,911 miles, 8,077 additioa-d niilC3 cf such service having liken j.ut into operation during the year. Eight new lines of railway J pos. cilices have been ctab:ished,wiih an aggregate length 01 2,909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the maiU with foreign countries was 24.362,500, an inercsse of 4,066,503, cr twenty ptr cest. over tho number in 181, and the postage thereon amocn's to 81,871,257,25. The total wtight of the mails exciunged with European countrios excetde-1 820 tons. The cost of the Lmtcd Stales iracs Atlantic mail steamship service was 822,030,170. The tot a! cost o! the United States ocean eteamehip ssrvice, including the t mount 3 paid to the subsidized Imps of mail steam ers, was 10,2702,097. The following arc the only steamship lines now re ceiving tubaidks for mail service un der special acts of Congress : The Pacific Mail Steamship Company re ceive 500.000 per annum, for carry ing a monthly mail between San Francisco, Japan and China, which will be increased to 1,000,000 per annum for a eemi-monthly mail, on and alter Oct. 1, 1873. The United Stales and Brazil Mail Steamship Company receive 8150,000 per year for carrying a monthly mail between tween New Vork and Rio de Janeiro, Brszil, and the California, Oregon and Mexicc S'eaiusUip Company re ceive 75.000 er annum for carrying a n..; t.'-,.y mil between San Francis co ai.-: Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, making the total amount of mail steamship subsidies at present 8725, 000 per annum. Oar postal commu nications with all parts of the civili zed world have been placed upon a most advantageous tooting by the improved postal conven'jons,and the arrangements recently concluded with the leading commercial countries of Europe and America. The gratifying statement is made that, with the conclusion of a satisfactory conven- vention with France, the details of which L-vc b.cn definitely agreed to by the head of the French postal department, subject to tho approval of the Minister of Finance, little re mains to be accomplished by the treaty for some time to come, in respect to the reduction of rates for improved facilities for postal inter course. Your favorable consideration is respectfully invited to tho recom mendations made by the Postmaster General for an increase of service from monthlv to semi-monthly trips on the mail steamship route to Brszil; for a subsidy inside of the establish ment ot an American line of mail stc-Hmers between San Francisco.New Zaaland and Australia : for the estab mcnt of pest efflces, savings banks, and for the increase of the salaries of heads of bureaus. I have heretofore recommended the abolition of the franking privi lege, and see no reason now for changing my views on that subject. It not having been favorably regard ed by uongress, however, 1 now suggest a modification of that privl ledge to correct its glaring and costly abuses I would recommend also the appointment of a committee or commission to take into considera tion the ben method, equitable to private corporations, who have in vested their timo and capital in the establishment of telegraph lines, ot acquiring tbc title to all telegraph hues now in operation and of con necting this service wi h the postal service of the nation. It is not proba ble that this subject could receive the proper consideration during the limits of a short session of Congress, bat it msy be fair to the government and to private parlies concerned There are tut three Ibes of ocean steamers, nam el ; The Pacific mail ctesmship company, between San Francisco, China and Japan, with provision made for semi-monthly service after October 1st, 1873 ; the United States and Brazil line, month ly, and the California, New Zealand and Australian line, monthly, plying between the United States and for eign ports, and owned and operated under onr flag. I earnestly recom mend that such liberal contracts for carrying the mails be authorized with these lines as will insure their continuance If the expediency cf extending the aid of the government to lines of steamers which hitherto have not received It should be deemed worthy of the consideration ct Con grees, political and commercial ob jects make it advisable to bestow such aid on a line under oar nag between Panama and the western South American ports. By this means much trade now diverted to other countries might be brought to us, to the mutual advantage of this coun'ry and those lying in that quarter of the continent of America. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an alarming fall ing off in onr carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years, and even for the past year. I do not believe that publie treasures can be better ex pended in the interests of the whole people than in trying to recover this trade. An expenditure of 5,000, 000 per annum for the next five years, if it would restore to ns oar propor tion of the canying trade of the world would be profitably expended. The price of labor in Europe has so much enhanced within the last few years that the cost of building and operating ocean steamers in the United States is not so much greater, that I believe the time bus arrived for Congress to take this subject into senons consideration. The disbursements through the Department of Justice will be fur nished by the report ot the Attorney General, and though these have been somewhat increased by the recent act of Congress tj enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of of the Union, and to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and other amendments thereto, I cannot question the necessity and salutary effects of these enactments. Reck less and lawless men, I regret to say, have associated themselves together in some localities to deprive other citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution cf the Unit edStates, and to that end have com n.itted deeds of violence, bat the prosecution and punishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the repression of inch disorders. I do not doubt that a prrest majority of the people in all parts ot the coun try favor the full enjoyment by all classes of persons of these rights, to which they are entitled under the Constitution and the laws, and I in voke the aid and ind ience of all good citizens to prevent organizations whose objects are by unlawful means to interfere with those rights. I look with confidence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combinations prohibited by the set referred to, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or inflict punishment to protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations. Ap plications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted of a viola tion of said acts unon the ground that clemency in such cases would tend to tranquiliz ; the public mind, and to test the virtue ol that policy am disposed, aa far as my sense of justice will permit, to give to these applications a favorable considera tion ; but any action thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in my determination to en forcewith rigor each act, o long aa the conspiracies acd ccmbi&aiions tLereia named disturb lie peace ot the ccuntrv. It is much to be re gretted, and is regre led by no one ! more than reyse.i, that a necessity has ever existed to execute the en forcemeat act. No one can desire more than I that the necessity of ap plying it my nevex agiia be demanded. 

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR The Secretary of the Icteuor le ports satisfactory improvement and progression in each of the several bureaus under the control of tne in terior Department. Tney are a.l in excellent condition The work, which in some o: thrm tor some years has been ia arrears, ha ' een brongiit down to a recent elate, and ia ad the current bu-iincts Las leea promptly f'.ispatched. THE INDIANS Tue poiicy which was adopted at the beginning ot the administration w itii regard to the management or the Indiao3 has been as successful as its most ardent friends anticipated. Wit i-n sj short a time it has reduced the expense of their management, decreased their forays on the white settlements, tended to give the largest opportunity to the extension of the great railways through the public domain, and the pushing of settlements in more remote districts of the country and at the same time improved Ihe condition of the Indians. The policy wi;l ba maintained with out any change, except ns: such as further experience may snow to be necessary to lender it more eiilcient. The subject of converting the so called Indian Territory, south of Kansas, into a borne for the Indians, and erecting thereon a territorial form of government, is one of great impor tance as a complemnk of th e-xisU ing Indian policy. The question of removal to the territory has within the past year been presented to many oi the tribes resident upon other and less desirable portions of the public domain, and has generally been re ceived by them with favor. As a preliminary step to the organization of such a territory, it will be neces sary to confine the Indians now resi dent therein to farms of proper size, which should be secured to them in fee ; the residue to be used for the settlement of other friendly Indians, Efforts will be made in the immedi ate future to induce tho removal ot as many peaceably disposed In dians only to the Indian territory as can be settled properly without dis turbing tho harmony of those already there. There is no other location available where a people who are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits can be as well accommodated si upon the unoccupied laods in the Indian territory. A territorial government should, however, protect the Indians from the Inroads of whites for a term of years, until they become snfllciently advanced in the arts of civilization to guard their own rights, and from the disposal ot lands held by them for the same period. 

SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS. During ta6 last fiscal year there were disposed of out ot the public lands 11,864,975 acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres than was disposed ot the previous year. Of this axount 1.370,320 acres were sold ior cash, 889,460 acres located with military warrants, 4,671,332 acres taken for homesteads, 692,- 130 acres locited with college scrip, 3,554.887 acres granted to railroads, 465.347 acres granted to wagon roads. 714.255 acres given to states as swamp land, and 5,160 acres lo cated by Indian scrip. The cash receipts from all sources in the land office amounted to 13, 218,100. During the same period 22,016,608 acres of the public lands were surveyed, which, added to the qnantity before surveyed, amounts to 583,364,780 acres, leaving 1,257, 633,628 acres of the pnblic land yet nnsurveyed. Ihe reports from tne subordinates of the Land Office con tain interesting information in regard to their respective districts. They uniformly mention the fxaitfnlness cf the soil daring the past season, and the increased yield ot all kinds of produce evince in those states and territories where mining is the principal business, the agricultural product to have exceeded the local demand, and liberal shipments have been made to distant pciats. PATENTS. During the year ending September 30, 1S72, there were issued horn the patent office J 3,62b patents, ex tensions, and 56 certificates and reg isters of trade marks. During the same time I'J.osi applications icr patents, including reissues and de signs have been received, and 3,100 caveats hied, ihe lees received daring the same period amounted to $70,095,986, and the total expendi tures to 862,355,390, making the net receipts over the expenditures $7, 740,056. Since 1836, two hundred thousand applications for patents have been filed, and about 134,000 patents issued, the offices being con ducted under the same laws and gen eral organization as were adopted at their original inauguration, when only from one hundred to five hand red applications were made per an num. The Commissioner shows that the office has outgrown the original plan, and that a new organization has become necessary. This subject was presented to uocgresg in a spe cial commuaication in February last, which met my approval and the ap proval of the Secretary of the In ten or. and the suggestions contain ed in said communication were em braced in a bill that was reported to the House by the Committee on Pat ents at the last session. The subject of the reorganization of the Patent office, as contemplated by the bill re ferred to, is one of such importance to the industrial interests of the coun try that I commend it to the atten tion of Congress. The commissioner also treats the subject of the separa tion of the Patent effice from the Department ot the Interior. Thi subject U also embraced in the bill heretofore referred to. Tho com missioner complains of the want of room for the model gallery and for the working force and necessary files of the office. It U impossible to transact the business of the ilBce properly without more loom in which to arrange files and drawings that must be consulted hourly in the transaction of businees. The whole of the Patent Office building will soon be needed, if it is not already, for the accommodation of the busi ness of the Patent Office- to it. of by PENSIONS. The amount paid for pensions in the last fiscal year was $30,169,310, an amount larger by 13, 08,434 than wss paid during the preceding yea Of this amount $2,313,409 was paid under the act of Congress of Feb ruary li, i3l,to the survivors of the war of 1812. The annual increase of pensions by the legislation ot Con greas has more than kept pace with the natural yearly losses from the rolls. The act of Congress cf June 8, 1872, has added an estimated amount of $750,C0D per annum to the rolls, without increasing tlw number or pensioners. We cannot,inererore, look for any anb3tantil decrease in the expenditures of this department for some time to come, or ao iudS Congress continues o ro cuauge the "rates of pension. The whole number ol soldiers enusieu in me war of the rebellion was 2,688,523. The total number of claims for inva lid peosion is 176,090, being but six per cent of the whole number of en listed men. The total number of claims on hand at the beginning of the year was 91,669 ; the rumrr j ceived during the year wk, 2o;571; the number disposed of was 35,178 ty of I The ry the one PR3PARJNG FOR Connell's Book Store!

Oa the 30lh of June, 1872, there were on the rolls tha names of 9o,405 invalid military pensioners, 113,513 widows, orphans and de pendent relatives, making an aggre gate of 209,023 army pensioners. At tie same tune there were on the rolls the names of 1,44'J navy pensioners, and 1,730 widows, orphans and de pendent relatives, making the whole Dumber of naval pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage ot the act to provide pen sions lor ihe survivors ot the war of 1812, 36,551 applications prior to Jane 30, 1872. Of these there were 1 lowen (inrinir mo mat ikm vpir. "(l l-r. ri.ln..- .isk oaring tne year, leaving 11,530 claims pending at that date.

It is thought that the claims ior pen sions on account of the war of 1812 will be disposed cf by the 1st of May 1S73. It is estimated that $30,430, 000 will be required for the pension service during the next fiscal year. 1 THE CENSUS. The nirth census is about com pleted. Its completion is a subject of congratulatiou, inasmuch rs the use to be made of the statistics there in coctaiccd depends very greatly on the promptitude of publication. ine secretary oi iae interior rec- commends that a census be tkken in 1875. which recommendation fchould receive the ready a-.tenlion ot Con-'thrr The interval at present es-jgelher tablished between the federal cenrus 13 bo lorj; that the information r b-! tamed at tiio lieiecinial periods as tho material condition, wants, and condition, wants, snd resources of the nation is of little practical value after the expiration ot the first hali of that period. It would probably obviate the consti tutional provision regarding the de cennial census, if a census tsken in 1875 should be divested of all politic al character and no reapportionment ct Congressional representation be made under it Such a census, com ing ss it would in the last year of the fiist century of our n&tfoord exis tence, would furnish a noble monu ment of the progress of the United States during that century. 

EDUCATION. Tue rapidly increasing interest in t ducation is a most encouraging fea ture in the current history ot the country, and it is no doubt true that this is due in a great measure to the effects of the Bureau of Elucation Tbat office i3 continaally receiving evidences wbica aDuoilantly prove its eilicier.cy, from the various in stitutions of learning and educators of all kinds throughout the country. The 1 eport of the commiesioner con tains a vast amouut of educational details oi great interest. The bill now pending betore Congress provid ing for the appropriation ofpart of the proceeds of the talcs of public lands lor educational purposes, to aid the states in the general educxtiou ct their rising generation, is a measure of such great importance to our real progress, and is so unanimously ap. proved by the leading friends of education, that I commend it tha fa vorable attention of Congress. TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS. Affairs in the territories are gener ally satisfactory. The energy and business capacity of the pioneers who are fettling up the vast domains not yet incorporated into states, are keeping pace in internal improve ments aad civil government with the older communities. In butone of them, Utah, is the condition of affairs un satisfactory. Except so far as thei quiet of tbe citizens may be disturbed by real or imaginary danger of In dian hostilities, it has seamed to be the policy of the Legislature of Utah evade all responsibility to tbe gov eminent of the United States, and even to bold a position in hostility to I recommend a careful revision the present laws of the Territory Congress, and the enactment of such a law, as the one proposed in vougrew Bk ljm 1BSi session, ior in stance, or something similar to it. as win secure peace, tbe equality of all citizens beiore tbe law, and tha nlli mate ex'.inguisliment ot polygamy. isince the establishment of a terri torial government fcr the District of Co.noibia, the improvement of the condition of the city of Washington and surrounding, and the increased prosperity of the citizens, are. observ able to the most casual visitor. The nation, being a large owner of pro:er in tuis city, should bear with the citizens cf the District a just (bare the expense of these improvements. recommend, therefore, as appro priation to reimburse the citizen the work done by them along and in front of public ground dur ing tbe past 3 ear, and liberal appro priations, in order that the improve ments and embellishment of the pubMc buildings acd grounds may keep pace with tbe improvements made by 'he territorial authorities.
