Among -many voters In the recent campaign, some fear was entertained over possible evil consequences of a so-called centralization of power in the 'federal government. Some were of the opinion that "centralization" meant a robbery of local government, corruption, class discrimination, decay. The question was argued during the campaign, but there are many yet who entertain some fear of i. "centralization of power" In our government. In his last annual message to Congress. President Roosevelt devoted an interesting lJWa>?ruji n lu cuts i|u?nw* ui w;utrallzatlon. pointing out that not more power. Is wanted or needed, but ;? tbe means of adequately using already existing power in the proper. .... channels, and this distinction should be carefully considered by those to g whom the question does not seem ?" quite clear. i* Alter enumerating the measures deemed "by him to be vitally necesKw sary for the federal regulation of interstate corporations. President Roosevelt states: "To accomplish this, means of course a certain Increase in the use , or?not the creation of?power, by the Central Government. The power already exists; It does not have to be created: the only question Is whether it shall he used or left Idle ?and meanwhile the corporations over which the power .ought to be exefclsed will not remain ldlo. Let those 'Who abject to this Increase in the use of the only power available, the national power. l>e frank, and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the great business corporations and to exercise supervision over the accumulation and distribution of wealth, for such supervision and control can oniy come inrougn mis puruuuiai kind of increase of power. We no more believe in that empiricism which demands absolutely unrestrained individualism than we do* in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism which would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the country with a com- , pjetoness that not oven an unrestrain- ' ed individualism itself could achieve. The dapger to American -democracy lies not In the least in the concen- , trutfon of administrative power in responsible and accountable hands. It lies in having the power insuflie- , icutly concentrated, so that no one can he held responsible to the people for its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through many administrators. many legislators, many men who work behind and through legislators 'and administrators, is Impalpable, is unseen, is irresponsible, can not 1>e reached, can not be held to account. Democracy is In peril wherever the administration of political power Is scattered among a yarlety of men who work In secret, wfioon vorv namoB oro nnlf nnwn to the common people. It is not in peril from any man who derives authority from the people, who exercises it in sight of the people, and who Is from time to time compelled to give an account of its exercise to the people.'* Forest Kin* lA*mn* in Ctate. "The unprecedented destruction this season :by forest flrjjs in West Virginia has called the attention of the people, as never before, to the necessity of better protection to woods and watersheds." says Hu Maxwell. chairman of the West Virginia Conservation Commission.

The amount which county treaBurles and companies are reported to- have spent to suppress fires was only 3046; lndl- t viduals and companies are reported t to have apent about 389.000. i "The injury to the soil from fire t was much more severe this season In g West Virginia than ever 'before, not alone because the burned area was larger than in any former year, hut also for the reason that excessive r dryness exposed the humus to a n greater depth. Ground fires have li rbeen unusual heretofore In this State, lmt this season they were common and . widespread. Two human . lives were lost In the fires. t "The mountain people fought fires o In tho naaf a-hpn thpv fnnsrht at- all.

Fires crossed the lanes s by burning the tfiumus beneath the I surface, and then started up on the a farther side. The fires burned so b deeply Ln the humus that an <un.usual ti phenomenon was presented when a tl snow fall came early in November. The snow apparently extinguished the fires, but It went away quickly under the influence of a strong, dry ? wind, and the fires came up and out V of the -ground and were soon spread- o ing again, il saw an interesting ex- ? ample of -this. In the morning the ti snow in the <woods was two inches ? deep, and no fire was to be seen, b Before sunset'the snow was gone and ? the leaves were burning. P "Large tracts of land on the high si mountains were denuded of soil n doWn to the rocks. Over much of s; the area where the Pottsville con- ^ glomerate is the surface formation, w there never was much mineral soil, c Beds of 'moss, lichen, leaves, and de- ft caying wood formed a covering for tl the rocks which gave anchorage to ii the roots of the forest trees. Over extensive tracts, soils of that kind were absolutely destroj'ed." fSm y Congressman Bartholdt. of Mis- a souri, proposes the placing of a a fn nlff rtf flvo nontc o iinnnrl nn U coffee in order to vciake up the deficit in the national revenue caused by the prohibition wave that is sweeping* over the country.
