CURRENCY REFORM THE CHIEF QUESTION a a Made to S the Nationa Treaanr A N a a a N Iloml I ii Note Circu a on a Other it Washington, Dec 8. Th annual report of the secretary of the treasury, sent to congress Tuesday, shows that the total receipts fbr the year ended Jun 30,1897, were $430,378,107, and the expenditures $44S,439,622, leaving a de ficit of $18,052,454. The receipts of the Th Cnrrency 1 ear, however, exceeded those forth 3 ear 1896 by $20,911,759. The customs, it is shown, yielded $176,554,126, and internal levenu sources $146,088,574. A compared with 3S06 this is an increase in the customs of $10,532,374 and internal ievenu» $4,342,721. Secretary Gage calls attention to what he terms "the menace to the public credit oc casioned by the continued use of the large volume of demand liabilities, represented by the legal tender notes," and says that the enormous depreciation in the commer cial value of silver as compared with gold has greatly increased the financial respon sibilities of the government in its demand liabilities, and all the logical consequences of the fact should be boldly faced. The advantages of a strong position In the national treasury, with its accompany ing benefits to all commercial interests and great reinforcement to the public credit, can, I believe, be secured without any unsettling legislation in a manner easy to be comprehended by all and with small cost to the people. The recommendations I make must be construed as tentative st^ps in a direction which, if consistently pin sued, will ulti mately lead to conditions theoretically desirable lather than as being in them selves final measures to that end The con dition of the treasury in its relation to de mand obligations requires that one of two steps be taken. The one may be a large re inforcement of the permanent gold re serve the other may be by an important reduction tn the objectionable foim of lia bilities. The latter is. in my opinion, the more desirable a First. I recommend that proper legisla tion be enacted which will establish, sep arate and apart from the ordinary opera tions of the treasury as they relate to rev enue and expenditures, a department to be designated and Known as the issue and re demption division. To this division the sum of $125,000,000 in gold should be set over from the general fund in the treasury, to be used only for redemption purposes, and all the silver dollais now held for re demption of silver certificates, and all the silver bullion and dollars coined therefrom, bought under the act of 1890, should be passed to the same account. Further, that the sum of $200,000,000 in the legal tei.der notes of the United States known as -een backs be collected as hereinafter descubed and deposited in the said issue and re demption division, to be disbursed there from only upon the receipt in exchange therefor of an equivalent amount of gold coin. Such gold, when so secured, to be held in said division as pai of the general redemption fund. Second. 1 recommend that provision be made for the issue of refunding loan bonds, payable after ten years at the pleasure of the government, such bonds to bear in terest at the rate of 2% per cent, per an num, payable, principal and Interest, In gold coin: and that the secretaiy of the treasury be authorized to issue such bonds and receive in payment therefor, with an equitable allowance for the diffeience in interest, and part or all of the outstanding oans of the United States which mature by their terms of payment in the years 1904 1907 and 1925. W S Onr Credit. The advantage involved in the proposed action lies in this: It removes an am biguity from our contract obligations—an ambiguity which affects unfavorably the government credit. The word "coin," now used to express the obligation in the public debt, is an ambiguous word It is no doubt understood by the more discriminating public creditor to mean gold coin, and the solemn act of congress pledging the main tenance of silver coin upon a pailty with gold coin makes it impossible to construe the word "coin." as therein used. to mean anything other than gold or its full equivalent. Yet as this is a conclusion of logic rather than a clear statement of fact, the simpler or more humble investors or would-be Investors In the public debt are confused and doubtful, and the public cred it is the weaker therefor To refund our outstanding bonds now payable in coin into bonds payable to gold would strengthen and confirm the public red it and put tie In a position to command the markets of the world for our securities on the most advantageous terms. a Note Circulation To accomplish.the objects.heiejn sug gested without contracting the circulation some other form of paper money must he allowed to (111 the vacuum which would oth erwise be occasioned. The national bank note now familiar to our people Is the readiest and most practical agent to ac complish that object, and under reason able,, conditions it will be found responsive to the call The complaint uttered against tho national bank act as It now stands is not directed toward the method of bank organization or the absolute safety guar anteed to the noteholder It Is directed toward those restrictions It embodies, which result in Its failure to accomplish the full benefit it ought to cany The re quirement of the law now makes it impos sible to organize a bank with a capital of less than SWI.OOO. no matter how small the place. In which It Is to be located or how restricted the volume or business there to be transacted. Because of that, with the added expense of taxation.) both national andjocal. many communities are deprived of the aid of banks of issue and burdened with onerous rates of exchange and inter est charges. In order to obviate to as great an extent as possible those objections and make the act more harmonious with proper business conditions I recommend that It be amended in the following particulars: First. Permit national banks to be or ganized with a minimum capital of $25,000 In any place having a population of 2.000 Inhabitants or less. Second. Reduce the rate of taxation on circulating notes secured by deposit of bonds to one-half of one percent per an num. Third. Permit banks no organized or hereafter organized to issue circulating notes to the par value of the refunding bonds hereinbefore suggested, when de posited with the treasurer of the United States and, further, allow such banks as shall avail themselves of the opportunity to deposit with the treasury of the United* 000.000, against which there shall at once be issued to them by the comptroller of the currency national bank notes to an equal amount, it being further provided that from time to time, at his convenience, the secretary of the treasury shall sub- Bt'tUte •v A 7 for the greenbacks, treasury notes *HE!*W»SnraB: and character as the refunding bonds first named to the amount of $200,060,000, such bond* to be chargeable to sffHLbanks and by them accounted Jfer-'at such price (not Jess than par) as, the market* quotations may indicate to be their flir market value. During Uhe perlo^ of time intervening be tween sthe deposit of greenbacks, treas ury notes and IjUver certificates and the substitution'of the bonds by the secretary of the treasury the circulating notes spe cifically issued therefor shall be exempt from taxation. Upon such substitution of bonds the funds released thereby shall at once be transferred by the secretary of the treasury to the Issue and redemption division. Fourth. After said banks have deposited such bonds, greenbacks, treasury notes or silyer certificates to the amount of 50 per cent, of their capital they shall be permit ted to issue bank notes In addition^© the O per cent? thus" provided to the^extent of 25 per cent, of such deposft. which said 25 per cent, may be unsecured by any di rect pledge of security, but issued against the assets of the bank. Fifth Extend the guaranty of payment bv the government to all circulating notes of the bank, whether issued against de posited security or against assets. Sixth To secure the goverrraent against loss, if any. attaching to its guaranty a tax of two per cent, per annum on unse cured circulation shall be levied to create a safety fund, which fund shall be Invested by the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller of the currency in government bonds. In addition to such funds the gov ernment shall be further protected by hav ing a first lien upon all assets in case of failure of the Issuing bank. Seventh. All notes shall be* redeemed in the city of Ne Yoik at the subtreaaury and at such other subtreasurles,as may he. designated by the comptroller of the cur rency, with the approval of the secretary of the treasury. The control of such re demption shall be under the direction of the comptroller of the currency and made from a redemption fund of ten per cent., to be provided and maintained by the banks Eighth Restrict the issue of national bank notes to the denomination of ten dol lars and upward. a A ram men A a The important nature of the subject un der discussion tempts to a fuller treatment. I must, however, be content with referring once more to that feature of this series of recommendations which touches the ques tion of note issues by national banks. I am moved to press the recommendation as submitted, in view of the following consid erations: Paper money is the product of an indus trial, commercial and financial evolution. Its economizing effect in the use of me tallic money precludes the idea of its aban donment until society shall relapse into anarchy. Credit Is the base upon which it rests. Paper money Is the evidence that a thing of value has passed into the pos session of the issuer, and that the holder of that paper Is willing to await payment. When payment is made the evidence of the transaction should be withdrawn, to ap pear again only when a similar ti ansae non occurs. The bank is an agency, the result also of a pure evolutionary movement, whose function it is to issue Its various forms of credit instruments, of which paper money is one. against the pledges and promises to It of the less publicly known members of the industrial community. It thus be comes an intermediary lnvinuch thelaiger part of all trade and industry. Whatever operates to render the bank a safe, ef ficient and available agency to the people operates to the general prosperity. 'A Problem The problem is a twofold one. How to withdraw the specific form of security now provided, since it will ultimately disappear how to provide a substitution which will be recognized by the people as adequate se curity, and which will at the same time allow to banks within well-guarded limits the most useful freedom in their note is sues. The problem is too large, its results too far-reaching, to be solved offhand oi by expert dictum. Its solution must be gradually reached by the path of safe ex periment. To allow national banks to issue circulating notes equal to 25 per cent. ojf their capital upon a payment of two pe?* cent, per annum as an insurance or safety fund upon amounts so issued is, if the dem onstration drawn from the comptroller's office can be trusted, a proposition well within the limits of safety. Nevertheless, whatever risk there is should be assumed by the government, obnoxious as it may be to the general principles of'governmental action. It is by such action that the situ ation as it exists has been evolved. Upon the government, therefore, rests the duty of seeing it properly solved. Some years of experience aiong the line suggested will prove what is an adequate tax for the se curity of noteholders and will allow such amendments as time will justify, involving as one of its features a complete with drawal of the government's guaranty from bank note issues W E a is a Colony Gaheston, Dec 10.—Gen.

Eckels, comptroller ofi the currency, for the year ended October J*. 1S97. opens with a brief review of the his tory of the legislation which constitutes the present national bank act and Invites the attention of congress to amendments to the law recommended In former reports without specifically repeating them. Han Note Circulation On the subject of bank note circulation the comptroller says: "It Is noticeable that In all the changes whl^h have been wrought In the national currency act from its Incep tlon to the present time the feature subject to criticism, but which was intended should constitute the principal beneiit to be con ferred, has remained comparatively un changed, namely, the note-issuing func tion Whatever justification there was n. the first instance for restricting the issu ing of notes against the bonds of the gov ernment, deposited with the treasurer of the United States to 80 per cent, of the par value thereof, long since ceased, in tie report of every comptroller of the cur lency during the past 20 years the wisdom of changing the existing law so that the banks, and through them the communi ties in which located, might have the ad ditional benefit of an added loanable capi tal has been urged*. Despite all this the law still remains without amendment. No only should the bank act be amended in this particular, but congr-ss should se riously consider such a change in the od of bank note Issues as will enable the banks of the country to more adequate'y meet the demands of trade and commerce in all sections of the country. The busi ness of banking, like every other form of investment, must be made attractive to capital. If it is placed upon a footing: different from other undertakings, embar rassed through unnecessary restrictions and deprived of proper souices of -oflt. the result cannot be otheiwise ban that investable capital will seek other means of emplovment, and to such an extent deprive the people of the benehtSj*of the agency most requisite to commercial activity. W a lie a "It has been seriously suggested more than once that the bank note issues be done away with and all naner be issued by the government ins-.au. The danger or such a course Is not to be overestimated, A he experience of every government has Leer, that governmental cunency paper is a source of weakness and danger. In the United States, where there has been the nearest approach to success, with the vol ume of the federal paper comparatively limited in amount, the ciedit of the gov ernment has been more than once put in jeopardy through it and the business in terests of the countrj subjected to unnec essary loss and confusion. Growt of Nationa a in System The total number of national banks or ganized since the svstem was put into op eration in 1863 is shown to have been 5,09*". On October 31 last there were in active op eration 3,617, having an authorized capital of $630,230,295. The total outstanding cir culation of the banks then in operation was $229,199.^80. of which $202,994,555 was secure.' by bonds of the United States and the bal ance t)y lawful money deposited with the treasurer of the United States. The totai circulation outstanding of all national banks on October 31 last was $230,131,005. ot which amount $1,558,800 was secured by bonds held for account of insolvent and liquidating banks and $26,205,325 by lawful money deposited for their account and by active banks reducing circulation.
