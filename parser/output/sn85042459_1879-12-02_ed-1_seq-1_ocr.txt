WASHINGTON, Nov. £9.—lt is learned that the President's mes sage has been purchased from par ties uuknown, and will undoubted ly be printed to-morrow morning. A representative of tlie Associated Tress waited ou President Hayes this evening aud asked, in view of tliis fact, for authority to send it to ail points. Tho President, while regretting that such publication was threatened, said that his duty in the mater was clear, and that bis annual messages were addressed to Congress aud he could not under any circumstances countenance a course which contemplated their prematura publication. A Heartless Frnlrlcltle. Pokti.and, Me., November 30.— James M. Lowe, arrested for tlie murder of his brother, Joseph A. Lowe, on the 27th of September, was arraigned yesterday afternoon and pleaded guilty. He was re manded to await tlie aotiou of the Qraud Jury in Jauuary, and his wifo was held as a witness and committed iv default of $1,000 ball. Lowe last night confessed that about 3 o'clock on the morning of the murder he hid behiud a bam door, aDd when his brother went in lie struck him with an ax, felling liiiu to the ground. The blow, however, did not extiuguflh the brother's lantern, and by its light he struck a second blow, nearly severing the hoad from tbe body. He then put out the light and walked back to Portland, reaching there at 4:30. The trouble between the brothers was occasioned by what was believed to be an unjust discrimination by the father in re gard to property. Tlie Irlali AKMnllou liiOr<>i>»lii«\ New York, Nov. 30.—A cable dispatch from Dublin to the Herald says: Tho flame of agitation is again burning brightly. Meetings are to be held to-day iv all parts of Ireland and Euglaud. A great seu eation has beeu caused in Ireland by Gladstone's reference to the Irish Church. "Down to the year 1868," says the ex-Premlor, "and the dissolution of that year, the whole question of tbe Irish Church was dead. Nobody cared for it. Nobody paid attention to it. In England circumstances oocured whicli drew the attention of tbe people to the Irish Church. I had lv 1885 said that I believed It was out of the range of practical politics. Now it came to this, that a jail ln the heart of the metropolis was broken open under circum stances which drew the attention of the English people to the state of Ireland, and when in Manchester a policeman was murdered In the ex ecution of his duty, at once the whole country became alive to the 

QUESTION OF THE IRISH CHURCH. It came within the range of practi cal politics, and tlio Irish Church Act followed." The natural infer ence among the opponents of land lordism iv Ireland is that if the blowing up of one jail and the mur dering of a solitary policeman brought about the passing of a Church Act, perhaps the blowing up of two jails and the killing of a few landlords would pass a land Act. At all events, the agi tators feel greatly encouraged by Mr. Gladstone's language. I understand from tho leaders of the agitation that they Intend to carry the movement Into Kugland, where many large meet ings have already been organized. Parneli himself will speak at Liv erpool and Davitt at Newcastle-on- Tyne to-day (Sunday). The next 'hree or four weeks will prob ably witness a great development of the agitation. More organiza tions exist lv the west of Ireland than is generally believed. I was informed last night by a gentleman in a position to know, that SECRET, ORGANIZED DRILLING Is going on constantly there. It is now stated that Parneli will proba bly not go to America in conse quence of the arrests and comiug trials. There was n torchlight procession composed of 4000 persons at Kil rush, county of Clare (Ireland), last night, which was witnessed by an immense crowd, who cheered for tho prisoners and O'Donovan Rossa. A great demonstration by unem ployed laborers has taken place at Jtiallena, county of Mayo. Daly, the agitator, has arrived at Castlebar, county of Mayo, aud was received with great enthusi asm.

Madrid, Nov. 30. —King Alfonso and his, Queen, Mario Christine, drove through the city proceeded by a briiliaut cortege. The Queen made a most favorable imprassion aud was enthusiastically greeted by the populace. Last night there were illuminations in honor of the marriage. To-day King Alfonso will present his bride to the Em bassadors and authorities. Ex- Queen Isabella will also hold a re ception. Late Telegrams. A candidate for teacher was caught copying answers to ques tions from her sleeve-cuffs. She said she got the answers from Sac ramento. The Flxamlning Board at once called in tbe questions and framed a new set. Last Friday night tlie Preeeott stage was stopped near Gillettee, the driver robbed aud the mails and all but one of tbe horses stolen. The only passenger in the coach was shot and stabbed, and is in a precarious condition. The Grand Opera House in To ronto was burned Saturday morn ing, and the Janitor and his wife aud daughter consumed iv the flames. Bandniann, the tragedi an, lost his entire wardrobe, valued at $25,000. Alfonso was married to the Arch duchess, Marie-Christine, ou Fri day, at Madrid. Tlio wedding was a gorgeous affair, Nine of the lifty members elected to the Loudon School Board are women. THE AGITATORS' COUNSEL. An Eccentric Genius—The Count Joannes of Ireland—His unsuccessful effort to get into Prison—The Man whoso Humors have brokon the hearts of one Mayor and two Judges. New York, Nov. 29. —A Herald cablegram from Sligo says: After watching these cases for five days, aud talking to all the principal peo ple concerned in them, I have come to the conclusion that however ill advised the arrests may have been on the score of the doubtful success of the prosecution with Irish judges, tlie effect has been magical on the leading agitators, who now revile tbe Government for unconstitu tional measures, while their own sentiments and speeches have been utterly destitute of moderation or good judgment. The prosecution, as conducted hy the officers of the Crown, lias been remarkably in dulgent; at tho Hume time it has been firm. It is said that Parneli and one or two other prominent leaders have grown somewhat jeul )us of the prominence into wnich three comparatively obscure agi tators have suddenly sprung. Two :>f tho latter are now prominently mentioned for Parliament. John Rea, the Belfast attorney, is the L'ouut Joaunes of Ireland, and ia one of the most curious characters lv the country. Ho is pugnacious and obstructive to a degree. With this he is audaciously witty. His sallies keep the audience in roars of laughter. He has beeu arrested for oontempt of Court and ejected from Belfast Court-rooms at least twenty times, and tlie more he lias beeu ejected the more violent has been his tone when again admitted. It is reliably stated that one Mayor and two Judges in Belfaßt have DIED OF BROKEN HEARTS, 111 consequence of tbe exuberance of his verbosity and the i>ertinaclty of his obstructive policy. John Rea once made his way Into the House of Commons, iuterrupted the pro ceedings, apostrophized tJ'i'Speak er, and had to be removed by ' six Sergeautß-at-Arms. His connect ion with the present case is J .c to Mr. Biggar, RI. P., who, t' nking .hat obstruction had succ ded so .veil at Westminster, might Drove a trump card at Belfast, was itruck with tlie idea that Rea would do moro to turn the pro jeedlugs into a farce than any man iv the country, whereupon he retained the services of thateccen trio gentleman and sent bim to 31igo. Wheu Mr. Parneli heard of it, be used his inlluence with Da vitt and Daly and persuaded them to deollne Ilea's services. KilleD, out of defeienco to the wishes of his friend Biggar, allowed Rea to undertake his defense. The conse quence was that Kilieu's case which has already beeu prolougei for three days, would have lasted till the end of the week but for the firmness of the magistrates, who had to send down witness after wit ness| because Rea wasted hours in asking immaterial questions and making speeches on every subject To-day they got SICK OF THE WHOLE THING. They oueoked further obstruction by summarily committing KilleD offering at the same time to accep LOS ANGELES. TUESDAY MORNING, DEC. 2. 1879. bat I, Rea came Into Court this morning with the firm intention of being committed to jail for con tempt,having with him a bag con taining prison clothes aud toilet articles. He directed X i lion to refuse to give bail and applied all sorts of epithets to the magistrates. When they ordered the Court to be cleared he told Killen not to stir. Tbe magistrate retired. Everybody was put out. Rea alone remained. Af ter a while the Inspector of Police politely Informed this legal ob structionist that be had the Court all to himself, and could dons he pleased, whereupon Rea gathered up his bag, his prison clothes and his toilet articles, and took his de parture, being terribly chagrined that be bad not been arrested.
