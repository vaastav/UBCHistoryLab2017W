GAGE’S FIRST REPORT THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY URGES NEW CURRENCY LAWS. GIVES CONGRESS ADVICE Says That Material Changes in Bank ing Methods Should Be Made and Tells How- in His Opinion These Should Be Compassed—Points Out Alleged Menaces to Public Safety. Washington, Dec 8. —Secretary Gage of the United States treasury submitted his report to congress Tues day. His treatment of the currency question was the principal subject of interest In port he said: ‘Tn their respective annual reports to congress my predecessors since the close of the civil war have called at tention with unfailing regularity to the menace to the public credit occa sioned by the continued use of the large vo'ume of demand liabilities, represented by the legal tender tiotes, and have constantly appealed for such legislative action as would remove the dangers pointed out. Although these warnings and appeals have not as yet met with the responsive action that their serious nature justifies, it is not now the part of wisdom to ignore them. In fact, as time has gone on, all the reasons upon which these warnings and appeals were based have received auditional force. The enor mous depreciation in the commercial value of silver, as compared with gold, hits greatly increased the finan cial responsibilities of the government in its demand liabilities, aud all the logical consequences of the fact should be boldly faced. “Under the act of 1878, requiring the purchase and coinage of silver, supple mented and enlarged by the so-called Sherman act of 1890, there were out standing June 30, 1897, the sum of $410,337,570 in silver dollars or cer tificates representing them. Under the act of 1890 there were also out standing $114,807,280 in treasury notes clothed with the quality of legal ten der. “In the act of Nov. 1, 1893, repealing the purchasing clause of the act of 1890, it was declared to be the policy of the United States to secure by safe guards of legislation “the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and silver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times In the mar kets and in the payment of debts.” “Conformable to the spirit of this declaration, the treasury department In all its operations has treated gold and silver coins, and the paper repre sentatives of each, as of equal dignity and value. In the collection of its rev enues, whether in the form of excise taxes or of customs duties, it has made discrimination against neither, while, upon the other hand, it has held itself ready to pay to the public creditor whichever of the two he might chooso to receive as the more uesi.ablo to him. “Even further than this, it has de clared itself ready, whenever neces sary x to the maintenance of its parity, to exchange on even terms, at the pleasure of the holder, either form of the metallic money for the other. These practical operations and declar ations were necessary, and they have operated to keep in concurrent circu lation on terms of equality the two kinds of metallic money, notwith standing the varying aud never-ceas ing disparity between the natural or commercial value of the one as com pared with the other. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that this undertak ing involves a large financial respon sibility, and requires proper and ade quate legislative provisions for its continued execution. “Considered from the standpoint of national delense the argument is rein forced. We appropriate millions to create a navy, which, through the genius of invention, may sj eedily be come obsolete and worthle.-.s. We ap propriate other millions to provide coast defenses against attacks which may never be made. Such action, timely and wise as it may be, is in consistent with a treasury condition so extended in a time of peace as to bring panic and alarm to our own peo ple before the first sound of the ene my’s guns. In modern days a well supplied war chesl with an impreg nable credit is as important as are warships, shore batteries, or regi ments of men. “lue au*uncages ot a si.ong posi tion in the national treasury, with its accompanying benefits to ad commer cial interests and great reimorcemeut of the public credit, can, 1 believe, be secured without any unsettling legis lation, in a manner easy to be compre hended Jjy all, and with small cost to the people. • The recommendations 1 make must be construed as tentative steps in a di rection which, if consistently pursued, will ultimately lead to conditions theoretically desirable rather than as being in themselves Anal measures to that end. The condition of the treas ury in its relation to demand obliga tions requires that one of two steps be taken. The one may be a large reinforcement of the permanent gold reserve, the other may be by an im portant reduction in the objectionable form of liabilities. The latter is. In my opinion, more desirable. “First—l recommend that proper legislation shall be enacted which will establish separate anfi apart from the ordinary operations of the treasury as IOWA COUNTY DEMOCRAT; MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN, DECEMBER 9, 1897. * they relate to revenue and expendi tures, a department to bo designated and known as the issue and redemp tion division. To this division the sum of $125,000,000 in gold should be set over from the general fund in the treasury, to be used only for redemp tion purposes, and all the silver dol lars now held for redemption of silver bullion and dollars coined therefrom, nought under the act of 1890, should be passed to the same account. Further, that the sum of $200,000,000 in the legal tender notes of the United States known as green backs be col lected as hereinafter described, and deposited in the said issue and re demption division, to be disbursed therefiom only upon the receipt in ex change therefor of an equivalent amount of gold coin. Such gold, when so secured, to be held in said division as part of the general redemption fund. "Second —I recommend that pro vision be made for the issue of re funding loan bonds, made payable af ter ten years at the pleasure of the government, such bonds to bear inter est at the rate of 2Vi per cent, per an num, payable, principal and interest, in gold coin; and that the secretary of the treasury be authorized to issue such bonds and receive in payment therefor, with an equitable allowance for the difference in Interest, any part or all of the outstanding loans of the United States which mature by their terms of payment in the years 1904, 1907 and 1925. “To accomplish the objects herein suggested without contracting the cir culation, some other form of paper money must be allowed to fill the vacuum which would otherwise bq oc casioned. The national bank note how familiar to our people is the readiest and most practical agent to accomplish that object, and under reasonable con ditions it will be found responsive to the call. "An enlarged issue of bank notes thus contemplated woflld require #. number of amendments to the pfesent national bank act. These amendments should be made only upon such con servative lines as would, while grant ing fhe necessary aid to the business world in facilitating exchanges, in no wise weaken the system, or lessen the stability of the notes to be issued. The complaint uttered against the national bank act as it now stands is not di rected toward the method of bank or ganization or the absolute safely guar anteed to the noteholders. It is di rected toward those restrictions it em bodies, which result in its failure to accomplish Hie full benefit it ought to carry. The requirement of the law now makes It impossible to organize a bunk with a capital less than $50,000, ino matter how small the place in which it is to be located, or how re stricted the volume of business there Ito be transacted. Because •of that, with the added expense of taxation, both national and local, many com munities are deprived of the aid ot banks of iesue and burdened with on erous rates of exchange and interest charges. “In order to obviate to ns great an -extent as possible those objections and make the act more harmonious with proper business conditions, 1 recom mend that it be amended in the lol lowipg particulars: "r ust—Permit national banks to be organized with a minimum capital of $20,U00 in any place having a popula tion of 2,000 inhabitants or less. ' Second —Reduce the rate of taxation on circulating notes secured by deposit of bunds to one-halt of 1 per cent, per annum. xaiiU Permit bunks now organized or boie-iiter organized to issue circulat ing notes to the par vaiue ot "the reloading bonds beriabeiore sug gested,” when deposited by them \tiih the treasurer ot the United Stales; end, further, allow such banks to de posit as security with the treasury of the United States greenbacks, treasury notes, or silver certificates to a total amount of $200,000,000, against which there shall be at once Issued to them by the comptroller of the currency national bank notes to an equal amount, it being further provided that from time to time, at his con venience, the secretary of the treas ury shall substitute for the green backs, treasury notes and silver cer tificates so deposited to secure circu lation, bonds of the same class and character as the refunding bonds first named to the amount of $200,000,000, such bonds to be chargeable to said banks and by them accounted for at such price (not less than par) as the market quotations may indicate to be their market vaiue. During the per iod of time intervening between the deposit of greenbacks, treasury notes and silver certificates and the substi tution of the bonds by the secretary of the treasury, the circulating notes specifically issued therefor shall be exempt from taxation. Upon such substitution of bonds the funds re leased thereby shall at once be trans ferred by the secretary of the treasury to the issue and redemption division. “Fourth —After said banks have de posited snob bonds, greenbacks, treasury notes or silver certificates to the amount of 50 per cent, of their capital they shall be permitted to issue banknote dn addition to the 25 per cent, of such deposit, which said 25 per cent, may be unsecured by any direct pledge of security hut issued against the assets of the bank. "Fifth—Extend the guaranty of pay ment by the government to all e'rcti lating notes of the bank whether Is sued against deposited security or against assets. "Sixth —To secure the government against loss, if any, attaching to Its guaranty a tax ot 2 per cent, per an num on unsecured circulation shall be levied to create a safety fund, which fund shall be invested by the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller of the currency in govern ment bonds. In addition to such fuuds the government shall be fur ther protected by having a first lien upon all assets in case of failure of the issuing bank. "Seventh- All notes shall be re deemed in the city of New York at the the subtreasury, and at such other subtreasuries as may he designated by the comptroller of the currency with the approval of the secretary of the treasury. The control of such re demption shall be under the direction of the comptroller of the currency and made from a redemption fund of 10 per cent., to be provided and main tained by the banks. "Eighth—Restrict the issue of na tional bank notes to the denomina tion of $lO and upward. “An examination of the plan herein proposed will show that the amend ments suggested are not of a dlstliid ly radical character. It is believed that banks organized under the na tional, buk act, with these amend ments, would give upon a thoroughly sate basis a desirable credit currency loading ultimately to further freedom of Issue its the result ot time and ex perience . “Without further extension of the historical statement, it la recognizable thqt the exigencies of the government do not now require the absorption of banking capital in aid of its own finances. In fact, with treasury con dition's once normally established, the funded debt will, within a few .wars, be entirely liquidated. “The importance of banking in its relation to industry ami commerce demands for it, in view of the con siderations thus enumerated, careful and timely attention. “The question Is complicated by the fact that for a whole generation our people have been schooled in a system of banknote issues secured by pledges in the hands of a public trus tee. It is not a good system, but it not to be yielded until some other form adequate guaranties for the sol vency of banknote issues are pro vided. “The problem is a twofold one; How to withdraw the specific form of security now- provided, since it will ultimately disappear; how to provide a substitution which will be recog nized by the people as adequate se curity, and which will at the same time allow to banks within well guarded limits the most, useful free dom iu their note issues. The prob lem Is too large, its results too far reaching, to be solved offhand or by expert dictum. Us solution must lie gradually reached by the path of safe experiment. To allow national banks to issue circulating notes equal to 25 per cent, ot their capital upon a pay ment of 2 per cent, per annum as an itsurance or safety fund upon amounts so issued, is, If the demon stration drawn from the comptroller’s office can be trusted, a proposition well within the limits of safety. Nevertheless, whatever risk there is should be assumed by the govern ment, obnoxious as It may be to the general principles of government action. It is by such action that the situation as It exists has been evolved. Upon the government therefore, rests the duty of seeing it properly solved.” TELEGRAPHIC TICKS.

OHIO MAN LEADS IT A STUBBORN ATTACK ON THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW. HOT TIME IN HOUSE Grosvenor Makes a Sally Against Merit System and Says He's Glad to Part Company with President— Mr. Griffin Introduces a Bill for Enlargement of damp Douglas. Washington, Dec. B.—The session of the house Tuesday, though it lasted but two hours, witnessed a very lively skirmish over the question of dis tributing the president's message to the various committees clothed with Jurisdiction over the subjects dealt with. The conflict of authority came between the ways and means commit tee and the banking and currency committee. The battle raged nil along (ho line During the debate Mr. Grosvenor (rep,, o.) lived the first gnu against the civil service law, ami this brought the friends and enemies of that measure into action. At the out set ho repudiated the idea that oppo sition to the civil service law in volved affront to the president. Con gress was empowered to deal with the subject and the president had referred it to congress. Ho heartily agreed with the president, "that there were places in the classified service which ought to be exempt.” "i am glad," said Mr. Grosvenor, “to go that far With tlio president, even if I am com pelled to part company with him when ho says the civil service system lias the official sanction of the people." Mr. Grosvenor declared that he had kept in touch with the sentiment of the country and that if the question wore submitted to the people west of (he Allegheny mountains it would be burled Milder their overwhelming con demnation. His remarks in denuheta ttou of "life tenure in office" were met with uproarious applause from the galleries in which many members on the floor heartily joined. This was a government for the people and by the people, he declared, and no man should bo excluded from participation In the executive branch of the government by accident of birth or misfortune of early education and not otherwise dis qualified. Ohio, lie said, had repudiated the civil service law and was opposed to the building up of an office-holding class in this country. Mr. Brosius, chairman of (ho com mittee of civil service defend ml the law and the president's interpretation of it. Ho was for executive admin istration of it. The president lias full power to correct any mistakes that hud been made and lie thought Us ad ministration should be left there. He thought any attempt to legislate upon 1 '.ho question must bo regarded as an indignity to the executive. Mr, Bailey (deni., Tex.) commended Mr. Croavenor's utterance* against the building up of an office-holding class in tills country. Mr. Johnson (rep., led.) in a ringing warning declared that if the bill to emasculate the civil service law passed it would meet a piesldentlal veto. Mr. Grosvoaor ho cl urged wit h being derelict to his duty ns a republican. That party, he said, was unalterably pledged to support the law. No portion of the presi dent's message met with more hourly endorsement from him than that re lating to civil service. Moreover he said It was a mistake to imagine that the sentiment <*f the country was op posed to it. The law is heartily ap proved by all except a few "degener ate politicians" who opposed it from selfish motives. During the progress of the debate Messrs. Walker and Johnson consult ed with Dlngloy and a modification ot the resolution of distribution was agreed upon. It gave the ways and means committee Jurisdiction over all matters in the message relating to "revenue, bonded debt of the United States and to treaties of the United Stales affecting revenue." When this amendment w.is presented the opposi tion withdrew and the resolution was adopted without division. After the session Chairman Walker claimed tl-at he had won a decisive victory and 1 Is committee under-the order would have Jurisdiction of the measure as be expresses It "to convert green backs Into gold certificates;” but the members of the ways and means committee Insisted that the changes of verbiage would not affect their Jurisdiction. Representative Griffin Tuesday In troduced a bill in the house to ex < mpt from homestead entry 120 acres ot the land adjoining the Wisconsin rifle range at Camp Douglas and turn It over to the state of Wisconsin. The range now occupies 400 acres, but ad ditional space Is needed to provide for safety from stray ladls.

An Interesting contest for prece dence In the consideration of the Lodge Immigration bill and the pro posed . legislation to oorfer author ity upon the president to art for the protection of the government’s inter est at the sale of the Kansas Pacific then occurred.

WISCONSIN PEOPLE. The Omro Herald hits come out in favor of c\ Congressman Cook of Nee nah for United States senator, Milwaukee letter to the Chicago Tlmes-Horald; Speaking of Babcock, I’hll Check of Uatnhoo tells a good story of the influence the congressman wields in Washington, Mr. Cheek si,id that on old colonel of his regi ment after the war went to Texas and started a republican (taper. After some years struggling he found out that such a venture was not half so good as sawing wood. He went out of the newspaper business. He man aged to drift along with the tide after a fashion, and Cheek had almost for gotten him. After the election of President McKinley Cheek was sur prised to receive a letter from ills old commanding officer, In which after sot ting forth his hard luck, he said Ihe to was a little job as deputy collector at El Paso which would pay him 8125 a month, and he wanted (''heck's assist ance in getting It. He asked Cheek to give him a letter to his senator and any one else who might lav of assist ance. Cheek sat down and, as ho says, wrote two strong letters, one to Sena tor Spooner and the other to Congivss mun Unbcock, sett ing forth the old sol dier's claim to recognition. Mo never heard anything more of the mat ter until last summer when lie was returning from a (rip abroad lie met on the steamer a man from Texas. They became quite friendly, and dur ing the course of their eon versa (.loti Cheek happened to think of his old commander. As smut as he spokn his name the Texan replied: "Oh, yes, | know him: he has Just got a place aa deputy collector at El Paso," On hta ret urn home Cheek wrote to the suc cessful applicant, and In return re ceived a reply (hanking him for his letters. "1 only used one of them," said the writer, "1 could not And the senator, and therefore went to your congressman, llabeoek. Ho took mo right over to the president and Inter ested himself In my behalf, ami did not let up itnl.ll I got the place. i want to toll you that he has more in fluence in Washington than any other man there." Discounting the slight ex travoganeo of language due to a feel ing of thankfulness, the incident goes to show the standing the congressman hns among the party loaders In Wash ington.
