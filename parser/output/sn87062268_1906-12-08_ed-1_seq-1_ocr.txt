RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT Upon the Japanese Problem in California Considered By Japanese Residents the Most Rational Solution of the Difficutly By Associated Press San Fancisco Dec 7In an Inter view published in the Call today bearing on the recommendations made in his message by President Roosevelt on Japanese naturalization and on the segregation of their chil dren in schools General K Upeno i the consul for Japan here says Sentiment is practically universal I among the ten thousand Japanese in San Francisco that the recommenda tions made by the President consti tute the most rational solution of AmericanJapanese problems yet at tempted The Japanese are not only pleased with the message but they regard it as one of the most note worthy documents on International questions that has been issued from j the White House There is no question but that the I bonds between Japan and the United States would be considerably I strengthened by conferring the privij lego of franchise on the Japanese in California There are some fifty odd thousand Japanese in the state and while not in a position to say these would take advantage of naturaliza tion privileges I do think that the number would be comparatively large I think this would be especially so in the case of the Japanese in San Fran cisco Many Japanese have family and property interests here and they would naturally regard San Francisco as their permanent home once they beliired they had the same privilege as other aliens Concerning the school segregation question a lot is being written and talked about it that is due to miscon ception of facts In the case I think that the entire matter will be solved I I satisfactorily and that there Is no I occasion for believing otherwise The Japanese are not striving for anything I unreasonable and are quite willing to I let the facts in the dispute guide whatever decision is to be ultimately rendered Bloody Fight With Negro Murderer at Greenville I the
