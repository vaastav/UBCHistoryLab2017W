MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 190«. VALUE OF OPEN RjVER. The traffic manager of the open river transportation commission has made public a statement concerning the results of the season's work, which Is encouraging for those who have their hop— centered In. the efficiency of the plan. The total tonnage has not been great, but this Is accounted for by the —viral handicaps the commission suf fered In Its first year's work. The lack of boats was the Bret serious problem and when they were finally —ehred much of the traffic had been routed over other llnesf But on euch freight as was —nt over the water ! routs the shipper was saved from 30 to 40 centa per ton and wheat for ex port has brought a higher price per bushel on the bank of the river than at points the same distance from mar ket that had no river competition. A strong point tn the report of Traf fic Manager Smith Is made In refer ence to the fact that the unu—d land along the river that has been lain fallow for years will next sea—n he put under cultivation and the pfoducts —nt to market over this new artery of commerce. For over Si years the up per river has not been In use and facu lties for storing and handling freight were lacking. But towns are spring lng up and docks end landings have already been constructed, deserted villages revived, and In another sea. —n there will be a large Increase In the volume of buslne—. Several new steamers will be put on the river next —a—n and the long unu—d waterway will soon b teeming with business ac tivity. Word comes from the far east that the Idaho apple Is winning its way and Is in demand In the markets at fancy prices Idaho Is becoming well stiver Used — a producer of first-class fruits. The Idaho cherry has already given good account of It—if, — also has the Idaho grape. There are thousands of acres In the valleys and uplands of Idaho that can be given over to fruit culture and the product will find a ready and a profitable market. Acting on a suggestion offered at a public meeting recently held in Lew iston It is likely that a bill will be Introduced at the legislature this win ter asking for an appropriation for the purcha— of the bridge acr—a river between Lewiston and Clarkston. Some excellent arguments can be pre sented In favor of the prop—ltlon and the precedent for such an appropria tlon has already been established In Idaho In the appropriation for the bridge spanning the Snake river at Welser In Washington county. It Does Idaho need a primary election law or a railroad commission? Are these laws desirable, or shall the en ergiea of the legislature be directed in other directions? These and other similar questions will soon be before the legislature for consideration and the people for discussion. The Even ing Teller will gladly open Its columns for public discu—ioa of what legisla tion most vitally concerns Idaho at this session. Congress meets tomorrow and the congressman that succeeded In fixing his fences will now face a graver problem of red—mlng his promt—a. There are not enough postoffices to go round and he wiH be forced to side step many dlsappointed constituent* The problem for the safe and sane democracy between now and 1948 Is what to do with Mr. Bryan and Mr. Hearst. Their presidential aspirations are to be side tracked and the radical doctrines they are sponsor for ex punged form the democratic creed. ♦ NEW« 

FORECAST OF THE - ♦ WEEK. ♦ WASHINGTON, Dec. S.—The large number and Importance of'the matters slated for consideration and. action .will combine to attract fat more than the ordinary amount of attention to the lut s—slon of the Fifty-ninth con gre—, which convenes __ today. It has been tin, «suai custom In the put for the short s—slon to confiai its attention to the money budgets and to th—e matters left unfinished by the long session. But it Is believed that a precedent in the opposite direction will be established by the coming session. Th—r appears to be a disposition among the members of both branches to dispos e of some of the great pro national problems demanding action. Spurred on by the president it is probable that the legislators will be more industrious during the ensuing thtfce months than they have ever been before, excepting in war time. Mon day and Tuesday will be taken up with the president's message and the trans action of the usual preliminary busi ness. By Wednesday at the latest the lawmakers will have their coats off and be ready for the serious work be fore them. It looks now as if the Thaw trial <n New York, tentatively set to begin next Monday, will be deferred until a later date. The delay will not be longer than a few days, however, u it is evidently the desire of both the prosecution and the defense to have the famous cue out of the way if pos sible by the first of the year. A number of lmportânt cases are on the docket of the United States su preme court, which will reassemble Monday after the Thanksgiving re cess.
