Chippewa Faltn, Wis.. Dec. 7.- Sight seers to the numlwr of visited Chippewa Falls for the purpose ol viewing the immense gorge of ice that has choked the rivet- and given this town such prominence during the last week. The visitors came from till the towns on the Central road between this city and Med ford, and .Minneapolis and St. Paul, few of whom appreciated the full significance of the ice formation in the bed of the river. Only streaks of Jagged ice clinging to the fronts and sides of buildings mark the height to which the water of the river lose, for dt'ring the night the Hood receded rap idly ami a fall of four feet is recorded oil T1 .'lg.\ Xe.ir I lie C.

It is conndeiiily lifved by cifSe obsei'vers of 1 he situn tion that the river will cause no fur ther nppivhenisioii thiis winier. and the more in.pel ui pretliet that tiie ice will go out gradually, giving Hie stream a clear course by spring. The supply of anchor ice from above the city seems inexhaustible. Tons ol' the slushy stuff is still pouring over the dam. but it must certainly be flowing with the current beneath the gorge, as the ice near the city remains unchanged. Maj. Jones. 1*. S. A., left Chippewa Fails to-day, stating as his opinion that the danger of the flood is at an end. Then* is a great deal of good feeling iu the city at the happy ter mination of affairs, and it is the gen eral belief that the damage that has been car sod property will be much smaller than was at lirst apprehended. It is impossible to get an estimate of lhe cost ot' the Hood, but business men generally refuse to give out any esti mate of their losses. \o one. however, has been so seriously affected that it will invvent him from remaining in business the same as fonm-rly.
