rJ fa gattg Jlsfomn, ASTORIA. OREGON: TUESDAY DECEMBER 8. 1885 LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT. After showing the outrageous ap portionment of the legislative dis tricts of Oregon, The Astobian asks: Does this look to you just, or reason able, or fair? Is any farther argument needed to show the absurdity of the existing system of mis representa tion? Exactly! but will The Astobian advocate a just reasonable, sensible system of representation? Not this year in all probability. How long would are-apportionment of Oregon bo "just, reasonable, or fair?" Suppose for the sake of argument it was just and fair, in two elections it would not be and would eventually attain the monstrous wrong of the present apportionment Would The Astobian advocate a system of representation based on the people and not on- 4,slavepen" dis tricts? Would it advocate "minor ity" or "proportional" representation, whereby Baker, Coos and Multnomah or any other county could have as many members in the legislature as their votes stood in proportion to the whole vote of the state? Would The Astobian advocate the election'of members of each body of the legislature at large, each list of candidates, of any party, being enti tled to one member for each part of the whole vote it received, equal to such whole vote divided by the num ber of members to be elected? The present system of. electing rep resentatives to the Uregon legisla ture, is all The Astobian states, and the only way to make the legislature a true representative body, is to adopt proportional representation. Salem Vidette,3. From reading- the above it is not just clear to our mind whether the Vidette is desirous of making a point against The AsTOitrAN, or is disposed to view the matter in the same light. Probably the lat ter of these motives would be the more charitable to ascribe to our astute contemporary. Reference to the constitution of the-state and the provisions therein regarding legislative apportionment will an swer the first two questions and the accompanying proposition. The third question we answer in the affirmative. The fourth ques tion is unintelligible to any one except the propounded The question will be answered if put in such shape as will allow our limited comprehension to grasp it. The same remark applies to the fifth. In general Tiik Astobian be lieves that exact interpretation of existing statutes would re move the present injustice, and that the fault is due more to polit ical cowardice and the inertia of mossbackism than to any defect in statutory enactment. But it does not believe that it is necessary to go outside the constitution to find a remedy for the existing evil of mis representation. The following is from an article by Rev. Lyman Abbott, D. D., en titled "Danger Ahead," in the November number of the Century, upon the social and labor questien: "All that we can learn from Alex ander III., Bismarck, and the two Napoleons is, how not to do it. Not by making America less demo cratic, but by making it more so, are we to perpetuato the republic." "Politically America is u democ racy; industrially America is un aristocracy." "At the ballot-box the laborer is a king; in the factory he is a servant, sjine i:u & slave. Men who make governors, legisla tors, judges, president-,, are not allowed to determine how many hours in the day they will work, and are able to determine what wages they shall receive only by organizing in an unarmed militia to preserve that right. The com munity at the same time puts the ballot into their hand and a man acle upon it. We must either take the ballot out or the manacle off." It is continually said, "It's born in the boy, and must come out." Character is not born in any body. Forces are. Mould and fashion these forces in one way and they become beneficent. Mould them another way and they become maleficent. It is with children as with clay, dif ferent qualities are all capable of being moulded. A poorer kind, with care in shaping and burning, will make beautiful bricks of great use; an excellent kind, carelessly moulded and poorly baked, will make worthless material, only fit to be thrown away. - It all depends upon the treatment tho clay re ceives whether it becomes of any use in the work of the world. Yesterday there was no life be tween Cleveland and an interreg num. Now there are two, Sher man and Carlisle. Rosecraxs has written a book entitled "The mistakes of Grant " This is one of the mistakes of Rosecrans. The president's message will be read in congress to-day. NEW 

TO-DAY. A Card. Editob Asteeian: The Democratic mass meeting held at the court house on Saturday last for the purpose of nominating candidates for city offices for the ensuing term, should, and ought by every fair minded citizen ana legal voter be repudiated on the ground of the glaring and flagrant bull- dosing propensities practiced at the bal loting lor their respective nominees. The balloting for street superintendent was one of the most glaring impositions ever palmed off on any intelligent communi ty. The most obtuse observer could not fail to detect that the whole proceeding was a preconcerted cut and dried piece of business, and stuffing the ballot box was the order of the day. The meeting being largely represented by repeaters, sailors, sailor-runners and the offscourings of swilltown who were evidently hired for the express purpose of assisting to demoralize the legitimate process; and they admirably succeeded in converting the balloting for the respec tive nominees into a grand carnival and enjoyed the joke hugely. In tho confu sion that prevailed motions before the house were wholly ignored by the chpir man of the meeting, which does not re dound very creditably to his ability as a presiding officer of a public meeting and can only be charged to his lack of knowl edge in parliamentary rules. From the unfairness in the count of the ballots cast there are ample and sufficient rea sons to contest the nomination of street superintendent. The motion of putting in nomination Mr. Chas. Shively for au ditor and clerk, made by Mr. Andrew Schuring, a legal voter and taxpayer of this city was wholly ignored by the pre siding chairman; but stuffing the ballot box was cheerfully granted and no at tempt made to check the imposition. All fair minded, honest citizens and legal voters should constitute themselves into a committee of one and exercise the ut most circumspection on election day, to guard against a repetition of what tran spired at the Democratic convention at the court house, the proceedings of which in the main, we emphatically pronounce as a magnificent fraud and also an im position on the ballot box.
