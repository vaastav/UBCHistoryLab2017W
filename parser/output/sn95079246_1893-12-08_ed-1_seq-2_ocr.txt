The contraction of business b pretty plainly shown bv tbe vast yoi time of idle money in thc east. The Dioney is still piling np in the New York hanks, anti pi csu ra* ably in the hunks ot' al! tho money centers. Among Port Monmouth'* indus? tries is a bologna sausage factor}' which grinds np tn average of ten horses 4 (lay together with a littl**j pork and beef. The sausage.? are shipped to foreign con nt rios. The Herald says: '?H-.erc is no rscare1 anywhere, and in Wall street which is the most sensitive test' there has been a decided improve? ment in the values of railroad stocks and Louds since the term pi the proposed new law were made known. True, there has been a howl from tho Sugar Tru*i and the price of its certificates lats been marked down, and a variation of a few points in these volatile speculative counters is a matter oi daily occurrence when there is no tariff discussions. The people have known for a year that the tarin was to he revised. They elected the present national administra? tion for the purpose of doing thal very work, ami thc changes propos? ed are scarcely as sharp and radical as many people expected. Tue World discourses as follow on a timely topic: Two distinguished members cf the Cabinet, the .Secretary of War and the Secretary of tho Navy, are profounly considering the question pf whether cr not long hair is es? sential to good foot-ball playing. There is a rule in the Academies at Wast Point and Annapolis that the hair of the ca-lets and '?mid? dies" shall be worn shott?close cropped, in fact. It is proposed to enforce this rule even at the sacri? fice of the pi ide and protection i-f the heroes of tito football held. The hviys protest against such cruel violation of the sacred tradi? tion of the game that is impossible to play without long and matted hair. They not only object to the rape of their locks on aesthetic grounds, but insist that logo info a pigskin battle witli exposed scalp would be most hazardous. Thc boys are determined. There can be no hair-splitting in thc question, lt is a matter of long hair or no football. A Point for Business Men. When the free silver lunacy was being harped upon' the country over, it will be remembered that the business men of thc country argued that the men wanted free silver were ignorant of Quautial itel's and that the men who rc icw fnun daily study of the r, knew that free silver did mean free money. Thc point was wei] made. Now wc come to the tariff mat? ter. This new bill is the work ol .men who have given years to the study of the tariff question. Thai has been their business. They know the resources of the govern? ment. They know what portion ol'! the people are taxed, how they j ari taxed and for whose benelit] they ure taxed. Theirs is, then, exp ni testimony, just as the busi? ness man's opposition to the free silver policy was expert opposition. The manufacturer whose profit i marked down by the new tariff, measure mu-t bear in mind that j the bill is for the benefit of the ma-1 ny and nut for his benefit alone. Tite men having tho matter iii j han 1 have at ted as experts. The manufacturer must, therefore, now practice what he n few months ago preached -trust tho matter to these who ni lerst tn 1 it.?-State. X'mkd Wilson Bili Prom The St. Louis Republic, Dem .

The bill of 1857 was passed without objection from tiie manufacturing classes. They hal adjusted themselyes to low tariffs and were not dissatisfied with the prospects of a tariff for revenue only. So it will be with them after the Wilson bill gets into op oration. 

WASHINGTON LETTER, | From our Regular Correspondent,] Washington, D. C. Dec. 4,? President Cleveland's message to Congress is unusually long, but the number and importance of the sub? jects with which it deals made it necessary that it should be. Like all of his utterances it is straight? forward and to the point and even the republicans admit that it is an abie presentation ofilemocratic pol icy. Tariff reform as em bod. ied in the Wilson bill is commend? ed language that carries conviction and Congress is earnestly urged to [>:;ss the bill at the earliest possible moment in order that the business of the country may be adjusted to the new conditions. The opening of the regular ses? sion of Congress finds the dem? ocrats in much better condition than did the opening of the extra session. A few democrats repre? senting districts that may be tem? porarily injured by some of the proposed tariff c hinges are dissat? isfied wih the Wilson bill, but as ti rule the democrats take the same view of the hill that was so aptly expa-essed by Representative Tars ney, of Missouri, who is a member <>[ the Ways and Means committee It is not simply a revision of the larill?it is a reform of the tariff. Time will develop that it contains no clement of prejudice or animos? ity against any particular industry or attack upon the manufacturing industries; on the cotrary, it is in? tended and will speedily result in the rapid growth, develcpement and expansion of our industries upon a broad national basis, and not upon a narrow basis of selfish personal, local or sectional ii.t-r e'sts. While taking aw.ay from the manufacturer much of the so-call? ed protection found in the schedule of rates on manufactured products, by giving him untaxed raw mate? rial essential in his manufactures, wc leave to him all that should be required to enable him to compete with the world in the disposition of his products. Thc delay caused by theprepara i ion of estimates by the Treesury department, showing in detail the difference there would be in im? port duties received by the govern? ment under the Wilson bill as com? pared with those paid under the McKinley law, has revived among democrats the talk of submitting [he Wilson bill to a democratic caucus before it is reported to the House. It is argued by those who favor this pian th.tt it would be Letter to have it determined by caucus whether the bill should be amended than to have the demo? crats try to get amendments adopt? ed on tlie floor of the House and that it would also save time in dis? posing of the bill. The question his not been decided but judging Irom the talk of members, the chances appe.tr .against the bill be? ing submitted to a caucus before it is aoported. and it will not be after? wards, unless there shall he much more democratic opposition to it than has yet been shown. If a hint from an official source be founded on fact President Cleve? land has succeeded in accomplish? ing something that will make his administration one of the most dis? tinguished in American history and one of the most popular, making a new treaty with China, under which the government of China, agrees to purchase annually silver produced hy American mines to the value of ?51>,< "-0.000 -- abo a t our entire pro- j \ linet?and to throw its markets open to our manufacturers. It has been the dream of the European statesmen for many years to get the valuable Chinese trade for their respective countries, and if Presi? dent Cleveland has succeeded he has gained the greatest interna? tional commercial triumph of the century, one worth untold wealth to the people of the United Stales, I ? and enc that will soon give us the [ commercial supremacy of the J w .rid. i So much has been said, not only j ( by republicans but even by some ? democrats, about the enormous cost '? of the special examiners who have : ( been employed for some months to investigate suspected frauds on the petition roll that Secretary Smith's statement on the subject, in his an? nual report, is decidedly interesting as well as timely. Thc much talk? ed of special examiners have un? earthed actual frauds in Iowa, Now i Mexico and Virginia alone, which i saved the government more money than the entire cost of salary and maintaianance of all thc special ex? aminers employed by the Penson Bureau, and to Say nothing of eas elsewhere. So the special examin? ers are money savers for the gov? ernment instead of money wasters. Secretary Smith also calls atten? tion to the fact that in making suspensions he has simply follow? ed the policy that has always guid? ed the Pension Bureau in dealing with similar cases. Tho report en? dorses the application ef Arizona. New Mexico and Utah for state? hood. 

MACON MYSTIFIED. Macon, Ga., December 1.?(Spec? ial.)?Macon experienced a sensa? tion this morning that has thrown the whole city into a fever of ex? citement. It was certainly a strange mystery that this city had to think over for a long time and surpass all under? standing or explanation. It is not exactly a ghost story. but by those inclined to besupersti tious the spirit of some departed cit? izen is charged with responsibility for the mystery. This morning about nine o'clock Mr. Will Ervin of the Georgia Mu? sic house, with several em ph-yes of ti.e store w.as in the tuning room in the rear engaged in tuning scv eral instruments, when their atten? tion was attracted by u pepperinj noise of something falling on the floor like rain pattering on a roof. The men all stopped and began to investigate. The result of the in? vestigation soon had the hair of ev? ery man present standing porcupine fashion, and their f.acecovered with a thousand little hamps raised by sheer fright. It was raining shot. A sterdy shower of No. 0 bird shot was rain? ing from toward the ceiling all over thc room. The shot came peppering down thick and fast, from whence no oue could tell, and rattled on the expos? ed string boards of the open pian? os and stiff hats making a noise that tended, under the circumstances, to further increase the fears of the frightened men. The most thorough investigation revealed the fact that there was no? one up-stairs and the upper floor was swept clean of everything. The ceiling is sound and tongued and grooved so as to render it even wa? ter and air proof. Several well-known people were telephoned and culled from the street to witness the strange phe? nomenon. All were mystified be? yond expression. For more than two hours the) shot shower continued unabated. During that time a large number of people, who had heard the strange story, visited the scene. The ver-' diet of all was the same, that is was the strangest mystery in the histo? ry of Macon and surpassed ail un? derstanding and explanation. As soon as' the afternoon paper wine out with the story the visitors to the scene began to increase and the room is continually full. Sev? eral people havegnthered up hands Pull of the shot and taken them liome.?Atlanta Constitution. A Lawyer's Stratagem. i A Well-known Kansas citizen { tells this story: Fifteen years ago Judge Mc? sweeney was a famous criminal ; lawyer of Southern Michigan. Rt was called upon to defend a young woman from the charge of bavin:; poisoned her old husband, it was t question of whether or not she iud placed poison ia a cake of which 'he old man had eaten. A portion )i the cake had beeen analyzed by I t chemist and found to contain a ; great deal of deadly poison. The; shemist testified to this in court. )ther witnesses succeeded in mak ug a chain of damning eviden ? .goinst the pretty young widow. The time came for the summing ip speeches ot the attorneys, i \ i prosecution began and finished and ill looked hopeless for the prisoi ti the bar. Judge McsS*weeny, >nly speaker for the defence, maid breath ie- . ? tom vas crowded ir,! til wera lisienii )ne could almost hear the quiet it ,vas so intense. He began in a low one to sum up the evidence n defence of the prisoner. He had jeen allowed an hour in which to }lead his side of the case. He lealt with everything hut the cake. lt rested upon the t.able just at his ?ight hand, where it had stood dar? ug all the weary trial. Thirty minutes passed and the people wore ?itIII motionless, charmed by the iweet eloquence of the gruff old lawyer. Three-quarters of an hour passed by, then another ten min? utes. When the clock over the big lesk told him, there were but five minutes left, he reached his hand jut to the cake, half of which stood upon the table, and broke off a ragged chunk. He held this in his hand and between sentences took ?reat mouthsfuil of it. During those five minutes he calmly ar? gued the case and ate cake. He de molished more than half of it. The chemist had declared that there was poison enough in it to kill fifty men. The good people looked at him in amazement and the jurors turned to each other and whispered. McSweeny wound ap his speech, took .mother chunk of cake and walked quietly from thc court room eating it. He closed the door behind him, ran into a small room close hy and locked the door. Two physicians stood ready with a stomach pump, and in ten minutes the cake was all in the slop jar. The jury returned a verdict of "not guilty'' without leaving the courtroom. RE.5GLUT10Sy.
