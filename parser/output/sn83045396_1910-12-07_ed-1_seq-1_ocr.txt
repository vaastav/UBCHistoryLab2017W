OPPOSES ENACTMENT OF MORE LAWS FOR REGULATION OP CORPORATIONS : : Advises Halt to Observe Effect of Vigorous Execu tion of Measures Already in Operation; f Earnestly Hopes for Cheapening of Litigation Features of President Taft's Message: He declares it Is lime to stop legislating with reference to regulation of cor- poratious and to observe the effect of a vigorous execution of the laws already ; rtr on the statute hooks. Tho exact limitation upon business methods imposed by law will doubtless be made clearer by pending decisions of the supreme court. Just at this time, tho president nays, ho bolieves the activities of the gov- i eminent, in addition to enforcement of the laws, should be directed toward econ omy of administration, the enlargement of opportunities for foreign trade, tho --nuildiug up of home industry and the strengthening of the confidence of capital in domestic investment. NO 

TARIFF RECOMMENDATION UNTIL 1911. . Mr. Taffc recommends strongly some form of ship subsidy to increase Ameri- ', can shipping, especially to South America. Tho tariff board is not ready to submit a roport on any of the uchedulos 1 Of the Payne law, and Mr. Taft says ho will not recommend any tariff legisla tion until the new congress convenes in December, 1911. He urges that the tariff board be made permanent and that all future revisions be made schdule : ,by schedule. He vigorously opposes any general revision. The Panama canal should be fortified. An appropriation of $19,000,000 iB recommended for this purpose. There must be no more "pork barrel" methods in river and harbor and public building bills. The matter should bo based upon the report of a com mission of experts. In the past congress has appropriated too much for build ings not needed and not enough for buildings badly needed. Recommendations for anti-injunction and federal incorporation lawB are re newed. It is proposed that second class mail rates shall be readjusted so as to charge magazines a much higher rate on their advertising sections. i. Strong representations are made for -tho. establishment of a' new banking . hand currency system. S Two new battleships and several auxiliary vessels are urged for1 the navy. E& The president recommends that coal, phosphate and -oil lands, and water BKpowcr sites be disposed of in tho future by leasing. tfk 

UNCLE SAM'S INCOME FOR YEAR ESTIMATED, fjjfli Estimates for government expenditures during the nest fiscal year have beou cut to $630,194,013.32, which is 552.964,887.36 less than the actual approprl orB?stiou for the current year. The estimatod receipts for tho next fiscal year aro 5680,000,000. , The president urges the extension of tho civil service principle to tho dip njJKlomatic mid consular corps and the acciuisitiou by the government of the resi tfijradences and offices for its diplomatic officers. ' oIiSr Some criticisms of the Payne tariff act aro just, says the president, but ' nijMmore are unfounded. Thcro should bo more officers for the army. The engineer corps should bo ' gKincreascd by sixty. jfrHB- Tho fortifications at Corregidor island, Manila bay; and at Pearl harbor, anifcHawaii, should be carried to early completion. j;w Regarding tho Panama canal, the president says: jitgfK "The. progress of tho work is most satisfactory. It will be completed well nctjpwithin tho timo set, January 1. 1915, and within the estimated cost of $375,000, ,p9jB00O. The 3lides in Culcbra cut offer no great reason for delay." Failure to fortify tho canal would leave the United States powerless to en Jflttforce tho universal and equal use of the watenvay against a desporate and irre- 75spousiblo enemy and would defeat tho object of the canal in increasing tho mili- rJBtary effectiveness of tho Americau navy. Tho tolls should not exceed SI por VfjyKhot ton. The president should be authorized to adjust the rates a3 necessity arises. The government should include in its management of tho canal the rtlKl'unn'pliing. not only to the navy, but to the public as woll, dry docks and repair ,-'MKfaci!itios and the salo of coal, oil and other ship supplies. alMfi' Interstate railroads should be prevented from owning, or controlling ships aK"3jtrading through tho canal. 

WANTS LITIGATION CHEAPENED AND JUDGES PAID MORE. Regarding the courts, the president declares tho crying need of tho United ec$ jBtates is cheapening of the cost of litigation by simplifying judicial procedure V'fJBnnd expediting final judgment. The supreme court should be relieved from un "rJHnecoKsary appeals. Tho salaries of fedral judges should be increased, 1 dBft PoHtal savings banks will bo established in a number of cities January 1. vffKA. parcels post on rural delivery routes ia recommended.

The pendulum swung slightly toward the government today and the result of three days' voting, in which 2t9 seats have been filled, gives tho coalition one more member than in the last parlia-! nicnt from tho same constituencies.

Y X The hand of the federal bunch has at last been exposed in the preparations which are being .T. J. made by the politicians of the Eldredge-Loofbourow stripe to secure the election of Dr. G. B. T X Pfoutz. Several conferences were had yesterday, and it is the purpose of these politicians to de- T feat Dr. Douglas if it is possible to do so. In fact, there is a rumor that a name will be sup- T T. ported for the long term to insure the defeat of both W. J. Barrette and Dr, Douglas. r T The church Republicans are angry because their trick in springing Dr. Pfoutz as a dark hor5e t t candidate in the Fifth ward was exposed. They captured all of the nominations in the other f wards and deceived the Americans in the Fifth into believing they were satisfied to renominate Barrette and Bailey. The result was that but few Americans attended the convention and E. D. 4 R, Thompson, Jack Hayes, Rodney Badger and twenty other tools of the federal bunch succeeded f J in slipping in the name of Dr, Pfoutz. ' X i This so incensed the Fifth ward Americans that they met in convention Monday night and i named W. J. Barrette and Dr. O. I. Douglas for the long and short term, respectively, Both are ijl 1 first-class citizens and desire to serve the schools without attempting to further their own in- t X. terests. ' jr Every American voter should go to the polls today and vote for Barrette and Douglas.. If T they do not do so the "gang" will defeat these men with a couple of their tools. The list of the voting places will be found in another part of this edition. Call up your friends arid urge them to vote. Tell them of the necessity of keeping the schools safeguarded y j by having these two honest and upright men on the board. There is no contest, save in the Fifth.
