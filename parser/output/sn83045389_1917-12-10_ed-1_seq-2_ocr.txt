NAVY'S RECORD IS ONE OF INCREASING POWER Secretary Daniels, in His Annual Report, Proposes Bud get of $1,039,660,502 ? Asks for Increase in Permanent Enlisted Personnel. I H> Afsoclnted Press.) WASHINGTON. December ?.?To a young officer. commanding tlte first flotilla of American destroyers to reach the war r.ono when the United States entered the world war. Secre tary Daniels turns in his annual re port. made public to-day. to find the war .?logan of the naval service. Asked by the British admiral to whom he reported when his ships would be ready for work aguinst the submarines after the long voyage, the officer re plied: "We are ready now." "That was not the language of boasting." Mr. l>anic!s says in de scribing the. incident. "It was the prophecy and pledge of our service with those lighting in a common -a use. "During peaceful years the navy has been quietly but steadily perfecting itself to meet the time of war Now the hour for which it has been pre paring has arrived. Our sword is drawn, and no one will dispute that the blade is keen and free from rust, ind its temper true. "While I may not speak in detail of the Rreater na\a! operations, it may be stated that the record is one r.f increasing power, of developing re sourcefulness and of co-operative i?< hievernent which the American peo ple may well survey with national pride. While the details of what we have done and how we have done it must wait until it is permissible to spread them upon public re. ord. this nummary may be given to our people: j "In the navy we have prepared for, nnd have met the duties of the pres ant; we are ] reparing for and are con fident we will be abl? to meet any call for greater duties, for more exacting responsibilities. The best way to I ?ti<-ure enduring peace is to prepare unceasingly, night and day. for the winning of the war, whether it lie ong or short. This we have done: his we are doing and this we will ?ontinue to do." For the coming year. Mr. Daniels imposes a naval budget of ?l.03P, i?0,50", which is not itemized i:i his ?cport. In various ways, lie says, it 1 ??111 b? necessary to ask for additional unds as the session of I'ongress pro ceeds.

Voting Men's Hebrew Association. While many references were made !?> Zionism, the restoration of Palestine to the Jewish nation, as no- longer being a dream, but a reality, it was distinctly pointed out by all speakers thai no premature discussion should he .? uisbl ered. and that the first consideration should l>e nn early and decisive vic tory for the allies. Many questions relating to the wel tare and condition of tl?c .Jewish sol diers in the military camps were dis cussed. The place of the Voting; Men's Hebrew Association and Ihe scope of in activity was a problem discussed by all speakers. The recent marvelous growth oi the association was 111< subject of much interest. Problems bearing upon K"iter;il work of the Young Men's Hebrew Association were thoroughly worked out in detail. rovnt *sts spkkh A(;irrri> ?

In continuing he dealt with the hope of the Jew and his present obligation - - a duty which lie would not avoid with out discredit and reflection upon the entire Jewish nation to the govern ment. There was never a time in which the Jew had not responded wholeheartedly o the cull of his coun try. and that is the spirit in which the .lew is now entering the servic ? of the 1'niteii .states.

The American Jewish Congress war. expected to be held last November. He gave :?.? the reason for the indefi nite postponement, r.ot because it would really interfere with the course of the government in the vigorous pro secution of the war. but because some few might contend that the Jew wi? ?tying to seize advantage of an unfri r opportunity and push forward his ? lalm for right i long due him. ?.i\ i:x ip i\ nr.iiAi.i-' ok t .Mii vini-:i)
