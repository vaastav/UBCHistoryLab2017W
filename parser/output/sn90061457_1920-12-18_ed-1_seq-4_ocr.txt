V1 ICON'S COM'l-sMOX OF FAITH The message which President WIN FOtl sent to Congress lost Tuesday was n source of deep disappointment In on i) particular to tliu admirers of our Croat leader, In the fart that not In any place Old he make mention of tho groat cause of International or ganization for world peace ullli which he has had so much to do, which omlMlon causes homo of lilt friends to bellevo ho may send n later mes nage. Tor tho past eight yean Woodrow Wilson has stood ns the world's tore- moat pxnonunt of democrjrv not the ' democracy of party, but the democra cy of fundamental theory, lie has battled against privilege and doss and canto and for government of tho Ii oplo, by tho people and for the people. He has bittlcd for democracy as "an assertion of the right of the Individual to live and to be treated Justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of Individual- to mako laws which will overburden lilm or which will destroy his equal ity among his fellows In the matter of right or privilege." lis has toullz cd the outstanding truth ih.it "the law of democracy Is for Urn protec tion of tho weak." And he has striv en mightily to mako It work that way, not only at homo but abroad. Tor the reason tint he clearly saw the world resolving Itself Into a death (trapple between dcmuiraey and numeracy ho led us to stand on the riuy of Armageddon, by tho side of 1 'ranee nnd (treat Britain to stem the overwhelming Herman tide. Ho saw, In the Ilohenzollern and llapsburg d) nasties, am In the evil they had wrought, the embodiment of the auto cratic principle. Ho believed they must not only be defeated In their dream of world empire, but must be driven as sullty fugitives from the seats of power, or human liberty would go down In a welter of bb.od I nnd anarchy and deipotlsm establish Itself on the ruins. Ho led the American nation Into, and won the war. The Hohe uotlorns and H.ipsburgs became fugitives from Justice Popular govermenU were es tablished by the peoples of the do feated lands. In the peace treaty provision was made for the establish ment of a league of nations for the pr 'ei'tlon of all members, even the m t and weakest, asalnot wars of tei or political aggression. The oi i 'temocrary was triumphant Tli of world peace was put up on i el and started on Its way. Th ' '' people of his own country Ji oorlty of them rejected him. l this cruel blow does not pro ve r deter In his Tuesday message. I r n In body his leadership shat tei I, hi influence dissipated. Wood rm Wilson quoting Abraham Lincoln -' Let us have faith that right makes might, and ifi that faith kt us dare to do our duty aa we understand It." And he sajs that this is "a sentence Immortal, because it embodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation." It Is to this be recurs In his closing een tences: "I have not so mu h laid before you a aeries of recommendations. gentlemen, as Bought to utter n con fession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred and which it U my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting dey. I believe this to bo tho faith of America, the faith of tho fu ture, and of all tho victories which It wait national action la the day.i to cutse, whether In America or else where." History presents some unforgettable figures of men resplendent in tho day wbsa they were scorned and rejected. History tus conferred upon them that full meed of Justice which their own L'uBor&ttoa dented. In that galaxy of the world' noblest and best.

RIGHT The fiercest fight In tho lata cam paign was over tho Interpretation of Arttelx X of thu Leaguo of Nations covenant which the democrats, who VfflfU always rather be right than to JioM the offlees. Interpreted and ex PSOBa'atl rtelitly and tha cops wrong. J". Tilts ts now absolutely proven In fi praeiloal way by tha unanimous I uriui'ti of the League n w In - sum i" tlcucv.i, which settles that dispute for all lime, and settles It by an express tepudlation of the con struction put upon Arllelo X. by the opponents of the treaty in the senate and by distinguished republican Jur ists who made speeches for their party's candidate. The commission, In which all the forty-one member nations were rep resented, reported that "It cannot loo emphatically be stated that Artble X doea not ffuarantee tho territorial Intearlty of nny member of the leiguc." Eminent advocates of the election of Senator Harding Insisted that Article X guaranteed all frontiers as they stand. "All It docs," sajs tho commission, "la to condemn external aggression on the territorial Integrity and political Independence of any member of tho league," as was point ed out thousands of times during tho campaign. Again, It was Insisted that under Article X, If the leaguo called for tho help of American troops, they would hive to go whether we liked the business In which they wero en gaged or not. There was a groat deal of talk about "our boys" being con scripted to die In Europe Denmark, requested by the council to furnish a small contingent of troops for the Vilna service, replies that, while the party leaders favor granting tho re quest, their constitution requires that tho project have tho approval of the Danish parliament. That reply was accepted as satisfactory. Thus again the Interpretation put upon the cove nant by Its friends was authoritative ly sustained; that Insisted upon by Its enemies rejected. cors will c.ivi: you mom: TAXIS Of course you cannot help but to remember during tho campaign that Senator Harding, now president-elect, nnd all of the other republican ora tors who flooded tho country wero profiio In their promises of reduced taxation nnd of raoro equitable taxi tluu, but In tho six weeks that have Intervened since election not a single responslblo republican leader has como forward with any plan, nnd Senator I.odgo baa said that congress will da nothing with revenue legisla tion until after Match 4. What It will do then la on tho knees of the gods. Senator Wadsworth of New York can think of nothing In tho way of tax adjustment except to inrrexso the exemptions to $3,000 and J 1,000 Senator Curtis of Kansas Is confident that Jl. 000, 000, 000 a jcar can be raised from a protective tariff, al though no tariff even in the blessed days of Dingle) Ism ever brought In moro thin a third of that sum. A billion-dollar tariff would mean Hn Increase In the cost of living for which no political party would cate to assume tho responsibility. To the suggestion that a Kilos ta.x bo substituted for tho progressive In come and excess profits tax, Profes or Thomas 3. Adams of Yule, who Is one of tho taxation experts of tho bureau of internal roienuo. Informed his audience In an address delivered the other night that If tho agitation continued, "you nro going to succeed in fussing n soldiers' bonus bill, and the enormous cost of that bonus li going to bo paid for by a galea tax added to tho taxes of which jou now complain." Thla Is a dismal prophecy, but It is ono that la abundantly sustiltied by the whole cocpirlenco of American politics. Tho tlmo to have begun tho sys tematic revision of tho war taxo.i was two j'cats ago when tho Slxtj-slxUi eongroes first met. So far as hostill ties wero concirned the war was oier and nothing remained to bo done In a military way except demobilize. Every consideration of common sense and practical government wa-i on the sldo of a careful Inquiry Into tho wholo question of war taxation and tho readjustment of Its Inevitable In equalities. No Inquiry was undertaken and no attempt v.ii made at readjustment. Senator Penrose, with characteristic franknOhH, nald that tho republicans Intended to do nothing until after election, and that If the country want ed a republican revision of taxation It would havo to clvo the republicans control of all branches of tho govern ment. Hut now Uiat they have carried the elections, the republicans aro en tirely without a program and have dona nothing to obtain the data on which an Intelligent program could ba baaed. Two joars have been wast ed by partisan politics nnd the lead ers of the rarty hao nothing to offer except talk. Th chances now are tbst there will be no general revision of war taxes until throo years after tho armistice went Into effect, ami what that revision will actually be there Is nobody who can even guess. If tho bonus U to bo added to the unavoid able expenses of the government, rrofeesor Adams' foreboding r all Justified, What tho country will gtt Is not lower taxation, but new taxes supcr'mptn( J on tho cx.sllng war taxes. COP TAltll 1 1 rr.S I Mi NOT 1X)OIi tmi:ji llavo jou noticed that of late you aro not hearing so much nbout "America first?" So far ns tint campaign claptrap meant anything at all to tho ordinary mind, It Implied that thin country was to go It alone, llvo off Its own fat and keep foreign goods out by a high tariff. Hut that kind of America first Is nlresdy be ginning to appear too much like an America hindmost. Hven the farm ers aro waking up to tho fact. Tho statement Issued In Washington on Monday by tho Harm Hurc.su federa tion reads very much as If It were written by a spectacled professor of economics, or even by somo wicked International banker disguised as Old I Silt Jones, of Oopbcrvllle. Xoto theso plain talks from tho farmi r. "Wo must open up our us ual and natural outlets for cotton, wool, grain nnd meats If we aro to relievo tho present disastrous eco nomic situation." The farmer Is now asked to sell below hla cost of pro duction. What Is his only hope? Why. "tho opening of foreign mar kets." Hut Huropo can not buy un less It his credit, and unless It can sell its mnnufuctures here to pay Its debts. Very well, says tho farm bu reau, arrange, for credits, and con sider that It la "good business" for us to protect our loan of some ? 10, 000, 000,000 to European countries by helping them to "start production." This cold elementary senso la par ticularly refreshing coming from farmers. They ns a clasj have been tho slowest to perceive that they are moro Interested than anjbody elso In the freo flow of foreign commerce. Dut falling prices for their products have been rapidly opening their e)e.s. If they remain as wide awake as they now seem to be, the republican high tarlffltcs will not have so much fun as they used to out of their old pas time of "fooling the farmer." MAY tiii: HAY 

RKOW mtlRITTini The first real sign of sanity that has been observablo In Irish affairs for a long time. Is tho now apparent fact that the way Is being prepared for negotiations between the Hrltlsh government and the Sinn Pcln lead ers. There In tho other fact still patent namely that by nothing short of aberration can tho descent Into aavago warfaro of two peoples long accustomed to self-government In most things bo explained. Questions of race, religion and an cient WTongs, embittered by treacher ies, oppressions and delinquencies of the present day, havo complicated the situation, but thcro cannot havo been an hour blnco tho recent cut-throat contest began that the great mans of Englishmen and Irishmen failed to rcallzo that a Just settlement on such terms was Impossible The struggle has been tupremely disgraceful to all concerned. It has mado Ireland a shambles, threatened the veiy exist ence of the Hrltlsh empire and de layed the return of pcaco throughout tho world. Of the sufferers from these wretch ed errors th United States has not poisoned. Our foreign policy has been lng guerilla terrorism. Noboly In the perverted. Our moral leadership of tho world has beon uicrlflced. Our demagogy, naturally local or sectional. has become violently nutlonal and In ternational. Our ordinary social tights and diversions are subject to riotous Interruption or must bo pur sued under the protection of the po lice. Nobody In Ireland, In England or In the IlrltLsli dominions and depend encies has an adavntago by the exlst guutllla terrorism. Nobody In the United States has profited by It ex cepting a crew of cheap politicians and agitators engaged In capitalizing tho Irlah question for their own ben efit. It la high time for tho principals In tho quarrel to icgaln their Ecnaos. Wirr.lt NOT 

ROING TO TIIU DEVlIi JuBt from the fact that a great number of workmen are being thrown out of employment Just now, and many of tho merchants and also the peoplo nre suffering heavy losses be cauuo tho transition from Inflated to lower prices Is on. Is no sign that thla groat country Is going to the devil as many would like to believe. During tho war, and for a while after tho war, and becauso of tho war, profits and wages and Incomes and prices wont up like a rocket Borne of them aro now coming down Ilka a atlck. Even ahould they all come down that way, they can go no fur ther down than the bod-rock baso of our national prosperity. Just as tho going up process was exhilarating so tho coming down pro cess Is painful and depruulng. Hut remember that falling prices do cot mean a decrease in real values. A loaf of bread is worth the same, for the purpose fur which it was created, whether It sollj for S cents or IS. So ts an nci'O of land. So Is a coat, or a -1 'tlrjng, or a flick of candy. The Important thing Is to havo the wealth and tho means of producing It. The prlro level Is a secondary considera tion. If It Is stable, and If prices nro relatively equitable. It doesn't much matter whether tho level bo high or low. Tho supply of commodities Is what counts. If thcro wero 100 pco plo on n Island assured of a dilly supply oHIOO loaves of bread of their own production they would bo moro prosperous, nnd better off, wllh bread at 5 cents a loaf, than 100 other peo ple, on another Island, with a dally production of only fifty loaves through tho price were twenty cents. Tho Important thing Is to hava the broad, and all the other products and resources that go to mako up national wealth. That Is what tho United States has. That Is why our pros perity Is assured If wo will only let and help Nature havo her way, and not wreck her beneficent processes by our own folly. ALAS! POOH I'NHAPPY HAUDING Thero aro many peoplo who possi bly becauso they aro short of brains or partially denudod of reasoning power ore always ready to "construo" every act of a president-elect and give It soma Interpretation foreign to Its real Intent. Theso peoplo aro con tinually on the lookout for Interpre tations, and sorns few aro reasonable enough, but some must strike ono as exceedingly fanciful and forced. These Interpretations come for tho most part from newspaper correspondents, ever on tho lookout for a "story." Other peoplo would not think of them. On hla Sunday on the gulf, going down to Panama, Mr. Harding con ducted a very modeat little religious -rvlco. He happened to road the Twenty-fifth psalm, which opens: "The troubles of my heart aro en larged. Oh, bring me out of my dis tresses." The Interpreter was at once on the Job. He Immediately perceived "a peculiar and dramatic slgnlflca'ico" to tho lines, which "seemed to become the personal prayer of Senator Hard ing himself as ho faces tremondous problems." He could not have It that Mr. Harding was simply reading a prayer of Ifcuid, but that he was making a prayer of his own. To do this It was necessary to cram the senator's heart full to bursting with distresses due to tho responsibilities Imposed on tho successful candidate on election day. As tho senator read on, tho Inter preter says positively that tho presl-dont-clect meant tho verses to reveal his own attitude toward tho assump tion of the presidency. Ho has tho senator groaning In downright, dea pcrato "affliction" and bewailing to Clod that he has many enemies who hato him "with cruel hatred," and he begs the Lord to take charge of them. How lncomportable with tho happy conduct of tho senator since election day, his recent Joy In hooking a tar pon, his eagerness to be "on the Job!" This Interpreter to Mr. Harding's ac tion In selecting and reading tha psalm conceives the senator also In travail of soul over the sins of his youth, for Harding, following David and making David's words his own, ploadod that thesa sins of his youth bo not remembered. Mr. Harding has said over and over again on Ills trip that ho was having Just a fine tlmo. Ilia company have always found him cheerful and smil ing, but this "affliction," theso "dis tresses," this multitude of spiteful enomlcs, these sins of hla youth why If the Interpreter Is correct our president-elect is ono of the unbapplcst of mortals. mi: joke on oi"t rurrAiLiats It has been ao long ulnce there was a real Joke told on tho rotallera of St Joseph, that It Is almost cruel to sprrhs ono now but this ono Is too good to keep to It will bo told right hero. It will bo remembered that about a year ago tho St Joseph clothiers and hubcrdashers staged a considerable campaign concerning tho advisability of wearing tho high-tone woolen sock Instead of squandering va&t fortunes on boots Oxfords, with woolen hose, they arguod, would keep tho wolf from the door in fact, 'way out in the street. This lesson, we ore told, has struck borne, and so many boya and girls aro wearing woolen hoso with their summer oxfords that the sale of leather boots Is Impaired. Woolen utocklngs seem to be com fortable unions tbore ts ewath of snow on the ground and oven then tho box referred to havo tho dainty habit of ahcddlnc water like a ducks back. Economical America seems to be learning things right "".g much to tho disgust of the hoys who booated Oxfords with woolen hose. Hose are cheaper than thoe. It ap pearsunless prcumonla gets you. Some day some savant will proclaim the discovery that leather is a warm er and better covoriu;.- for the ankles than wool la. Then back to tho high tops again! You'vo got to hold on tight to stick onto this mundano mcrry-go-round. I'OHD'S IHVU'ICAIlMS CAMr.UON The pet hobby of Henry Pord, the flivver man. Just now Is a weekly magazlno which ho can for that mat ter easily conduct, no matter how much red Ink Is needed to keep tho books. And thcro Is no haim In it, either. If thero Is no harm In It But Mr. Ford, It appears. Is using his magaxlno to carry on a campaign ngalnst tho Jows, and makes that campaign a leading feature week after week. That's a wretched business to bo In. Wo don't caro whether such a crusade Is antt-Jewtsh anti-Irish, antl-Hrltl&h, antl-CntholIc or anti-Protestant, It Is wrotched business. Any man who devotes himself nnd his resources to stirring up religious or racial hatred anywhere, and In this country above all countries. Is in shameful business and deserves noth ing but scorn and contempt, When there is so much good work to which ho could apply his money and tho talents of those who write for him, Mr. Pord chooses to devote thorn to a campaign of race hatred. We aro ashamed of him, and for him. THOSE POLITICIAN INDICTMENTS It was common talk around tho court houso after tha grand Jury ad journed, that tho Jury failed In the most Important of their recommenda tions that being that they In placo of recommending a special grand Jury, should have taken up tho further al leged election frauds. Thla was tho plain duty of the grand Jury, and It should have remained in session until such a result was achieved and still furthor this grand Jury It Is believed should in view of somo of tho Infor mation which it Is alleged seeps through, have found moro Indictments than It did and they should have been found among tho Republicans who served In tho election booths whom If what Is continually alleged Is true, were moro guilty than the democrats who aro Indicted, It Is not at all necessary at tho present time to pass on tho Innocence or guilt of Senator Lybaght. The courts aro tho proper ones to settle this question, and the evidence pro duced Is what will govern. Many people aro prone to adJudo a porson guilty as soon as thero Is a whisper about him, and such hasty Judgment only too often leads to repentence and apology later. Senator Lysaght Is a man who has many political enemies who would harm him If they could and among the republican politicians noth ing would bo Eivcetcr than to have him put out of the- way politically. With hardly a question of doubt tho caso will not havo ono half of tho bad features that some public prints would havo the public bellevo. With the scarcity of real Jobs In St Joseph, Just now, tho man or woman who showed real senso during the flush times and saved some of his or her high wages is now feeling that satisfaction which cornea from having something laid by. St. Joseph Indications are that tho Christmas present game will not bo as hoavlly playod tills year as last, as the people who failed to save money aro not spending money as frcoly as In tho years past. In the death of Capt John A. Dun can St. Joseph loses a good citizen and a splendid business man one who always was for tlio upbuilding of this eplondld city. The St Joseph merchants have had so fur a splendid Christmas trado and they had It becauso they carry tho goods and their prices aro right It ts Just a little singular that all of the men and officials Indicted by the grand Jury aro Democrats. Why not a few Republicans? Tlio Christmas turkey la to cost more this jcar than the Thanksgiving bird cost Tbo profiteers aro still do cldedly active. There aro too many robberies and hold-ups in the city Just now. The authorities should give us a little more vigilance. Did jou say that this brand of St. Joseph weather such as we bad all of this wock was bod? There are but flvo moro shopping days before Christmas. Do your shopping NOW. Do not bellevo all that you hear, Is a pretty good old maxim these days.
