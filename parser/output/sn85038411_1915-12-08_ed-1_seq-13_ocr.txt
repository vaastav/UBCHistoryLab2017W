SPECIALTIES AT OPENING YIELD Sonic Drop a Point; Motor Shares Weak; Railroads Gain By Associated Press New York, Dec. B.—Selling of the general character that attended yes terday's late dealings was resumed at to-day's opening, some specialties yielding as much as a point. United States Steel fell % to 86%, almost 2 points under yesterday's best quo tation, while Heading, Union Pacilic and Erie were equally heavy. High priced motor shares were weak, Willys- Overland losing 6 at 420 and General Motors 3 at 518. Some of these is sues made partial recovery in sec ondary quotations. Among the few initial gains of moderate proportions were Pennsylvania, St. Paul and Northern Pacilic. Business in the first hour was quite active, but the turnover was very mod erate, only a few large Individual lots changing hands. Dealings in Sleel were greater than the combined op erations in all other leaders. Steel fell to 86% before it rebounded to 8 7'4 and other prominent issues were subject to the same irregular tendency. Canadian Pacific, Great Northern, Atchison, Reading and Erie were lower by 1 to 1% during the early trading,, but much of this loss was subsequently regained, after which trading became nominal. Anglo-French notes declined to 96, a fraction under the partici pation price. Bonds were lower.

Wireless ad vices received to-day from the peace ship. Oscar 11, signed by Henry Ford and prepaid, tell of a mass meeting held I on board last night at which extracts I of the message of President Wilson to Congress were read by S. S. McClure, the publisher. Some discussion followed, during 1 which Ellis O. Jones, n writer of New York, referred to the message as "re actionary," and said it should not be received In silence. "We are going abroad now." ho said, j "on a mission to stop a terrible war 1 among nations, every one of which is prepared in a military way. This Is no time to disturb American traditions and prepare the United States for war."

Federal Square 13 Message Is Ridiculed i by Roosevelt; Denounces Inaction of President Special to The Telegraph j Oyster Bay, N. V., Dec. B.—Colo nel Roosevelt issued a bitter attack last evening against President. Wilson's message. He finds the message to be filled with illogical as well as meaningless | sentences which he challenges any man, including the President, to ex plain. and asserts that the document I reveals Mr. Wilson as a man without i convictions, who, in the present in j stance, is using words to cover a policy of "dishonorable inaction." I Colonel Roosevelt asks, what does I Mr. Wilson mean when in one line hu says that we have "stood apart, stu ] (iiously neutral, because it was our j manifest duty to do so," and a couple jot paragraphs later says, "We demand j security in prosecuting their self- I chosen lines of national development J tor others'.'" He can take either of the two positions; but he cannot take both. Did or did not Mr. Wilson "de- I inand security" for Belgium "to prose- I cute its self-chosen lines of national i development?" He knows he didn't. Then what does he mean by saying, "We demand this security for oth ers?" Again ho says that he regards war as a "means of asserting the rights of a people against aggression"; and yet he says that it was our 4iuty to remain studiously neutral when Bel gium asserted the rights of her people by war against the aggression of Ger many. How does he reconcile these two statements? He cannot do so. He is using words to cover a policy of dishonorable inaction." Wilson and Taft Sit Together at Meeting I Washington, Dec. B.—President Wil son and former President Taft sat on | the platform together here to-day at the annual meeting of the American Hed Gross. The President and former president greeted each other warmly. In a brief address President Wilson i praised the humanitarian work being 1 done by the American Ked Cross in | the European war, saying it was tliH Kreatest agency the United States had j for good. President Wilson presided |a? the afternoon Session of the Ked Cross and introduced Dr. RicharQ Strong, who recently returned from Serbia where he had charge of the typhus fight.
