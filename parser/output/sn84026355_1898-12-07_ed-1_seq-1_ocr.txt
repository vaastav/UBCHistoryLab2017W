MR. VEST ON COLONIES A Resolution Bearing: Upon Our New Possessions Petition to .Re vive the Grade of Admiral and Vice Admiral The Attendance on the Floor of the House Is Largo, but the Galleries Hold Very Few Spectators Business Transacted. Washington, Hoc. 5. The session of " the venule was devoted mainly to rou tine matters, tlio introduction of bills aril presentation oC reports. Mr. Morrill presented u petition from tli legislature of Vermont, asking for the revival of tlio grade of admiral and i cognition of Hear Admiral Dewey; Air. Hall- presented a bill to revive the credo ni admiral and vice admiral. Mr. Vert i.Mn.1 offered the following .vilnt resolution which he asked might li on tli" table ns be desired to speak on It at an early day: "Thai under the constitution of tho 1'tilted Suites no power Is Riven to the t deral government to acquire terri tory to be held and governed perma nently as eolonies. Tne eoloiilal system of F.uropean niitlons eaiiuot be established under our present constitution but all terri tory acquired by the government, cx-t-"it such small amount as may be lii-ci ssir.v for loallng stations, correc tion or boundaries, and similar govern uient'il purposes, must be acquired and governed with the purpose of ultimate ly m-ganlylng sueh territory into state suitable fur admission into the union." Consideration of bills on the calendar was then taken up. A measure report ed favorably at the last session, amend ing existing law relating' to issuing of American registry to foreign built ships rcck-d In tho United States, pun haiil bv citizens of the 'United St.U"s ami repaired to the extent of three-fourths of their value, was dls euseil. The bill provides that If such n wi coked ship be employed in the eo istw trade It shall be subject to forfeiture. Mr. Vest, a member of the committee nil i oninieii e. expressed his opposition tii the hill. principally because it affords protection to the coastwise trade, which needed no protection. Our gen eral carrying trade, Mr. Vest believed, medi'd protection. Under the present sstem of navigation laws this trade bud dei reused from 73 per cent, to 11 per ent. and this country is now pay ing .fldO.OOC.OO'i annually to foreign ship own-rs for carrying trade that ought to be carried in American bottoms. Thl condl'lnn of affairs, Mr. Vest de clared, was "a scandal and disgrace." lie said he bad been amused nt tho suggestion of the president made In his message submitted yesterday that our carrying trade be encouraged by the payment of fubsldles. "In other words," said he, "It Is pro posed to substitute for the present ielous system of navigation laws, a scheme of subsidies that is even mnro !( 'ous than is the evil It proposes to remedy." "Under the proposed policy of the ai.m'nlstratlon," continued Mr. Vest, ' we are to build a great navy. We are to lease to be u nation of traders, and under the Impulse of the policy of ex pansion become a nation of warriors. 1 would appear to me to be better lirsi to build up our carrying trade. I would also let our people, through the leiiellcent effects of Mich trade, buy wluri they can buy cheapest." Mt. Caffery (La.), also a member of the committee on commerce, opposed til bill. Finally It was made a special orilei for next Monday,

The senator' wife left her card as a formality. The ex-empress promptly sent an attendant to request Mm Davit to call In person. The latter complied and was received, she said, afterward, by ii stately, white-haired, smool faced woman, having little the ap- -ance of an Invalid, which the je ,ic supposes her to lie. The ex-empress seemed to be pleased at being addressed as "your majesty," and said she had the deepest regard for the Americans, "because for my escape from Faiis at a perilous time 1 wan chleily indebted to an American." lef eience being, of course, to the late Dr. Evans. Although Mrs. Davis studiously avoided mentioning the Aiiierican-Hls-pano war. remembering that the ex empress is n Spaniard, the latter broached the topic, saying: "After tli" destruction of the Maine, war was In evitable, although I do not believe any Spaniard was responsible for that sad calamity. I am sure any nation would have done in the circumstances as the United States did." When Mrs. Davis, on retiring, kissed her hand, the ex-empress seemed deep. ly touched and exclaimed: "I am most grateful." EXPLODING MINE KILLS FOUR MEN Appalling' Accident Near Boston.

N. Y., Dec. C. -Mrs. Margaret Cody's cross examination was conclud ed todny. In the trlnl of the Indictment.! against her charging an attempt to blackmail tin- heirs of the lete Jay Gould. She denied Hint she had writ ten two of three letters to Ailiaju .1. i'.uker, of tills city, having reference l i the alleged marriage of Gould to r i rah Brown, afterwards Angell. The thltd letter, In which the writer said kh could 'manage Mary Ann Shields," Mrs. Cody admitted writing a portion of It. She would not explain what was meant by the phrase ipioted above. She denied that she was the woman in black who, according to Mrs. Pierce, daughter of Mrs. Angell, had stealthily given her (Mrs. Fierce) a marriage cer tificate of Jay Gould anil Sarah Brown in 1S9I. Mrs. t'oih admitted that she had made Inquiries among old residents of Delaware county as to tho early life of Jay Gould and In this matter she was complying with tile request of Mrs. Pierce. This afternoon Mr. Carvallio, an ox pert in chiroi;raphy, was placed on the stand. He had made an Investigation of tlie book containing the baptismal record of the child, which was reputed to be the child of Jay Gould and Mrs. Angell, whose maiden name was Brown. He tistillid that the original entry of tho birth of tills child had been tampered with. "What did your investigation amount to?" asked Mr. Nleoll. "I found that the names of Mary S. Brown and Jay Gould were forged to the entry." Witness said that there had been an erasure of names and others were writ ten over them. An "1" has been erased from in front of tho word "ilegitlmate" so as to make It read "legitimate." Witness further deposed that the paper had become thin from the erasure when It became necessary for the oper ator to use t'uni so as to prevent tho ink from spreading. Mr. Nleoll then asked Mr. Carvelbo if he had taken photographs of the en try as he found It and if so to produce them Witness did o, and Mr. Nleoll furnished to each juror a photograph. It was an excellent photograph, show ing plainly tho alleged changes. On cross-examination by Mr. Dugan, witness said he had first seen the rec . ord on Friday of the week before last. The operator had used iron ink, and the irop composed In that Ink had not y.-t come back to Its metallic state. Therefore In; judged that the forgery had been committed within the past live years, as It generally took about that period for tho paper to return to its metallic state. 

MARIA TERESA AFFAIR. The Court of Inquiry Freed All from Blame. Washington, Dee, C The llndlnga of tho court of inquiry concerning the abandonment of the Infanta Maria Teresa, during the storm of Oct. 29, were made public today. The finding Is summed up In the statement that, the court llnds the abandonment was not due to any fault or negligence on the part of any oillccr of the navy and that the court does not think any fur ther proceedings should be instituted. The vessel was pronounced to be In lit condition for the voyage to the United States In reasonably fair weather, but could not be called seaworthy In a gale, H v.as stated that Commander Harris did not take charge of the Teresa until after the decision of Captain Chit tenden, of the Morritt Wrecking com pany, to abandon her. This settled the contention advanced before tho meet ing of the court that Commander Jlar ils exceeded his atthorlty In taking charge of the cruiser. The transfer of the ship's company from the Teresa to her consort, the Merrltt, Is char acterized as n skillful accomplishment In view of all ciicumstnncea. Lieu tenant Harris' conduct under the try ing conditions is to be commended. MYSTERIOUS DEATH. Charles Wilcox Dies in the Embrace of His Dead Wife.

Spanish soldiers electing to re main in the cotonles may do so, but It is more a matAor of economy for tho Americans to return the others, an these must be fed as long as they are kept and Spain Is unable to bear tho expense of the repatriation. Paris, Dec. C. The joint pence com mission met at 2 o'clock tills afternoon. It has developed that yesterday's session was of far greater Importance than generally supposed. It resulted in the Americans uncompromisingly rejecting Spain's request that for n, term of years, the ships of that coun try and IH products be admitted to Cuban and Porto Rlcan ports under th same regulations and customs tariff as American ships and products. Tlie Spanish commission for sumo days, has ben playing for time, Tho Americans were anxious for a decision or. the question of a coaling station in the Caroline islands, religious tolerancn in the Carolines and the release of po litical prisoners,. The Spaniards wen unwilling to answer these points until they heard what the Americans pro posed to do for their Industries which had been built up by the Cuban and Porto Illcan trade. This is why Spain contended that tho articles of the treaty should be dis posed of in their order while tho Amer icans wanted to llrst settle their press ing needs. The session of yesterday was prac tically a light on the order of proced ure. Finally th Americans yielded and then the Spanlnrds proposed their shipping and commercial question which the Americans rejected in Its entirety. Tlie session then adjourned with neither side in an especially amia ble frame of mind. DIFFKRKNCK OF OPINION. It Is learned that there were differ ences of opinion among the Americans on tho shipping question and numerous telegrams were exchanged with Wash ington. Finally the American commis sion was Instructed to refuse, the prin cipal reason being that Porto Rico 1st about to be declared within the coast line of the United States, Willie ns re gards Cuba the authorities at Wash ington would make no promises, as thu American occupation there is not fixed and tlie future Cuban government must make Its own treaties. Exactly what Spain requested will that her ships and products should ho accorded the same pilvlleges In Culm, and Porto Rico for a period of ten yeas, as had been conceded to Spain in the Philippines. This request was sup ported by tlie pieeedents in the cass ot Louisiana and Florida. when the pro ducts! and ships of France and Spain were admitted to the ports of New Or leans. Penxacola and St. Augustine for twelve years, the same as those of thu United States. Ill the case of the pur chase' of Louisiana tlie same privileges were extended to the products and ships of Spain, because she had ceded Louisi ana to France three years previously. When the commissioners emerged from tlie foreign otllce this evening, after another long session, Judge Day, president of tlie American coinmlhslon, announced that all the big questions had been nettled and that the treaty would be signed In iluee or four days.
