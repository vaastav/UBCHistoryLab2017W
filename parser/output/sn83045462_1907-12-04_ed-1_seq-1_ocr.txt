WAS REAR-END COLLISION Accident Much Like the Terra Cotta - Crash. BOTH WASHINGTON TRAINS Fatal Block Is Supposed to Be Con trolled by an Electric Signal i System. ?" BALTIMORE. Md.. December 4,-Four persons were killed and about twenty In jured In a rear-end collision between local passenger trains Nos. 14" and 144 on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad at Hanover. Md.. twelve miles west of here, this morning. The list of fatalities later was increased to five. An unidentified man died on the relief train and a fourth negro track hand died at a hospital here. Between thirty and forty, all told, were hurt. Of this number eighteen are In hospitals here .but with one, and possibly two exceptions, their wounds are not be lieved to be dangerous. Engineer Wagner of the rear train < lalms that the signal at Harwood, the first signal station west of Hanover, showed a clear track ahead. Same of the Injured are badly hurt and may die. The three killed outright were negro track hands. Relief trains were made up. the dead and injured were brought to Baltimore and the latter placed in hospitals. The flr?t train was twenty-five minutes late, having been delayed by a broken rail at Jessups. where It had sidetracked to let an express pass. While standing at Hanover station taking on passengers the second train came around the curve at that point at a high rate of speed and t rashed Into the rear car of the station ary train, smashing this car and driving It Into the next coach ahead. The last car of train No. 142 was dlvlued into a smoking compartment and a sec tion Cor negroes. It waa id this car that the deatKk secured. The movement of trains on this branch of the Baltimore and Onto system la con trolled by an automatic electric signal. When a train enters a block electricity throws a red target. The red target sig nal remains stationary until the train leaves the block, when the target changes ?to green. Just west of Hanover station is such a signal. Lilt of the Dead.

F. D. McKenny. Laurel. Md. Harry H. Phelps. Laurel. Md. WAS A BAD WRECK. Btory of a Washington Business Man on the Spot. Scenes about the wreck were described to h 8tar reports this afternoon by Mr. J. J. Betton. who has offices In the Col orado building. Mr. Betton resides In Baltimore. He arrived upon the scene of the wrecl^ about one hour after it oc curred. He was a passenger on train No. 151, which followed No. 144. According to his account, No. 142. which, it is stated.was late, was just pulling out of Hanover from Washington when No. 144, which is a through express train, came around the bend at the station at a high rate of *peed. The rear coach, which was of separate compartments for white und colored peo ple. was telesct?>ed by the car immediately ahead. The giant engine of the express drove the light rear car of the accommo dation into the second car with terrific force, completely telescoping it. The engine then plowed into the second ?-oa/?h and made splinters of It. Very little damage was done to train No. 144, with the exception of the engine being considerably smashed. After plowing into the slowly moving train, the giant engine of the express carried the wreckage about one hundred and fifty yards farther down the track, tearing up the rails as it went. As Hanover is a small station, there Is no teleg-aph operator located there, but In a short time an operator was upon the scene and after cutting in an Instru ment In the overhead wire began ticking off the news of the smashup. As soon as the news waa received in Baltimore express train No. -65 left that city and arrived at the scene of the wreck a short time after 8 o'clock. The dead and a number of the Injured were placed upon the train and taken at once to Baltimore. All this time the j wrecking crew was working to clear the , track. At Intervals along the rails. Mr. Betton stales, one could observe pools o' blood, where the dead and Injured had laid before being removed from the wreckage. According to Mr. Betton a statement was made at the scene of the wreck that the engineer of the express train had been on duty for a stretch of twenty Itours before the smash, but this could not be verified. It Is also stated that the Hanover station marks the end of the automatic block system of signals from Washington, and it Is said that the tower system of signals Is In use from that l>olnt to Baltimore. Shortly before noon the wreckage and broken trucks, which completely covered the track, had been cleared away and a number of Injured were carried toward this city. 8hortly after the start, it is stated, stops were made and many of those hurt were taken to their homes at way stations. At Laurel. Md.. three men and a young woman were carried from the train and taken to their homes. None of them could walk. LA PATBEE COMBS DOWN. Beported That She Has Landed in Ireland. BELFAST.

AFTER. beceived or audience at PALACE IN ST. PETERSBURG. ST. PETERSBURG. December 4.-Sec retary Taft Was received in audience to day by Emperor Nicholas at Tsarskoe Selo and received from his majesty the frankest expression of Russia's sentiments of sympathy and regard for the United States. The emperor requested Mr. Taft to convey his greetings to President Roosevelt. The Secretary spent about five hours in company with the emperor, and enjoyed the honor of a long and Intimate conver sation regarding the situation in the United States and the problems confront ing the American government. The empress is suffering so severely from an attack of Influenza that she was obliged to refrain from taking part in any of the official ceremony, consequently Mr. Taft did not see her. He was pre sented. however, to the other members of the imperial family and to many high military and codrt officials. On account of the Secretary's expressed desire that he be received unofficially, no salute was fired, but the reception was given a military setting by a p&rade and regimental festival of the Semenovsky Regiment, the officers of which attended the luncheon with Mr. Taft. The emperor discussed with him military topics at considerable length. He questioned Mr. Taft concerning his journey over the Trans-Siberian railroad, and drew a contrast between the present means of communication and the method in vogue? three-horse slolghs and steamers across the rivers and lakes?when he made his trip across Asia to inaugurate the Trans Siberian lines. The emperor showed a keen interest in the problems which the American govern ment has to solve in the Philippine Is lands, and he asked many questions con cerning the new Philippine assembly. He referred also in a complimentary manner to the work done by the American gov ernment on the Isthmus of Panama in its fight against yellow fever. The party then proceeded to the riding school, where the Semenvosky Regiment, 1,800 strong, and accompanied by a ma chine gun battery and several other de tachments. was drawn up. The emperor and Secretary Taft were received with cheers. Then the emperor and his guest, j accompanied by their respective staffs, I walked together through the.lines of the regiment and inspected its formation. When this examination was over tht troops passed twice at a quickstep before the reviewing party, and then the hosi and his guests returned to the palace foi luncheon.

Now Scheme of Store Window Rob bery Successfully Worked in New York City. NEW YORK, December 4 ?A new de velopment in burglary was displayed yes terday when Abraham Bobler's jewelry store in West 116th street was robbed of jewelry said to be valued at ?r>,000 while Bobier was In the store. Bobier had dressed his show window by piling up a number of boxes and cov ering them with black cloth. On this cloth valuable jewelry was displayed. Several times Bobier thought he heard rats In the floor, but paid little attention to the scratching noise. Presently, while he was waiting on customers in the rear i of the store, a friend came In to ask why j Bobier had removed the jewelry from the window. The jeweler rushed to the window. Al most every article of value had disap ' pea red. Investigation showed that the 1 robbers had entered the cellar under the store, cut a hole two feet .square In the ! floor under the boxes, climbed up Into one of the boxes by means of a ladder. : cut a small hole through the top of the j boxes, slit the black cloth and picked the ' pieces of jewelry out of the window with out difficulty. ' Two well-dressed women had been in ! the store a short time before aYid had kept Bobier engaged in the rear of the room for some time, although they made no purchases. The janitress of the build ing remembered seeing two strange men leave the building by the stairway en trance a few minutes before the women 3eparted.

Buelow May Tender His Resignation. ARMY SCANDAL RENEWED; "Bloc" Not Supporting Premier as Agreed SPEECH BY HERMAN PAASCHE Count von Hohenau Will Have to Take His Chances With Civil Courts. BERLIN. December 4.?The policy of ' imperial chancellor. Prince von Bue low. of governing by a coalition of the national liberals, the radicals and the con servatives appears to be seriously endan gered by the attack delivered upon the government today by Dr. Herman S. I aasche. first vice president of the reich stag and one of the national-liberal lead ers in the matter of the Harden-Von Moltke scandal as -well as on the proposed financial measures. Prince von Buelow has given the lead ers of the so-called "bloc" to understand that the situation which has arisen em barrasses him. He caused the dissolution of the reichstag a year ago upon assur ances that the parties of the "bloc" would support him. but today he is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked, and he asks what maj be expected of the future. The im herwoi>wiant'l"?r dls,in(-tl>" intimated that supported. " hc was adequately More Harden Entanglements. Today's session of the reichstag ad journed at an early hour In order to give the leaders of the "bloc" time to consider the situation and consult with their sup. porters. There is much talk of a "chan cellor crisis." but this, at the present mo ment. seems too strong a phrase to apply to the situation. A way out may be found by the national-liberals accepting the dec larations made by Gen. von Einem the aJSinlVtZl 'T Lhe '"ligations against the officers incriminated In the Harden-Yon Moltke scandal will be push ed forward rjgorouslj\ ??^ War von Einem announced today that Emperor Wil liam had ordered the suspension of court Wllhe??r,.?r??eK,nK8 aKalnst Gen.

This action means that Count von Hohenau must take his chances In an or dinary court of justice. The minister of war announced further that Count von Hohenau and Count Lynar had presented wh?e?e've.8 f?r trlal that the cases would take the u.sual course. This an nouncement created a great sensation. Orgies at the Villa. The remarks of the minister of war were called forth by a speech delivered by Dr. Herman S. Paasche. first vice president of the reichstag, in the course of which he held up a bunch of letters which he said had been written by Count von Hohenau from the imperial head quarters at Wilhelmshohe to Herr Boll hardt, who was a witness at the Harden trial, and which indicated that Von Ho JV1 h?d meretricious relations with Bollhardt.

At the conclusion of Gen. von Einem s speech the leaders of the "bloc" joined in a motion to adjourn. They were opDOsed by the centrists, the socialists and the Poles, who demanded the reasons for the adjournment. Herr Wiemar, radical, re plied that the leaders who had signed the motion in favor of adjourning had re ceived an official communication regard ing occurrences of high political impor tance which required discussion by the coalition parties.

75-CENT GAS. Mr. Madden Introduces His Bill of Last Congress. Representative Madden of Illinois has reintroduced his bill to compel local gas companies to furnish 75-cent gas in the District. Mr. Madden told a star re porter today that he Intended to push the matter and endeavor to secure action on the bill as soon as possible, as he be lieved there was a general demand for it here in the District. Moreover, gas com panies in other cities were selling gas to the consumers at 75 cents a thousand feet, and in many cases for even less than that price, and he saw no reason why the people of Washington and Georgetown should be compelled to pay more. The measure has been referred to the House District committee and will prob ably be one of the first considered by that body. TAFT-FORAKER CONTENTION.

MAKE ORAL REPORT Ambassador Aoki Explains His) Return to Japan. NO OTHER SIGNIFICANCE Cannot Be Construed as an Indioa* tion of Unfriendliness. NO LETTERS OF RECALL GIVE* Doesn't Know Whether He Will Re turn?Will Investigate Situation on the Pacific Coast. ? 1 Viscount Aokl. the ambassador to Jn* pan. talks briefly and reservedly regard ing the Instructions given him by his gov ernment to return home for the purpose of making a report on affairs In which Japan is Interested jointly with the United States. "I am going home." the ambassador said, "for the purpose of making an oral report to my government. There are many things to report on?things that I have heard and seen In this country. They can be made better orally than in writing. There Is no other significance to the visit. I shall discuss Immigration in addition to other questions in which my government Is Interested. My return cannot be con strued In any way as an Indication of un? friendliness on the part of Japan for the United States. The Washington govern ment knows very well that Japan is dis posed to be one of her'beat friends and to remain on terms of the greatest amity with her. Any other Idea or suggestion la foolish to entertain. The question of the adjustment of the immigration difficulty Is not at all a serious one. and in my judgment it will be settled satisfactorily. My return, I repeat, has no bearing on the relations between the United States and Japan. Our relations are ? friendly and 1 hope will remain the same. There Is no reason why they should be other wise, but, on the contrary, every reasoa why they should continue good." "How long will you remain In JapSn?'* "That I don't know." "Are you coming back?" he waa asked. "That I don't know," replied Count Aokl. Will Make an Investigation. Count Aokl. |f time permits, will look Into the general question of Japanese Immigration on' the Pacific cogst before he aalla for home. He had Intended do* ing this earlier 1n the year, aaA had prac tically made all arrangements tor, a trip to the coast. For what seemed good reasons, however, the trip waa for the time abandoned. The Japanese govern ment is anxloua to learn from the ambas sador personally the real situation on the coaat as he views it, and the ambas sador indicates that he will make It a matter of Inquiry on hia way home. The ambassador reiterated the opinion that there would be a satisfactory out come of the pending immigration ques tion between the United States and Japan, and added that his country should do all In Its .power , to so adjust matters a* to satisfy the United States. No letters of Bee all. At the State Department it was learned that Count Aokl did not present any let ters of recall, but th*t what he had re ceived was a summons to go home for consultation) with his government. It is not known at the department whether Count Aokl will or will not return to the United States, and the Impression there is that the ambassador himself is not certain as to his future movements. ' The most positive statement Is made at the Japanese embassy that Count Aokl's recall is not the result of any dis satisfaction with his course on the part of his government, or that in his recall his government in any way disavows his ac tion while here. The ambassador expects to leave Wash ington on his homeward trip before Christmas, and during his absence Mr. MIyaoka, the counselor of the embassy, will act as charge d'affaires. 

TOKIO AWAITS AOKI HIS BETTTRN TO WASHINGTON HOT EXPECTED. TOKIO. December 4?2 p.m.?The recall of Viscount Aoki, Japanese ambassador at Washington, is the result of his own expression of a desire to resign, and no official announcement is expected until after his arrival In Tokio. It is now re garded as a foregone conclusion that Am bassador Aoki will not return to Wash ington. The question of his probable successor, in the event his resignation Is accepted, has been long under discussion. The names mentioned in this connection include Baron Kaneko, formerly special envoy to the United States; Baron Chin da. vice minister of the foreign office, and M. Takahira. at present Japanese am bassador to Italy and formerly minister of Japan at Washington. It is now under stood that M. Takahira is first choice. Neither Baron Chlnda nor Baron Kaneko can be spared, so Takahira will undoubt* edly be appointed, if he is acceptable at Washington. No Reflection Meant. The Associated Press is assured by tho highest authority in the foreign offlca that the recall of Viscount Aokl Is not In tended as a reflection upon his course, but a possible change at Washington has long been considered.
