Tho sug gestion Is not deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct tho man ner in which claims for Indemnity by foreigners, as well as by citizens of tho United States, arising out of tho late civil war, shall bo adjudicated and do tcrmincd. I huvo no doubt that tho subject of'nll such claims will cngago your attention nt a convenient and proper tlino. OUR DEMANDS ON OIIEAT H1UTAIN. It Is a matter of regret that no con Bldcrablo ndvauco has boon mado to wards an ndjustmont of tho differences between tho United States mid Great 'Britain, arising out of tho depredations upon our national coirimcrco and other trespasses committed during our civil war by British Bubjccts, in violation of International law and troaty obllga tlons. Tlio delay, however, may bo be Hoved to havo resulted In no small do greo from tho domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred In that country dur- lntr tho last session of Parliament. The attention of tho now ministry was call cd to tho subject at an early day, and there Is somo reason to expect that It will now bo considered In a becoming nnd friendly spirit. Tho lmportanco of nu early disposition of tho question can not bo exaggerated. Whatever might bo tho disposition of tho two governments It is manifest that good-will and friend ship between tho two countries cannot bo established until a reciprocity, in tho practlco of good-faith and neutrality uhall bo restored between tho respectlv nations. the i-enian invasion. On tho sixth of Juno last, In violation of our neutrality laws, a military expe dition and ontcrprisoagalnst tho British North American. Colonies was projected nnd attempted tjd bo carried on within tho territory and jurisdiction of tho United States. In obedlenco to tho ob ligation imposed upon tho Exccutlvo by tho Constitution, to seo that tho laws nro faithfully executed, all citizens wero warned, by proclamation, against taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceed ings, and tho proper civil, military, and naval ofllcers wero directed to take all necessary measuros for tho enforcement of the law. Tho oxpeditlou failed, but it has not been without its painful con Boquonecs. Somo of our'citlzcns who, it was alleged, wero engaged in tho ox peditlou, havo boon captured, and havo been brought to trial, as for a capital offence, in tho Provluco of Canada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pronounced against some, while others havo been acquitted. Fully be lieving tho maxim of government, that severity of civil punishment for mis guidod persons who havo engaged in revolutionary attempts which havo dis astrously failed Is unsound and unwise, such representations havo been mado to tho British Government, in behalf of tho convicted porsons, as, being sustain ed by an enlightened and humane judg ment, will, it is hoped, induce in their cases an exerciso of clemency, nnd a ju dlelous amnesty to all who were engaged In tho movement. Counsel has been employed by tho Government to defend citizens of tho United States on trial for capital offences in Canada; and a dis continuance of the prosecutions which wero instituted in tho Courts of tho JJnltod States against thoso who took part in tho expedition has been directed I havo regarded tho expedition as not only political in its nituro, but as also in a "great measure foreign from tho United States In its causes, character, and1 objects. Tho attempt was under stood to bo mado in sympathy with an Insurgent party In Ireland, and, by "striking nt a British Provinco on this continent, was designed to aid in obtain ing redress for political grievances which, it was assumed, tho pcoplo of IrolandJiad suffered at the hands of tho British Government during a period of soverul centuries. Tho persons engaged in it wero chiefly natives of that coun try, somo of whom had, whllo others had not, becomo citizens of tho United Btatcs under our general laws of natur n'ization. Complaints of misgovern ment in Ireland continually cngago the attention of tho British nation, and so great an ngitatlon Is now prevailing in Ireland that tho British Government havo deemed it necessary to suspend tho writ of habeas corpus in that country Thcso circumstances must necessarily modify tho opinion which wo might of horwlso havo entertained In regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as thcso Iaw remain upon our statute-books they should bb faithfully executed, and If they oporatp! harshly, unjustly, or op pressively, Congress nlono can apply the remedy, by their modification or repeal. A iRUrilEfUJXTATION WANTED FOll OltKECn. Political and commercial Interests of tho United States nro not unlikely to bo affected in somo degree by events Hint nro transpiring In tho eastern regions of Kuropo, tiud tho time seems to havo come when our Government ought to have n proper diplomatic representation in Grccco. I'OMTICAIj EXPLANATION. This Government has claimed for nil porsons not convicted, or accused, or puspoctod of crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation, and a choice o'f now national allegiance. Most of tho Uuropeou States have dissented from this principle, and havo claimed a right to hold such of their subjects as have Immigrated to and been naturalized in tho United Slates, and nflerward re turned on transient vlslU to their native eounlrle, to tho porfornmnco of mili tary Horvlco In llko manner m resident ubjects. Complaints arising from tho claim In this respect nindo by foreign States, liavo heretofore been matters of controversy between tho United States nnd somo of thu Kuropenn Powers, and thu Irritation consequent upon thu fail ure to settlo this question Increased during the war In which Prussia, Italy, and Austria wero recently engaged. Whllo Great Britain has never acknowl edged tho right of expatriation, sho has not practically insisted upon It. ! ranee has been equally forbearing, and Prus sia lias proposed a compromise, which, although ovlnting increased liberality, has not been accepted by tho United States. Peace is now prevailing every where In Kuropo, und tho present seems to be a favorable tlmo for un nsscrtion by Congress of tho principle, so long maintained by tho Kxocutlvo Depart ment, that naturalization by one Stato fully exempt tho natlvo-born subject of any other State from thu t performance of military service under any foreign government, so long as ho does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits. 

CONCLUSION. In tho performance of a duty Imposed upon mo by tho Constitution, I havo thus submitted to tho Representatives of theStatesnnd of tho peoplesuch Infor mation of our domestic and foreign af fairs as tho public Interests seem to re quire. Our Government is now under going its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is that the peril may bo successfully and finally passed, without impairing its original strength nndsym metry. The Interests of tho nation nro best to bo promoted by tho rovivnl of fraternal relations, tho complete ob literation of our past differences, and the rcinaugurntiou of all tho pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to thocarly accomplishment of thoso great ends, let us endeavor to prcsorvo harmony bo- twecn tho co-ordlnnto Departments of tho Government, that each In its proper sphoro may cordially co-opcrato with tho other In securing tho maintenance of tho Constitution, tho preservation of tho Union, nnd tho perpetuity of our free institutions.

Witim: there Is ,so much agitation in Northern communities as to tho future of tho South, it Is gratifying to read such evidence as tho following of tho quiet determination of tho Southern people to make their great resources us availa ble as possible JCor; seems to bo up permost In tho minds of tho Southern pcoplo at the present time, nnd tho mnny suggestions of application aro be ing received with undivided attention, and put in actual practice To the Jlonnrablc, the CftturaJ AiscmlUj of Xorth uurctmu, now in irmuii At a mcctlnsr of tho Rowan County immigration society, nciu on tuutwen ty-sixth day of November, instant, tho unuersiirneu wero mummied a com mltteo to momorallzo your honorable bouy in tneir lionair, on tlio suiyect of the encouragement of immigration to this State from other States of this Union, nnd from other Countries. Tlio society iioes not uoem it nccos- sary to go at any considerable length into tno reasons wnicn nnvonromnteu them to such a course they must bo well known to every membor of your honorable body. Sufllco it to sny that as one of tho results of tho lato disas trous civil war, our stato nas uecn loit destitute of monoy with the great mass of our people largely in debt that tho system of labor by which our lands were tiueu uoioro tno war nas uecn bro ken up and destroyed that much of our best population was swept away and destroyed by tho war that sinco tho cioso oi tuo war mucu 01 our laboring wnno population witnout nnv Kumcicnt cause, and, as tlioSociety believe, against tueirown ucst interests, nnvo migrated to oiner suites mat mucn or tno color- eel population, now much less to bo re lied upon as laborers than before their emancipation, have also died or loft the" State, and that, as u consequence, our buuu is now I'reatiy ticiiciciit uotn in capital nnd labor that wo havo but littlo left us except our fortllo lauds and vast mineral and other natural resour ces, without any adequate means for their development. In consideration of these facts tho Society would respectfully suggest to your honorable body tho propriety of granting u charter for a company to establish aliuo of direct communication between onoor nioroof tlionortsof this State nnd Kuropo, with a capital stock oi not less man seven mmiircu annuity thousand dol urs. for tho nurno&o of bringing Immigrants hithor direct from that country. Tlio Society would furth or uriro upon your Jionornuio noiiv t subscribe in tho nnmoof tho State, twi thirds of tho capital stock of Mild coin pnny. tho society lor many reasons which cannot bo stated here, nro o opinion that, with proper mnunirement such an enterprise would sustain itself. if indeed, It would not pay a handsomo dividend to tno HtocKiioiucrs, Tlio so clety, of eourso, contomplato that the steamers composing this line shall also oo employed in tuo export uuu import trade, iw well as in tho Importation of cm trrants. But If no divldonds should bo derlv cd from it, nnd oven If tho capital stock itsoii siiouui u timniciv no lost, oi which tho Society entertains no fears, it will yet provo of Immenso ndvnntago to tuo state. 11 onco a una oi muni gratlon can bo turned to our Statu from othor countries, tho Society bellovo that it win ston tno miirruiion oi our cm zens to other States. Audnotnnly this, but tho Society boliovo that in that event a tido of Immigration will be directed hithor from tho Northern S ntes. Northern capital, tlio society beliovc will then seek investment In our vnlu able agricultural and mineral lands, and no also laruoiy employed in manuiac- turiug purposes, for which tho vast and extensive water nower of our Stalo uf- fords thu aiOAtcst facilities. Tho result of oil this, the Society believe, would be to grently improve our system of agri culture, build up Tor our people a homo market, und finally to mako our good old Statu what nature Intended she should bo one of tho foremost States of this Union. These considerations, and tho largo nmotint of weal th thus to bo brought into, and created In our Stalo, nnd tlw consouuont diminution of taxes to our present population 'must, tho Society think, be reasons of snfllclcnt weight to luduco your houornblo body to glvo tho subject that consideration which Its great Importnuco domands.

Dkah Captain, I supposo that af ter so long uslleuco yourself nnd readers havo forgotten thu existence of your correspondent, but 1 shall mako no npol- igies, as porchnnco they might jiot bo so well appreciated as a still further con tinuance In my taciturnity. Tlio city has again fairly aroused from Its Summer siesta, and thero is every indication of a busy season during tho present session of Congress. Whllo wo havo Klstori, tho representative of high nigedy, at ono end of tho Avenue, wo may expect tho usual amount of low comedy at tho othor; a fair exemplifi cation of which was shown on Monday n Thad. Stevens's motion to adjourn during tho reading of tho President's Message. The Messago, by tho way, has given general satisfaction from its moderation nnd dignity of toiio. Tho election or a delegato from tlio District as proposed by It meets with many argument pro and con; tho former going to show that with a delegato In Congress tho Interests of tho District would recei vo moro atten tion, from its being his particular duly, whllo tho latter argue that what Is now n somo degree a duty of every member would in the event of such election be devolved upon ono individual who would porforco bo obliged to succumb under tho crushing weight of petitions cast upon him, or shunning a Tnrpclau fate, neglect tho many to promote tho advancement of tho few. Tho grand mass meeting and banquet given on Monday, as a welcome to tho returning Congress, must havo been in tensely gratifying to tlio ultra-lladlails, in spite of its soinbro color, nino tenths of tlio procession consisting of our color ed brethren. The procession, after a thorough airing through dltlerent parts of tlio city, wended its way to the Fair building on Seventh Street, cheering tho agcr beer establishment, when opposito it, of Geuoral (?)

All was not harmony nnd concord, as several urrests were necessary to bo mado in ordor to prc- servo the peuoe, In spllo of tho soothing olfect of ono of Forney's usually temper ate speeches.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMEND MENTS. Tnr. question, whether tho constitu tional amendment shall bo adopted, in volves a subject vastly moro important than tho immediate changes which these amendments nru designed to elfect. Tho first nnd great question is, can wo amend tho Constitution rightfully, so as to take from any Stnto a power which it has not voluntarily gran toil to thoUnited StntosV Does tho provision In tho Constitution, which authorizes its amendment, mean that a majority of two thirds in Con gress and threo fourths or tho states hnvo tho power to mako a monarchy out of tho republic, and that tho mi nority of tho pooplo and States aro bound to submit to such a fundamental change? If tho power of alteration oxtonds ns far as now assumed for tho purposes of theso proposed amendments, then it ls plain that the power also extends to tho complete obliteration of Statos. Tho exception in the Constitution forbidding amendments which would deprive n Stuto of Its equal representation In tho Senato can Itself bo amended and erased. Tho provision that no Stato shall bo di vided without its consent can bo amend eil and erased. It is as easy to mako Now York twoStates, and New England ono Stato, as It Is to pass thcso amend ments now beforo tho people If theso aro passed the precedent) will bo estab lished. Thero will then bo no limit to the changes which, In political oxclto ment, will bo urged on by Radical men on both sides. It is therefore tho very body of tho Constitution which is now In danger. Wo beseech tho Radical leaders to faco this great truth und give It duo ntteu turn. Tlio futuro of this country Is not within tho view of living prophet; but thero uro lunumornblo reasons for the bolicf that tho majority of moro than n million now opposing tho radical meas ures will in timugalu tho power in Con gross and In tho States. When thattlino conies, thero Is every reason to supposo that a sectional party will ugnln spring up. That sectional party, however, will not maintain Northern against Southern Intorests. It will in all probability bo a party In which tho South nnd tho Wi-st will bo united against tho Northeast. Tlio grand questions or political econ omy, which nro to bo tho controlling questions in our country, will bo very likely to enlist men in tho mnnufactur lug aud consuming parts of tho country, whllo tho Interests of tho producers will tend to bind thom together In other parts of tho country. Tho South nnd West nro moro homogeneous than tho South and tho Northeast. Tins people of tno South and West nro much allko, especi ally along our great rivers, where thoy havo a groat deal of Intercommunica tion. Jn that day of which wo speak, a a llrm, unnlterabio Constitution will bo an Invaluable guarantee to tho Fast and tho North. A weak Constitution, easily amended, tho subject ofull tho winds of popular caprice, will bo as useless as the paper on which it Is printed. Adopt theso amendments now, and wo shall havo established a precedent which takes all tho strength nnd firmness of tho Constitution away from It, and de prives It of tho vital force, which force is necessary to permanonco.

TIIE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY. Titnurc never was a period in tho history of any country when It was moro dllllcult to foresee what n year or uven n few months may bring forth. Tho speculations of tho wisest hnvo been hawked In all that, related to tho war nnd Its consequences. Tlio mo-it, far-sighted havo been ns much nt fault, sinco tlio war ended, ns when it was rag ing. In tho early period of tlio peace, tilings looked hopefully, nnd, under tho benign Influences of u patriotic Presi dent, tho wounds between tho sections seemed to bo rapidly healing. But, ever sinco' Ills constitutional policy has been trodden under foot by Congress, matters havo beou getting worse, and apprehensions hnvo been" expressed by men of tho soberest Judgment, that tho party passions now raging so furiously Will terminate In a civil war, extending throughout lliowliololength and breadth of tho laud, Wo are not of tho despair ing school, but It does seem to us that tho great chasm mado by tlio late war Is not going to bo ns readily bridged over as wo had believed and hoped ; that tho earthquake, whoso rumblings havo not yet subsided, but seem to bo Increasing, has given a shock not only to our institutions, but to tho character of our pcoplo, and that wo are not what wo were a nation prlzlngconstltutional liberty and representative government nbovonll othor human blessings ; that, at tho present moment, tho public mind is rather yearning for stability, for ro poso, for security of property and of life, than for the semblance of freo forms, without tho substance. Thero Is per vading all men's thoughts an uneasy apprehension that thero is at this mo ment no great Interest of society which is not set completely at tho mercy of fanaticism and party passion. Tho np-. proaching session of Congress, it is fear ed, will add fresh causes of dlsquletund alarm, and the call for tho" veterans of tho Republic" to protect that body against a danger which does not exist, is among tlio most ominous signs of tho times. Whither nro wo tending V Farther and farther every day from the old land-marksof tho Constitution, from old principles, ideas, mid traditions ; but whoroundhow will our voyage termi nate'.' Thero are many people who aro beginning to feel careless whether Con gress gives us republicanism or mon archy, centralization or Stnto rights, so thoy glvo us something dofinito and permanent. Baltimore Trunscrijrt. A NEW ERA OF 

"SOUTHERN CHIVALRY." It is evident that a new spirit has been evoked ni tho South by tho cir cumstances of the times, which must result in substantial benefits to thnt sec tion of our common country. Tlio sys tem of slavo labor having been over thrown by tho rudo shock of war, thous nnds of young men who, under tlio old regime of what was called tho " South ern Chivalry," had been taught to des piso labor nnd laborious business pur suits, now realize tho necessity of earn ing a subsistence for themselves, nnd their mothers and sisters. And many of them havo, In thospirltof truochlv- nlry, risen with the emergency, casting away Ingrained prejudices and assuming tho proper responsibilities of the hour, entered upon their duties manfully. In cited by nn honorablo pride, many hnvo put their hands to the plough on their paternal acres, determined that thoso who have a right to look to them for support shall have it. These young men aro tho true chivalry of theSouth ; their conduct shames that of thoso who aban don their natlvo soil to seek adventures In other lands, or thoso wiio loaf nnd swagger about, marking their ludolenco under a pretended chivalrous pride. There is a capital field In tho South for her young men to distinguish them selves in, nnd to provo how " peace hath her victories no less renowned than war." Let them tako hold of work res olutely, begin nt tho foundation, nnd build themselves a great edlflco of agri cultural and incchtiulc.il prosperity, Thero Is a great lack of capital In tho South, but this gtvos them Immunity from tho ovlls of speculation. Capital will follow whon hard labor has been Intelligently applied to tho soli of thoso remarkablo agricultural regions. Thev havo tho best cotton nnd tobacco lauds in tlio world, ami with theso they can socuro riches and pecuniary Independ ence If thoy will discard their old pro- Judlcc3 against industry. Wo observe that tho Southern presses are exhorting their young men to stay at homo and dovelop tho resources of their own Stales, by working diligently thorn solves, and availing themselves of such labor as can bo procured, until their waste places are built up and plenty shall again smllu upon thu laud. This Is good advice, and if tho young men of tho South follow It they will bo In a con dition to snap their lingers ut tho poli ticians and "tho rest of mankind." Xationul Jlcpubllvan.

JlAMiiroN,OhIo,hasnrellcofUiopast, It exists, or rather ho exists In tho per son of an pld negro, familiarly known ns Tom. A regular, genuine African negro Is Tom not one of the half color ed evidences of Southern civilization, but a thorough Guinea negro, with tho thick lips and tint nose betokening his origin, and with all tho eccentricities of speech, action, and ninnncr charac teristic of his race Ho was brought to this country In a slaver somo time near tho close of tho lust century, though nt what preciso time Itlsdlfllcult to nay, as Tom's Ideas regarding dates nro rather confused. Indeed, It Is Impossible to fix upon his precise age In reply to a query upon this point ho "reckoned ho must bo ubout flvo hundred." But Judg ing from othor data, It is probable Tom ls somewhere between ninety-fivo nnd a hundred years of age. Ho was pres ent at the surrender of Corn wallis, which occurred in 1781, or eighty-flvo years ago. Ho says ho was " right smart of a boy" at that tlmo, and allowing his " right smart" to bo ton years, It would mako Tom nlnoty-flvo years old, which Ls probably not far from tho actual ago of this vcncrnbloand veritable descend ant of limn. The chief Interest attaching to Tom ls the fact that ho was prcsont at tho his torical event above named, whero ho saw General Washington, of whom his recollection is quito distinct, nnd his ad miration intense. He Is duly sensible that there aro few, If indeed, u slnglo person now surviving who witnessed that scene, and it confers upon him no small sense of Importance llo was own ed at the tlmo by a planter living In tho vicinity of Yorktown, whither he had boon brought soon after landing from tho slnvcr ut somo point en the Caroli na coast. As might bo expected from tho nnturo and character of the African, tho Impos ing display attendant upon tho surren der mado a deep impression upon his memory, and ho relates with considera ble minuteness tho details of the affair. The red coats of tho British particular ly struck his fancy, aud ho describes witli much gusto and satisfaction tho ceremo ny of grounding arms, giving nn Illus tration of tho ceremony with his Iron pointed walking-staff. Washington pass ed near whero Tom was standing on tlio occasion, mounted, ho says, on a whlto horse, and looked " mighty grand." From his earnestness and minuteness of description, it Is clear Tom is n truth ful witness, and porhaps tho only ono left In tho laud. He ls still stout, con sidering his advanced ago, nnd bids fair to llvo out another decado of Wiutors In pleasant wenthor ho passes much of his time sunning himself in front of a saloon on High Street, whoso friondly proprietor provides him with n comfort ablo arm-chair. He has n hlghly-dovol-oped tastofor whlskoy, and no ono need complain of his refusal of an invitation. lYltogothor Tom is n genuine eccentric! ty and rolle Cincinnati Commercial. THE CONDITION OF MEXICO Tin: sum of what may bo drawn from tho eonliieUng reports from Mexico is that tho French aro roally preparlug to evacuate tho country, and that Maxi- milium is trying to get away as fust as ho cm. Nnpoloon lias ordered his aids to hurry up tho evacuation, and his Minister has given our Government n list of tho vessels which havo actually sailed, or nro sailing from Franco, to take tho troops homo. This, next to flie nctual embarkation of tho roops, is tho most satisfactory news that wo could havo. Maximilian's baggago Is at Vora Cruz, and that uncrownod King himself is nt Orizaba, whero ho has been living for threo weeks ns a private gentleman, In which station wo wish him nil tho hap plnoss and prosperity his mostsaiiguino dreams call for. Tho French now hold tho Capital Vera Cruz, Puebla, and Orizaba as their only possessions in tho country. They aro said to bo fortifying tho latter placo as an impregnnblo stronghold. Why they should bo doing this when they aro going to glvo up tho post so soon ls ono of tho mysteries that soem to sur round all Franco-Moxlcau questions and facts. A great victory of tho Liberals Is nn nounced in tho capturo of Jalapa on tho sixth. Tho placo win strongly fortified nnd garrisoned, and was taken after a cannonading of several days. After tho ovacuation tho country will most need quiet till tho government can bo organized aud a regular eloctlou held which shall decido upon tho claims of Juarez, Ortega, and all other aspirants. To this end it is but Just that thoso who nro fighting her battles shall bp protect ed until election day from tho incursion of schemers from our torrltory. After that it should bo left to tako caro of itself. A MATRIMONIAL SQUABBLE. A uatiikh singular caso of matrimo nial infelicity camo before Justice Wal thcr yesterday morning. A young Eng lishman, eighteen years of ago, named Robert Whltton, was arraigned boforo tho jiistico on a peaco warraut sued out by his wife, who is about hlxteen years old. A couplo.of ballot-girls figured in tho proceedings, and took a lively inter est in tho affair. About n year ago young Whltton was living in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. At tho same time Miss Lucy Armstrpng was leading an unquiet llfo in Cincin nati with her mother. For somo cause, not necessary to explain, Lucy left her mother and went to Pittsburg. Sho thero bcvnmu acquainted with Whltton, and nn lutlniaoy sprang up between them. Tho young girl was in needy circum stances, and received assistance from tho English boy, for which sho was, of cour.-o, grateful, hint Summer Lucy uud her mother nnd Whltton camo to this city, uud on tho seventh of July the lovers were married by Justice Nlor nieler, without tho consent, it is allcgod, of tho mother, For a tlmo they lived happllyi Whltton obtained n situation as Walter at tho "Hotel do Paris," on Jfth Strcett and Lhoy nnd her mother Were engaged nt tho Museum. The oung wife became iiemmintcd Willi tlio ballet-girls ut the Museum, and by their nlluenco was Induced to separate from icr husband. A reconciliation was ef fected, but thoy soon quarrelled again, uud once more soparated. A short tlmu , ago Whltton went to Cincinnati, and mado arrangements to remove Witli ins Wife to that city" j but on returning ho could not find her. Ho Introduced him self to some of tho detectives, uud stated that he was In search of his sister, who was supposed to bo In a houeo of ill fanie Ho put up at tho Southern Ho ld, nnd obtained credit by telling tho story of his orrlng sister. At ongth ho discovered tho whereabouts Of hu wife, who had her elTects paeked up ready to start for Cincin nati. Whltton took nu nxo, and go ng to his wife's room, threatened to kill her. For this sho had htm nrrestcd, but when tho casociimu beforo the Jury, the young husband cried like u child, Imputing the blame to tho two ballot- girls, that the jury acquitted him, nnd last night ho was arrested and taken to tho calaboose on u charge of vagrancy, nnd if it is proved that he has been sponging nt tlio hotels, ho will probably bo sent to the workhouse St. Louts Democrat of Novimlicr 17.
