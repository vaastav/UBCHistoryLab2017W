General Rising of the Dutch in Cape Colony Now Anticipated. EVEN THE BLACKS MAY REVOLT, Details of ficnernl Gatncrt-'s Assault Upon the Determined Burghers Smothered by War Ofli- clals Latest News of the Strife. London, Dec. 11. Later detiils re garding the disaster to General Get acre's column show that but for the magnificent work of tho British artil lery the disaster would have been far more extensive, as the Incessant Boer shell Are in the midst of the repulsed infantry ultimately led to disorder, which only escaped developing into a rout through tho batteries of artillery occupying successive positions cover ing the retreat, thus drawing a por tion oi the Boers' galling, fire. Apparently the British were set an Impossible task and were treacherous ly guided. After a trying march and being under arms 16 hours, they at tacked the wrong part of the Boer position, where the hill was impreg nable, and the burghers were esti mated to number 6,000 men, instead of 2,500, as the spies had reported. There is little in the story to miti gate the Intense humiliation occa- Tho naval 4.7-inch gun again took up position north of the camp, while the howitzer battery was posted south east on the Jeft of tho Boers. Both opened a hot fire with lyddite shejls and shrapnel, to which tho Boers sharply replied with a dozen guns, thUB unmasking their position, which was tho pbject of tho British man euver. After an hour's flrlpg, the Boor guns were styencecj. The howitzers searched the trenches and then threw shell' after shell Upon the hills, the explosion of the lyddite causing the whole ground over an extensive area to arise Jn the air in dense, brown clouds. A Boer long gun was disman tled. It now appears that the Boers in tend thai tho next fight is to tako plac it Magersfontein. Apparently Spyto fontein is not defended or the Boera jre unwilling to unmask their position there, as the replies to the British artillery ivere all from guns at Magersfonteln.

The war office "was besieged with anxious relatives and the successive editions of the newspapers were eagerly scanned. Men and women were equally persist ent in pleading for information, but the authorities either do not possess any or are not prepared to publish any at present The most serious aspect of the affair is tho effect it Is likely to have on the Dutch in Cape Colony who have been wavering as to whether to throw in their lot with the Boers. Hosts of tho northern farmers are now likely to Join the rebellion. Defeat is also seri ous because it will delay the junction of General Gatacre with General French at Naauwport The plan was for their combined forces to relieve tho .pressure on Lord Methuen's col umn. i Tho affair has caused the most de pressing influences everywhere, not ex cepting the stock exchange, w,here con sols were at the lowest price in many years, and ou.th African securities slumped, not, so much on account of the military reverse, which is retriev able, but owing to the profound appre hension as to its presont effect No great surprise would now bo be felt if General Gatacre's reverse resulted in Capo Colony becoming aflame from end to end. The queen sent her private secre tary, Sir Arthur Biggo, specJaUy from Windsor Castle to glean full details n,t (ho war office for her majesty re specting General uatacres reverse. Discussing the defeat of General Gat acre at Storraberg, tho daily news papers state that the event is in tho highest degree deplorable; that it will' toll against the British nmong the Dutch of Capo Colony, and even among! the natives.

Mr. Mason (Ills.) then called up his resolution offered a few days ago ex pressing the sympathy of the senate with the South African republics In their war with Great Britain.

Ho urged that the Interests of the United States was aroused by the facts that tho South African war was a struggle between democracy and roy altybetween the divine right of kings and the divine right of men.

Mr. Overstreet (Ind.), who is to be in charge of the measure on tho floor, opened the general debate with a set speech. "The tremendous Increase of silver coin under tho operation of the laws of 1878 and 1890," said Mr. Overstreet, among other things, "created a doubt as to the ability of the government to maintain the parity of all its money. Tho difference between the intrinsic and faco valuo was a government obli gation, so established by congressional act. The ability of the government to bear this burden was never ques tioned. The mere money obligation .Imposed by the law created no serlou embarrassment It was tho principle involved, coupled with the repeated efforts by a very considerable number of the people of the country to estab lish absolute free coinage of silver, which shook public confidence and produced the fear that a change of tho monetary standard would result ''If the legal standard today is tho gold standard, under the act of 1873, a positive statute to thqt effect can do no harm. If, op the ether hand, there is any reasonable doubt, it shoujd be dispelled by a statute plain and clear In Its terms. "Tho proposition to allow national bauks to issue circulation to tho par value of -tho bonds deposited for their security is nqlther new nor partisan. It has been recommended by four pres idents anjl flvo secretaries pf tho treas ury, and bills contalplng such provi sion have been introduced in congress and supported by members of both po litical parties. It Is entirely consist ent with tho presont banking system." Another" Double Star. Chicago, Dec. 11. Professor G. W.

Nearly all the im portant labor organizations are now affiliated with the American Federa tion of Labor." Special effort is recommended for an exhibit at tho Paris exposition of the economic and social progress made in tho United States. On the question of the boycott Mr. Gompers says: "In insisting upon our right to em ploy tho boycott to secure relief from onerous conditions, or to secure im proved conditions, we realize how nec efisary it is to employ so powerful a weapon with tho greatest care and discretion. The wanton or unneces sary placing of a business house upon the unfair or boycott list is to bring that weapon Into disrepute and ridi cule and to render It worse than In effective, since It then must react upon us to our disadvantage." On the subject of "trusts" he says: "The grelt wrongs attributable to the trusts are their corrupting influ ence on the politics of the country, but as the state has always been tho rep resentative of tho wealth possessors, wo shall be compelled to endure this evil until the tollor3 aro organized and educated to the degree that they shall know that tho state Is by right theirs, and Anally and justly come to their own, while never relaxing In their ef forts to secure tho very best possible economic, social and material Improve ment in their condition," Tho aqtion of the military during Idaho mining troubles is severely con demned, as fa tho "expansion" policy of tho administration.
