Ths threat of Preaident H. H. Have meyer, of the American Sugar Refining company, to shut down all the refiner* iea of the company in Boaton, New York and Philadelphia, ia probably one of those cold corporation bluffs that are frequently made to influence congres aional action. California ia indifferent, however. Our beet sugar outfit ia suf ficient for all ordinary needa, and tbe profit thereon in caae of a Havemeyer •but down will be proportionate to tbe increased demand for our product. Tna bill to pension veteran teachers fn the public schools, wbich will be pre sented at tbe coming legislature, is al ready meeting witb strenuous opposition throughout the state. It is urged tbat teaohers are not compelled to teach, and that because they bave found it profit able to adopt teaching as a profession is not a valid reason why the taxpayers should remunerate those who bave drawn salaries for teaobing during a series of yeara. It ia contended that tbe farmer, tbe tradesman, tbe profes sional man and otbera who have been long in aervice for their own emolument are entitled to aa much conaideration from the people wbo pay tax ea as those who bave been instructing tbe youth of tbe state. These arguments are of course fallacious, but they are very prevalent, and it looka very dubious juat now for the teaobera' penaion bill. As am indication of return ing pros perity tbere oould be no better criterion than the railroad earnings during a dull season of the year at a period when tbe finances of the country are only recov ering from a condition almost bordering on panic. Tbe Southern Railway com pany, for the third week ia November, reports an increase of $24,883 in earn ings; tbo Missouri, Kansas and Texae, for the aame period, ahowa an increase of $24 637; the Norfolk and Western an increase of $20,750; tbe Northern Paci fic $22,802, tbe International and Great Northern $22,746, the Missouri Pacifio $22,000, the St. Louis Southwestern $12,000, the Toledo, St. Louis and Kan sas City $10,735, tbe Texas and Pacific $9 990, the Lake Brie and Western $10, --037, the Weatern New York and Penn sylvania $3300, the New York, Ontario and Western $>:>. the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville $2180, the Chesapeake and Ohm $4254, tbe Kvaneville and Terre Haute $1553, the Cincinnati, Jaokaon and Michigan $1231, tbe Kvana ville and Indianapolis $784, the Mexican National $4519, and the Kanawha and Michigan $869. There are many governments tbat ewn and operate railways, and tbe fact tbat these governments are rendering better service to the people and charging tbem less than ths private corporations for tbat service is an object lesson that should have some weight witb tbe rep resentatives of the people in this coun try. Tbe German empire owns about 21.840 miles of railway , Portugal owns about one-ball the railways in that country; Francs owns about 2000 miles of railway; South Australia owns ber railway system ; Chile owns 670 miles of railway; Japan owns 60S miles; Baden owns 829 miles; Sweden owns 1645 miles; England and Wales own 14,094 miles; Belgium o»na about 2000 miles; Hesse owns 226 miles of ber railway sys tem; Cbina owns and operates ali ber railways; Victoria owns all ber rail roads, 2341 miles; Oldenburg owns 222 miles of ber railroad; Brazil owns end operates 2091 mites of railway ; Toland and Caucasia own 5005 miles; New Sooth Wales owns 2182 miles; Norway bas 929 miles of railway—ali her own ; Scotland bas 3118 miles belonging to the state; Peru baa 1625 miles of railroads owned by the state; Austria owns and operates nearly 2000 miles of railway; Bavaria has 2896 miles of railway owned by the government; Denmark has about 1000 miles of railroad owned by the gov ernment Some 1137 mile*of railway in Finland belong to Kusaia.

THE 

"HERALD" AHEAD. The Herald yesterday morning dis tanced it! looal contemporaries in pre* tenting tbe president's menage to the people of Los Angeiea. The message wai delivered to congrcii at 2 o'clock in tbe afternoon and tbe Herald wai in the bandi of the newiboyi at 12 o'clock in the morning. It wai a volnminoui document, con taining 12,000 wordi and filling fifteen oolnmni of solid brevier. It wai beyond the capacity of our contemporaries whose entcrpriie ii content with tbe or dinary processes of conservative effort Tbe Herald realized that tbe citizens of Loa Angelei were entitled to the earliest information concerning the prnident'i viewi on the affairs of the nation; tbe Herald pos sessed tbe newipapir inatinct tbat aohievea reaulta; tbia waa the combina tion that placed tbe Herald on tbe streets yesterday hours ahead of ita alow-going contemporaries. Tbe people will appreciate tbia effort on tbeir behalf, and will hereafter look to tbe Herald (or their newa in all great emergencies. We give them aa anrancetbat they will in no inatanoe ba disappointed. The Herald ia firat of all a newspaper, and will fill that field to the excluaion of all competitors. WHY IT 

HAPPENED. Even enthusiastic Democrat! are not surprised at the remit oi the munioipal election in Loa Angelei. Tbe conserva tives are oontent to congratulate them selves on the (cot tbat it is no worse—a "tidal wave." an "upheaval," a "land slide" or something of that sort. The defeat of Mr. Ryan is a misfor tune —not for himself or hia party, but for the city. It is unfortunate that par tisan prejudice blinded so many cit'zens to tbe fact that the Democratio candi date gave better promise of a progres sive, public spirited administration than either of hia opponents. But the result as far as be was ooncerned might have been expected, baaing a calculation of probabilitiea on tbe Republican major ity of the gubernatorial election. Still, tbe figurea ahow that if the Democrats of Loa Angeiea had voted aa a minority party aa in duty bound to vote they would bave won. The apathy of a Loa Angeiea Democrat in a crisis ia some thing to make tbe bsavena weep. Mr. Rader, as spokesman and pledge maker for tbe Republicans, bas made many fair promises. If these promises are redeemed or if an honest effort is made to redeem them, that portion of the Democracy wbo bave the welfare of tbe community at heart will swallow tbeir regret at tbis defeat and hope ior a more satisfactory iaaue next time. If the ensuing adminiatration ia not true to ia promieee ; if it does not make an earnest effort to advance the interests of tbe city; if it does not exerciae a public epirit commensurate with tbe community'! ambition there will be a reveraal of tbe current decision at tbe next municipal election. Even without a full Democratic vote tbe popular ver dict will be adverse. Loa Angeiea will bave good government at any coat. It is apparent from the returns that the Democrats did not all vote tbeir ticket. They chased after strange gods, including Hazard and Schnabel. Some of them, for reaaona beat known to tbemeelvea, voted for Rader. The Re publican votea for Ryan may be counted on the lingers of two banda. And of the wreck the Democrata aave four councilmen —Snyder from the Sao ond ward, Pessell from the Sixth, Ash man from the Seventh and Savage from the Eighth—and with that tbe tale is told. It was not a rout all along the line, but our flank was turned, our center broken and our baggage train captured. We saved our picket line and we covered tbe retreat of our light horse cavalry. We didn't even get a school director. The victory is clearly witb tbe enemy. The Republicans fought nobly. Tbey polled 5515 votes for Rader, which is only 181 leaa than they gave Mr. Estee for governor. Tbe Democrats fought ignobly. They gave Ryan 3506 votea — 901 less than they gave Budd. Come to tbink of it, tbe reault does look like a "tidal wave" and all that sort of thing. But the Democrats have only them selves to blame. Tbere is one gleam of sardonic exulta tion tbat flashes like a scitnetar in the moonlight, emanating from the defeat of Henry T. Hazard—not because Henry T. Hazard was defeated, for he was only an interloper in the fight-—a guerilla bushwhacking on the outskirts of tbe melee —but because his defeat is a re buke to tbe man who equipped him for bis predatory campaign. There woe wild rejoicing at the overthrow of this political Baal, and even the "widows oi Ashur" were not "loud in their wail." There is aome compensation even in tbia Democratic defeat. The Examinei's Christmas edition will be issued by women. Women will write the editorials, handle tbe "scoops," edit the copy of "stars" and "sltatee," scissor the exchanges, fur nish ideas for cartoons, invent "features" and "make up" tbe paper at 3 o'clock in the morniug. That's one clause of the contract. Womon will "head up" the tolegrapb, order news, "schedule the local," answer the tele phone, reply to the queries of corres pondents, receive cranks and retract misstatements. That's another phase ol tba proposition. Women will solicit "LOS" ANGELES TIER ALU: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1894 advertisements, collect tbe billa, man age the bnaineaa office and figure the oircnlation. That'a tbe financial end of tbe bargain. It* a great icheme, and one tbat will not only enhance the pop ularity of tbe paper, bnt reault profitahy for the objeot in view, whicb ia charity. All the proceeda ol thia edition are to be turned into a fund for the Children's hospital. It ii a noble effort and the people of California will respond nobly to the appeal thm generously and uniquely made. It ii the belt work ever undertaken by a California news paper and tbe Examiner will achieve a wider fame thereby than ft bac se cured by even greater and more ex pensive enterprises. THE MESSAGE. It wai probably not tba intention of Mr. Cleveland to addren congress and tba American people editorially. Ai a conieqaenoe bil meeiage il almost ex clusively a review of eventi, leaving tbe reader to adjust and form an individual opinion. Hp quotei iiberally from de partment reports and confines himself to facte ai presented in atate papers re garding our foreign relation! and tbe ef fect of tbe internal policial of other countries on our own. In all tbil Mr. Cleveland advert! only occiiionally to the effect of the conditiona aa be bai found them and then only by inferenoe and indirection. By hii qualifying and introductory remarks we may arrive at the president's own opinion concerning tbe lubjecti he diiousies, and as a rule be hai been content to merely arrange and formulate the facts and statistics without indicating wherein they operate for good or ill and offering no inggestion of penonal approval or disapproval. On the subject of civil service reform, the public health, tarilT legislation, bond issues and banking and currency he re iterates and reaffirms previous utter ances, adhering cloiely to hii policy in each initance and ibowing wherein it has been beneficial and salutary. The message is not "a statesmanlike document" in the baokneyed sense of tbat term, but it is a valuable state paper and one which will commend itaelf to thinking citizena, preaenting, aa it doea, in condensed form, tbe aalient featurea of our history during tbe paat six montba. In this form it is a safer document than one tbat would pleaae tbe political partisan better. | The president's review of tariff legisla tion is based on sound Democratic doc trine, and his recommendation that tbe additional duty of one-tenth of a cent per ponnd laid upon sugar imported from countries paying a bounty be abro gated, is in line with tbe principle of free competition as opposed to a monopoly of staples and the necessaries of life. Mr. Cleveland's aasumption tbat tbe new tariff polioy, built upon the theory that it is well to encourage snob impor tations aa our people need, and that tbeir producta and manufacturea should find markets in every part of tbe habit able globe, ia a proposition tbat cannot be successfully refuted and will meat with unanimous approval by the people. The only objection that will be urged to thia plain home protective polioy will emanate from the syndicates, trusts and monopolies, which are in no sense a part of the people, except as parasites are a part of tbe human body. Tbe people of California would have been gratified if tbe president had en larged upon the Nioaraguan canal pro ject. At the present moment tbere ia no subject of more vital intereat to tbe Pacific coast. A poaitive declaration by Mr. Cleveland tbat it waa tbe policy of the administration to encourage by every legitimate meana the completion of the canal and to control the water way for tbe commercial aggrandizement of thia country, would have palliated many eina of commiaeion and omission charged against the Democracy by par tisan antagonists on tbis coast. Tbat only the merest reference waa made to tbe Nicaragua canal in tbe preaident'a message cannot be regarded aa an over eight, and an explanation from tbe president ia in order. It ia possible that he does not thoroughly understand the temper of our people in this matter, and it may be tbat be does not realize tbat tbe canal is regarded on the Pacific coast as an absolute emancipation from tbe thralldum of tbe Southern Pacific railroad corporation. As a whole tbe meaaage ia worthy of the closest consideration, not only by our representatives in congress, but by the people. It is at leaat an index to important queetiona of atate policy and will afford ample acope for profitable discussion. The assembling of congress yeaterday, after a receaa of tbree months, does not presage ultra important legislation at thia aesaion, which will be brief and largely interrupted by holiday inter missions. The Democrats are naturally discomfited by their overwhelming de feat, and tbey will attempt no retalia tory legislation merely to force upon tbe people issues that bave been decided at tbe ballot box. This would be undem ocratic and unpatriotio, and tbe De mocracy has never been guilty oi a pol icy so suicidal. The remainder con greaa will merely endeavor to complete the work they have In band, and they will leave for their auccesaors a clean docket upon which to inscribe the theories of Republicanism, content to let the people once more judge between tbe representatives of the two great par ties. It is more than probable that tbe mistakes of the Republican majority will be aa egregious as those charged against tiie Democratio excess of repre sentation. Iv the meautime it may be discovered that the Democratio admin istration lias accomplished more good for tbe country than is now credited to it. Cou.is P. Huntington is preparing for death. lie bus built a huge granite mausoleum at Woodlnwncemetery, New York, and it is said that nothing iv tbe world approaches it for durability. The storms may beat upon its gates of bronze; the lightningo may twine about ts Doric columns ; the years may come and tbe yoars may go and tbe iron tooth of time may gnaw ceaselessly apon the sculptured eepulehre, but the tomb will atand, defiant of every as sault. Not so ite inmate. Long befoie tbe first mat has eaten through the metal of tbe sarcophagus in wbioh the corpse of Huntington wai laid when freah, Huntington will have orumbled to duat io Impalpable that the breath of a pauper's infant migbt loatter it—so fine tbat tbe particlee would not flicker aa motel in a sunbeam. The tomb of Huntington will endure, but the grand egotiit who reared it will be aa one wbo haa never existed—a shadow effaced; a whisper unheard. The oorpae of Hunt ington will not even outlast the memory of Huntington. Posterity will perpetu ate tbe biatory of tbe aim of the aged trafficker even unto the third and fourth generation of tbem tbat hate him. The New York World argaes forcibly In favor of an issue of bonda—since bonds muat be iasued —which will bene fit tbe email capitalist, Ths fact tbat a syndicate is able to monopolize the en tire issue of bonda abowi how hopeleae it is for amall capitalists to attempt to compete with combinationa unlcaa the loan ia made popular by law. While all untaxed bonds drawing intereat from tbe taxpayers are detrimental, tbe bond whioh does least harm ie the one tbat gets into tbe hands of the small in vestor and stays there until it ia called in. 

AMUSEMENTS. Manager Bouvier, of the Baldwin theater, in San Francisoo, last evening telegraphed the Herald aa follows: An audience hardly leas fashionable or leaa in numbers than on the opening night of hie engagement greeted Mr. Salvini tonight at tbo Baldwin theater, to witnesa Paul Keater'a new romantic drama, Zamar, for the firat time in San Francisoo, The story of tbe play is laid among the eventful episodes of early Spanish history. The plot rests upon a queation as to the legitimate succession to tbe throne in consequence of an early marriage nf Alpbonzo to the Gypsy Queen laidra whicb waa diaaolved by tba nope. It transpires tbat a Gypsy cbiaitain named Zamar waa tbe issue of thia marriage, but be waives his right in favor of his hall brother Ferdinand, preferring hia own Gypay royalty. He supports hia brother's claim against the conspiring regent Philip, tbe atrugglea between the two factiona involving many excit ing incidents. Tbere are two quaint end exquisite love stories running through the play whioh makes it ac romantic aa any lover of tbia school of drama can deaire. Tbe play ia full of action, it waa re ceived by tbe audience with almost con tinuous applause and the final curtain rant down one of tbe moat enthusiastic audiences Mr. Salvini has had in thia city. Aa tbe Gypsy Chief Hamar, Sal vini wae powerful to a degree and pre sented a moat pictoreeque appearance. Outaide of tbe atar individual hits were made by Miaa Dickson aa the' Gypsy Maid Hinda, and Mies Moretti as tbe Princess Isabel. The New Vienna Baffat offers an on usually fine programme this week. If patronage ia a sign of how thia place of amusement is liked then tbe New Vi enna Buffet ia one of the most popular placea of amusement in Los Angeles. Carmen, the Spanish dancer.

Witnesses Testify ea to the Defendant's Good Character, Woodland, Dec. 3.—The Hatch case was reaumed today. Several witnesses testified as to Hatch's prsvious good obaracterand aa to tbe time be was laat aeen on tbe day of July 11th. General Hart's method of queationing R. H. Buckingham, one of bia own wit nesses, brought out many objections from Attorney Cook, whicb were sus tained by the court. General Hart wanted the witn sat to state positively when be bad last seen Hatch on July 11th, bnt witness would only say; "About three-quarters of an hour before the train went out." Tbe defendant's mother was tbe laat witneaa. Mra. Hatcb'a testimony was to the effect that she had married 21 years ago, and that ber son was not of age. Attorney Cook tried to prove tbat young Hatch bad sworn falaely when be said be waa 21 yeara of age when be procured hia marriage licence. Thia brought General Hart to his feet with an objection wbich was auatained by the court. A SLUMP IN SUGAR Refineries Working oa m Reduced Seale — A Fall In Frloea. Nsw Yorr, Dec. 3. —An afternoon paper prints tbe following as emanating from President Havemeyer of tbe Ameri can Sugar Refinery company: "Work has been resumed in tba re fineries on a very rtduced scale. Don't anticipate tbe passage of a free sugar bill. Bpreckels' refinery it working about one-half tbe regular force. The Brooklyn refinery ia idle." Mr. Havemeyer then denied reportßof differences with other directors. NOT 

GUILT*. Tha Oarlln Strikers Acquitted on Sneond Trial. Carson, Nev , Dec. 3.—The argument in tbe eecond trial of the Carlin strikers, charged witb obatructing and delaying tbe United Statea mails, closed this afternoon and the case went to the jury, who retired, and after 20 minu'es' de liberation brought in a verdict of not guilty. When the news of the verdict was rsceived the greatest enthusiasm waa manifested, fire bells were rung and aalutea were fired. Mr. John P. Wetmore, a prominent real estate agent of San Angelo, Texas, bas used Cbamberlain'a Colic, Cholera and Diarrbcci Remedy in hia family for several yeara as occasion required,. and always with perfect success. He says: "I find it o perfect cure for our baby when troubled with colic or dysentery. I now feel that my outfit is not complete without a bottle of tbie remedy at home or on a trip away Irom horns."

THE MESSAGE. {Continued from Filth page.] oreaae their circulation, thus permit* ting inch increase of or redaction within the limit of the 75 per cent of capital, to be qaickly made an eruer gencies ariae. In addition* to tbe grantee fund required, it is proposed to provide a safety fond for tbe immedi ate redemption of the circulation notes of failed banks by impos ing a small annual tax, say one-hall of one per cent upon the average circu lation of eacb bank until tbe fund amounts to 5 per oeut of tbe total circu lation outstanding. When a bank fails, its guarantee fund is to be paid Into this safety fund, and its notes are to be redeemed in the first instance from such safety fund thus augmented; any impairment of suob fund caused thereby to be made good from tbe immediate available cash assests ol said bank, and il these should be insuttioient, auch impairment to be made good by a pro rata assessment among other banka, thair contributions conatitnting a firat lien npon the aaseta of tbe failed bank in favor Of tbe con tributing banka. Aa a further aaourity, it is contem plated that tbe existing provision fixing the individual liability of stockholders ia to be retained and the bank's indebt edness on account of its circulating notea is to be made a first lien on all lie assets. For the purpose of meeting tbe expense of printing notes, official auperviaion, cancellation and other like charges, there shall be paid a tax, say one-half of one per cent per annum, oo tbe average amount of notes In circula tion. It ia further provided tbat there shall bo no national bank notes issued of less denomination than $10; tbat eacb national bank, except in tbe case of a failed bank, shall redeem or re lease ite notes in the first instance at its own office or at the agenciea to be desig nated by it, and tbat no fixed reserve need be maintained on aocount of de posits. Another very important feature of tbia plan ie the exemption of state banks from taxation by tbe United Stales, incases where it is shown to the satisfaction of the aecretary of the treasury and the comptroller of tbe cur rency by banka claiming auch exemp tion, that they have not bad outstand ing tbeir circulating notes exceeding 75 per cent of tbeir paid up and unim paired capital. tbat tbeir stockholders are individually liable for tbe redemption of tbeir cir culating notea to the full extent of their ownership of atock; tbat the liability of auch banka upon tbeir circulating notea constitutes, under tbeir atate law, tbe firat lien upon tbeir aaaete that auch banks have kapt and maintained a guarantee in United Statea legal tender notes, including treasury notes oi 1890, equal to o0 per cent of their outstanding circulating notea, and tbat aucb banks have promptly redeemed their circulat ing notes when presented at tbeir prin cipal or branch offices. It ia quite likely that this aobeme may be usefully amended in aome of tbe de tails, but lam satisfied it furnishes tbe basis for a a very gieat improvement in our present banking and ourreccy eya tem. I conclude tbis communication, fully appreciating that tba responsibility (or all lsgislation affecting tbe people of the United Stales reata npon their repre sentatives in congreas, and aeauring them tbat whether in accordance with recommendations I bave made or not, I shall be (lad to co-operate in perfecting any legislation that can add to tbe pros perity and welfare of oar country.
