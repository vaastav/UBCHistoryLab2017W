The British press is displeased with President Harrison's message, but does any real American caret Mr. Cleveland' evident dislike of oflice-seekers betrays inconsistency. Two months ago he was so much in earnest to get an office that he paid $10,000 to promote his chances. Word comes that the foreign steam ship companies will send a powerful lobby to defeat the proposition to re strict immigration. If it succeeds, the country will know that its Congress bo longs to the foreign ship-owners. The monument commissioners, who have outraged ttie patriotic sentiment of the State, violated the law and com mitted a breach of trust by perverting the monument from the high and holy purpose of its original inception, should be removed find their places filled with men who will restore the work to its original design. That eloquent Populist, Representa tive Watson, of Georgia, is asking his friends for contributions to enablo him to contest a seat in the next House. One of his reasons for contest is that one county having a population of 11.000 polled 5,000 votes, and rolled up a major ity of 8,600 against him. He should be thankful that 5,000 people did not bury him under 11.000 votes. A statement was submitted to tho road congress, yesterday, showing that the total road tax collected, in this State in 1802 was $2,289,075. At the Tate of $1,500 per mile, which is a liberal esti mate, this would build 1,513 miles of excellent roads, yet it is doubtful if fifty miles of .really good roads were built in the entire State. In other words, the sum collected as road tax is largely misapplied and thrown away. Tfie road congress should not adjourn without organizing a State league for good roads to act in co-operation with similar leagues in other States, and with tho national league. Such an organiza tion would bring into close union all the delegates to the present congress and other citizens interested in the movement, and would furnish-a nucleus for effective action. It would put Indi ana in theVan of the whole movement and be a good advertisement for the State. TriE leading Democratic boss of Mil waukee has just given a swell dinner to millionaire Villard, at which only prom inent Democrats were present. Villard was highly complimented for his effect ive financial aid in carrying Wisconsin for the Democrats. He owns large properties in Milwaukee, and his local agent there, the boss who gave the din ner, is expected to boss the Legislature when it meets. And thus does the sim plicity of Jeffersonian Democracy assert itself. : A dispatch from llonesdale. Pa., says that on the day after the recent election the Republican postmaster at that place resigned and that a well-known Demo crat has been appointed in his place, llonesdale is the county seat of "Way no county, and the postoffice is worth $1, 600 a year. Of course. President Har rison knows nothing about the appoint ment of a Democrat to office. There is no First Assistant Postmaster-general . at present, and the chief clerk of the office is acting First Assistant. It looks very much as if some person was trying to curry favor with the next adminis tration by appointing Democratic post masters. ' It is very evident that there is a stronger and more general feeling in Canada in favor of a political change, either in the form of Canadian inde pendence or of annexation, than there has ever been manifested before. It appears to be the leading topic for dis cussion by tho Canadian press in every province. Judging from tho recent ex pressions of these papers, the present inclination istoward annexation. They all declare that dissatisfaction is spread ing very fast, which is proved by large publio meetings, and that something must be done at an early day. The English connection has been found to be not only expensive, but it deprives Canada of the prosperity which its peo ple see that the United States enjoys. , The suggestions which the President has made regarding political parties and elections are worth a good deal more than passing attention. Little can be done in legislation to bring about the reforms he suggests beyond the simpli fication of election laws and the crea tion of election boards which will in sure the honest counting of ballots. The rest must bo done by public senti ment, and could bo effectively done by those who represent political parties. If committees representing the State committees of tho two leading parties should meet, talk over the methods of conducting campaigns and agree upon certain modes of procedure, much of the friction which now causes charges of trickery and bad faith could doubt less be avoided. THE 

THEEB PE0PLF8 DEPAETME5TB. In no direction is the magnitude of tho performances of the Harrison ad ministration more conspicuous than in the three departments which more nearly aflect the people than other de partments, the 'postal, the interior and the agricultural. Now that nothing is to be gained by abusing the Postmaster general, his adversaries who have any intelligence will admit that greater and more practical changes have been wrought during his term than under any predecessor. There is no branch of the postal service which has not felt the in fluence of his organizing and energizing mind. If it had been known that Mr. Wanamaker would carry tho expendi tures of the postal service from $56,280, 000 to $77,000,000 during tho fiscal year which ended last June, he might not' have been confirmed. That is what he has done in the way. of expenditure, but by his management he has increased the receipts so that the deficiency was less than it was the year before he took the office. He has given the cities moro and faster mails, and has connected the most remote outposts of the country to its centers by postal facilities which were not dreamed of years ago. He has added to tho mail servico 21,000,000 more miles than it contained In 1801. Free delivery has been doubled, and rural delivery has only been prevented by opposition of tho Holman order. Tho work of the Interior Department cannot be so well appreciated, because, aside from pensions, it is confined to the newer States and the Indians. When General Noble took charge of the department the work of the land bureau was two years behind. Settlers had been harassed and denied their rights. Already the 'work is up and tho better policy has quieted settlers. Millions of acres of lands purchased of the Indians have been added to the public domain so efficiently that thero has been no well-grounded cause of complaint. Tho policy of making tho Indians self-supporting by allotting land to them which shall be their own has been carried for ward bo successfully that the wisdom of that policy has been proved. Schools have been multiplied, and, on tho whole, r a great advance has .been made toward making tho Indian self-supporting through civilization. Secretary Rusk has made tho new De partment of Agriculture a beneficent in stitution. It is no longer a bureau for tho distribution of seeds and the pub lication of worthless reports, but a far reaching organization, which at once disseminates valuablo information, checks those diseases which cost farm ers millions, and attends to an inspec tion of meats which has opened the markets of millions of consumers here tofore closed. These are but a few of the achievements of this useful depart ment, and they reflect great credit upon Secretary Rusk. TAXING THE 0A3 MAINS. The proposition to tax the natural-gas mams is one that calls for careful and candid consideration. No one will deny that the city needs all the money it can fairly obtain, and no legitimate source of revenue should be neglected, but taxes should not bo imposed simply for tho sake of taxing, nor should any in terest or industry be taxed to tho point of injuring or cripplingit. Corporations should not be imposed upon because they .are corporations. Much as the city needs revenue it cannot afford to exceed the just limits of taxation nor to squeeze any enterprise simply because it has the power. It is not wise to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, and it is unjust as well as unwiso to impose burdensome taxes on useful enterprises. The city never had a healthier growth than it has had during the last year, and the conditions are so fayorable for its continuance that it would be unfor tunate to mako a misstep that might cripple or retard its progress. At present our natural-gas service ie one of the most attractive features of tho city, so much so as to bo a subject of universal comment among visitors and strangers. Considering price and abundance and regularity of 'supply, it is tho best service enjoyed by any city in the coun try, and it would bo very unwiso to do anything that would cripple it. Thero are about two hundred miles of mains in the city. The Indianapolis company has about eighty miles and the Consumers' Trust about 120. A tax of 3 cents a foot would be $158 per mile, which would make, say, $18,900 a year for the Consumers' Trust and $12,040 a year for the Indianapolis com pany. This would bo a hand some addition to the city's rev enues. The city needs the revenue, and if tho companies can pay the tax without injury to their business they ought to be required to do so. The fran chise they enjoy in the use of the city's streets and alleys is of immense value, and the city ought, if possible, to have somethingin returnforitbesides gas fur nished to the people at ordinance rates. The original ordinance, accepted by both companies, provided that the city might, after the expiration of five years froji the passage of the ordiuance, require the companies to pay an annual tax not exceeding 3 cents per foot on their mains. The five years expired June 27, 1802, and the Council now has a right under its contract with the companies to impose the tax. Tho companies can not complain that it is a surprise. They accepted the ordinance with that pro vision before them. The only question in thecase is wheth er the companies are able to pay the tax without crippling the servico. It is the general opinion that they are mak ing a large amount of money and are able to pay the tax. It has been recently announced that the stock of one of tho companies is worth $1.SC, and it is be lieved that both companies have made large earnings. If this is the case they are able to pay the proposed tax, and should be required to do it. It it is not the case tho companies can easily satisfy the Council on this point. The Journal is of opinion that tho pending ordinance should be passed unless the companies can and do satisfy the Coun cil that their profits are so sniall that the imposition of the tax would be un just. A bill has been introduced in 'the House changing the time of the assem blage of Congress to the first Monday after tho 4th day of March in each year, instead of the first Monday in Decem ber, the change to begin with the Fifty third Congress. On general principles this change ought to be made, and the reasons are obvious. It is contrary to the idea of popular government that a Congress elected by the people should not meet till more than a year after its election. The theory of popular gov ernment is that tho will of the people, expressed in an election, should be given practical effect as soon as possi ble. Strictly epeaking, tho term of a new Congress ought to begin in the De cember following its election, but,, at furthest, it should convene in tho March following. At present the salary of .members of a new Congress begins on the 4th of March following tho election, but the Congress does cot meet till tho following December. If the change were made at this session, tg begin with the next Congress, it would dispose of the special session question. ThcFifty third Congress would meet on the first Monday after Mr. Cleveland's inaugura tion, and would have an opportunity to formulate a policy, which ought to bo done as soon as possible. 'Representative Tayloii, of Ohio, says the result of the recent election in that Stato was a surprise to both parties and due to exceptional causes which nobody foresaw. Among other things he mentions the organized labor vote, which was largely cast against the Ro- .publicans. Already, however, there is a reaction. Mr. Taylor says: To-day there is no set of men in the conn try who regret it more than do these same men. They are already suffering from the result of the election. They will soon re alize that tho country was never mora f rosperous than just before the election, n Ohio factories were running at fnllca pacity, employing two gantiB of men. They had orders ahead. Tho shock of the elec tion alone, without any regard to what tho Democrats may do, was enough to unsettle business to a considerable extent. Besides, meu who had given big orders to manufact urers have in many cases withdrawn the orders, expecting that there may be an ex tra session and immediate laritt legisla tion, which will enable them to set the same goods cheaper abroad. The resnltin my State is that the manufactories are run ning with only about half the. force they had before the election, and two workmen are after one job instead of two jobs after one man. If the scheme for taxing vehicles includes the wagons and carts of a large number of poor men who are enabled to earn a living using them, it is vicious in the extreme. Their horees and wagons are taxed as is ether property, and the streets they must use are of no expense to the eity. Why lay an additional tax upon them? If the extravagance of the Sullivan regime mast have more money to spend, let them find other victims than the poor men who work early and late with horse and cart to earn their bread. If it is necessary to tax vehicles, let the Council discriminate be-, tween those which are conveniences and luxuries and the cart or wagon of the man: who, .by using it, may earn a couple of dollars a day. WnAT a correspondent said yesterday about the streets of this oity, that is, the main thoroughfares which are not paved, is true. Even in ordinarily muddy weather the gravel roads outside are infinitely bet ter. They could not do worse. Everybody has dug them up at will, and nobody has any care for them. They are tho carriage repairers' best support. They measure the efficiency of the present reform city admin istration. The city has no right to tax ve hicles using such streets. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The message is an admirable vindication of Republican policy and a sagacious prog nostic of events about to be. Chicago Inter Ocean. No ruler that has ever lived has been able to submit such an exhibit of national progress and abounding prosperity as the message presents. Pittsburg Chromole Telegraph. Like all his publio utterances, whether to Congress or to the people. President Harrison's message is practical and bu9i- ness-litte in its contents, earnest, dignified and unpartisan in its tone. Chicago Tri bune, i While there has been but littlo curi osity to see this message, no one will lay it down without reading with immense pleasure all that part , of it which records the prosperity of tho past and ue present. Toledo Commercial. Thk message is well worth reading. It is the utterance of a thoroughly sincere and public-spirited official, who has always, in meeting the duties of his position, shown an intelligent desire to advance the inter ests of his country. St. Louis Globe-Democrat. . . The President discusses in his usual clear and forcible way every subject of present national importance, and no. citizen can read and weigh its contents carefully with out having an increased admiration for the statesman who penned it Cleveland Leader. Pkesident Harrison's retiring message will be read with pride by every patriotic citizen of the Republic. It is an exhibit of material and industrial progress, of na tional growth and prosperity, of honest, capable and intelligent administration such as has never before been made by any President of the United States. Detroit Tribune. The very best that may be said of the message as a whole is that it is a powerful enunciation of a cardinal principle of gen uine Republicanism that the people are in capable of self-government and lack the ability to determine for themselves what policy of government is better calculated to advance their prosperity. Chicago Her ald (Dem.) There is an undertone in the present message which is pitched throughout in a minor key. Mr. Harrison is no longer truculent, but he takes pains to deny that b was wrong on a single point of the pTlicy of hi administration. He goes out reiterating his indorsement of everything he has previously advocated, from high taritT to force bill and tho ship subsidies. St. Louis Republic (Dem.) Ox the whole the President's message is interesting, able and strong in purpose. Its plea for protection, its recommendations relating to Canada, to steamshipaubsidie. to the restriction of immigration and other importaut matters are vigorous. The plan of making a noble showing for his party's chief policy and calling on Lis party's suc cessor to match it ia uuique. and is decid edly a happy thought. Chicago News, (Ind.) The rirltislt Pre. M i:. Harrison's tariff remarks remind one of the schoolboy maxim: "If you tell a lie tell a big 'on and stick to it." It may now be regarded as certain that America will build the Nicaragua canal and thus pre vent Prance from reviving the Panama scheme. London Chronicle. Nothing could be more misleading than Mr. Harrison's remarks concerning agri culture. The only thing that saves Amer ica from a vast, terrible social catastrophe is the extent and cheapness of her outlying lands and her superb system of railroads. With regard to the troubles of English tenant farmers, however, nothing could be a wilder or worse step than retaliation on the McKinleyites by excluding American coin and beef. London Telegraph. Not every one is privileged to rent bis spleen In the form of a state paper. Mr. Harrison's message is not meant to be gra- cious, neither is it impressive, like the epistle of tho rejected lover, sincerely trusting that she will not rue bitterly the preference accorded to one unworthy of her preference. The warning to Canada is polite compared with the threat once hurled at Chili. There is an unwelcome ambiguity in the reference to the Behring sea matter. But it matters littlo what be savs. Ichabod is written in every sentence. London Standard. Mr. Harrison ascribes the drain of gold from America to political movements in Europe. By many of the Republican lead ers, however, nothing of the kind is re quired to explain a phenomenon which everybody acquainted with the first prin ciples of currency legislation eould predict with absolute confidence when America first nndertook the control of trie market. Mr. Harrison appears to be entirely nncon- scions that the monetary conference is a failure. He talks about delay in compet ing other nations to change their coinage. What a hopless tangle of misconceptions is thus revealed. Surely the existence ot millions of dollars in the vaults of the American treasury, which nothing could m- dnce the world to employ, ought to restrain even the retiring President from talking this nonsense. America may reverse her policy, but the world will Jong antler from its effects. Reversion to a eonnd policy may disturb the silver market as an in evitable result of blundering legislation, but it will pave the way to a healthy state of affairs. London Times. 

KNOCKED OUT BY GRESHAM Decision That Yinaail j Declares the In terstate Act to Re Unconstitutional. Con press, It Says, Cannot Make the Courts , Subordinate to a Non-Judicialor Adminis trative Body, fcuchas the Commission. Chicago, Deo. 7. Judge Gresham ren dered to-day one of the most important de cisions which has been handed down since the interstate-commerce act was enacted. Last July W. G. Brim son, David Brown, L. Hopkins, Henry Waiger. W. 1L Stacking and others refused to answer certain ques tions propounded by the Interstate-commerce Commission, and nnder the twelfth section of the act District Attorney Mil christ brought a petition before Judge Gresham to compel the produotion of the books and tho answer of the questions. Judge Gresham, in a long opinion, refused to grantthe petition to compel the witnesses to testify and produce books, holding that the court could not be made subsidiary to or a subordinate auxiliary to a nou-judicial or administrative body. This is the fam ous case in which the Chicago & Grand Trunk, the Calumet & Blue Island, the Chicago, Kenosha, Joliet & Blue Island, the Chicago & Southeastern, the Milwau kee, Bay view & Chicago, the Baltimore & Ohio, the Chicago & Eastern Illinois, the Big Four, the Chicago & Erie, the Michi gan Central, the Lake Shore, the Pennsyl vania, the Nickel-plate, the Wabash and the Lackawanna were accused of unjust discrimination in favor of large Chicago shippers, notably the Illinois Steel Com pany. "The commission was engaged in investi gating charges of unlawful discrimination against certain railroad companies," said Judge Gresham, "and. this court is asked to aid that body in obtaining evidence which it is claimed will tend to support the charge. The subject of the inquiry is not brought here lor adjudication, and this court can exerciso no discretion be yond deciding whether the evidence de manded is pertinent to the charge and within the general scope of the twelfth section of the act. Congress cannot thus make a juuicial department the mere ad junct or Instrument of either of the depart ments of government." ! In concluding. Judge Gresham says: "Undoubtedly Congress may confer upon a non-jodicial body authority to obtaiu in formation necessary for legitimate govern mental purposes, and make refusal to ap pear to testify before it touching matters pertinent to an authorized inquiry an ollenso punishable by the courts, subject. however. to the priv ilege of witnesses to make no disclOBUie which might tend to incrim inate them or subject them to penalties or forfeitures. The prosecution of an action for violation of such a statute would clear ly be un original suit or controversy be tween parties within the meaning of the Constitution, and not a mere application, like the present one, for the exercise of the judicial power tn and of a non-judicial body. So much of Section 12 as authorizes or requires the courts to use their powers in aid of inquiries before the Interstate commerce Commission is unconstitutional and void, and the application is dismissed for want of jurisdiction to entertain it." District Attorney Milchrist at once gave notice that he should apply for a review of the case by the Supreme Court. The rail road lawyers are jubilant, feeling that they have now virtually established the unconstitutionality of the interstate-commerce act. , A 

FREE-COINAGE IDEA. How a 3Iicer Would Improve the Quality of the Present White Metal Dollar. Botte. Mont., Dec. 7. A strikingly sug gestive letter was to-day sent to Secretary Foster, of the United States Treasury De partment, at Washington, by Superintend ent Allen, of the Butte and Boston Mining Company, of this city. The letter is ap offer to make any amount ot much better silver dollars for 90 cents apiece than are at present in use. Mr. Allen tojtestho position that, counting silver at 85 cents per ounce, the intrinsic value of a silver dollar is only C5.71 cents. He wonld put in each dol lar 400 grains of 'pure silver, whereas the present dollar only contains 871U grains, and ho would number and letter each coin, so that the govern ment would not be compelled tb redeem duplicates, a safeguard now neulected. Mr. Allen says he would reap a profit in coin ing while the price of silver was anywhere under $1.29. The letter adds: 0 While it has always been possible to recognize counterfeit paper money, the present silver coin can be produced at a protit of 5;i per cent, in a coin that cannot be detected. This is true of sil ver money, whether foreign or American. Now, my proposition is to either withuraw the present silver money before tho excess becomes so larire that It will bankrupt the government to redeem It. or combine Mich foreign powers, who are equally in danger, and make the old standard of value $1.2'J, which will make a coin that can-' not bo counterfeited without the use of baee metal alloy, which is easily detected, and for which the government will never have to pay face value. Commenting upon the letter the Daily Miner says: It shows that under the law and the prices as they now exist, the counterfeiter can make equally as good a dollar as is made by the gov ernment n tid still accumulate a fabulous fortune, lie cau make a dollar out of 65 cents' worth of ftilver; with JfOoO worth of silver he can make $ 1.00O, and from $650,000 worth of the metal he can reap a profit of $350,000. Whether this trick has alreadr been played ou the government it is imt-osMble for the ablest expert to say, for the counterfeit dollar can stand every tent, and. so far as human mind can ascertain, will estab lish its genuineness. IT

If the Tariff Laws Are Not Altered the Secre - tary of the Treasury fcajs There Will Be Ample Funds for All Requirements. Present Condition of the Pnblic Finan ces as Shown in Mr. Foster's Report. Suggestions Concerning the Redemption Fund Additional Tax on Whisky Recommended Public Euildincs and Quarantines. Washington, Deo. 7. The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the government revenues from all sources during the past fiscal year were 85,SCS,20 and the total expenditures $415, 95S.S06. leaving a surplus of $9,914,453. With the cash balance, the national back re demption fund and a few small itema added this surplus was 1 10,753,463, which was applied to the payment of the publio debt. As compared with the fiscal year 1801 tho receipts for 1892 have fallen off $"2, 673.972; the principal Josses being cus toms receipts, S42.0C0.241. and in profits on coinage, 5.CS1.479. On the other hand, there was a gain of $3,284,823 in internal revenue receipts, of $4,098,690 in postal re ceipts snd in sales of District of Columbia bonds of $2,412,744. In the ordinary ex penditures there was a decrease of Slo.349,- ,51, which is accounted for by diminished payments for direct taxes refund, for re fund of excessive customs, deposits, draw backs, census, quartermaster's supplies and .interest on the publio debt, tho decrease in the last item alone being 514, 169,019. For the present fiscal year the ro venues are estimated as follows: From customs 108,000,000.00 From internal revenue 163.000,000.00 From miscellaneous sources.... 20,000.000.00 From postal service 80,336.350.44 Total estimated revenues $4 03,336,350.44 The expenditures for the same period are estimated as follows: For the civil establishment

Charge able againBt this are unexpended river and harbor and ordnance appropriations amounting to $!i,ono,COO. and no account is taken of the sinking fund requirements, amounting to $18,000,000 beyond redemp tions estimated at $T,100,0'JO. ' 

CANNOT SAFKLY MAKE PREDICTIONS. The estimated receipts, says Secretary Foster, are based upon conditions prevail ing prior to the lato electiou. Public opin ion having decreed a change of policy, par ticularly in the tarift laws, the altered conditions resulting therefrom render it im possible at the present time to estimate the annual income with any marked degree of accuracy, and it is impossible to predict the eliect that such proposed radical changes would have upon the future revenues of the government. The Secretary farther says that he will not estimate further, bat the inevitable result of the tarm-reduction agitation will be a tailing oil' in Importa tions and in revenue, the extent of which no one can measure. He does say. how ever, that all the facts fully justify the opinion that the largo increase of receipts, ascribed to the marvelous prosperity of the country under the present revenue system would, if continued, enable the depart ment, during the cominc fiscal year, to meet all obligations without the slightest impairment of its cash, and, thereafter, continue to show a material improvement in its condition. Touching the sinking fund act the report states that up to June SO, last. $99U,510.0M more than is required by law has been credited to the fund. He recommends the repeal of the aot of March 31, lslauthor izing the application of surplus money to the purchase or redemption of United States bonds, in view of the very large de crease iu tho national debt already etiected and the probable future condition of the national finances. Touching the gold reserve the report saya the treasury has ditliculty with tho limited amount of cash on hand above the $100,000, 0C0 redemption fund to keep a sufficient stock of gold and if the shipments continue as large as they have been durintt the past two years, the gold in the treasury will bo dimished below the reserve line. The main tenance of silver at - par has also increased the possible charge upon the gold reserve and, therefore, the Secretary suggests that the reserve for the redemption of govern ment obligations should be increased to the extent of at least 0 per cent, of the nmount of treasury notes issued or to be issued under the act of July 14, 1S90. The Secretary says: As will le seen by the estiir.ates'submitted the receipts of the current and tho next fiscal year arc not likely, if present conditions continue, to fall below expenditures, yet. In view of the fact that the surplus for this year will he small, upon the basis stated, with the probability of a falling oil in receipts for causes mentioned, I think the revenues should be so increased as to enable the Treasury Department to malutain a gold reserve of not less than $123,000,000 to maintain a comfortablo working balauce iu the treasury carfh. As a general revislou of our customs laws is now probable, I do not feel like suggesting any special methods for increasing the revenue, though I should otherwise thick that an addi tional tax on whifeky. whioli could be collected without additional cost, would furnish an easy method. THE 

SILVER QUESTION. In regard to the monetary conference, he says: This conference is now in session. As yet littlo is known as to what Its action may be, beyond tho mere fact that the subject of the better use of silver as a money metal is receiving its earnest attention. Whatever may be the outcome of the conference, it is safe to predict that a clearer idea will be had of the views and purposes of the countries represented. The Secretary gives statistics to show the success of the reciprocity treaties now in operation, and says tho result of reci procity will be enlarged markets for our agricultural and manufacturing products and increased employment for our ships. The Secretary refers with much satisfac tion to the benefit accruing from the opera tion of the administrative actof JunelO, 1890, which shows that both the importers and customs officers have obtained relief from many evils it was intended to remedy. Tho Secretary renews his past recommendations, thomoreimportantbeingthe abolition of all fees.commi8s;ons, etc.. now allowed collect ors and surveyors, and tho establishment of a fixed salary; the consolidation of cus toms districts and the clothing of the Secre tary with powers to abolish districts and discontinue minor ports; the revision and codiucation of the customs and navigation laws, which is specially urged, with such moditication and new provisions as aro re quired for the efficiency of the service.

On this subject he says: These figures exhibit a lamentable condition of affairs. U would sera that we were well hemmed in by subsidized steamship companies of the UritlAh government monopolizing trade legitimately belongiug to ocr own people. The ttep toward such prevention by the provision in the statutes for payments to American built and American owned vessels of certain classes In 4the foreign trade is in tho right direction. It is very desirable that there shall be a continu ance or extension of the prent pohey pi pro tecting our vessels in the foreign trade against the subsidized lines of foreign governments, so I that we may retain for thoxe directly or mdl I rectly interested a fair portion of the monor now expended In foreign eoantriet for ships and the navigation thereof; so that employment and nautical knowledge and experience may be glventoomerandmen. who. In case of war, could be uUlized In onr navy, and so in that way be enabled to build up as auxiliary to the navy a class of powerful steam vessels, contltut!ng an ofisetto the vast Heels of tuch craft belonging to foreign nations now swarming along our coasts Uttcd for Immediate use as war vessels, with cannon in store at home and ready tor service, at a day's notice, ss destroyers of oar commerce in waters with which their crews are familiar, or as transports tor troops to our shore or shores in our vlciidty.

Fa. The report charges the delays in com mencing the work on many new public buildings to the failure of Congress to pro vide the necessary clerical and expert force and to the eight-hour law.

The subject of the world's fair is briefly dismissed with the statement that satis factory progress has been made in the preparation of the department's exhibit, in the arrangement of the customs laws and regulations and Upon the government buildings. Tho report says the desirabil ity, if, indeed, it be not a necessity, of a change in methods of disbursing publio moneys and the examination, adjudication and settlement of public accounts has loug been manifest The whole duty of control and audit ap pertaining to the public expenditure should be under the administrative direction of a controller-general, or chief controller of the treasury, within whose bureau a board of audit might be created for the detcrmi nation of quasi-judicial questions arising in the examination, statements and settle ment of accounts, if that mode of pro cednre be regarded with . favor.

Asa measure, to determine what this tax should be. he suggests that the sum should be such as will equalize tha cost to the immigrants to reach Sooth America or Australia. On the subject of alien contract labor laws, the Secretary ays: "The vigorons exeoution of the law has called a halt in the extensive importa tion of foreign laborers under contract."

Pro visiBon is made tor the admission of Chinese exhibitors and employes of exhibitors at tho world's fair, and it is probable, the Secretary says, that a large number of Chinese laborers will enter th United States under this authority. The Secre tary says that at the close of tho fiscal ycal no applications for certificates had been made to resident Chinese laborers and that there seems to be a determinatiou on the part of the Chinese not to register.

The whole country should have a voice In their ownership and man agement, and this cau only be accomplished by such legislative action as will forbid the collec tion of quarautine fees by State or municipal authorities, and which shall direct the assump tion of all quarantine duties by the United fctates. This dutv rests nnder the ctme author ity as that under which laws relating to immi gration are framed and executed. F.very such epidemic that this countrr has ever known has been traced to the immigrant, and It "uet be ap parent that the same authority chat controls immigration should control quarantine. Admitting that any particular local quaran tine may bo peerectly managed, of Vnat avail is it if a neighboring iort Las either a lax or in sufficient quarantine, or iio&e at nil 1 bucli are the facilities for iuland communication that all quarantines must he equally ellicient to be suc cessful In preventing importation ot disease, and only the strong arm of the government, di rected under laws enacted by representatives of the whole people, can give coutldence and se curity. .
