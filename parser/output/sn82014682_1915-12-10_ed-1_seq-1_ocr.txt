Such is the information brought to Honolulu today by J. C.

They have been in Australia for the last two or three months Mrs. Bridwell went to the big commonwealth to meet her husband after he reached there from Africa, where he was war-bound for some time having been on the west coast of the Dark Continent collecting insect parasites when the European conflict first commenced. ' 'I wasn't lost in Africa at all," said Mr Bridwell when he was asked by a Star-Bulletm reporter for a recital of his manr adventures since he left here more thab a year and a half ago. I'd rather hot talk much about it, you know." And he refused to be In terviewed further until the newspaper man asked him whether anti-American igntiment exists in Australia today to he extent that has been reported, ays Navy Men Made Promises. - -It certainly, does," he replied. "The visit of the American fleet there a number of years ago seems to have had something to flo t with, it, too. When the . fleet was there, on i its round-the-world 4cruise, Australians went wild with enthusiasm when, ac cording to them, our naval officers promised to help Australia and Great Britain in Ihe event of war with a foreign power.

"Bridwell added that the better class of Australians resented most bit terly President Wilson sending a note of congratulation to Emperor Wilhelm cn the occaion of the Kaiserin's birth day anniversary. A censorship of all letters coming into Australia also exists, according to the entomologist, who said that the censor does not seem to interfere with mall from the United States.

C v Dec. 10. Secretary of War Lindley M. Garrison today announced -a special report on national defense, pre- paml at his request by the War College division of the general staff. The report goes into details on the increase in the army believed necessary adequately to care for the defense of thtv country, and in this connection calls for additional troops which will bring the num ber of soldiers on Oahu to more than 20,000. " . , v ' . - It is recommended that the Hawaii military district be created a division, instead of a department,' as at present.

There is some difference noticeable between the recommendations of the' special board of the War College, quoted above, and Secretary Garrison's recommendations, as voiced in President Wilson's message ine special Doard recommends a regular army of 121,000 men, where as the war department plans as given in the president's message are for 141,843 men. Tbewar department called for a supplementary force of 400,000 men, as against 500,000 fori the continental army under periodical training, the latter figure being proposed by the War college report. . j Under whatls known as the "Macomb report,'; drawn .by a board of which Brig -gen. M. M. Macomb, formerly commanding on Oabu, was a member, Oahu was to continue with six regiments of in fantry. Apparently this report has been followed very little by the War College board, for, as is stated in the Associated Press despatch today, the board does not consider that Jthere are enough soldiers now. for a mobile force sufficient to prevent an enemy's landing in an aggressive move on Pearl Harbor. . ' Militia Legislation Expected. - - - J The legislation recommended to repeal acts requiring the militia to be received into the U. S. array in war time in advance of any. other force, was'expected. Regular army officers hold that this pro vision, which makes the militia the firstline of volunteers to be called' on in war time, has hindered the deveopraent of reserves. Now the continental army as proposed will be the first line first to be called rfantry. Apparently this report has been followed very little by the Probing Coama
