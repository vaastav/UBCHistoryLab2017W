BEAVER WANDERER. ______«f Her Expedition—The Captured AfHnn Ask to be Returned to tEcisi Native Load.. [From the Washington Patriot.] A peculiar ease, involving the auestion of restoring reoaptnred Africans to their nati ve country, is soon to be brought before the United States government for action. Many wiV remember the excitement caused through the c.onntry in 1859, daring the ad ministration of President Buchanan, by the capture of the slaver "Wanderer," and the kionapping of the recaptives ou board at Savannah, Georgia. The Wanderer had been overhauled and captured by a United States vesscl-of-war cruising off Cuba. When bearded, the Africans were found to be iq such a condition that it was found necessary to run into the first port that could be* made. Though fearful of the re sult, the commander of the cruiser put into Savannah. Many at Washington recall the anxiety of President Buchanan to have the Vessel brought at ouce to some Northern port. Before this could he effected, how ever, a lawless gang boarded the slaver at night, brought out the people, and ran them off toward the Gulf, aristrlbuting them in the country so that future efforts to recover them proved unavailing. About two years since Rev. A. IV Phil lips, a missionary of the Southern Baptist Convention, in Yornbn, in Central Airica, having returned, after twelve years' ab sence, to revisit his triends, was. one Sab bath morning, addressing a congregation of colored people at Mobile, Alabama. Speak ing of nis mission and of the people of Africa, to illustrate the character of their languuge, he repeated the Lord's Prayer in Yorubau. A little group in the back part of the house broke out into a shout of de light, which was mistaken for religious en thusiasm by the preacher, till at the close of his discourse they came thronging toward bim and addressed him in their African tongue. They told him they were part of the company carried off from the Wanderer, and described how they were first seized in their own country, sold, and put on board the slave ship. They were traders in Yomba, in good circumstances, and with connections of high standing. Their party were on a trading tour to some towns west of Abeoknta, when, at an exposed point on their road, a party of slave-hunting Da bomeys rushed on them from an ambusli, seized them, bore themoff to a little town on the coast near Porto Novo, where the Wanderer was lying off the shore to receive them. 8inee the war these people have gathered into a little community, retaining their language, and keeping tliemselves separate from the inferior blacks about them. They have become Christians, are thrifty and en terprising, and are very eager to be sent back to their native country, that they may meet their families again and be useful to their people. The question row arises, whether the former laws relating to the restoration of recaptured slaves apply to these people. Humanity certainly speaks for them. The ■ Secretary of the Interior, however, who has just retired, hesitated as to the power given him under the laws of Congress. Probably the new secretary, Hon. Mr, Delano, will feel the same, ditiieulty. Congress may be called upon to decide this, and even wider questions as t° the just demands of many enterprising and earnest freed men of the South who are eager ty go hack to the land of their ancestors and build up an African civilization. We copy the*following from thfc Atlakapos Register, published at Brashear: liny changes of position and location are making in this parish just now. Hon. C. B. Darrull, late State Senator, recently elected to Congress, lias gone on to Wash ington. Hon. A. J. Syplier takes bis place in the Senate. Levi Darrall, late Customs officer at this port, has resigned that posi tion fof the better one of Tax Collector for this parish, and Removes to Franklin. II. B. Allison, late Deputy Sheriff, has resigned that position and taken that vacated by Levi Darrall, and consequently comes from Franklin here. E. B. Mentz, the late Sheriff, has got a clerkship in the Custom house at New Orleans, and has left St. Mary. J. ft. Jolley, the lately elected Sheriff, leaves Brashear and the Register office to go to Franklin. Hon. James H. Handy, re-elected Parish Judge, is soon to remove from Brashear to Franklin; W. B. Merchant, at present Mayor of Brashear, and the only lawyer and notary public hefe, intends to remove to Franklin soon. And last, but as we flatter ourselves, not least, the Register, will, after Christmas, be issued from Franklin, whither we are ■ now removing our office material. Charles Palfrey, the late Tax Collector, leaves Franklin and the harassments of office for the pleasant shades of ex-Governor Baker's plantation, below Centreville, while Fred. Palfrey, lately assistant collector, intends to'devote himself to the duties of his office of public auctioneer. So we go. In this general changing around, Franklin will be the gainer, as but two or three leave her. whim double that number will come in. It is to be Foped they will bo allowed to come in pep.ee this time. It seems they can not be kept out._____. Peoria young men get into matrimony by writing to the girls: / "I saw yu at oliurtch last sandy nite, and I want to form with yu and Aquanetans.

It clouded up during the forenoon, and a few drops of rain descended, but it soon cleaved off' 'again, and at time of writing it is pleasant. Business on tlie iandiug was active. The arrivals were jiretty numerous, and several of them were deeply laden. The Rapides, from Red river, brought in an excellent trip. She had 862 bales of cotton and a large amount of sugar and molasses. The C. H. Dtirlce had over 1000 bales of cotton. The St. John, Pretender, Wild Wagoner and Jennie Ilowell were all well laden. Among the departures were : The South western to Red river, with a full cargo and au extensive list of passengers; Olive Branch to St. Louis, with a heavy trip of sugar aud molasses. She took about 900 hogsheads ol sugar anil a large miscella neous freight; tlie St, John left with a good coast trip; the Wild Wagoner, as usual, had a good trip to Natchez; the Trenton for Ouachita river was well ladeu. Cottoii and sugar receipts are increasing daily, and all that is now desirable for a successful busi ness season is a better stage of water in the. • upper portion of the Mississippi river and the Ouachita aud Red rivers. There is only four and a half feet of water at the mouth' of Red river, and but low water in the channel ot' Ouachita. Arkan sas river is at good stage. Tlie Ohio river is rising, and the canal, at Louisville, was opened yesterday. This will lie good news to our merchants, and we may look for numerous arrivals from the Ohio river in tlie next fifteen days. There is a large fleet of boats ou the Ohio river that have been delayed waiting for tlie opening of the canal at Louisville, and now we suppose they will hurry to this port with lull cargoes. The Ciucinnati Gazette of the fifth says that tlie river rose (seven inches in the twenty-fours ending at six o'clock last evening, whenjhere was thirteen feet five inches water in the channel. The St. Louis Republican of the 4*ftli *' c ' ports as follows: Tin: river here is now nearly stationary. It is very low, aud will probably remain so the remainder of the winter. * There is now no more than six feet of water to Cairo, aud it is even doubtful whether that much can be found at Liberty Island. Kates are firm to all points. Miscellaneous Items. —Captain Henry Johnson, Missouri river pilot, was a passen ger on tin* steamer Olive Branch, that sailed last evening for St. Louis. Captain James Kerr. Jr., arrived yester day. at noon, from tlie North and East. The steamer Belie of Alton was towed to retirement yesterday. Slie is lying at upper wharf, and will await a rise in Keel river. Captain Brener says that if the Red people desire to see tlie Belle of Alton soon again, they must pray for rain. The Tidal Wave for to-day at 5 P. M.« Era No. 9 Friday, and Charles H. Durfee Saturday, is the programme of the ••Red River Packet Company" this week. This line is now running in full blast, ami tlie boats are leaving on time and in turns with great regularity. The merchants and con signees seem much pleased with the new arrangements, and the boats of the 'ine leave fully laden, daily at 5 P. M. The Richmond. Friday, and Pauline Car roll Saturday, arc the St. Louis boats to leave this week. Tlie beautiful steamer City of Quinsy seems to have made quite an impression on our cit izens. Since her arrival here she lias been visited by crowds of people, and all seem harmonious in the opinion that slic is one of the most elegant steamers visiting our wharf. Her peculiar style of cabin attracts much attention, and Mr. William Brown, chief clerk, has had his hands full in doing the polite to tlie visitors. The opening of the canal at Louisville yesterday will allow the Quincy to leave with a big trip for the Ohio. She had a large number of passen gers registered yesterday, and when she leaves, to-day, we suppose she will be full. Captaiu Judd T. West, her commander, looked exceedingly happy yesterday eve ning, occasioned, no doubt, by the flattering reception our merchants gave liis steamer. The steamer M. J. Wicks was over due last night, aud, uo doubt, will be found at the landing this morning. The Bannock City is loading at St. Louis for New Orleans. The Richmond, en route to this port from St. Lifhis, added one hundred passengers to her list at Memphis. The Messenger is en route from Pittsburg to this port deeply laden. The Mollie Ebert left Pittsburg, Friday, for New Orleans, with a good trip. 600 tons, drawing four feet and a ball'. Pilots, Cap tain Ebert and Jacob Poe. The Granite State also denarted. The Rodman and the John Kilgo «r leave Cincinnati to-day or to-morrow for New ' q leans. The Commercial says: ''Commodore W. F. Davidson has expended over $.i06,(ioi) among Cincinnati and Madison mechanics anil artisans iu building the large and mag nificent City of Quincy, John Kyle and another superb steamer now in course of construction here, at James Mack's ship yard." A correspondent of the Cincinnati > 'oin ertial makes these good points: There arc many other items <>f exorbitant charges npon the cotton of the Red river country, when carried to the New Orleans market, and from which it will lie comparatively free when transported directly from the plantations to any of the Northwestern cities, but I will only mention one other ar tlfis time, and that one, all steamboat men will agree with me, Ins long been a crying !*vil. 1 allude to the Red river pilots' wages, mil I would ask in all honesty and sincerity, •au any man give a good reason why a Red river pilot should get $500 per month for steering a steamboat of 200 to 500 tons, when for the same service iu the Arkansas, the Yazoo bml White rivers, the pilots, equally well skilled, work for about one half the money! When, also, the mammoth steamers in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade are piloted by the most skillful bands at a far less rate. Do tin* Red river pilots work more horns out of the twenty-four hours than gentlemen engaged in the same profession iu other trades? Is the Red river "a harder river to learn" than the Mississippi! No man in bis senses will undertake to prove that it is so. and if he did, the proncieucy which the pilots of the Carter line have shown in lining Red river iu the last two seasons, would give the lie to the whole theory^ Many a thousand bales of cotton have been carried from Shreveport to New Orleans on which the pilots got more than one-lialf the price of transportation for their wages; and I have known several instances where, from upper Red river, the pilots' wages amounted to $3 per bale ou the entire cargo, anil the •rice affreight not averaging over $4 50per iale. I do not speak of $509 per month as the maximum of pilots' wages iu Red river. By no means; for they are no ways modest in their estimate of the value «ot their ser vices. In 1865, for a few trips tlie wages went up to $1700 per month, and $1200, $10 K) anil $800 were considered moderate demands in 1866 llnd 18*17, and last season, as much as $600 was paid, and more than one man who invested his capital ;n Red river steamboat stock last season has been iicard to say ip truth that but for the pilots' wages he would have made a tolerable season's profit. , . The ab<<vc has much more truth in it Than poetry, and certainly demands the atten " * ' v **y- dajrr •tltion between the cities ef St. Louis tion of steamboat owners, in* these days of competition between the cities ef St. Louis aud New Orleans, for the possession of the trade of Red river.
