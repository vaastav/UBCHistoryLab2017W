LENA CORRESPONDENCE. LENA, LA., Dec. 5th, 1895. MR. EDITOR- Dear Sir:--Wi!l you please grant me space in your valuable paper to ask a question or two concern ing the position of several of the candidates for the Legislature up on the matter of voting for a Unit ed States Senator? I have heard it said that Mr. Mil ler, Mr. Smith, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Ariail would vote for a gold bug for the U. S. Senate before they would vote for Mr. Blanchard. Will these gentlemen kindly an swer what they would do in the event the contest should narrow down to Mr. Blanchard upon one side and Mr. Boatuer or some oth er gold bug upon the other? Would they vote for Mr. Blanch ard or the gold bug? The people hereabouts do not agree with Mr. Blanchard about keeping the silver question out of State politics and they want a man in the U. S. Senate in full sympathy with them, but Mr. Blauchard is a silvier man, for all his votes in Congress prove it and I would not be willing to send a gold bug to the Senate just to de feat Mr. Blanchard. While we may differ with Mr. Blanchard in some matters, yet we will take him every time in preference to a gold bug. It has been my desire to vote for one or more of the above namn ed gentlemen for the Legislature, but I cannot vote for men who would sacrifice silver to satisety a prejudice. 1 hope these gentlemen will at once deny positively this charge against them. A SILVERITE. Meeting of Exeeutive Committee. The Democratic Executive Corn mnittee of Rapides Parish mnet at the Court House, in Alexandria, last Saturday and was called to order by the Chairman ex-Govern or James Jeffries, who stated that he had called the committee to gether for the purpose of selecting a temporary Chairmani, to preside over the preliminary organization of the Democratic, convantion, called to meet on said date for the lpurpose of choosing ten delegates to represent the Parish in the State convention at Shreveport on the 18th of this month, as he did not desire to assume that responsi bility. On motion, Judge W. F. Blackman was elected temporary Chairman of the convention. A conrmmunication was read by the lhairman, which he had received from the Executive Committee of Vernon, declaring that Vernon had been ignored in the selection of a Senator and requesting that a con vention of the two Parishes be called to nominate a State Senator. The chairman stated that he had replied informing the Vernon Committee that RIapides had al ready ordered a primary on the 16th of December to select a nomi. nee. Upon motion of Mr. J. O. Ryan, the 8ecretary of the Com. miittee was insti tetcd to co muoni cate with the Verrnon Cou itteta and reqtest them to elect delega. tes to meet delegates from Rapi des at a time niud place to be agree:l upon by the respective committees of the two Parishes, to nominate a Senator to represent thre Senatorial District. There being no further business to be tranisacted, this Committee dljournried sine cdie and became Jinc tus officio, by reason of the selectionl of a new committee by the conven tion su bseqnell tly, I he personnel andl organizatiou of whichl will be found in the official proceedings of the convention.
