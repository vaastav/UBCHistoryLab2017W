The President's Message. concluded from first page. 089 perroua employed in such manufactur ing interests as are claimed to be benefitted by a high tariff. HOW THE TARIFF WORKS. To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no dis position to answer such suggestion by the allegations that they are in a minority among those who la Dor. ana tnererore snouiu iorego advantage in the interest of low prices for the majority; their compensation, as it may be affected by tne operation or tana laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view, and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they are con sumers with the rest; that they, too, have their own wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages will regulate the measure of their welfare and comfort. But the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingmen nor the lessening of his wages; and the profits still remaining to the manufacturer after a necessary readjustment should furnish rfo excuse for the sacrifice of the interests of his employes, either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the workers in manufactures fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of the remunerative wages it certainly results in a very large increase in the nrice of nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the nse of himself and his family. tie receives at the desk of his employer his whom and Derhaps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for family use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the in crease in price which the tariff permits, the hard earned compensation of many days of toil. The farmer and agriculturist who - manu factures nothing butwho pays the increased price the tariff imposes upon every agricul tural implement, upon all he wears and upon all he nses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and suoh things as his husbandry produces from the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present situation, and he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear in order that the price of their wool may be increasea. iney or course are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged in his pur chases of clothing and woolen goods to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to the manufacturers and merchants; nor is any mentien made of the fact that the sheep own ers themselves and their household must wear clothing and nse other articles manu factured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return their share of this increased price to the tradesmen. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks numbering from 25 to SO. The duty on the grade of imported wool which the sheep yield is 10 cents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece the duty thereon would be 60 or 72 cents, and this may be taken as the ut most enhancement of the price of the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent the increased price of the wool from 25 sheep and $36 that from the wool of 00 sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to about one third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum which in all its charges will adhere to it until it reaches the oonsumer. When made into cloth and other goods and material for use,its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a further sura has been added for the benefit of the manufactures on the operation of oth er tariff laws. In the meantime the day ar rives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himself and family for the winter. "When he faces the tradesmen for that pur pose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in the way of increased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactur ed form, but that he must add a considers, ble sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufac ture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the f aot that he hag paid upon a moderate pur chase as a result of the tariff scheme whioh, when he sold his wool seemed so profitable, increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he receives upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all the farmers in the coun try and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered, when it is made apparent that in the case of a large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the pres ent tariff on wool is illusory, and above all when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and un employed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it constitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the re moval or reduction of this duty should be in cluded in a revision of our tariff laws. the "trusts." In speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our home manufactures result ing from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not over looked that competition among our domes- tio producer sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that' this competition is too often strangled by combinations qnite preva lent at this time,and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration in the operation ot tnese selfish schemes. If, however, in the absenoe of such combination, a healthy and free competition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under onr tariff laws, ana it, wltn suon reduced price, its manu facture continues to thrive, it is entirely evi dent that one thing has been discovered which should be caref ally scrutinized in an effort to reauoe taxation. The neoessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point furnishes proof that someone is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity and that suoh prices are remunerative; and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus, where either of these conditions exist, a caae would seem to be pre sented tor an easy reduction ot taxation. HOW A 

CBAKOB SHOULD BE MADE. The considerations whioh have been pre sented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the reduction of our customs duties, and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose f ws may discharge a double duty to our peo ple Dy granting to tnem a measure ot relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of such considerations be, with any degree of fairness, regarded as evidence ot unfriendliness toward our manu facturing interests, or any lack of apprecia tion of their value and importance; these in terests constitute a leading and most sub stantial element of onr national greatness and furnish the proudproof of our country's prog ress. Bnt if in the emergenoy that presses upon ns onr manufacturers are asked to sur render something for the public good. and to avert disaster, their patriotism as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already affor ded should lead them to willing co-oper ation. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental re gard; but they conaot fail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self-interest and safety, when they are re minded of the fact that financial panic and to which the present condition tends afford no greater shelter or protection to our manu facturers than to our other important enter prises. Opportunity for safe, careful and de liberate reform is now afforded and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those wno nave resisted timely and reasonable re lief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The difficulty attending a wise and fair re vision of our tariff laws is not underestimat ed. It will require on the part of Congress great labor and care and especially a broad and national contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and reck less of the welfare of the entire country. Under onr present laws more than four thou sand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures, and many are hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable rednction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents bo features of hardship; but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction or tne amies im posed upon raw material in manufactures or its free importation is of course an impor tant factor in any effort to reduce the price of those necessary; it would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on suoh ma terial, but the manufactured proaucs oeing thus cheapened that part of the tariff now laid upon such product as a compensation to our manufacturers for the present price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Such reduction or free importation would serve besides to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change cau have anv iniurious effect oa oar manufac turers. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people mieht have the opportu nity of extending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption saving them from the depression, interruption in business and loss caused Dy giaitea aomseua market and affording their employes more certain and steady labor with its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than -Dartisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotio duty which should characteriie the aotion of those intrusted with the weal of a connuing But the obligation to declared party polioy and principle is not wanting to nrge prompt and efficient action. Both of the great polit ical parties now represented in government have by repeated and authoritative declara tion condemned the condition ot our laws which permits the collection from the people of unnecessary revenue and have in the most Bolemn manner promised its correction, and neither as citizens or partisans are our coun trymen in a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. HOT A 

THBOBT. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theor ies of protection and free trade, inis savors too much of bandvinor epithets. It is con dition which confronts ns not a theory. Belief from this condition may involve a slight redaction of the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be contemplated. The question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant, and the. persistent claim is made in certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the people from UDjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so called free traders, is mischievous and far removed from any considerations for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the neces sary expenses of an economical operation of the government, and to restore to tne Dust iness of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our in dustries, without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor wnicn our working men need and with benefit to them and to all our people, by cheapening the means of subsistence and increasing the means of their comforts. THE STATE OF THE UNION. The constitution provides that the Presi dent "shall, from time to time, give to Congress information of the state of the Union." It has been the custom of the ex ecutive, in compliance with the provision, to annually exhibit to Congress at the opening of its session the general condition of the country, and to detail with some par ticularity the operations of the different executive departments. It would be espec ially agreeable to follow this course at the present time, and call attention to the valuable accomplishments of these de partments during the last fiscal But I am so muoh impressed with the paramount importance of the subjeot to which this com munication has thus far been devoted that I shall forego the additional of any other topic, and only urge upon your immediate consider ation the "state of the Union" as shown in the present condition of our treasury and our general fiscal situation, upon which every element of our safety and prosperity depends. The reports of the heads ot departments, which will be submitted, oontain full and ex plicit information touching the transaction of the business intrusted to them, and such recommendations relating to legislation in the public interest as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and recommendations the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the government. There are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports demanding legisla tive consideration, and which I should be glad to submit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them, I beg leave to re peat prior recommendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the department of State, a brief history of the transactions of that important department, together with other matters wnicn it may hereafter be deemed essential to commend to the attention of Congress, may furnish tne occasion for a future communication.

The December session of the Supreme Court of Errors convened yesterday with the full bench. Corporation Counsel Driscsil requested the court to either hear the arguments In the appeal of the New Haven Steam Saw Mill company or come In some time in January. Chief Justice Park said he would consider Mr. DriscoU's motion. The first case argued was that of Augustus S. Chase et al., execu tors, vs. legatees of S. W. Hall et al. of Waterburr. Samuel W. Hall died in Waterbury in 1877. By the thirteenth clause of his will the use and improve ment of $10,000 was bequeathed to Nelson Hall for and during the term of his natural life, remainder to the children of Hopkins P. HaU. Mr. Hall re ceived $3,600 in cash and the balance In bank stock. He inventoried the stock as his own and in the list of his debts entered each year an item of $10,000 indebtedness to L. W. Hall's estate, payable alter his death, which has occurred since. As the stock is much mere valuable now plaintiffs do not wish to return this, but the $10,000 instead. Judge An drews decided that the children of Hopkins Hall are not entitled to receive the bank stock, but are to receive $10,000 and interest thereon. The next case argued was tne piainsin m appeal m mo w. Timothy J. O'Oonnell et ux. vs. Jeremiah Dennehy. This is the slander suit brought by the down town liquor dealer known as "Sheriff" O'Oonnell against Tiim.,, rt.nnAhv because the latter testified be fore the county commissioners to the effect that Mrs. O Conneu committed aamtery iu nor mwuuu, tj nm... nannphv before the Court of Com mon Pleas for $800 damages.
