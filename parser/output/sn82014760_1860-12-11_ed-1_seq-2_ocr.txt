' L ' ' Jl ' ' i'ihi mi"! if 'ruiri . .-, r . t. & J. NATIONAL REPUBLICAN. Tuesday, December 11, 1860. If any of our subscribers fail to receive their papers regularly, we hope they will notify ua of the fact -without delay, that we may call the attention cf the carriers to the neglect. Mr. Codb. This gentleman has at length been forced, by public opinion, to resign the office of Secretary of the Treasury. An avowed co-operator In the work of breaking up the Government, he has only remained so long in office, at the cost of bringing the deepest seem dal upon the President. It is proper to add, that the work of purging the Cabinet is not yet completed. it is currently reported that the lion. James Guthrie, of Kentucky, has been tendered the Secretaryship of the Treasury. Another report says that Mr. Holt, the present Postmaster General, has been offered tho position. 

YESTERDAY IX THE SENATE. The debate in the Senate yesterday, devel oped many points of interest. Mr. King said that the people of New York were determined lb uphold the Government and enforce the laws. Per contra, Mr. Pugh aid that Mr. Buchanan ought to be impeached, if he resorted to coercion against South Caro lina. The difference in the authorities is, that Mr. King represents a State, while it is doubtful if Mr. Pngh even represents a defeated party. Both the Senators from Connecticut made conciliatory observations upon tho difficulties of the times. A marked feature of the day was the con test between Mr. Green, of Missouri, and Mr. Davis, of Mississippi. Mr. Green was emphatic in the declaration that nobody in Missouri proposed disunion, and no less emphatic in ridiculing the pretended complaints of the States which never lost a slave running into the free States, against the non-execution of the fugitive slave law. It was Missouri, and not Mississippi, which suffered in that way. The remedy he proposed, was not a dissolution of the Union, but a border police. In the course of his remarks, he expressed his want of confidence in the efficacy of constitu tional amendments. In the course of the debate, Mr. Sumner produced the following autograph letter (hith erto unpublished) from Gen. Jackson to a Vir ginia clergyman : . " Private Washington, May 1, 1833. "Mr Deau Sir: I have bad a la borious task here, but nullification is dead ; and its actors and courtiers will only be remem bered by the people to be execrated for their wicked designs to sever and destroy the only good Government on the globe, and that pros perity and happiness we enjoy over every other portion of the world. " Human's gallows ought to be the fate of all such ambitious men, who would involve their country in civil war, and all the evils in its train, that they might reign and ride on its whirlwinds ana direct the storm. The free people of these United States have spoken, and consigned these wicked demagogues to their doom. Take care of your nullifiers you have them among you ; let them meet with the in dignant frowns of every man who loves his country. The tariff, it is now " and he italicizes or underscores the word "now" " known, was a mere pretext its burden was on vour coarse woollens. By the law of July, 1832, coarse woollen was reduced to five per cent, for the benefit of the South. Mr. Clay's bill takes it up, and classes it with woollens at ntty per cent., reduces it gradually down to twenty per cent., and there it is to remain, and Mr. Calhoun and all the nullifiers agree to the principle. " The cash duties and home valuation will be equal to fifteen per cent, more, and after the year 1842, you pay on coarse woollens thirty five per cent If this is not protection, I can not understand : therefore the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and a Southern Con federacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro or slavery question. " My health is not good, but is improving a liuie jrreseui me kimuiy iu your muy unu family, and believe me to be your friend. I will always be happy to hear from you. , " Andiiew Jackson. " The Rev. Andrea J. Crawford." A SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY. One of the candidates for the South Carolina Convention, Claudian B. Northrop, said in his card to the electors : "In my judgment, the first object of the Con vention should be to ordain the independence of the people of South Carolina, by immediate dissolution of the Federal Union. " Whatever alliances our Republic may here after form, we should never enter into any union with other States, bv which a general government shall be established, whose laws can control our people against their sovereign will. I hope lor a (Jonfederacy ot independ ent sovereign slavcholding States. None other, and no more Unions." These paragraphs' open up a part of the questions which will arise, if the Utopian scheme of a Southern Confederacy is attempted to be realized. It is easy enough to propose such a Confederacy in general terms, but the difficulties will be found to be immense, when it comes to the practical point of settling how it shall be constituted, and with what powers it shall be invested. There will be at the threshold, the settlement of the relative weight of the States which shall compose it. Will the great Stato of Georgia assent to a Senate, in which she shall count no more than Florida, or will South Carolina as sent to a House, in which she will be dwarfed by the standard of numbers? Equally troublesome will be the adjustment of the powers of the proposed Confederacy, and to be ended, probably, in no otherway than by de nying it any substantial powers whatever. The States in favor of opening the African slave trade, will never consent to put it in the power of slavcholding States to control them. So, too tho Slates in favor of direct taxation and Eu ropean trade, will never yield the power of reg ulating commerce to States in favor of build ing up -manufactures. These nullifying gentle men may agree in leaving the North, but they cannot escape everlastingquarrels aniongthein-selves. A Viboixian Thrown Overboard. Mr. Millson, tho Representative of the Norfolk district, being grievously suspected of a want of sympathy with South Carolina nullification, is thrown overboard by the Washington Con slitution, in the following summary style: "Mr. Corwin's title to be considered the ex ponent of Northern or Western conservatism is as valid as that of Mr. Millson to the cham pionship of Virginia, or Mr. Henry Winter Davis to that of Maryland. Wo concede that any one of the three is as likely as the others to receive the confidence of the South, or to influence materially its conduct in the present controversy." 

VIRGINIA ON SECESSION MR. BOTTS'S LETTER. Tho Alexandria Gazette publishes, a letter from Mr. Bolts, under date of November 127, which tells some plain truths in a very plain way. It undoubtedly expresses the general feeling in Virginia in respect to the proceed ings in South Carolina. The letter is too long for our columns, and we make the -following extracts : " I do not concur with you in opinion, that the dissolution of the Union is inevitable ; the sky looks threatening, I grant you, but so it has done before, and yet the clearest sunshine has succeeded, without a shower of rain or a peal of thunder ; so I trust it will be again. But, if it is to be otherwise, and the Govern ment of the United States is to be overthrown, no part of the folly, the wickedness, or the crime, shall be charged npon me, either by the wise and good men of the present age, or of generations yet to come. " True, South Carolina has rushed on with a headlong impetuosity, wholly unsuitcd to the gravity of the occasion, as if she were afraid to trust herself with time for calm deliberation, relying more upon the passion than the wisdom of her people ; and it may be, that under a ridic ulous ana false idea of a becoming pride and true greatness, she may involve herself in very serious difficulty; she may een declare herself out of the Union; she did so by ordinance in Convention in 1833; hut still the Union was not rent asunder, nor will it now be, as I think ; no other State is likely to go with her, and what is best, and surest of all, Virginia certainly will not in her present state of mind. " If I could see the least semblance of justi fication in the attitude South Caroliua has as sumed, I would sympathize with her but I can not, for reasons already given in my speech, which you say you have just read. 1 see noth ing in that position but plain, bold, daring, fiat-footed rebellion against aud treason to the rest of the States, and I cannot, under any contingency, be induced to take sides with her in her disloyalty and treachery. " Wh,en Bhould we bo safe in declaring war for the defence of our honor or our rights, or for the protection of our people, if in the midst of the war the Union could be dissolved, and tho Government destroyed, whenever some one of the States might be disappointed in the election of her favorite candidate for tho Presi dency, or because her interest would be pro moted by doing so, or because it would enhance the price of cotton, to open a direct trade with the enemy t What Government on earth would thereafter treat with us as one of the nations of the world, or treat us with respect ? I do not wish to be disrespectful to anybody and most surely not to you but I hope jou will par don me for saying, that one of the inconceiva ble and irreconcilable things of this world, to my mind, is, that an idea of such unmixed and unmitigated nonsense and absurdity as that of the right ot a state to secede at pleas ure, should ever have obtained a place in the mind of any man who was not an absolute lunatic " But if a new Confederacy were to be formed, I could not go with you, for I should use what ever influence I might he able to exert against entering into one with South Carolina, that has played the part of a common brawler and dis turber of the public peace for the last thirty years, and who could give no security that 1 would be willing to accept, that she would not be ns faithless to the next compact as she has been to this which she is now endeavoring to avoid. In addition to which, the objects and interests of South Carolina, as she conceives them, are essentially at variance with those of Virginia; this State will never sanction piracy, and if not, South Carolina docs not desire our company, and would get rid of us as soon as possible. " What may be the ultimate condition of things. I do not pretend to be prophetic enough to foretell, but 1 do not think there is any like lihood that any other State will go out, as South Carolina proposes to do, in a sort of sky-rocket blaze. The rest will be disposed to consider matters more carefully, and will take time for consideration and reflection." It is now certain that Mr. Secretary Cobb will at once leave his office and go home, to devote his talents to the disunion revolution in Georgia. If he succeeds as well in that busi ness as he has in conducting the affairs of the United States Treasury, the new Southern Con federacy will be hopelessly broken down in about Bixty days from the present date. What a conclusion is that which we behold of the long career of the Democratic party I After thirty years of almost uninterrupted pos session of the Government, that party retires from office with the Republic sundered and the Treasury exhausted. It certainly is high time that a new party, with new principles and new men, should take the places of the com bined weakness, treachery, and incapacity, which have brought the country into its pres ent condition N. Y. Tribune. A writer in the Columbus (Ga.) Times pro poses that the new Southern Confederacy should not repeat again the useless and disastrous ex periment of republican Government, but, as soon as the States are out of the Union, should at once proceed to organize itself As a constitu tional monarchy. This is a first rate idea, and we take the lib erty of suggesting Robert Toombs as the most proper person for King. It is true that Mr. Rhett, in South Carolina, and Mr. Jeff Davis, in Mississippi, may think they have claims to the purple equal to those of the great Revolu tionist of Georgia, but the matter might be com promised by making them princes of the blood royal. Or, on the South Caroliua principle, that the minority ought to govern, the case might be submitted to the people, and the can didate having the fewest votes could be pro claimed. Still, on that principle, Toombs might carry the day. We go fur him. Huzza for Robert 1 1 Long may he wave I N. Y, Tribune. According to the census returns, the present white male popuhtion of South Carolina above twenty years of ago is about 47,000. Statements representing that 65,000 have been enrolled in the militia are necesmtrily erroneous. Returned Passengers. The steamship Iluutsvilic, Captain Post, which arrived Sunday morning from Savannah, brought eighty-six steerage passengers, who wero sent back by the authorities. 

THIRTY-SIXTH GONGBESS, Second Session. Monday, December 10, 18G0. 8ENATE. Our report closed yesterday, while Mr. Green was spaking upon Mr. Powell's resolution. Mr. Latham said that California will remain with the Union tho great North and West no matter what ocenrs. The Pacific railway was the great desideratum of her people. A protracted discussion ensued, which was participated in by Senators Powell, King, Fos ter, Green, Latham, Dixon, Douglas, Sumner, Brown, Pugb, Hale, Mason, and others. . Mr. Bigler rose to address the Senate, but, tho hour being late, gave way for a motion to adjourn. HOUSE. Our report closed yesterday, while Mr. Val landigham was speaking. Mr. McClernand, of Illinois, said that seces sion opened a troublous future. He did not believe our Government could be dissolved by the action of one of its constituent parts. Bound together as we are, by a common lan guage and religion, and common mountains and rivers, it is only by a civil and sectional war, such as the sun never shone on, that such a result can be produced. There is more strength inour-Governmentthanis extensively believed, and the peopte will, sooner or later, rally to its maintenance. lhe people of the Northwest are an interior people, and eminently prosperous, waxing stronger and stronger every day. Shall we consent to have ourselves cut off 7 Mr. Sickles proceeded to show that every in stinct, thought, and purpose, of the city of New York, is national, patriotic, and American. In the name of such a people, with such a record as he had presented, he ventured to appeal on all sides of the House for the moderation and de votion to duty which had always characterized them. One of the greatest dangers of the day is, that the country does not understand the'ex. tent of the peril in which we are placed. The country has been filled with delusions, which even now present themselves; one of which is, that disunion can be prevented by force; that that it can, by revolution, bo brought to the verge of destruction, and yet, at last, the strong arm of power can stay the work. On the call of force, come whence it may, no man would pass the frontier of the city of New York to wage war againstaState which, through its constituted authority, should, for its rights, interests, and honor, seek safety in a separate existence. The city of New York will cling to the Union while a single hope is left, but when there is no longer a Union, proud ns she is of her opinion as a metropolis, ready to banish sectional prejudices, ana willing to contribute all in her power to maintain her honor at home and abroad when there is no longer a Union, she will never consent to be an appendage, a slave of a puritan province. She will assert her own independence. There is no sympathy now between the city and State of New York, nor has there been for years. She will open her free port to the commerce of the world. Mr. Sherman said it was not bis purpose to engage in a debate, but to report a bill from the Committee of Ways and Means. Consent being given, the bill was read. It authorizes the President to issue Treasury notes for such sums as the exigencies of the public service require, not exceeding ten millions of dollars, of a denomination not less than one hundred dollars, to be redeemed at the expira tion of a year, bearing interest not exceeding six per centum, for the payment and redemp tion of which the faith of the United States is solemnly pledged ; the bill also authorizes the f resident to borrow irom lime to lime money to redeem the same, the notes to be received in payment of all debts, taxes, etc. ; its opera tion is limited to the 1st of January, 1863. Mr. Sherman explained that the bill was to meet the temporary demands of the Treasury, which was not now even able to pay the sala ries of the members of Congress. Last week the revenue fell short a quarter of a million. No increase of the Treasury debt is proposed. The receipts of the current quarter have fallen short several millions, and it is probable that during the remaining three-fourths of the year there will be a deficiency of ten or fifteen mil lions. We have been three years living on credit, and we ought to preserve the credit of the Government by the means now proposed, or change the revenue laws. This will not, ac cording to appearances, be the last loan bill. Its provisions are similar to those of the act of 1857. Mr. Crawford proposed several amendments, one of which specifically pledges the public land's for the payment and redemption of the debt. He was of the opinion that there could be no agreement between the North and the South, and therefore it was the duty of South ern members to ask their friends that the lands be set apart for that purpose. They did not desire any of the retiring States to be oppressed with their quota of the public debt, so long as any agent of the original States holds any of the assets. Mr. Houston did not regard this amendment as essential. If there should unfortunately bo a disruption, in all likelihood there would of necessity bo negotiation concerning the portion of debt falling on tho seceding States. As a matter of course, the assets would be divided enuallv with the debt. Mr. Grow opposed pledging the public lands, and maintained, as heretofore, in the language of General Jackson, that they should not be regarded as a source of revenue. The amendments were rejected ; that pledg ing the public lands by a vote of 75 against 121. The bill was then passed in the form reported. Mr. Morris, of Illinois, endeavored to intro duce his resolution declaratory of devotion to the Union, Ac. Questions of order were raised, that it could not be done while the motion to excuse Mr. Hawkins from service on the select committee was pending. Without further action thereon, the House adjourned. Tuesday, December 11, 18C0. 

SENATE. After the reading of the Journal, Mr. Colla mer made a motion to take up the Kansas bill; which was agreed to, and made the special or der for next Tuesday at one o'clock. Mr. Clingman moved that the Chaplain of last session be requested to serve this session also. Agreed to. On motion of Mr. Fitch, it was ordered that an extra number of the President's message be printed for the use of the Senate, On motion of Mr. Cameron, the Morrill tariff bill was taken, up after some discussion yeas 29, nays 27 and referred to the Finance Com mittee. Mr. Hale introduced a resolution of inquiry in relation to our military affairs whether the expenses were more or less than is necessary and to instruct the committee so to report. Agreed to Mr. Bigler claiming the floor, which he yielded yesterday, discussed the resolutions of Mr, Powell, on the stato of the Union, at some length. Ho said he was a Union man, and would do whatever he could for the Union, He had a word or two to say to his friends, on that side of tho Chamber. Ho was speaking when our reporter left the Chamber. 

HOUSE. The House met at the usual hour, and was called to order by the Speaker. Prayer was offered by tho Chaplain, Rev. T. H. Stockton, in which allusion was made to the t resent state of the country, and also to the fnion Prayer Meeting Convention which as sembles in Washington to-night. After the reading of the Journal of yester day A report from the Postmaster General was received, transmitting the information which the Houio ha S called for by its resolution passed on the 23d of June last, by which the Postmaster General was desired to furnish the House, du ring the present session, a statement of the dis tance of the mail routes from the post offices of the members of both branches of Congress to the cily of Washington. The -report was re ferred to tho Committee on Mileage, and ordered to be printed. The subject pending being the motion of Mr. Hawkins, nsking to bo excused from serv ing on the committee Mr. Cobb, of Alabama, very briefly addressed the House. Tho eye of the whole country was directed on the committee. Ho hoped some good might result from the deliberations of the committee. But tho time was short. In his own State, the election for delegates to the Convention would be held on the 24th day of the present month, and the Convention would meet in January, lie hoped a vote would be taken immediately. Tho people-were anxious in re lation to this matter. What meant those crowded galleries 7 He hoped they would organize the committee, and seo if something could not be done. He referred to the Boston election, and regarded it as a good sign. He hoped his State would remain in the Union. He called for the previous question. Mr. Davis asked Mr. Cobb to withdraw his call for the previous question, as he desired to give his reasons why he should consent to serve on the committee. Mr. Cobb withdrew the call for the question, with the understanding that Mr. Davis would renew it. Mr. Davis then stated that he intended to serve on the committee. Though his constit uents mightnot approve his course, yet his own conscience approved it, and that was sufficient for him. He renewed the call for the previous qncstion. The call for tho previous question was sus tained. The question on the motion to be exensed was then taken, and resulted as follows yeas 95, nays 101. So the gentleman was not excused from serving on the committee. Mr. Hawkins then remarked that silence on his part might be misconstrued. Ho had but one word to say he would not serve on the committee. Mr. Boyce, of South Carolina, then asked to be excused from serving on the committee. Mr. Burnett hoped the gentleman would be excused. No member should be compelled to serve against his will ; it would entirely de feat the object of tho committee. Mr. Smith, of Virginia, had voted against ex cusing the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Haw kins. He looked with uneasiness upon the present Btate of the country, and hoped some thing would be done by the committee tq er raugo and settle the existing difficulties. He was anxious to seo the movement go forth in the true spirit in which it was offered. He might vote to excuse others from States where others might be found to fill the vacancies, but he could not in the case before the House. Mr. Burnett, of Kentucky, wanted to know if there was an instance on record where mem bers bad been compelle'u' to serve against their will. Mr. Smith knew of many such. Bat in this case, gentlemen bad asked to be excused, at the same time not intending to serve if their request was refused. Mr. Burnett was opposed to using force. Mr. Smith was not in favor of using force. But the crisis was an imminent one, and re quired positive action. He then called for the Srevious question on the motion to excuse Mr. iovce. The call for the question was sustained, and the yens and nays being taken, resulted in a tic vote, and he was not excused. Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, asked to be excused from serving on the committee. Pending the consideration of which, our re port closed,

The defence eery day is rendered stronger. The wives of officers and men have packed up their effects, ready to quit at a moment's notice. The Legislature will probably sit during the Convention. News from Florida shows perfect unanimity in the State for secession, and the enthusiasm is increasing daily. Lincoln was burned in effigy at Fernandina on Friday last. The Convention election returns from dis tricts which went for co operation in 1852 show a great revolution in public opinion, the vote in favor of separate secession being tweuty, to one against it. ' Columbia, Dec. 10. In reference to the proposition to send commissioners from Vir- inia, Kentucky, and other border States, to the outh Carolina Convention, the Guardian says it is a useless measure that the Convention will not listen to persuasion from any quarter.

KENTUCKY. Louiscille, Dec. 8. In response to recent applications for a suspension of specie payment, the Kentucky banks have determined that such a measure would afford no commercial relief, and consequently they will continue to pay specie as usual. TENNESSEE. Nashville, Dec. 8 The Governor of this State has called an extra session of the Legis lature on the 7th of January, to consider the present condition of the country. Items Telegraphed from Washington. It is stated by some persons here that Gener al Scott advised the President, some time since, to strengthen the force at Fort Moultrie : but instead ol complying with this advice, tne r res ident caused the troops stationed there to be ordered to California, when there were plenty of other troops who could have been detailed to that duty. Northern people here, as well as Southern, are writing letters denunciatory of Vie administration lor what tney allege to De its dilatoriness in tne present state ol attain. Washington, Dec. 10. The President has just been assured, from an authentic source, that the authorities of South Carolina will make no resistance either to the collectiou of duties or to the Federal posession of the forts guard ing Charleston harbor, during the remainder of his administration. The conservative sentiments uttered to-day by Senator Dixon, of Connecticut, together with Mr. Hale's correction of the erroneous im- Jiressions occasioned by reports concerning his ale speech, would argue well for ultimate ac commodation between the States, were it not for the idea thrown out by Mr. King, of New York, that coercion was the policy of the Re publican party. There is too much reason to fear that persistence to the bitter end in an ex treme partisan policy is the card of the leading Republicans in Congress. It is probable that there will be a long dis cussion in the House, precedent to final action, as to excusing members from serving on the , committee of one from each State. I bear from a well-posted quarter that only Messrs. Haw kins and Boyce will decline to serve thereon. The motion for raising a committee of thirteen in the Senate will doubtless pass. Judge Morscll, of the Circuit Court, here, has just decided, that when an inventor, after the rejection of his claims for a patent, with draws the same, and suffers a considerable number of years to elapse before renewing his application, he will be adjudged to havo for feited any rights that he might otherwise have bad. The immense edition of the agricultural re port of the Patent Office, ordered by Congress at the last session, has been completed by the Senate printer, aud will be shortly in the hands of Congressmen.
