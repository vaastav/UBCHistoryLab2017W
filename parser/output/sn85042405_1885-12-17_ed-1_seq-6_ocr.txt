The Washington Evening Star says: The ruling of Commissioner Sparks, of the gen­ eral land office, suspending the issue of land patents in certain sections of the west, which embraces Dakota, has creatad no little excitement in that region. Com­ plaining letters from settlers affected by the ruling are coming to senators. The complaint is that the commissioner's ac­ tion makes the innocent suffer with the guilty, and that it imposes the same hard­ ships and inconveniences upon, those who purchased their homesteads honestly as those who resorted to dishonest methods. A strong effort will probably be made to have the ruling changed ho as to apply only to persons known to have entered their a,nds in an irregular manner. Personal Gossip.

VANDERBILT'S MILLIONS. Bis Two Klilest Snns Get tlie Uullc of Hi* Property—Tlie Other Children Uot StlO, 000,000 Ktich.

All the rest, residue and re­ mainder of all property and estate, real, personal and mixed of any description and wheresoever situated, he gave unto his two sons, Cornelius Vanderbilt and William K. Vanderbilt, in equal shares, and to their heirs and assins, for their use forever. The amount is estimated at about $100,000, 000, which willgiveeach $50,000,000, which sum is doubtless equal or nearly equal to the holdings of any living individual in the country. A disposition to perpetuate the family's supremacy in the business world, however, is seen in the provision in the will which directs that the railroad stocks shall be held in bulk, and not disposed of without the consent of every person con­ cerned. The bequests for public and charitable purposes are as follows: I give ami bequeath to the board of trust of the Vanderbilt university of Nashville, Tenn., incorporated under the laws of the state of Tennessee, §200,000 oi the second mortgage bonds of the Lake Shore it Michi­ gan Southern railroad company, to be ap­ plied to the usages and purposes of said university.

The Burial of Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt family desired the re­ mains of the husband and father to be conveyed to the tomb with as little dis­ play as possible, and their wishes were re­ spected. Fifth avenue is not much given to display, oven when a million­ aire is carried to his tomb, and when the hour for the funeral of Will­ iam H. Vanderbilt arrived Friday morning the 10th, there were but few indications, even in the neighborhood of the Vanderbilt home that anything unusual was going on. ust three flags fluttered at half mast among a plenty of bare poles. No badge of crape was seen anywhere except on the little electric bell at the Vanderbilt mansion. The ceremonies in the church were simple Episcopal burial services. They were con­ ducted by Rev. Dr. Cooke, the pas­ tor, and Mr. Clapp. Bishop Potter was present in his robes, but did not participate. The priests met the pall bearers at the door of the church and pre­ ceded them down the center aisle, chanting as they walked along. Preceding the coffin walked the pall bearers, wearing white sashes. They were: Chauncey M. Depew, J. Pierrepont Mor­ gan, Charles Rapallo, William Turnbull, William Bliss, George J. Magee, C. M. Berger, Charles C. Clark, Judge John R. Brady, W. L. Scott, D. O. Mills and S. W. Caldwell.

Winnepeg Special: Riel's remains were laid to rest beneath the Catholic cathedral at St. Boniface, the authorities beingafraid to bury them in a grave as they might bo stolen. To show the esteem in which the de­ ceased rebel was held, his people bore his re­ mains upon their shoulders all the way from St. Vital, almost six miles. To see the stal­ wart, rugged forms of eighthafl-breedswith beards covered with frost struggling under their load was a sight never to be forgotten. Two paces in front of the coffin walked Riel's two brothers, Joseph and Alexandre, both stalwart specimens of their race. The first sleigh in the procession contained Riel's mother, his two sisters and his wife. The poor old woman on leaving the house in­ sisted on walking in the procession, and did so as long as her failing strength would bear her up. She was at last obliged to ride in a sleigh. The ordinary requim mass was celebrated by the clergy at the cathedral. The poor mother was weeping piteouslv, as were also other members of the family and relatives, a large number o! whom were present. Tlie Des Moines Valley Lands. Senator Wilson, of Iowa, has renewed his proposition to settle the old and vexed question of title in the Des Moines valley. These lands are along the Des Moines above Lacoon fork. Under a grant in aid of a canal in 1846, they were improperly certi­ fied by the department of the interior to the Btate of Iowa. therefrom located lands sold by the United States, the state re­ ceived indemnity lands for them, and the Iowa legislature, in 1866, ratified the ac­ ceptance. By this act the state was stop­ ped from all claims to the grant in the Des Moines valley. Settlers went on these granted lands supposing they were part ol the public domain, the state treated them as trespassers, and sued them. What a Fall Was There. Chicago. Special.—Hon. Henry O'Connor appeared in the Armory court as prosecut­ ing witness against Fred Hart, for having, he alleged, robbed him of his pocket book and a railroad pass. Wearing yet on his swollen and discolored face the imprint of intellectuality, his ineffectual at­ tempts to appear the man he had been, were pitiful to behold. Henry O'Con­ nor was for years attorney general of Iowa. He is sixty years of age and has held many, positions of trust and honor. The man Hart was discharged and the decree or the court was endorsed by the ex-attorney gen­ eral. Justice Meech gave the once eminent lawyersome advice, and Mr. O'Connor Haid he would follow it.

"Here I am—tear me to pieces!" The ter­ rible story has created intense excitement throughout the city. St. Paul has collected $86,013 licensei far this year.
