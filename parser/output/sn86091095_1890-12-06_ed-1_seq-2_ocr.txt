Charles Francis Adams has been superceded in the presidency of the U. P. road by Sidney Dillon. The California State Farmers' Alliance pronounced in favor of the Australian system of voting, which implies that they want a free vote and a fair count. The St. Louis Republic says the opinion is freely expressed that any Alliance man who votes for Ingalls for senator from Kansas will be lynched. Not very complimentary to Ingalls, truly. It was intimated a few days ago that General Miles might have got ten up the Indian scare to boom his presidential aspirations. The weak place in this seems to be that General Miles is not known to have any presidential aspirations, We sometimes think that the domain of politics does not extend to either mor als or religion.—Pocatello Tribune. So once thought Mr. Ingalls of Kansas, but the ethics and the mor als of politics have since extended To him and he will soon shine in the i obscurity of private life.

It is also well known! that to this class more than to the Indians themselves is our country indebted for the terrible bloodshed 'hat has so often spread consterna s,en and death over the American frontier, and were the Indians to me up and sweep them from the face of the earth without injuring innocent people, the public could well afford to condone the act. We believe the danger, and all danger of Indian butcheries has passed away, and that no more massacres some 3 about exhausted itself material harm to without any one e xcept the class who lie around res ervations for the purpose of getting up Indian outbreaks, real or pre tended, that, thev m. occur. Choose Wisely. Soon now two United States Sen ators will be elected to represent our state at the Federal Capitol. These men, whoever they may be, should be capable and reliable. They should also be fully identified with the interests of the state and intimately acquainted with the con ditions and people of the widely dissevered sections thereof. The former of these qualifications prob 'ably belong in about an equal de gree to each of the prominent can didates in the field. But that Hon. W. J. McConnell is better acquaint ed with the northern part of the state, its needs and people than either of the others is indisputable. Believing, therefore, in efficient as well as capable representation, and paying respectful, heed to the wishes of the people in political matters ; and, further, believing as we do that the people of the northern part of the state desire the election of a citizen of their section to the U. S. Senate, that that citizen is W. J. McConnell, and, further, believing that they are entitled in all fairness to have their desire gratified, we have hoped and still hope to see him chosen U. S. Senator from Idaho. Certainly it would be better to please the people than the politi 'cians in the matter of electing a United States Senator, as in all other matters ; and we admit that we can see nothing in the proposi tion to elect two Senators from the 1890 BY each the been the the vote the any be ago of i southern part of the state, except a weakness to cater to the vanity and ambition of aspirants to a position is t0 which, whatever just claims they an ma y have, will be as valid two, four all ; or s * x years hence as they are now. And, viewing the matter from the ' 9tand P°i nt °f a disinterested spec- of j tato U ^ seems to us that McCon ! nell s claims upon the people, if the is ; theory of such claims be admitted, are at least equal to those of either j b * s opponent?.

This factory, it goes on \ 0 sa y with continued uncon President's Message. This document has been received and is an exceedingly dishwatery affair.

Next the African slave trade is taken up, but we are not informed as to its present status. We have i the proud satisfaction, however, of being informed that a "complete treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between the United States and the independent state of Congo is pending." Fortunate, in deed, that we are to secure the blessings of a treaty with Congo, Central America is next discussed, and we learn that Minister Mizner has been recalled for the part he took in the murder of General Bar runda on board of an American vessel. The Nicaragua canal is said to be malting encouraging progress, The reports from our minister at Santiago warrant the expectation of I an early and satisfactory adjust- J ment of the claims of American citizens against Chili. Our relations j with China have been the subject of much correspondence, hut what j the result of that correspondence is is not recorded. Under the same head we learn that Sir Edmund Monson has rendered an award that j no compensation is due from the Danish government to the United States ou account of what is com inonly known as the Carlos-Butter field claim. field claim.

All of which, if not i very enlightening, is thankfully re i ceived. But the plagueing qustion arising out of all of this befogging statement is: Which side of the silver question is Mr. Harrison on, anyway? The revenues of our government I for the fiscal year ending June 30, j 1890, were, from all sources, «63.1 | 963,089.55, and the total expend! j lures *358,618,584.53. The volume 'helof - *- -- ' - • money in circulation has in j creased in nineteen months >$93, i 836,814, ; of populati 1 ^ j 836,814, or about $1.50 per capita on. Ot this increase j $7,100,000 was due to recent silver 1 legislation. | j n urging the passage of the force i bü] i tLe president says : "Its prob able effectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is made toit." This is the language of a churl. The bill is opposed by a large majority of the American people because it is known to be an unconstitutional interference with the full, fair and free use of the ballot, and the fact that similar legislation has been on our statutes for twenty years and has been de clared constitutional by the supreme court, does not invalidate the serted unconstitutionality of the Lodge infamy in the least. laws may be very similar and yet one of them may be constitutional and the other unconstitutional. Moreover, decisions of our supreme court of late years are pot conclu sive as to the constitutionality validity of a law, that bodv being frequently influenced by other sidérations than right, law and j ! tice. But we have already pursued this subject too far for our space, Tha message is a failure as a state paper, and is so lengthy that fow w*ill read it. as Twi or con US . It take? a great man to make a president of this country.1 A State Alliance. the The farmers of California have organized a State Alliance and put forth a platform of principles dif fering from the platforms of their eastern brethren only in the fact that the tariff is not referred Observing this omission the Chron icle jumps to the conclusion that the tarif!' is approved by the Cali fornia farmers. The inference r.ot legitimate. On the contrary, it proves that they were unaccus tomed to drafting platforms and inadvertently omitted reference a matter in w hich all Americans, his the ; whether opposing or favoring, are In- j deeply concerned. It further proves j that the great daily papers of Cali re- j fornia, of which the Chronicle is principal one, have habitually treat ed the tarifF in a sensational and is not in an educational manner. The tariff affects the pecuniary interests i of the people when properly pre of sented (o their understanding, This the farmers of California will discover in good time, and when they draft another platform will of have and express an opinion either in- for or against it. the Time was when the American farmer had no opinions about grant ing the public lands in limitless quantities to railroad companies, he and the robbery was pushed ahead by the party in power at a rate that would in a decade or two have wit nessed the transfer of the entire be public domain to those corpora tions. But the magnitude and effrontery of the grant business set at of I the people to thinking, and soon J such a roar of disapproval went up from the robbed multitude that j Congress was compelled to call a halt. And so it will- be in regard j to the questions now being pushed upon the attention of the country by its farmers. They have votes, and they are rapidly acquiring in j telligence to know how best to employ their votes for their protec tion, and they will do so in spite of purblind partisan newspapers. T1 legislation of the last thirty years has made it possible for a few cor portions comprising a few thous rtn d men to dictate even the terms of existence to more than 00,000, ! 000 of people. To say that this i anomalous state of things is to be P erulanent i* to deny common | sense ■'> the people wronged by it. The equities that have produced i il are being studied by the prod cers of wealth. They will be com prehended and then will follow their utter destruclion, whether existing ! Poetical parties will it or not. | And it is a good omen that the ! demands of the farmers are. so far, with the single exception of suffrage, calculated to promote common sense, honesty and purity in the Tilminictrofim, of ti ! m ine aummistration of the gov i r n.r. »» ,. 1 s 1 .

' We hear a great deal said about what this, that and the other has done for Idaho, and it is prob able that all have done something for the territory in times past. But ex-Governor Stevenson's man services, about which nothing is said, even by his own party, have totally eclipsed nil others. He saved the territory from dismemberment. To him our people are indebted for the privilege now offered them of elect ing U. S. Senators. But for his timely and intelligent action when a republican Congress had passed a bill dismembering Idaho and di viding her fair domain up amongst her neighbors there would now be no state of Idaho to elect U. S. 1 Senators ; for Mr. Cleveland, with out the information given him by ex-Governor Stevenson, would sure ly have signed the bill that would have relegated her to nothingness.
