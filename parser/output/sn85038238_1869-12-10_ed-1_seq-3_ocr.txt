The Editor and Publisher of the New York Independent celebrated the twenty-first anniversary of that able and most commendable family paper, on Thursday of last week. We have repeatedly spoken in high terms of this paper and quite a large club comes to this place. Its , ad mirers here, will doubtless increase. Upper Sandusky, Dec. 7th, 18G9. Mr. Editor : As your paper appears' to be open for communications on all subjects, I desire to say a few words as to scnoois ana school arrangements My object is to draw a picture of what toon place in a town not a great wav off, entirely freeing our town of any thing of the kind, for it is well known that our people, our school Board of Education, our Superintendent, our teachers, and our children are all right. ana that there is not tne slightest jar in the whole machinery. In this school thafT desire to speak of such, incidents as the following occur frequently : jonn Jones reports rtutn sours as hav ing pointed her finger at Bessa Myers. and Bess in return having made a mouth at Ruth. The teacher conceived the offense on the part of Ruth as deserving a severe reprimand, whereupon she was sent to the Superintendent for that- purpose. As to Bessa nothing short of suspension during the balance ot the term would atone lor her oflence, Bessa's mother felt and talked that, as tne casta oeut was witn itutn, her child should not be deprived tt the right of school tor so trifling an oflence, and especially when provoked to it. Neigh bors interceded in Jjessa s behalf. Su perintendent when approached thought it a very grave and serious matter of making mouths m school, and thought that nothing short of callinsr a meetinsr oi me .tsoaru or Education would answer in a case of so much magnitude. Now it is generally supposed that the wisdom ot tne town is concentrated in tne "ijoara ot .Education" as it was never known to thunder while that august body was in session. The Board" meets, the teacher Tnakes statement of the case, firmly believes what was told her by John as she ha always known him to be a truthful boy Superintendent argues the oroDrietv of making an example of this case and preventing a re-ocurrence, claims that nothing short of a public acknowledff mentof the wrong done, and apromise to oo so no more on the part of Bessa to the teacher, in the presence of the Board, will suffice for the enormity of me onense; ana runner, mat Bessa's mother ought to be humiliated in some way for the contempt she has shown ior tne school, the teacher, the Superin tendent and the "Board." The Board after a fair investigation and due delib eration, came to the conclusion that Bessa's conduct was not to be tolerated in a well regulated school : that in order to preserve their dignity as men and officers of the institution. Bessa shall be required to do as suggested by the Superintendent, and in future the mother must do likewise, or the child must remain suspended as per sen tence ot the teacher.

There were a number perfect in reci tation but failed in deportment, and they are trying to overcome that diffi culty, and I hope by the next report to have a number perfect in both. I haye as yet had no cases in truancy and but little tardiness, and this I hope to soon overcome. The scholars take a great interest in their studies, and the most of them are improving rapiddly while a few make but little improvement. I haye had quite an addition made to the school-room in the way of repaint ing of the old blackboards and the in troduction of new ones, which adds much to the facility of recitation. And the parents begin to take much more interest in the school room than here tofore. James S. Foster, Teacher. -
