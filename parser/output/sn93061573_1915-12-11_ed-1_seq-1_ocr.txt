NO. 50. x PREPAREDNESS IS PLEA IN WILSON'S MESSAGE President Asks Con o rem for Mer chant Marine. Takes Shot at I'n-Amerlean Crowd. President Wilson's message to congress Tuesday is characterized hy the press of all parties as the most interesting ' of his document and full of timely and pertinent suggestions. That he struck the popular keynote in his advocation of remedies for the many problems now confronting the government is evidenced by the comment of al most the entire American press. "His conception of Pan-Americanism" as set forth in the message is broad and inspiring," says the Santa Fe New Mexican editorially, "his plea for preparedness is sensible, logical and business-like; his state ments as to the need of a merchant marine are statements whose truth and pertinence are self-evident to every thinking citizen; his sugges tions as to revenue are reasonable. Notwithstanding the restrained and level-headed tone of the message, the president, in his reference to citi zens of foreign birth and foreigners in this country who have brought disgrace upon our nationalism by their underhanded and unpatriotic efforts in behalf of foreign sover eignties, displays more feeling than in any previous message. The e pressions of indignation on the part of the president, at these instances of disloyalty and treason, will strike an answering chord In the heart of every patriotic American and he will have the approval of his country in whatever measures are taken to enable the 'hand of our power' to lose over these undesirable aliens. President Wilson's arraignment of those who 'calling themselves Am ericans have so far forgotten them selves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side in the great conflict in Europe above their regard for the peace and dignity of the United States' is a stinging one, and a deserved one and one more than justified by present develop ments in the exposure of Teutonic plots against the 'peace and dignity' of this country. "It seems to us that the President's plea for a body of citizens who will be able when emergency arrives, to defend their country efficiently and promptly, is based upon the most conspicuous common sense. His presentation of the real American idea of preparedness, free from ev ery taint of imierialistic ambition or desire for conquest or dominion, is admirable. We believe the fol lowing paragraph sums up well this American spirit: "'No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to perceive that their pas sion is for peace, their genius best displayed in the practice of the arts of peace. Great democracies are not belligerent. They do not desire or seek war. Their thought is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un rensored thought thai quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But just because we de mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government, of our lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practlne. We Insist upon security In prosecuting our self-chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others."1 Lops t Qe Convention Washington, Dee. (J. If anyone had any last lingering doubU as to whether Woodrow Wilson would be the democratic nominee for the presidency in 1910, those last lin gering doubU would vanish after an , hour's milling with the Democratic hosts who are gathering here for the meeting of the national committee tomorrow. Someone was foolish enough to start a poll of the committeemen as they arrived from the various states. After getting twelve straight ballots reading "Wilson sure" and stares as if to say, "Why ask such a question?" the poll was abandon ed. It only emphasizes the dead certainty barring a most revolu tionary upheaval of sentiment of the renomination of the president. The fight for the convention was a lively one tonight, with St Louis claiming victory. Dallas has a big delegation here and a noisy one. San Francisco is out of the running. The convention will go either to St Iritis or Chicago ana the dope on the cards was for St. Louis to land the democratic convention and Chi cago the G. O. P. gathering. The St. Louis convention committee is the best organized and has worked more systematically. St. Louis claimed twenty-four votes of llfty-three, to gether with fourteen second choices. The light before the committee will present one dramatic phase, Speaker Champ Clark and Senator Stone will present the claim of St. Louis to the convention. Roger Sul livan of Illinois will present the case for Chicago. Intensity is added to the fight because of the Baltimore convention when Roger Sullivan swung the Illinois delegation to Wil son and the Clark presidential boom went Hat. Ton Pence, assistant to national Chairman McCombs, will be elected secretary of the committee. It was reported Rolla Wells of St. Louis would resign as treasurer. This re port Mr. Wells most vigorously de nied tonight. The two dates dis cussed for the convention are June l.i ;nd Juno 20. The earlier prob ably will be picked. Democrats and thousands of voters of all parties, are for Wilson regard less of his program, erause they be lieve he is their one best bet. Many ire frank enough to admit that Wil son is stronger than the party pen . ; a'ly.
