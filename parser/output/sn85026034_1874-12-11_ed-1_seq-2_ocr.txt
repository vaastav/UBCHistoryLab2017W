EDITORIAL NOTES. Down iu Yicksburthe "citizens' hold mass meeting whenever they want to get rid of obnoxious officers, and de mand their resUrnation. We can't see uiiT use for courf.s when mass meeting are adjudged such extraordinary jiowers. "One citizen ami seventy or lifteen negroes kiiled," is the way the Associate Press reporter puts it in Ids report of the casualties in the late 'scrimmage" at Vicksbar. We really thought ne groe were citizens down there. Perhaps we were mistaken. Jlr. Worihingtou has introduced a bill i:ithe Ohio Senate providing that only those children of disabled soldiers Iwirii before the close of the war shall be ad mitted into the Soldiers" Orphans' Home. This will turn out of the Home all chil dren under ten years of age now there. Tor the sake of humanity and the good name of the Sfnte, we hope that the bill mav not ix-cmie a law. The vote in investigate the conduct of Jenner, !.te Suieriiitendeiit of the SoldierV Orphans Home, was reconsid ered in the Ohio legislature, bust Moll day. and after amending co as to provide for a Joint Committee of each IIou-. was lost upon its passage. Thus have the Democrats emphasized their deter munition to S'-reeu the delxiueher of soldiers" orphans from justie. They are f.t it again in Yicjisbuig. About seven lmiidred negroes man-bed upon tlie city at the behest of the negro Sheriff of the county, and were met by the citizens, whereupon a light ensued in which one white mail and seventy ne groes were killed, and several wounded. One finds it dilllcult to believe the ne groes entirely to blame when seventy ne groes bite the dust for every white man k'lled.

Wi'.hout indulging in theories as to the can- of this prostration, therefore, 1 will cali jour attention only to the fart ai.d to joine questions as to which it would m--!u there should be no disagree ment. l;irflig this prostration two es sential elements of prosperity have !en mo-t abundant labor and capital. Itoth have leen largely unemployed. Where security haslieeu undoubted cap ital has lx-en attainable at very nnxler ate rates. Where labor has been wanted it has been found in abundance at cheap rate compared with what necessaries aud comforts of life cou.d lie purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements ot prosperity, therefore, have not leen d"nied us. A third might be added. ;ir soil and climate are un equalleil wivhiii the limits of any con tiguou.-. territory under one nationality. for iis varieties of products to feed and clothe a people and the amount of bur Ius to sj,;i re to feed fess favored teonIe. Therefore, with these facts in v;ew. it stems to me that wise statesmanship at this session of Congress would indicate ignoring the past, directing in proper cniuiii' is mese. great elements ot pros perity. To any people debt abroad is the only element that can, with always a soiiihi currency, enter into our affairs to caus" any continued depression iu the industries a'K! prosiierity of our people. A great conflict fi r national existence made necessary for temporary purposes. the raising of ia-ge sums of money from whatever source attainable. It made necessary, iu the wisdom of Congress, aud 1 do ;.ot doubt their wisdom in the premises retarding the necessity of the tunes, to ievr:e a system of national currency, which it proved to be impossi ble to keep on a par with recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot it spirit of speculation involving an extravagance aud luxury not required for the heiipiiiess and prosperity of a people, and involving, both directiyand indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The curreiicv Ivmg ot fluctuating value. therefore, unsafe To hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculiition iu itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in foreign indebtedness, contracted ia good faith by borrower and lender, wlncli should te paid in com and ac cording to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted, gold or its equivalent. Tlie good faith of the gov ernment cannot le violated towards creditors without national disgrace. Our commerce should be encouraged. American ship building and carrying ca pacity increased, foreign markets sought for the products of the soil and manu factures to the end that we may be able to pay these debts where a market can be created for the sale of our products. either of the soil, the mine or the manu factory. 

CURRENCY—SPECIE RESUMPTION. A new means is discovered of utiliilna our idle c.ipital and labor to the advan tage of the whole people, but in my judgment the tirst step toward accom plishing tins object js to secure a cur rency good wherever civilization reigns. one. which if it becomes superabundant wit li one pe iple, will hud a market with some otlier a curreucy which has as its basis the la!or necessary to produce it, which will give it vahi". Gold and silver are iu'.v the recognized mediums of exchange the civilized world over. and to this we should return with the east iiracticable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal tender svstem was adopted and the debt contracted, there should le no delay, certainly no unnec essary delay in lixuii; lv legislation a method I", which we will return to pecie. To i he accomplishment of this eud I invi-e your special attention. I believe lirmly that there can be no per manent ami prosperous revival of busi- nesss and industries until a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative basis may think it of value to them to make the so-called money abundant until they cau throw a portion of their burdens upon others, but even these, 1 beiieve, would be disappointed in tlie result it a course should be pur sued which will keep in doubt the value f the legal tender medium of exchange, revival of the productive industries is needed by all classes, by none more than the holders of property o whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sales. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be bene fitted by expansion, would it lie honest give it. Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not lie just as honest and pru dent to mil ':orize each debtor to issue his own legal tender to the extent of his liabilities than to do this? Would it not safer for fear of over issues bv un scrupulous creditors to say that all debts and obligations are obliterated in the United Slides and now we commerce anew, free from encumberance? These propositions are too absurd to be enter tained for a moment by thinking people. Every delay in the preparation of final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, aud is oniy lessiu degree as the prop is out that a convenient season will last arrive for the good work of re deeming our pledges to commence. It will never ome, iu my opinion, except jioMtive sietiou of Congress, or by na tional disasters which will destroy, for a time ot least, the credit of individuals and the state at large. A sound curren cy must be reached by total bankruptcy the credit, of the integrity of the na tion and of iudiv:uuals. 1 beiieve it is in power of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew con fidence, revive all the industries, start us a career of prosperity to last for many years, and to save the credit of the na tion and of the people. Steps toward return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought end; there are others which I may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing a currency below that of specie in val ue Labors under two great disadvantages : First, having no use for the world's ac knowledged medium of exchange gold silver these are driveii out of the country because there is no demand for their use. Second, the Medium of ex change beingof a fluctuating value for, after all.it is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver metals, hav ing au intrinsic value just in proportion the honest labor it takes to produce them. A large margin must be allowed prolit by the manufacturer and pro ducer. It is months from the date of pro duction to the date of realizaiion. in terest upon capital must be charged and of fluctuation iu the value of that which is to Im received in pavmeut add ed, hence higher prices, acting as a pro tection to the forei-u producer, who re ceives nothing iu exceauge for the prod uct of his skid and labor, except a cur rency g, Kd at a staple value the world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer than Uiat the greater part of the bordea of the existing prostration for want of a sound tiuancial svstem falls upon the working man, who niust, after produce the wealth.aud the salaried maa who superintends and conducts business. T., burden falls upon them two way.: By the deprivation of eui Pwyiueut.ai, 1 by the decreased purclias n.g power ,.l their salaries. It isihe duty Congress to devise the method of eor-rectMigtie- eMls which are acknowledged exist, nn,i not mine,but I will venture suggest two or three things which seem io use absolutely uecessarv to a return to specie JKtymeuts, the flrs't great requisite in a return to prosperity legal tender clause to the law au thorizing the issue of currency by the as I the by and sed, ly was of with its the laws ted, these than find the for the - j national government should be repefiej. to take effect a.- to all contracts entered into after a day lixel i:i the repealing a'-t, not to apply, however, to payments of salaries by the government, or for other expenses no'v provided by law to l;e paid in currency. lit the interval ending between repeal and filial reuiup tion, provision should be made by which tlie secretary of the trea-ury can obtain gold as it may Ironie necessary froia time to time, from th- date when specie resumption ewiim'-n'.s. To this might and should be added a K venue sjUi-j-iently in excels of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold in the treasury to sustain redemption. i comiueud this subject to your careful consideration. be lieving that a favorable solution is at tainable, and that if reached by this Congress, that the present and future generations will ever gratefully remem ber it as their deliverer from thraldom of evil and disgrace. 

BANKING. Witli the resumption of sijecie pay meiit free banking may Ix authorized with safety, giving the full protect io:i to b: 1 1 holders which they have under ex isting laws; indeed. 1 would regard free banking unessential. It would give prop er elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for the trans action of legitimate business. new banks would lie started, and, ia turn, bauks would wind up their business when it was found there was a superabundance of currency. The experience and judgment of the people can best oecide just how much currency is required lor tue trans act ion of the business of the country. It Ls uus-ife to leave the settlement of this question to Congress, the secretary of the treasurv, orthe executive, t.-ou gress should make the regulation under which banks may exist, but should not make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper cur rency that shall be authorized. Such im ortance do I attach to this cubject,and so earnestly do 1 commend it toyourat teution, that 1 give it prominence bv in troducing it at the beginning ot this messiu-e. INTERNAL REVENUE AND TARIFF. The Secretary of the Treasury, iu his report, favors legislation looking to spe cie payments, thus supporting the views previously expressed in this message. He also recommends economy m appro priations; calls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing tne tax on tea and coffee, without benefit to the con sumer, recommends an increase of ten cents a gallon on whiskey : and further. that no modification be made iu the banking and currency bill past at tin: last session of Congress, unless a iikxIi fication should become necessary by rea son of the adoption of measures for re turning tc specie payments. Iu these recommendations I cordially join. I would suggest to Congress the propriety of readjusting the tariff so as to increase the revenue, and at the same time de crease the number of articles upon which dues are levied. These articles, which enter into manufactures and are not pro duced at home, it seems to me, should be entered free. Those articles of man ufacture which we produce a constitu ent part of, but do not produce the the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter free also. I will instance tine wool dyts, &c. These ar ticles niust be imported to form part of the manufacture of tiie higher grades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medicines and used in various ways iu manufactures, come under this class. The introduction free of dues of such wools as we do not pro duce snould stimulate the manufacture of goods requriug the use of those we do produce aud therefore would be a ben efit to home productions. lhere are many articles entering iuto home man ufactures which we do not produce our selves, the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing the manufactured article. All the corrections in this re gard are iu the direction of bringing la bor and capital into harmony with each other and of supplying one of the ele ments of prosperity so much needed, AFFAIRS IN SOURHERN STATES. Your attention will be drawn to tiie unsettled condition of affairs in the Southern States. On the 14th of Sep tember last, the governor of I-ouiiana called upon me, as provided by the con stitution and laws of the United States, to aid in suppressing domestic violence in that State, i his call was made in view of a proclamation issued oirthat day bv D. B. Penu, stating that he was elected Lieutenant Kovernor in 1S72, and calling upon the militia of the state to arm, assemble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated the officers of the State Government. On the next day I issued mv proclamation. commanding the insurgents to disperse within hve days from the date thereof. and subsequently learned they had taken forcible possession of the State House. Troops were taken by nie to support the existing State government, but before the expiration of five day the insurrectionary movement was prac tically abandoned, and the officers of the State government, with some minor exceptions, resumed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State administration of Louisiana had been the only government in that State for nearly two years, that it has been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in such by Congress, and more than once expressly recognized by me, I re garded it as my clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent its overthrow by an armed mob, under pretense of fraud and irregularity, in the election of 1872. I have heretofore called the attention of Congress to this subject, stating that, on account of the frauds aud forgeries committed at said election, and lecause it appears that the returns thereof were never legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen, but, from the best sources of information at my com mand, have always believed the present State officers received a majority of the legal votes actually cast at that election, repent what I said in my special mes sage of February 13, 1S73, that, in the event of no action by Congress, I must continue to recognize the government heretofore recognized by me. the at ed cle. ear of in be ow 

INTIMIDATION IN THE SOUTH. I regret to sav tliat, witii the prepara tions for the late election, decided indi cation appeared, in some catities in Southern States, of a determination. acts of violence and intimidation, to deprive citizens of tha freedom of the ballot, because of their ponttcal opin ions. Bands of men, masked and armed, made their appearance. W lute Leagues, other societies, were formed. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were imported and distributed to these or ganizations, military drills, which mena cing demonstrations, were Held, and with all these, murders euocgh were committed to spreadterror among those whose political action was to be supres- if possible, by these intolerant and criminal proceedings. Ia some places coiored laborers were compelled to vote according to the wishes of their employ ers, under threats of discharge, if they done otherwise, and there are too many instances ia which, when these threats were disregarded, they were remoseless- executed by those by whom they were made. I understand that the Fif teenth Amendment to the Constitution made to preveut this and like state things, and the act otMay 31, 170, amendments, was passed to enforce provisions., the object of this being to guarantee, to all citizens, tlie right to and to protect them iu the free enjoyment of that rifjilt, enjoined by constitution, to take care that tiie be faithfullv executed, and con vinced, by undoubted evidence, that violations of said act had been commit and that a widespread and flagrant disregard of it was contemplated, the proper officers were instructed to pros ecute the offenders, and troops wore stationed at convenient point io aid officers, if necessary, in the per formances of their of Scial duties. Com plaint is made of their interference by federal authorities, but if said amend ment aud act do not provide for such interference under the circumstances.as above stated, then they are without meaning.force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is than mockery, aud little better a crime.

The principal hotel of the place caught fire, during a winter's night, and the liames had ma i -o.-h progress that a considerable ponton of the structure, in chiding the stairway, was in flames be fore i he alarm re.-.-'ie 1 the occupants of the seem 1 story. Retreat by the stair way being cut. o;f. the only means left was by a lad li-r, and liie occupants, be fore having, threw out their extra clothing, bedding, trunks etc., and re- treafed iu their night anparel. In one of tiie rtjotus thus oeir-i:ii"d, was Mr. K and his fami' v, who. the night previous, had depo.-ite 1 a paeh.ige of currency of eleven hundred dollars, and his gold watch, u:t I rneath his pillow. When the alarm of lire reached them the flames were t' o near to allow any cere mony, so li-; picked up the bedding, money and watch, and pitched all out of the window. When he reached a place ( safety, he nt once began to search for his money and watch. The latter was foun I, all tramped over, but the H-arch revealed no package of mon ey, ui'hnugh a considerable time was spent, and a very close investigation made, but in vain. So money could be found, and its whereabouts was the main question. Tiie citizens rallied and worked with a will, and soon had the fire subdued. Various were the conjec tures as to what had become of the money, and almost every one had his opinion, and suspicions rested on vari ous persons. A very highly valued friend of the writer, who half believed in hob gobblins, table-tippers, etc., then sug gested the propriety of consulting one "Madam Duboyee," a noted clairvoyant, residing near there, wiiose fame for dis closing the whereabouts of lost, strayed or stolen prop-rty extended all overthat section of country, and hundreds were said to have cous.ihe l her under like circumstances. The suggestjn was deemed timely, for two reasons: It.s truth or falsity, and the recovering of the money. Two or three as discreet persons as could bo selected were at oiiee dispatched with this fiii'iid to the residence of the clair voyant, who, on being mesmerized, told that she saw it deposited in a pile of ashes, iu the rear part of a hatter's shop, and if they got bask right speedilv it woui.i be found there. The party put their steeds on the home stretch," at two-forty, arrived there, and, oa search ing the said sho;, the ash heap was found, but no money, nor any evidences that any had been there. The clairvoy ant had cautioned the enquirers that the thief was uneasy, and, iu case it w:is not found, to come back at once for further disclosures, which was done tw:.ce and thrice, with a like result. Nei ther the thief, money, or any clue to it, was ever hud. At another time, while residing in one of the interior towns, liordering on th Maumea Valley, hi Olxio.the community was startled by large, flaming posters. heralding to man and woman, old and young, the arrival of a distinguished person, who had the ki!c and power or revelation and foretelling future events; also, would reveal the whereabouts of lost or stolen property of any kind. She wa-s,a;so,the happy possessor of an Afri can rock diamond.of immense value. I5y placing this wonderful diamond into the hand of any person, she could see the person's great future all for the. small sum of one dollar. Now, it so happened that a very honest old Pennsylvania farmer, who had discovered, as he thought, his corn, iu his crib, wasting away foster than it ought, aud, suspect ing one of his neighbors, with whom lie was at the "outs," as being the thief, came to consult the writer relative to his belief of her ability tr do what she had advertised, adding, at the sam time, fact that down in Pennsvlvania, where he came from, there were persons who could tell such things.

FOSTORIA. AN EVENING AMONG THE BUSINESS MEN. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FOSTER AND SNYDER BRO'S On Wednesday afternoon, of this week, tiie senior editor came into the ohlce. aud slipping over to the desk where we were scratching away for "dear life trying to supply the wants of the raven ous compositors, lie laid his hand gently on our shoulder aud told us in rather peremptory tones to "go to Fostoria find write up the town." WTe don't often stand on ceremony when our chief gives us orders, and 0:1 this occasion we got ready to go with more than usual alacrity. Hastily draw ing on our cap and overcoat we started, a short ride by rail, which was made short by the presence of pleasant com pany, we were soon at our destination Alighting from the train we entered the low and rather dingy depot and made a trial to collect our thoughts and de termine upon a plan for commencing our work, but, like reporters iu general, we concluded to make a trip around town and take the chances of something turn ing up. Leaving the dejH.-t we passed up the main thoroughfare of the town, glancing to the right aud the left, vainly looking for some familiar object. The street through which we passed is rather a pretty one, with a row of handsome business blocks. It is lighted with lamps, like those in our own town, but which are kept in better order and give a much more brilliant light. We had not gone far, however, until in front of one of the hotels of the town we met our old friend Delos D. Snyder, the junior member of the mercantile firm of FOSTER AXD SXYDER JJUn'S. After some mutual inquiries and con gratulations, we informed him the reus on of our visit, and asked his assistance. He kindly offered to "show us 'round." Taking Mr. Snyder's arm, we walked farther up the street. We had not gone but a few paces until a large two-story brick building of fine proportions that loomed up in the darkness, attracted our attention. Upon enquiring the use of the block, we were informed that it was the place where the firm with which Mr. Snvder is connected did business. We at once expressed a desire to see the in terior.' Our friend very kindly volun teered to accompany us and show us through the different departments. The store of Foster aud Snyder 15ro"s. stands on the corner of two streets facing the north. The building presents a very imposing appearange, and its location is perhaps the most convenient ior the transaction of business of any iu the place. Entering the t-tore we were taken completely by surprise at its vastne.-s. The main room is eighty-eight feet in length, and has a preportional width. Ia this room, ranged on shelves along the side of the room, and on tables through the center are immense piles of goods. The stock in this apartment con sists of Ladies' Dress Goods, Shawls, Cloaks, Clothes and Cassimeres. There is also a fine stock of Linen Goods for house furnishing purposes. This firm has a splendid stock of this class of goods, which they sell at prices that will suit everyone. We also noticed an im mense quantity of ladies, and childrens' furs of every quality, which look invit ingly nice and warm. In addition to the goods named, this room contains a line assortment of fancy goods, and als great piles of Muslins, Calicos, and otlier dome-tie goods. The goods are all con veniently arranged so that customers cau examine them with ease. Adjoining the room mentioned is another of the same dimenssion. In this is dis played an immense stock of Mens' and Hoys' Ready Made Clothing, Hats, Caps, Hoots and Shoes. The firm make a specialty of this class of goods, and in consequence, Jkeep large quanti ties on hand all the time, so as to supply their already great and increasing trade. From this room Me were taken up a broad flight of stairs into what is called the "carpet room." Here a sight met our eyes, and we started with amazement. Ranged along the room, so as to be seen to ths best aJvantage, are great rolls of carpets of every conceivable color and pattern. The firm has on hand the big gest stock ot" carpets ever bronght to this part of the state. They cau furnish any thing from a common Ingrain, to the fi nest Tapestry Hrussells. In this room, is also a large number of ladies and gen tleiueu's Trunks, Valises etc. We should have said that they also have a fine lot of ladies satchels, so pop ular now among the fair sex, for use iu travelling or shopping excursions. We spent some time in looking through this mammoth store, aud made some in quiries as to the amount of business done. Beside the two partners, Messrs. W. E. and D. 1). Snyder, both of whom give their personal attention to tiie business, there are employed six sales men. These are kept busy all the time waiting on the many customers that buy at this establishment. We can give but a small idea of the magnitude of the place in our present article. We went through the big rooms, and at every turn something new met our gaze, uud we can only say that the amount of stock which thev have on hand is enor mous, lint we have already exausted our space, and must defer a further ac count of our visit until another week.
