CONGRESS IS HARD AT WORK Senate Recommends a Ship Subsidy Bill-Hazing at Academy Considered. WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.?Tlio senate i committee on commerce reported favor- j ably the bill recommended by the ruer- | chant marine commission for the pro motion of American commerce, fnmii- ! iurly known as the "ship subsidy bill." -Mr. Aldrlch reported from tiie com mittee on finance a substitute for the Teller Panama canal bond bill. The i substitute has the effect of giving the 2 per cent canal bonds the same priv- ; i leges, and rights accorded to other 2 ; per cent bonds uud asked for its imme diate consideration. Mr. Pcttus ob jected, Gut later withdrew his objection, ? and the Villi passed without debate. Mr. Elkius made a verbal report 1 from the committee on interstate com merce concerning the progress of the committee's investigation of the rail-! road rate question. "We cannot report j now," he said, "but I am justified in j saying that it is the belief ot the mem- | hers that later the committee will be j able to present a measure." He added that the committee had been in session from April to June and again since Nov. 21 last and was giving all the time possible to the question. The president sent to the senate the nomination of Stephen P. Stone to lie United States marshal for the western district of Pennsylvania. A resolution providing for a thorough investigation of the situation and con ditions at tiie Naval academy was in troduced by Representative Loud of Michigan. The investigation is to be made by the house nayal committee, which is especially instructed to "ascer tain and report whether violations of the law and the regulations governing tiie academy continue and whether busing, fagging, running and class list fighting continue in practice there and tiie knowledge of and responsibility of the officers of the academy for any con ditions found to exist." The resolution empowers the commit tee to act through a subcommittee if deemed advisable, which may sit at the cnpitol or at the Naval academy. The senate spent four hours in dis- | cussing tiie Panama canal emergency | appropriation bill, and when it ad journed the bill was still under consid- j eration. Mr. Teller made a plea for a wider i and deeper canal than that decided up- j' on by tin! canal commission. He also j, indicated a preference for a sea level canal, ndniitUug;Utut its cost would not lie less than $500,<*>0,000, but contend ing that such a canal would better meet the demands of the world. Mr. Scott expressed tiie opinion that a mistake had been made in selecting the Panama route and made a speech ] advocating the San Bias route. "We < are now confronted with just such a i situation as I have always held would be encountered in connection with the - Panama route. We have expended millions of dollars and are no nearer to the completion of the enterprise than ; when the United States took control - of it." I '?? t Derrick Fell Into Miami River.

DETERMINED TO END HAZING Secretary Bonaparte Will Wage ! War on Lawless Middies Admiral Sands Summoned. ( ! WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.?Hazing of | every kind, It is announced, will be | stumped out of the Naval academy, re | Hard less of the number of dismissals I rom (lie brigade of midshipmen necas ! sary to bring about this result. Two i midshipmen will be dismissed from the j academy within a few days by the sec | retary of the navy, tin. one for linking , and the other for countenancing it by 1 failure while on duty to report its oc ,; currenee. Other dismissals will follow i I as often as midshipmen are found I ; j guilty of linking or countenancing it. ( Aroused by the condition of affairs i which reports show to exist at the | ! academy so far as the treatment of: ; fourth class men are concerned, Secre , tury Bonaparte telephoned to Itear Ad ; j miral H. Sands, superintendent of Uie| academy, u request to come to Wash , ington for a conference, and the adml-! ral arrived here on an early train this | morning from Annapolis, it will lie the initial step in a new and vigorous cam paign to he waged at Annapolis against | hazing. Admiral Sands will have the , unqualified support of the navy depart ment In his efforts t? abolish the evil, and Secretary Bonaparte announced that tin' admiral possessed the full con fidence of the officials here in his abil ity to handle the situation to the entire , satisfaction ol' the department. Con i gressional investigation of the condl ! tlons at the academy lias already been j proposed in a resolution introduced In . | the house by Representative Loud of j i Michigan. | Briefly these are the developments In .; the movement against liazlng at the I Naval academy: When Secretary Bona j parte reached the navy department he received an official report from Adml j rnl Sands announcing the suspension of "j Midshipman Trenmor Collin, Jr., for J hazing Midshipman Jerdono Pettus || Kimbrough by forcing him to stand on ? | ids head until he became unconscious 'j and or Midshipman Warren Abbe Van , Perveer, second class man, because ? | while on duty lie observed the occur ; rence and failed to report It. The su 1 perlnteudent called attention to the fact that Midshipmen Coffin and Van Derveer were guilty of violating a well 1 known regulation for the government of the Naval academy and reeonimend | oil their summary dismissal In accord-1 ' ance with the net of congress. It Is the declared purpose to get at! the root of the hazing evil and to extlr-1 pate the practice in a manner never be-i fore attempted. It was learned from official sources that the hazing of Kim ! broilgh was even more brutal than was ' first supposed, more dangerous in ils 1 natural results and more blameworthy ? | In Its origin.
