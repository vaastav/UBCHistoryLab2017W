NAYY. da the the by res be en j of the facts with reference to them demon ■ strated that an entirely new departure I necessary in undertaking further similar con struction. The one characteristic which an un ' armored cruiser must possess is great speed. This is determined by the function which she is expected to perform in modern warfare. She Is a "commerce destroyer." She must be able to escape from ironclads and outrun, so f hantmen. If slower than ironclads she could ot keep the sea, and if slower than merchant men she might as well stay in port. This di vision of s&ps by the functions which they are expected to perform is one of the things which has come about of recent years. When it be came impossible to concentrate In one ship both the greatest speed, strongest armament, and the highest defensive power, without reaching a tonnage displacement wholly out of the question, the division into classes, ac cording to the functions which they were ex pected to perform, came about. Unarmed cruisers have become a distinct class, and the characteristic absolutely indispensable to this class is very great speed. When the Dolphin, Boston, Atlanta and Chi cago were projected, and the contracts for their construction entered into, it was well known what speed ought to, he attained and what weight and character of machinery per ton of displacement was necessary to obtain it. Com mercial vessels had at that time attained speeds ranging between sixteen and nineteen knots, and cruisers were being built in other countries or had already been built, attaining the same speed. The Dolphin and tho Atlanta having both been completed, and having had trial trips, it is possible to compare them in their results with similar vessels built contemporaneously elsewhere. The Dolphin, of 1,500 tons displace ment, can be compared with the Alacrity and Surprise, English dispatch vessels of 1,400 tons each, and the Milan, a French dispatch vessel of 1,550 tong, all built contemporaneously. The Dolphin was designed for 2,300 indicated horse power, the Alacrity and Surprise each 3,000 and the Milan 3,900. The highest mean horse-power developed upon trial was. in the case of the Dolphin, less than 2,200, of the Alacrity, 8,173; of the Surprise, 3,079; of the Milan, 4,132. The highest speed of the Dolphin, resulting from several trials, was 15.11 knots, running light; of the Alacrity, 17.95 knots; of the Surprise, 17.8 knots; of the Milan, 18.4 knots. The Atlanta, the sister ship to the Boston, can be compared with the Esmeralda, the Giovanni Bausan and the Mersey. All three were built in England; the Esmeralda for Chili, the Giovanni Bausan for Italy and the Mersey for the English Government. The At lanta is of 3,000 tons displacement; the Esmer alda, 2,920; the Giovanni Bausan, 8,0GS, and the Mersey, 3,550. The Atlanta was designed to attain an indicated horse-power of 3,500, the Esmeralda and the Giovanni Bausan each 5, 500, and the Mersey 6,000. The trials had of the Atlanta indicate that her engines will develop less than 3,500 horse-power, while tho Esmer alda developed 6,000, the Giovanni Bausan 6, 080, and the Mersey 6,626. The maximum speed of the Atlanta will be less than 15 knots, while that of the Esmeralda was 18.28 knots, the Gtovanni Bausan 17.5 knots; the Mersey 17.5 knots. Important Features of Secretary Whitney's Report The Department's Experience in Building Cruisers—How Money Has Been Used—Resume of the Past Year's Operations. Washington, Dec. 4.—The annuel report ot the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1886 was made public to-day, and from It the following extracts, bearing on subjects of general inter est, are made. Tbe report has the following on tho subject of the ADDITIONAL NEW CRUISERS: The experience of the department in its first attempt at the creation of modern vessels of war has been such as to excite the greatest concern and disappointment. Ah examination WM in on D is of of to overhaul, mer These facts are stated without any intention of locating responsibility or blame upon any person. It is impossible to ascertain where it should be placed. But they indicate a simple abandonment on the part of the department of any attempt to reach the conditions which should have been attained and the failure on the part of the contractor to reach the limited results expected by the department. In con sidering the matter of constructing the additional vessels authorized bj Congress in March, 1885, it was decided by the department to exhaust every effort to avail itself of the most advanced thought and own and other knowledge attained by countries upon the subject. The machinery of naval vessels is entirely different in character from that of merchant ships; and as war vessels have been for many years built in this country by our Government, up to the time of those just referred to, it seems probable, on comparing results attained by the department in its first effort with thpse reached in other countries, that important advances had been made elsewhere in the methods ' of attaining great speed and power which it had become necessary for us to utilize. For twenty years the principal market tor modern war vessels has been England. Russia, Germany, Italy, Chill, Brazil, Japan have all procured in the English market war vessels reckoned among tho best in their respective fleets. Great ef forts have been made in most of these coun tries to develop ship construction at home, but not without first availing of-the latest products attainable elsew here as a basis Upon which to build their own subsequent improvements and developments. modern 33 is bo F. TnE NEW ABMOR-CT.ADS. Congress, at its recent session, authorized the construction of two iron-clads of about 6, 000 tons each, The subject has been referred to the bureaus of construction, steam engineer ing, equipment and recruiting and ordnance to take the necessary steps to prepare plans for the letting. The department has also deemed it wise to offer to all approvod naval arohitects and ship builders an opportunity to compete with the work of the department in the design for these new ships, and the sum of 115,000 has been offered as compensation for any accepted design for either of the vessels, the working drawings to be the subject of subsequent agree ment. There are muny distinguished architects who, of late years, have had much greater ex perience in new work than the liberality of our government has made it possible for our own to enjoy, and jn starting upon tho creation of a new navy the department has no embar rassment in desiring to avail of the best talent anywhere to be found in placing tho new work upon a par with the best of other countries, from which point it is entirely safe to predict that the ingenuity and talent of our own countrymen will suffice to keep us in the front rank for future work. No tinjo will thus be lost, even if 40 designs are submitted or accepted, for the process of preparing necoessary plans is going on simul taneously la tho department by THE ARMOR AMD GUNS FOR THE MONITORS A HD THE AhlMOR-CLADS. Congress jilso authorized the President, in his discretion,' - to dlrodt the completion of the doublc-turreted monitors, and mado provision with reference to the armor as follows: That the armor used In constructing said armored vessels ond for completing said mon itors shall be of tho host obtainable quality, and of domestic manufacture, provided tracts for furnishing the same in a reasonable time, at a reasonable price, and of tho required quality can be made with responsible parttos. Such armor shall bo ucoopted only after pass ing such tests as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy and inserted in tho tracts. to con t OD In construing the statute for tho purpose of ascertaining what, within tho view of Congress, should be construed a "reasonable time," it wos doomed to necessarily Imply such a time as would be required to perfeot In this country an additional plant adequate to the creation of the product doslrod. Inasmuch us modern armor, either of steel or compound, able to Btnnd tho tests which would bo prescribed, has not, up to tbo presont time, been mado in the Unitod States, and for a fair competition in its manu facture a "reasonable time" would be the time m no am or » manntaonirar to pro ride himself with the necessary plant to produce the article required. A shorter time would necessarily preolude the possibility of obtain ing the same In the United States. No steel manufacturer in the United States, with his present plant, would enter Into a contract to de liver armor guaranteed to stand the tests, based upon the tests of armor In use abroad, which the bureau of ordnance would prescribe.

In the ship-building policy of other naval powers and the designs of war vessels recently laid down great value has been given to the im portance of high speed and to the gradual de velopment of the type known as the protected cruiser. In some cases the maximum speed guaranteed is as great as twenty knots, while a speed of nearly nineteen knots has been at tained by several vessels already in service. Aside from the development in the type ot cruisers already noted, a most prominent feat ure noticeable in the conduct of naval affairs is the great attention paid to the study of naval warfare by means of the squadron of evolu tions. In this practical sohool, tactics, gun nery, tho use of torpedoes and torpedo-boats are taught, and the officers thus gain an expe rience in handling vessels of high speed and the use of modern weapons and appliances of war, in which so great and rapid changes constantly being made, under circumstances which so closely resemble those of actual war fare. As a result of the maneuvers of the French and English squadrons of evolution, it has been demonstrated that the type of torpedo boat (100 to 110 feet in length) hitherto accepted as capable of efficient service upon the open sea is too small for such work, and that its role in war must be restricted to operations along the coast or harbors. An increase of size has sequently been demanded, and torpedo-boats intended for a service extending beyond the limits of the coast line are built of lengths varying from 130 to 150 feet and in displacement from 90 to 150 tons. (A still larger boat has been built for the Japanese Government; length, 166 feet.) The department in July last appointed a board to examine and report upon the adapta bility df the Stiletto, a boat built by Horreshbff Brothers, of Bristol, R. I., for service as a tor pedo-boat. Tho hoard reported that the Stil etto embodied the qualities which a modern toryedo-boat should possess, although they suggested certain improvements for future bovts. The steam trials of the Stiletto were exceed ingly satisfactory, and when the smali type (but 90 feet in length) of the boat is consid ered they compare most favorably with those of boats built abroad. On July 2, with twelve men on board and about a ton of coal—displacement about 28 tons — this boat made four runs over the measured mile in a rough sea and fresh wind. The average speed was 22.12 knots. On July 3(1 six runs were made with twelve men on board and the same amount of coal. The average speed was 22.89 knots. The same day the boat made a run of 59 knots at an average speed of 19.62 knots. On the 7th a run to Block Island and back was made in a rough sea, and an av erage speed of 16.2 knots for the run was ob tained. Experiments have been recently made which indicate that for vessels at anchor way at low speed, and in smooth water, protec tion against torpedoes may be found in the use of the torpedo-net, now being generally adopt ed for armored vessels. The development of the torpedo is, however, receiving constant at tention and expenditure of money for its im provement, and it must be reckoned as one of the most formidable weapons, offensive and de fensive, of naval warfare. under Ro.ua and the Fenian Brotherhood. New York, Dec. 3.—O'Donovan Itossa has prepared an elaborate article which will appear in his paper to-morrow, in which he gives tho why and wherefore of his leaving the Fenian Brotherhood. In this explanation he says ho ros igned be cause the Brotherhood objected to his ap pointing Rocky Mountain O'Brien and John Murphy co-trustees with him as the treasurer of tho "resources of civiliza tion." Rossa thereupon wrote out his resignation as head center, and handed it to John Murphy, but immediately re ceived it back again. On November 33 the auditing committee of tho Brother, hood brought Rossa in as "indebted to the government in the sum of $3(16.62." Rossa says that ho had the money then to settle, "but as the celebration of the Manchester martyr day was that night, the settling up was put off till morning." This procrastination was what compelled the Brotherhood to demand his resigna tion. Rossa's principal bone of contention with the Brotherhood is the following sec tion of the constitution: The first duty of tho Fenian Brotherhood is to perpetuate its own existence and to coutinue as a permanent organization, un changed in name, until its object be fully attained, and that tho foregoing can never bo changed, nor can the Council of the F. B. ever allow an attack on Canada or any other territory on this side of the At lantic, unless England be at war with America." Doomed Cluverlus. Richmond, Va, Dec. 4. —There has been much talk about a statement to be made by Cluverius, but up this time he has kept his usual discreet silence, been condemned to be hung on the ]0Lh of this month, and the only power that can save him li executive clemency.
