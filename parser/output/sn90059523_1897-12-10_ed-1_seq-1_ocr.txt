SAINT PAUL GLOBE TALK OF RETRENCHMENT It Is Very Loud in and About the Capital, but Will Retrenchment Follow? Pensions, Hrmy, * Navy. NO PROBABILITY THAT TBEY WILL BE CUT Rivcp and Harbor Improvement and Pub lic Buildings Ape Also Things That "Must Be Had"— Money L>ost by Wastefulness —Postal Banks Will Add Heavily to the Government Burden. Special to the Globe. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.— The annual outburst in favor of economy in public expenditures is now heard In congress, and the appropriation committees of both houses this year will be more than usually impressed with the necessity for retrenchment. Butthe public might as well know first as last that little can reasonably be expected in this line. Concerning generalities, it is very easy to talk economy, but where can it be applied? Pensions take 38 per cent of the expenditures of the govern ment, and yet who is bold enough po litically to cut that appropriation down? The military and naval estab lishments take another large slice — 25 per cent, so far this fiscal year — but it will be very difficult to reduce these appropriations. The army is now little more than a police force, and the naval expense is still in its beginning if the United States continue their "new navy" policy. Interest charges amount to about 10 per cent of our national ex penses, and they are something that must be paid. River and harbor im provements, public buildings, private claims, civil and miscellaneous expend itures are all things which experience has proved "we must have;" and the last two congresses have doubtless been fully as economical as it is safe to expect the present or any succeeding congress to be. Not counting the sink ing fund appropriations, and consider ing as a postal charge only the postal deficit, the actual expenses of this gov ernment henceforth cannot well be un der $1,000,000 a day, counting Sundays and holidays. With an abundant rev enue and easy conditions, this sum would speedily be exceeded by from 10 to 20 per cent. NOT 

GROWING SMALLER. In estimates of the future expenses of the government, it is taken for grant ed that Uncle Sam will continue to do business in the rather wasteful and ex travagant way that now prevails. Moreover, the government is constant ly adding to the things which it under takes — this year a postal savings bank, an armor-plate plant and a national university are among the proposals, and when once established these enter prises go on forever. Many govern ment charges, besides, are paid for di rectly through fees of some kind, and so do not come out of the taxpayer in the ordinary way. The patent office^ for instance, is always more than self supporting. But taking $370,000,000 as our regular expenditures for 70,000,000 people, an average per capita of a little over $5 is the result. But it would be a very interesting calculation for some practical economist to determine what the average man In St. Paul pays to the federal government per $1,000 of his an nual expenditure. The $5 per capita no tion gives a very inadequate idea of the actual cost of the government to the individual taxpayer. Millions of people pay almost nothing, because they con sume so little upon which the govern- j ment levies either an internal or a cus toms tax. A traveler going through the mountain country of North Carolina would readily be convinced -that where the average native paid one dollar into the federal treasury, the ordinary St. Paul man would pay 20. And this in spite of the large share of the burden of I government expenditures borne by alco- j holies, tobacco and sugar. Another old question to which the commonest mind Avould have to give attention in deter mining the exact burden of federal ex penditures upon the individual is the much mooted one as to what it costs to get a dollar into the treasury. If the average voter could see before him. stripped of all the intricacies of indi rect taxation, an actual statement of his share in paying the expenses of the federal government, and beside it the larger items of municipal, county and state taxation, he would become more firmly convinced than ever that honest and economical government is highly to his advantage. PENSIONS EXCEED CUSTOMS. But to return to Uncle Sam's budget: Since July 1 pensions have cost about $68,000,000, and in the same time the customs revenue has amounted to $53, --000,000. Our entire custom house col lections then, all over the United States, are absorbed in paying pen sions thirty-two years after the close of the rebellion. And yet when Judge Lochren, a gallant Union soldier, tried to reduce this expenditure a little, an eminent New England" congressman, in a published letter, referring to the pension office, declared: "The Confed erates are in the saddle!" Commission er Evans has been more fortunate in his proposed measure of retrenchment. Congress will undoubtedly carry out his recommendation in regard to the rights of widows under the general law, in the case of marriages which take place after the passage of this act. Great abuses are reported under the present system. It frequently hap pens that an adventuress will marry an inmate of a soldiers' horne — some times when he is so intoxicated as not to realize what he is doing — and make no pretense of living with him. But on his death her certificate of marriage is good for a pension from the United States government as long as she lives and gives no public notice of marry ing anybody else. It is clearly the in tention of congress to correct this evil, but it will not very much diminish the pension expenditures. The same 

FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1897. The Three Form Over Sixty Per Cent of the Bulk of the Annual Expense of Govern ment. may be said in regard to the evident disposition of the pension committees of both houses to scrutinize in the fu ture much more carefully than in the past the private bills which come be fore them. In spite of these economies, pension expenditures are • expected to run $7,000,000 higher this year than last; and, if the pending claims could be promptly acted upon. It is not Im possible that a year's outlay might run up to $160,000,000. But without new general legislation this sum ls bound to diminish, and the tide will begin to turn before many years. No river and harbor bill was passed last year, but congress is obliged to appropriate about $20,000,000 on account of contracts which have been already authorized and made. About as much more will have to be appropriated this year on account of existing contracts, and perhaps $30,000,000 additional will be needed for work authorized, but not yet contracted for. Chairman Can non, of the house committee on appro priations, fears another river and har bor bill tnis year, but is evidently go ing to try his best to prevent its pas sage. Chairman Mercer, of the hcuse committee on public buildings, believes that little should be done in his line this year, but mentions a half-dozen places where the need is so urgent that an exception should be made in their favor. The difficulty will be in securing votes enough to pass a bill providing for this number of buildings A majority of the members of the house must see something in a public buildings bill to please them, and such has been the economy of congress in this particular for the past two years that more than six buildings will be necessary to appease the public ap petite. This will be a poor year for private claims-even for those which are wholly meritorious and should lons ago have been paid. BETTER RESULTS. Many people believe that better re suits could be secured from the old system by which the one committee on appropriations handled substantially ail the fourteen appropriation bills in- £ a ?£ f °~ ly six ' as now - Th ese are wnat Mr. Cannon's committee will this year be expected to report. The legis lative, the sundry civil, the fortifica tions, the deficiency, the District of Columbia, and the pension bills. But from the foundation of the govern ment down to 1885, this committee con trolled practically all the appropriation bills; and, as the house originates ap propriation bills, the committee's con trol over affairs there generally was very great. Samuel J. Randall made his reputation in leadership on the old committee on appropriations and it was because, in the Forty-eighth con fu es f' h e broke away from his party on the tariff question, that his old associ ates decided to relieve him of some of his power. Eight of the fourteen 'great annual appropriation bills were taken away from his committeee. The army and military academy bills were sent to the committee on military affairs the naval bill to the committee on naval affairs; the Indian bill to the committee on Indian affairs; the diplo matic and consular bill to the com mittee on foreign affairs, and the post omce bill to the committee on postoffices and post-roads. This change in the rules of the house was opposed not only by Mr. Randall himself, but by such Republican leaders as McKinle" of Ohio, Phelps, of New Jersey and Cannon, of Illinois. They all predicted that the change of rules, with the re sulting division of responsibility would result in an increase of appropriations In this prediction the experience of the last ten years has fully sustained ioo? 1 ' or the ten years from 1877 to im, the total regular appropriations of congress amounted to $2,019,743 000 ?<Tn d . fo I the followin S ten years, ISB7 to 18%, they have amounted to $3,427 S7B - 000. an excess in the latter period averaging $140,000,000 a year Of course it would be absurd to charge all this Increase to the changed system in the house. But it is prob able that this change has had some thing to do with it. Under the present system, each committee is impressed with the importance of the particular branch of the service for which it is responsible, and desirous that that branch shall not be crippled in its operations by want of funds. Each of the several committees recommends appropriations without consultation with the other committees, and with out being able to preserve the proper balance between appropriations and revenue. But, after all, it is with the n.-en who have charge of affairs, and not with the machinery, that the set tlement of this and every other con gressional problem rests. BIG 

STOKE RESERVOIRS. Plans for Constrnction Submitted to the Honse. WASHINGTON. D. C,. Dec. 9.— A re port on the survey of Big Stone and Traverse lakes, with a view to the construc tion of reservoirs, was today submitted to the house by the secretary of war. The survey was assigned to Lieut. Col. Jones, who sub mitted a plan to cost $950,000. The letter of transmittal states that the plans and esti mates must be considered preliminary, and that if congress decides to make privision for the work further detailed study of tho sec tion must be made. The plan" contemplates a dike at the north end of Lake Traverse to divert the river to discharge into the lake and to make controllable an opening in the diversion dam to cause the discharge of (he surplus through the old channel whon de sired. Secretary Alger also transmitted to the house a report on the claim of Wilhelm Boerlng for lands covered by * the Duluth canal, with a recommendation that it be sent to the court of claims for adjudication. Speaker Reed has appointed Congressman Heatwole chairman of a committee to con sider the claims of United States citizens against Brazil. He was also assigned as a member of the subcommittee on foreign af fairs to consider all Cuban matters, and appointed a member of the committee to obtain by international -agreement more gold and silver currency, and on the committee on the Omaha exposition. Senator Nelson Introduced the following bills: To pension James W. Smith, Company X, Eighth Vermont infantry, f24; increase pension of William L. Dow, Company G, Fifth lowa cavalry, to $50 per month; to pen sion Mary R. Bacon, widow of Columbus Ba con, $24; to pension Samuel D. Butler, Com pany F, Sixty-ninth Missouri, $12; to pay Charles T. Trowbridge, George D. Walker and Joe A. Trowbridge the salaries of the grades In which they serred in the war; to subject the national banks to penalties ' for usury; to pay heirs of Christian Reimers $5,000 for injuries in the New York barge office, resulting in his death. NO CHANGE AT CANTON. Sirs. McKinley Still Lingers at the Point of Death. CANTON, 0., Dec. 9.— The day has been almost devoid of incident in the room of Mrs. McKinley, who still lin gers at the point of death. Her rest during the day seemed a trifle less peaceful than heretofore, and at times she experienced trouble in breathing, the trouble being accompanied by ap parent distress in the throat, the di rect evidence of which was an ominous rattle. At neither of his calls today did the attending physician note a dis tinct change of condition, and each time he expressed hopes of survival for some hours to come. Just before dinner this evening he thought there were very good prospects of her living throughout the night. At this time President McKinley was not hopeful as the doctor. He thought his mother had failed very rapidly during the day that she Avas so weak that the end could not much longer be delayed and was prepared for the dissolution at any moment. He has been at the bedside nearly all day, and will remain there at least until midnight tonight. He took but a few hours rest this morning, and with his brother Abner took a short walk during the I day. The pa tient has taken no nourishment since Monday, and has not even taken a sip Russia Facing a Revolt of Hoslems. ST. 

PETERSBURG, Dec. 9.— Throughout Russian Asia there Is general unrest among the Moslems. It is attributed to the exaggerated re ports of the Turkish victory over the "great Greek empire," which have spread through the length and breadth of the continent. The authorities even fear that the revival of brigandage recently noticed ls directed almost solely against the government officials, and the unprece dented phenomenon of Georgians displaying hostility towards Armenians has become manifest. The danger ls so serious that a conference of Cau casian governors has been invoked to concert measures of pacification. Travelers In Central Asia report an extraordinary ferment among the Moslems of different races. They are sinking their mutual animosities and declaring that they are first of all Mohammedans, with the sultan as their common chief. It is evident that the slightest pretext would suffice to plunge Russia into the same state of troubles as India. of water for many hours. That she retains life so long without any nour ishment is the most surprising feature of the case. STEAMERS SAFE. P. & O. Liner nnd the Troop Ship Avoca Both In Port. CAPE TOWN, Dec. 9.— The British troop ship Avoca, with about 1,000 men on board from Jamaica for this port, has arrived here safely. A rumor pre vailed in Halifax yesterday that the Avoca had foundered, but the report was not credited in London. VALETTA, Island of Malta, Dec. 9.— The Peninsula & Oriental Steam Navi gation company's steamer Clyde, Capt. Gordon, which was overdue at this port, has arrived here from Marseilles. The Clyde encounteicd a terrific hur ricane In the Gulf pi Lyons, during which all her storm sails were blown to shreds and her commander was com pelled to heave her to for forty-eight hours. The Clyde had about 100 pas sengers on board. Carver's Complaint Heard. CARVER, Minn., Dec. 9;— Gen. George L. Becker and Secretary A. K.

Circular Sent Out by Mr. Hanna Asking Sup port for the Commission's Plan. INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Deo. 9.— Chairman H. Hanna, Of the monetary convention, has sent to bankers of the country 10,000 circular letters, as fol lows: The monetary commission, chosen by the executive committee ot the Indianapolis mone tary convention, will very soon conclude Its labors and offer a plan for financial organiza tion in accordance with the expressed will of the convention. The members of the com mission have, at great sacrifice to themselves and without compensation, other than their traveling and living expenses while engaged in the work, given a great deal of time and diligent, conscientious effort to the accom plishment of the great task imposed upon them. It is generally believed that the sug gestion for legislation that this commission will offer will prove to be broad, compre hensive and rational. The difficulty ot deal ing with existing conditions and the needs of widely separated geographical divisions pre sent many complex phases of the subject. After long suffering and immeasurably ex pensive delay, the opportunity seems to be at hand for financial reorganization. How ever, only patient, patriotic sacrifice of in dividual opinions as to the methods will make desirable legislation possible. It is not difficult for conservative thinking men to agree as to the principles involved, but tiiere Is a wide difference of opinion as to the de tail methods. The suggestions Bent to the commission are so varied that most of them cannot be used, therefore suppression of in dividual preference calls for patriotic pa tience.

Body of a Missing Duluth Fisher man Fonnd. Special to the Globe. DULUTH, Minn., Dec. 9.— The body of a man supposed to be Joseph Hardy, a fisher man, who lived on Oak Point, was found In the weeds near the Superior pump house on Minnesota point this afternoon. The dis covery was made by George Ward and Ernest Maynard, who were crossing the point, and had left the beaten path. The body was badly decomposed, and presented evidence that the man had been dead for some time. Hardy has been missing for three months, and the supposition that it is his body Is based on the fact that the clothing is identical with that worn by Hardy when last seen. How the man met his death is a mystery. The body is so wasted away that it would be almcrst impossible to find evidence of foul play even If It was thought that he had met a violent death. The police know nothing of the case, and are at a loss for a theory. An inquest will be held tomorrow. DAIRY3IEN WILL MEET. Great Gathering** Expected at the State Convention. Special to the Globe.

PR JC 11 *'*• WHEAT AT A DOLLAR NINE All Records of the Past Six Years Broken in the Chicago Pit. SHORT SIDE TRADERS PANIC-STRICKEN. TI(E BAI^E OP DECEMBER, A Net Gain for the Option During the Session of Almost Seven Cents. CHICAGO, Dec. 9.— Not since the memorable corner of 1888, when "Old Hutch" squeezed the Chicago wheat shorts in a way that they have never forgotten, have such scenes been en acted in the pit as were witnessed to day, when December wheat was bid up from $1.00*^4 to $1.09. The price paid was the highest touched for a wheat delivery since August, 1891. From the time the market opened until the close, though there were times of compara tive quiet and reactions in price, the shorts were on the anxious seat, and most of the time they were in a state of panic-stricken terror. There was apparently a general belief among traders that the December bulls in tend to control the dealing In that op tion. This opinion was strengthened by the announcement that arrangements had been completed whereby the con tract wheat will be shipped East, all rail, as soon as delivered here, thus keeping the market bare. This an nouncement had great weight with the shorts. The market closed at $1.07 for December, a net gain for the day of 6% cents, Wheat was very nervous at the start. Shorts were evidently alarmed by the announcement that the bull clique had made arrangements to ship by rail all the wheat delivered on December con tracts, and had also made advantage ous storage contracts In the East. The conseeiuence was there was a host of buying orders for December mt the opening, mostly of moderate lots, It ls true, but they had the same effect on the already strained market as If they were for millions. There was no wheat for sale. December closed yesterday at $I.oo'i, but opening bids today ranged all the way from $1.01 "»i to $1.04, and even at the top there was scarcely a bushel to be had. This precipitated a perfect scramble among the shorts, net in December alone, but In January and May also. Before wheat came out, $1.05 was offered for December. Then came a lull which lasted for an hour. Brokers operating for the bull clique attempted to stem the tide, but prob ably from 200,000 to 250,000 bu were taken before a reaction occurred. De cember declined to $1.03%, but by 11:45 had again risen to $1.05. Then came the storm. Within five minutes and amid a whirl of excitement December was bid up to $1.08. It reacted with a jerk to $1.06%, then up again without a stop to $1.09. the highest point bid for wheat in this market in six years. Prcbably as much wheat was sold on Sagasta Echoes Carlist Doctrine. MADRID, Dec. 9.— The Imparcial says today that It takes for granted that the government will take the necessary steps to "meet the interven tion threatened by President McKin ley," adding: "If the new loan for the organization of the navy is floated, it ls sure to succeed." Then, concludes the Imparcial: "The responsibility of the government ls enormous, if it fails to profit by the opportunity offered to place the country in a prsition to de fend its interests." The Globe confirms the reports that the government is making preparations to meet the "threats of Intervention." At a cabinet council today, the queen regent presiding, the premier, Senor Sagasta, outlined the opinions of the European press regarding President i McKinley's message to congress, the majority of which, the premier said, ! were favorable to Spain. He further declared that in the event of the Unit ed States attempting to intervene in i Cuba they would find the government ! prepared to defend the rights and hon ! or of Spain. As to the military opera | tions in Cuba, the premier informed the cabinet that the results obtained were satisfactory. The premier also 

ARISTOCRATIC HOLD-UP. Most Exclusive Section of Ckleagtl the Scene of It. CHICAGO, Dec. 9.— Dr. H. A. Moyer, a noted insanity expert and one of the faculty of Rush Medical college, was attacked by footpads tonight at the In tersection of Adams street and Ash land boulevard, than which there is no more aristocratic spot in the city of Chicago. The attempted robbery took place at a time when numerous pedes trians were en the street and was one of the boldest affairs of its kind that has happened in Chicago for a long time. Dr. Moyer made a fight for his money and knocked one of the men down. The second footpad then sht the doctor in the groin, inflicting a wound that will not prove serious. The robbers secured no plunder. SLAP AT IXCLE SAM. Paris Temps Critical in Comment ing on the Hu.vtlnn Incident.

That month opened strong at from 93c to 94e, and it sold as high as 97c during the exeitment, an advance of 5%c since yesterday. It was figured that the influences con trolling December also applied to Jan uary, and shorts got under cover as quickly as they could. May was also very strong, though it did not have the semi-panicky appearance of the other options. It'opened at t'l<&01* 4 -\ as c m pared with yesterday's closing price of 90*V4@90%c, and had advanced l>y noon to 92*&g-&2%c.
