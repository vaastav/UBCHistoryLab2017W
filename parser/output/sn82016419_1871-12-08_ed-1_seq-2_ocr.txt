"We yield large portion of our spaco this week to President Grant's third animal message. We give it In full because a large por tion of our readers will have no other means of seeing it, and we believe all should read It. It is a plain statement of the doings of the government during the past year, and of what is needed to further the general interests of the country. a , m Gen. Schzxce. Secretary Fish has received Information from New York that the statement appears iu one of the newspapers that Scheuck has been recalled and Fish Is to succeed him. The Secretary pronounces this untrue. Even should Gen. Schcnck be recalled, Fish would not accept ' tho place. Schenck's connection with the Emma mine was a legitimate invettment, of precedent date to his unsought appoint mont to the London mission. Political and personal hostility is the cause of his demanded recall. There has been no danger, from the first, that our friendly relations with Russia would be disturbed by anything that might grow out of the dissatisfac tiou of onr Government with Mr. Cata cazy, but the action of the Czar in recall ing the obnoxious minister has relieved the President of a disagreeable task, and the people of this country will feel themselves even more greatly obliged, insomuch as thoso newspapers which aspire to be our court journals, will havo no occasion, when Mr. Catacazy shall leave us, to manufacture theories every day as to tho cause of his failure to please the President and tho Secreta ry of State. m a s Tub New Iowa Capitol. The laying of the corner stono of the new Iowa State Capitol took placo at Des Moines on the 23d. The lion. James F. Wil son, of Fairfield, delivered the introduc tory address, Governor Merrill the ora tion, and CapL, A. S. ITardy the ode The exercises of. laying the corner stone took place according to pro gramme. As an episode of tho c sion, tho Hon. John A. Kasson prcscn ted Governor Merrill with a beautiful silver trowel a gift of the architects. At their meeting on Thursday, the Cap tol Commissioners adopted a resolution that, after the laying of tho cornerstone, all further work in masonry and laying stone be suspended for the present sea. son, and that tho hands, foreman, and local superintendent bo dismissed. Geokoia. Political affarcs in this state, haveaassumed a mixed condition, A short time since, Gov. Bullock resign cd, as is supposed, to prevent a schemo for his impeachment. Mr. Conley, then President of the Senate, took his place as Governor of the State. When the Leg islature met, the Senate elected one Tramnelln place of Conley, and insisted that he should have the placo occupied by Conley, as Conley's office did not go over the term which had intervened between the two sessions of the Legis lature. Failing to oust the Acting-Gor ernor in this way, tho Legislature, which is largely Democratic, passed a bill to hold a special election to fill the uuex pircd term of Bullock. The Iicpubli cans claimed that no vacancy existed, Conley succeeding, nnder the Constitu tion, to the whole of Bullock's unex pired term. But tho Democrats were determined, and after Conley had ve toed the bill, they passed It over his ve to. So there will be a special election in Gcargia, on December 19, and the bill provides that the Governor then elected shall be sworen in tho next day. W. T, Wofford is said to be the coming roan ; but Conley is likely to deny the legality of ihe election, and so there will be two Governors in Georgia and a judicial in vestigation and settlement of the ques tion will be likely to take place. Senator SraAOCK ix Kansas. Hon. William Spragne, who has been Gov ernor of Rhode Island, a General of volunteers from that State, and who is now one of its Senators, passed through Fort Scott yesterday morning, aud is expected here to-day. lie has already f tatted through Leavenworth, and now ntenda to go through the Neosho Val ley, over the M. K. & T., and then he takes a trip to Colorado. Got. bpragues brother, and partner, Auiasa Spraguo, was in the State a short timo ago. The attention of those gen tlemen was drawn to Kansas about two years ago by Mr. Ben F. Akers, of Leavenworth, and it is now their inten tion to buy land here, and owa In ovlt State the largest stock farm in" the Union. Several car loads of stock have already arrived at Leavenworth, and others are now on the way... a . This step is one of great importance to our farmers and to the citizens of the State generally. It is known that the Spragnea are the largest cotton manufacturers in our country. They own mills in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Maine, and have rectntly bought the best water privilege In South Car olina. They also take prido in owning and raising the beat horses and cattle. . In making Kansas the headquarters of their stockralsing business they have shown their shrewdness and wisdom. The visit of Gen. Spraguo to Fort Scott Is made for the purpose of exam ining our coal deposits, and judging for himself our manufacturing facilities. No other public man has ever been here who could do as much for our fu ture as Gov. Sprague should ho look favorably upon our situation and capa bilities. Got. Sprague is a very young man for one whe has already gained a nation al reputation, and exceedingly modest in his personal bearings. Those ..who meet him will find Tiim affablo and pleasant, and with no "airs" or preten sions whatever. Fort Scott Monitor of the 25. ; , 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Washington. December 4. To the Senate and House of Represent- aunts : In addressing my third annual mess age to the law-making branch of the government, it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year suc cess has generally attended the effort to execute law as round upon the statute books. The policy was not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to learn their scope and interest and enforce them accordingly. The pant year has, under a wise Provi dence, been one or general prosperity to tho nation. It has, however, been attended with unusual chastisements in tho loss of life and property - by storm aud fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country, and to develop a friendship lor us on the part of loreign nations whicii goes far toward anevi a tin? the distress occasioned by the calamities. The benevolent who have so generonsly shared their means with the victims or these misfortune, will reap their reward in the consciousness of bavin? performed a noble act, and ( r r . . . . i . , t hi receiving we grate i ut tnanas oi too men, women and children, whose suf ferings they have relieved. 

XORKIGHT RELATIONS. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an event ful one In witnessing two great nations speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by peaceful arts the disputes of long standing and which were liable at any time to brine these nations into bloody and hostile conflict. An example has thus beeu set, which. if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations and peoples furnishing the means of return ing to productive industry millions of I men now maintained to settle the dls- Eutes of nations by the bayonet and roads word.- I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded since the adjournment ef congress with her Britanio majesty, and a copy of the protocol of the conference of the commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two na tions. Various questions are yet to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend congress, at an early day, to make the necessary provisious for the tribunal at Ucncva, and for the several commit sionsrs .on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. Ills majesty, the king or Italy, the president or the Swiss coufederation, and his majesty, the emperor of Itrazii, nave each con scnted, at the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator for' the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the roudincss with which the joint request has been complied with by the appoint nicut of gcntlcmcu of eminence and learning to these important positions. Ilis majesty, the emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the two governments, and lias consented to act as arbitrator of the disputed water boundary be twecn the United states and ureal Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to remedy, as between themselves, certain principles of public law for which the United States has contended irom the com mencement of its history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other maritime thrones, and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of tho note by which the in vitation is to be extended to these powers. THE 

FISHERIES. I recommend the legislation ueccssa ry, on the part oi tne untied aiaies, to bring into operation articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to tne other matters touching the relations of the United States towards the British North American possessions, as soon as the proper legislation shall be held on the part of Great Britain and her pos sessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrange ments for the coming season I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith to the governors of New York, Penn sylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the govern ments of these States respectively the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the object or the articles or the treaty, which contemplates the use of the canals on either side connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary in terms of equity by the inhabitants of British countries. It is hoped that tne impor tance of the object and tho benefits to flow therefrom will Becnre the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. THE NORTHERN BOUXDART, I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true position of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the United States and the Brit ish North Ainciican possessions, be tween tho Lake of the Woods md the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action of congress, in this rccora mendation named, would put it in the power of the war department to put a force in the held during next summer, OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. Germany. The resumption of diplo made relations between France and Germany have enabled ns to give di rections for the withdrawal of the pro tection extended to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular rep re sentatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add, that the del icate duty of this protection has been performed by the minister and consul general at Paris and the various consuls iu Franco, under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German government and has wonnded no susceptibility of the French. The government of tho empire of Germany continues to manifest a friend ly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize- with the inodcrato aud just policy which this government maintains in its relations with tho Asiatic powers, as well ns with the South American republic. I have given assurances that the friendly feelings of that government are fully shared by tho United btates. A ustro'JIungarian Empire. The ratification of tho cousularand natural ization connections with the Austro- Uugarian empire have been exchanged. Italy. i have been officially inform ed of the annexation of the States of tho Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of that kingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy ef the United States, I have recognized this change. The ratification of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy has beeu e scan god, The two powers hive agreed tn their treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war betwecuthetwo powers. The United States has spared no opportunity in incorporating this rule into the obligations of natious, Spain. Tho forty-first congress, at its third session, made an appropriation for tho organization of a mixed com mission lor adjudicating upon the claims of citUxus of the United States, against Spain, growing put of the in surrection in Cuba. That commission has since been organized and I transmit herewith tho correspondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that tbis commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for their injuries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washlugton between the plenipoten fion of Spain and the allied South American republics, which has result ed in an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. Hussia. The intimate and friendly relations which so long existed between the United States and Russia continue to be undisturbed. The visit ot the third son of the emperor is a proof that there Is no desire on the part of his government to diminish the cor diality of these relations. The hospi table reception which has bcei giyen to the grand duke is proof that on our side we share the wishes of that gov ernment. The inexcusable course of the Russian minister at Washington - rendered It necessary to ask his recall and to de cline to longer receive that functiona ry as a diplomatic representative. It was Impossible, with self-respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit M. Catacazy to con tinue to hold intercourse with this gov ernment, after his abuse of government officials and during his persistent In- terference through various means with the relations between the mmtea States and other powers. In accord ance with my wishes, this government has been relieved of further Intercourse with M. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of the Imperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentle man entirely unobjectionable. Japan. With Japan we continun to maitain intimate relations. The cabi net of the Mikado has, since the close of the last session of congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve important offices in several departments of the government. I have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United istates uas pursued toward Japan. Cfttna. it is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspondence transmitted here with shows that there is no disposition on tho part of tbis government to turn from its established course. Prompted by a desire to pnt an end to the barbar ous treatment of our shipwrecked salt ors on the Corean coast, I instructed our minister at Pekln to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea to secure the safety and humane treatment of such mariners. Admiral Bogam was Instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him. A small surveying party was sent out, and on reaching the coast, was treach erously attacked at a disadvantage, Ample opportunity was given for ex planation and apology for the insnlts, but neither came. A force was then landed, and after an arduous march over a rugged and dmcult country, the forts from which the outrages bad been committed were eallaatly assaulted and were destroyed. .Having thus punished I the criminals, and having vindicated the honor of the flag, the expedition returned. Finding it impracticable un- der the circumstances to conclude the desired convention, I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto herewith submitted, and leave the sub ject for such action as congress may 6ee lit to take, Mexico. The republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law establishing what is Known as the free zone on the front tier of the United State. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more stringent measures may be taken by the republic for restraining lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon relieve this government of the difficulties experienced from these caases. llentral and South Ame.rien. Our relations with the various republics of I Central and Sonth America continues with one exception to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by congress, regarding tho over due in stallments under the award of the Venezuela claims commission of 1866, The internal dissensions of this govern ment present no Justification lor the absence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extra treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged It is a subject for congratulation that the great empire of Brazil has taken the necessary steps toward the aboli tion of slavery; our relation with that empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so, by this act. It Is not too much to hope that the government of Brazil may hereafter find it for its interests, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present cob tem plates. Ihe true prosperity and great ness of a nation is to be found in the elevation and education of its laborers, It is a subject for regret that the re forms in this direction which were vol untarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out in its West Indian colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of 6lavervin Cuba aud Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in bondage, with no hope of release until their liyes be come a burden to their employers. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that the citizens of the United States are large holders iu foreign lands of this species of property by the fun damental law of their adopted country. I recommend to congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the holding, owning or dealing in slaves or being interested in slave property in foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mortgagers by per sons of the united btates. Cuba. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba continues to be a source of an noyanco and anxiety. The existence : existence such close of a protracted struggle iu proximity to our own territory without apparent prospect of an early termina tion, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people who, while ab staining from interference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed en joyment of peace, liberty and the bless ings of free inititutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property ef bona fide American citizens, aud to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out or the an airs or Uuba may be ad justed in the spirit of peace and con sideratiou which has hitheito guided the powers in their treatment ot such questions. China and Japan.-To give import ance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with J pan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of those people, and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow be tween these nations and tho balance of the commercial world, I earnestly re commend that an appropriation be made to suppert at least four American youths in each of these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representa fives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representa tives of Great Britain and some other powers. As now situated, our repre sentatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon the natives of those countries, who kuow our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees in foreign business houses, or the interpreters of other foreign ministers. I would also recommend lib eral measures for the purpose of sup porting the American lines of steam ers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and China, aud the Austra lian lines, almost our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increas ing their service. THE 

NATIONAL DEBT. The national debt has been reduced to the extent ef eighty-six millions, fifty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-six dollars and eighty-cents during the year, aud by the negotiation of national bonds, at a lower rate of interest, the Interest of the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000,000 less than on the first of March, 18C9. It is highly de sirable that this raised diminution should continue, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince ns citizens or their entire ability to meet every dol ar of liability n th. out bankrupting them. But in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends by the rapid development of the resources of the country and its increas ing ability to meet large demands and the amount already paid, it is not desir ablo that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from inter nal sources be abolished, except those, on spirituous, vinous god malt liquors, tobacco in caddies and in various forms, from stamps. In re-adjusting the tariff, I suggest that a careful , estimate be made from the pressat laws, after pro viding for the current expenses of the government, for the interest account and sinking fund, and that this, as a surplus, be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many ar ticles not produced at home, such as medicines and compound essences, from which, very little revenue Is le rived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a fur ther reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that Jt be made in those articles, in which it can be, vith out disturbing home productions . r reducing the wages of American labor ers. I have not entered into figures, because to do go wpuld be to repeat all that is said before yon tn the renort of the secretary of the treasury. 

COLLECTJO. LAWS-., - J In tho present laws for collecting rev- enucs, the pay of collectors of customs im am.n vTli; .1 -. 1 i is small. i neir salaries are- dependent upon shares in all seizures which are made at principal ports of entry. I recommend particularly the raising of the compensation of these officials to a proper sum. It has always seemed to me that this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an induce ment to dishonest men, should such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, so as to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectful ly invited to this subject,- " 

GOLD rLrCTPATIONS. The continued fluctuations in the val ue of gold as compared with the na tional currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and develop ment of the country, in keeping up the prices of all articles necessary in every day life. It fosters a spirit of grumb ling at the national finances. .If the question can be met so as to get a fixed value to our currency, that value con stantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. THE AHMV. For the operations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining it, the estimates for the ensuing year and for continuing sea coasts and other improvements, conducted under the su pervision of the war department, I re fer you to the accompanying report of the secretary of war. I call your at tention to the provisions of the act of congress, approved March 3, 1SG0, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps or the army, until provided for by law. I recommend that the cumber of officers iu each grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number In any one grade falls be low the number so fixed, that the ra cancy may be filled by promoting from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes v.acant, the place may be filled by selection from the corps in which tho vacancy exists. THE NAVY. The report of the secretary of the navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting it. This is dne to the policy, which has been adopted and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several sta tions. By these means, we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex tent of cruising ground and to visit more frequently the ports where the presence or our nag is desirable, and generally to discharge officially the ap- propriate duties of the navy in time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditures authorized by the law. During the past year, the navy has, in addition to its regular ser vice, supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the coast survey, and has completed the survey, as authorized by congress, of the Isthmus of Darienand Tehauntepec, and uuder this authority has sent au expedition, completely tur- uished and equipped to explore the un known ocean ot the north. The sug gestion ot tho report as to the necessity tor increasing and improving the ma. terial of the navy, and the plan recom mended for reducing the personate of the service to a peace standard by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well con sidered and deserve the thoughtful at tention of congress. 1 also recommend that all promotions iu the navy above captain, be by selection; instead of by seniority. Tbis course will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency, and hold out incentives to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledgo of their profession. : The present cost of maintaining the nayy, its costs com pared with that of the preceding year and the estimates tor the ensuing year are contained in the acoompanying re port of the secretary of the navy. THE 

TOSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the postoffice department, as shown by the accom panying report of the postmaster gene ral, exhibits a gradual increase in that branch of the public service. . It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of a republic, with a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the servi ccs of the mail. It is not at present to be expected that this department can be made self supporting, but a gradual ap 1 1' 'v' .vu. jcai j is constantly relied on, and the day is not tar distant when the post-omce ae partment of the government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the postmaster general for improve ments in the department presided over by him, are earnestly recommended to your 'special attention, especially the documents favoaable to a consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraph system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course, the cost of telegraphing would be much reduced, and the ser vice as well, if not better rendered. It would secure the further advantage of extending tho telegraph through por tions of the country, where private enterprise will not construct it. Com merce and trade, and above all, the ef forts to bring a people widely separated into a community or interests, are ai ways benefitted by a rapid inter-com munication. Education, the ground work of republican institutions, is en couraged by increasing the facilities to gather with speed news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the postmaster general for full details of the operations of the last year, and for comparative state ments of tho resources with former years, THE 

KU-KLUX r There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the government the execution of the act of congress, ap. proved April 20th, 1371, and commonly known as the iu-Hlux law. in a por tion of the State of Sooth Carolina, the necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report or the com mittee to investigate southern outrages. Under the provisions of the above act 1 issued a proclamation, calling the at tention of the people of the United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise any of the extra ordinary powers thereby conferred on me, bnt making known my purpose to exercise such power whenever it should become necessary to do so lor the pur pose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution and the laws. After the passage of this law information was re ceiyed from time to time 'that combina tions of the character referred to in this law existed and were powerful in many parts of the southern states, particular ly in many parts of South Carolina. Careful investigation was. made, and it was ascertained that-ln nine counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a suf ficient portion of the citizens to control "rTKl"!: "rI""" rlu" v. uCm..,.u u emancipated class of the benefits of freedom, and of preventing the free po litical action of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of dif ferent political sentiments from them, or persons who bad shown a disposition to claim equal rights with these citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well dis posed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless violence. Whereupon, on the 13th day of October, 1671, a proclama tion was issued in the terms of the law calling upon the members to disperse within five days, and to return to the Marshal or military officers of the Uni ted States all arms and ammunition, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used by them for carry ing out their unlawful purposes. This warning not having beeu heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine coun ties in that State. ' Direction was given that within the counties so designated persons supposed, upon creditable in formation, to be members of such un lawful combinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States, and delivered to the Marshal to be dealt with acoordlng to law, - In two ot.aJ3 counties; York' and Spartaushurg, many arrests have beeu made. . , At last accounts the number of persons that were ; arrested waa ICS.

As soon as It appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigor ous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there ia good ground for supposing that all such per sons had violated that law. A full re port of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General. ."' " "AFFAIRS IN UTAH. In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to civilization and decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorial officers have, however, been found who are willing to perform their duty in the part of equi ty, and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither polyg amy or any other violation of existing statutes will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled saints that we are now dealing, bnt their practices. They will be protected in the worship of bod according to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It may be advisable for Congress to con sider what, in the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to be the sta tus or plural wives and their offspring. The propriety of Congresss passing an enabling act autnonzing the local legis lature of Utah to legitimatize all born prior to a time, fixed In the act, might be justified by its humanity to these in nocent children. This is a suggestion only, not a recommendation. . THE INDIAN POL1CT. The policy pursued toward the Indi ans has resulted favorably so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the exertions of the various societies of christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy, and the ac tion of the commissioners, assisted by the law of April 10, 1S09, many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle on reservations, to cultivate the boII, and perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civiliza tion. They are being cared for iu such a way, jt is hopeLas to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life, to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy, not only because it is humane, chrutian-like and economical, but because it is right. 1 recommend to your favorable consid eration also, the policy of granting a territorial government to the Indians of the Indian territory, west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so every right guaranteed to tho Indians by treaty should be secured. Such a course might be the means of collecting most of the Indians now be tween the Missouri and the Pacific and sonth of the British possessions, into one territory and ono State. The secre tary ot tho lu tenor has treated upon this subject at length, and I recommend to you his suggestions. PUBLIC LANDS. I renew ray recommendations that the public lands be regarded as a heri tage to our cbiidren, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been in great measure disposed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them; butcau tion should be exercised in attaining so desirable an object. Educational inter ests may well be served by the granting of the proceeds of the sale of public lands. I do not wish to be understood as recommending in the least degree curtailment of what is being done by the general government fop the enconr agement of education. The report of the beoretaryof the Interior, submitted with this, will give you information, collected and prepared for publication AGRICULTURE. The report of the commissioner of ag riculture gives the operations of his de partment tor the year. Agriculture is the groundwork ot our prosperity, and too much importance cannot he at tached to the labor ot the department, it is in the hands of an able head with able as sistants, all zealously devoted to intro ducing into the agricultural productions of the nation, all useful products adap ted to any of the various climates of our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to the mode of cultiva ting the flowers and cereals and other products adapted to particular localities. Uuietiy but surety the agricultural b.u reau is working a great national good. and if liberally supported, the more its influence will be extended and the less dependent we 6hall be upon the pro ducts of other countries. COMPENSATION TO BUREAUS. The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials, holding position of responsibility and requiring ability and character to nil properly, is one to which your attention is invited But few of the official? receive a com pensation equal to the respectable sup port of a family, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest in private life. Services demand com pensatson equal to the services rendered and a wise economy would dictate the same rule in the governmen service ESTIMATE OF EXPENDITURE. I have not given the estimates for the support of the government tor tne ensu ing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for the year mst passed and the one just preceeding because all these figures are contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly to congress. These estimates have my approval. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DISABILITIES. More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired be tween the armies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpetuation, and the other for the destruction of the Un ion. It may well be considered wheth er it is not now time that the disabili ties of the fourteenth amendment Bhould be removed. That amendment does not include the ballot, but only requires the disability to houi omces or certain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect officers to reflect the views of the ma. jority. I do not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were, before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions, re quiring them to take an oath to support Ihe constitution, and admitting to engi bility those entertaining exactly the same views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said the for mer violated an oath while the latter did not. but the latter did not have it in their power. If they had taken this oath, it cannot be doubted they would nave brosen u as aiu tne rormer ciass. If there are any great criminals distin gulshed above all others for the part they took in - opposition to tne govern m en t, they might, in the judgment of congress, be excluded from such an am. nesty. This subject is submitted for your careful. consideration. .' . CONDITION OF SOUTHERN STATES. - The condition of the southern states, unhapily, is not such as all truer iatri otic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake, -personal violence or threats toward persons en tertaining political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, prevents immigration and the flow of much needed capital in to the states lately in rebellion. It will be 'a happy condition of the country when the old citizens of these states will take an interest in public affairs, pro mulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing their views, and permit the same freedom of expression and ballot in those entertaining differ ent political confections, TUX DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. , Under the provisions of the act con gress, approved February 21st, 1871, a territorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. - Its results thus far have fully realized the expecta tions of its advocates. Under the di rection of the territorial officers, system of improvements has been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rap idly becoming a city worthy of the na tion's capital, the citizens of the district having voluntarily, taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of con tributing to the advancement of the state of ' government. . I recommend liberal appropriations on the part of congress, in, order that the government may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out a judicious- system of improvements, .' - - i .; THE CHICAGO FIRE. .. . ,By the great fire in Chicago, the most important pf the government buildings in, that city were consumed. Those burnpd had, already h,eppme Inadequate to the uses of the government In! that growing city, and looking fo the near; future, were totally inadequate. ' I rec ommend, therefore that an appropria tion be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square in which the burned buildings stood, provided it can do purchased at a fair valuation. and provided the legislature of Illinois will pass a law authorizing its condem nation for government purposes, and also an appropriation of as much money as can properly be expended, towards the erectian of new buildings. IMPOSITION UPOJf IMMIGRANTS. During the fiscal year, the number of Immigrants, ignorant of our laws and habits, coming into our country annu ally, has become so great, and the im positons practiced upon them so im mense and fiarrant, that I suggest con- grsssional action lor their protection. It seems to me a fair subject of legisla tion oy congress. . l cannot now esti mate as fully as I desire, the nature of the complaints made by immigrants of the treatment they receive, but will en deavor to do so during the session of congress, particularly of the subjects which should receive attention. THE CIVIL 8ERAICE It has been the aim of the administra tion to enloree honesty and efficiency in all offices. Every subject who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the vigor of the law. lr bad men have secured pla ces, it has been the fault of the system established by law and customs for making assessments on the persons of those who recommend for government positions, persons not sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give letters endorsing the character of office seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which devolves up on them. A civil service reform which can correct this abuse Is much desired. In mercantile pursuits, the business man who gives a letter of recommenda tion to a friend to enable him to ob tain credit from a stranger, is regarded as nominally responsible for the integ rity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would enforce this principle against all endorsers or persons for public place, would insure greater cau tion in making recommendations. A salutary lesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest servant in the great nnmber of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place through out the country in bringing to punish ment those who have proved recreant to the trust confided to them, and in el evating to public office those who e: press the confidence of the honest and virtuous, who, it win always be round, comprise the majority ot tne comma nuy in which they live, la my message to congress one year ago, 1 recommend' ed the ninth soction of an act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the government and ror other pur poses, approved Mareh 3, 1871, to give the necessary authority to the executive to inaugurate civil service reform and place upon him the responsibility to do so. U under the authority ot said law, I convened a board of gentlemen fit for the work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not yet complete, but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the executive, the heads of departments, and members of congress, and which will redound to the interest of the public service. All the experiments shall have a fair trial. I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the government during the last year, and made such sugges tions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit there with a confidence that your combined action will bo wise, statesman-like and in the best interest ef the whole country, Signed, U. S. UltAJST, President.

EMPORIA. Xatural Adf outages of Location Steady Inereose of Population Handsome and Commodious Buildings Leading Bus! ness Men Col. Robinson. Emporia, Kas., Nov. 26, 1871. In the 6outh tho Cottonwood's clear, running waters create life and power in man s mechanism, and the broad, ler tile valley yields its wealth of agricul ture. On the north flows the potent Neosho, Its steady current turning many a ponderous wheel that trans forms the products of the beautiful valley Into that which "gives life and strength to man and beast. Between these rivers and valleys so situated as to reap rich harvests from both, lies EMPORIA, one of the most flourishing and rapid ly growing towus iu all Kansas. First settled in February, 1857, its progress was slow but steady. December, '69 witnessed the entrance of the Missouri Kansas & Texas railroad, and the 800 people who then comprised the popu lation, realizing the importance of yet another road, at once set about to secure it. Emporia's NATUBAL ADVANTAGES of location, together with the class of people that had already settled in the town, formed alluring attractions to many, and in September, 1870, the 'date of completion to this point of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad the population numbered fully 1,500. Very many of the new comers leaving the old Buckeye State for the then new fiields of .Kansas. During the past fourteen months the grpwta m population has peon remark ably steady. Having MORE THAN DOUBLED, the present number being upwards of 3.0O0. In many respects Emporia has not an equal in the State, and but few towns of her size anywhere in the whole country can boast of more marked bus iness prosperity, of a better class of buildings, or higher moral standing. As regards the latter characteristic. know of no plaoe in all my travels that can equal this. -There has never been a murder committed, here, or, for that matter, in the whole county. Such document as a license to sell Liquor has never been known here, and but two hours' experience with a gambling house tells the story ot all in that line. Houses of ill-repute are unknown, and there has not been a street fight or a drunken brawl of any kind iu the past four or five months, very rarely in deed is there an occasion for arrest, and at times the calaboose remains empty week after week. The citizens of Em poria are men, very emphatically, and are above the brute in everything. ''Remember the Sabbath, day and keep it holyv- wiU never-become obsolete here, the interest in religious - maters ever keeping pace with the increase ia Eopulation, as ia evinced by the num er of churches already completed and those in course of erection. There are 

THIRTEEN TCKCq OBOAJOZATIOHS here, and, what is quite remarkable in this connection, none of them are Ro man Catholic, and it is stated that there is not a solitary individual ef that be lief in the whole town. , The Presbyte rian, Methodist, Episcopal, .Baptist, Congregational, Welsh Congregational, Christian and Quaker denominations all ' have convenient and : comfortable church edifices, the most noticeable of which is the new structure just com pleted for the .Presbyterians. It is of neat and becoming outer appearance, but the interior is a perfect gem, being fitted up in elegant style, oak pews with black walnut trimmings, crimson cush ions, floor Qf the isles handsomely car peted,' and over all falls the rich-hued light that sifts it way through the gothic windows of stained glass. The edifice is of brick, and cost t&OOO. The Welsh- Presbyterians, who suffered the loss of their church building by fire a few weeks since, are preparing to erect a new edifice, far superior in every way to the one destroyed. Emporia, Outside of the, "deserted village," has - JMsiBB CLASS OF BUILDINGS - devoted to business purposes than any other town in the State. Lawrence has perhaps three times the number of buildings, but there three story' struc tures are few and far between, while here they are numerous. Commercial street bears quite a metropolitan look, and if as many fine buildings are ereot ed during the cemtngyear as have been in the past, Emporia's main thorough fare will take a decided lead orer Law renco, Topeka and other large towns. -'Emporia's 'growth and prosperity are the fruits of industry and; energy, 'and from the first she has numbered among her people men or much enterprise, liberality and refinement..' These, men take gret prjde in the -progress of tfce at the tame tImev;adornig"; it with,, pleasing architecture. Among the handsome buildings lately erected is BUGGLES A PLUMB'S three story and basement, brick, on the corner of Commercial street and Fifth avenue. It is eighty by twenty-four feet, has modern improvements, and cost 118,000. The lower floor and sec ond story are used for business and of fice purposes, and the upper story fitted up as a Masonic Hall. Messrs. Ruggles & Pluumb are the leading lawyers in this county, and have an immense prac tice. LIEUT. GOV. ESKSIDGE, who has just been elected by a decisive majority to a seat in the Lower House, at Topeka, has lately completed a three 6tory and basement brick, on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Commercial street. It is of very attractive style of architecture and cost 0,000. The up per floor comprises a fine large hall, known as Eskridge Hall, and is where the Unitarians hold their services. W. W. Williams, late of the 2W6ne and News, is rapidly putting on the fin ishing touches to one of the finest buil dings in the place. It is on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Commercial street, opposite Eskridge's, is two stories in height, with basement, fifty feet front eighty feet in depth, and will cost about $ib,uuu. THE EMPORIA NEWS will occupy rooms in the building wnen completed. The .news is or re martabie longevity for a western week ly, having been started when the town numbered less than a half dozen houses, and holding its own ever since; nearly fifteen years of age. BANK BUILDINGS. Riggs' Bank building, the Neosho Valley Bank block, and Swallow & Co.'s bank buildings are all fine structures, of handsome appearance, and costing, in the aggregate, nearly If 60.000. BANCROFT HALL. There are many other buildings wor thy of note, among then. Bancroft's Hall, a large and commodious structure, ou the corner of Commorcial street aud Fifth avenue. The third story is devo ted to an amusement hall, and a fine one it is, capable of comfortably seat ing seven hundred persons. with good stage and scenic effects, it affords first-class accommodation for those who give the performances, as well as thoso who witness them. Mr. JJancrott is the leading dealer in real estate, and has done much toward building up the town, his Hall having cost him nearly PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The State Normal School is located near this city, and on the twenty acres of ground given the State by Giles Fil- ley, of at. Louis, who is largely inter ested in real estate and land about here. The present building is but a small and contracted edifice, by no means ade q n ate to the requirements. The coming legislature will be petitioned tor au appropriation of $50,000, and if grant ed,the people of this town will add $25,- 000 or $30,000 to that amount, and havo a school building that will be an honor to its location aud the State. The county court house is an imposing stone structure, and cost $25,000. There are two other school buildings at present, and another will be erected in the spring, when the aggregate proporty in that liue will amount to $ 

AI.OOU or up wards. The city has erected two board ing houses, at a cost of 6,000, for the use or the students at tne .Normal School. BUSINESS MEN. The great drawback to Emporia's progress in early days was the dearth of capital, not one in ten of the settlers coming here with any ready money, Commencing on almost nothing, the early merchants made their money by dilligent work, stepping up but one step at a time. P. G. Hall berg, one of the leading business men of the day, came here iu the spring of '59 without a dollar. Borrowing $25 at four per cent, a month, he commenced business in a little shanty on the outskirts of the town. lie now does a business of from $40,000, to $50,000 a year in gen eral merchandise, and also owns and operates one of the finest nerseries in the State. It is located adjacent to the town on the south, and is worth $23,000. H. V. Bundrem commenced here in '59, with nothing but his hands, picking up i F; 1 1 1 i i lie is now the leading saddle and har ness maker and dealer in this section of the State, and does a very large bus! ness. Hall Brothers, prominent dry goods merchants, commenced hero as clerks on small salaries. They are now doing a business of from $60,000 to $70,000 a year, and have just moved into a fine new two-story brick, built by them the present soason. Fred. Hirth, manufacturer and dealer in furniture, upholstery, etc., has built up his now extensive business from comparatively nothing, and well- do serves his good fortune. His sales will run close to $75,000 a year. He has also just erected and moved into a fine new building. Bancroft is McCarter, both formerly of Columbus, Ohio, have for some years been the leading dry goods merchants and do a yearly business of upwards of 100,000. A. A. Baker & Co.. extensively en gaged in groceries and fish, do about 125,000 a year. C. F. Pierce & Co., who have branch houses all over Southern Kansas, do here alone $150,000 a year in lumber. G. W. Fredrick, an old Settler, does rrom aO,UUO to $dU,UUO a year in gro ceries. Wicks & Maysc, another old house, doing about the same. More and Weaver and North & Shell mire are the leading dealers in drugs both firms doing a heavy business. Holderman & Bros., and J. M. Grif fith & Bro., carry very extensive stocks in the hardware line, and each firm does a yearly business of close on to $80,000 or $90,000. A. S. Smith, a new comer, is rapidly extending his business in dry goods and Doots and snoes, and, judging rrom present sales, he will easily reach $100, 000 as the sum total of the first twelve months. Associated with Mr. Smith is Mr. Ed. Morrison, formerly of Tippe canoe, unio, a most energeuo and tuor ough young business man, and who wii( ere many years make his mark among the leading merchants of this town. Kcisey & Kernocban, also dealers in groceries, do a large business, and are live, energetic men. Wm. Clapp, for many years a leading dealer in boots and shoes and clothing, noes over 

$1UU,UU(J a year. Perley & Bearce do upwards of 50,- OOO in eloUtins, McMillan & Cochran, grocers, about $50,000, R. C. Haywood E vo., furniture, branch or at. Aiouis house, about $80,000. BASKS. There are three hanking houses here, the oldest of which is that of Swallow, Heritage & Soden established in '65, and known as the Emporia Bank. Mr. Swallow is well known . all over the State, having been Auditor for two terms. The banking house of which he is the head, bears a most enviable repu tation, and the business done Is exten sive and profitable, The other two banking institutions are the Neosho Valley Bank, of which H. C. Cross is President, and R. B. Hurst Cashier, and the house of Riggs & Dnnlap. The ag gregate banking capital is about $125, 000, a fair proportion to the business of the mercantile houses, which will aggregate about $2,225,000 tbis year.
