PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Th e President of the United States C ommnnicates His Views to Congress. The Shortest Message on Record NATIONAL FINANCES. THAT AWFUL BUBPLUS. To the Cuvjress of the United States: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties, with a condition of the national finances which impera tively demands immediate and careful consideration. The amount of mcne> annually received, through the operation of present laws from the industries and necessities of the people, largely exceeds the sum necessary to meet the exigencies of the government. 'When we considr that the theory o? our institutions guar antees to every citizen the fall endow ment of th© fruits of his industry and enterprise with only such deduction a may be his share towards the careful and economical maintenance of the govern ment which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is inde fensible and a culpable bofrayal of fair ness and justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of na tional taxation, like other wrongs, multi plies a brood of evil consequences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people’s trib ute to its legitimate objects of expendi ture, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people’s use. Thus crippling our national energies, usurping onr country’s develop ment, preventing investment in product ive enterprises, threatening financial dis turbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our treasury is not alto gether new; and it has more than once of late been submitted to the peoples’ repre sentatives in the congress, who alone can apply a remedy, and yet the situation still continues, with aggregative inci dents, more than ever presaging financial convulsion and wide-spread disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation be cause the dangers are not now palpably imminent and apparent. They exist none the less certainly and the unforseeu and unexpected occasion will come when suddenly they will be precipitated upon QS. Oa the 39th day of June, 1885, the ex css of revenue over public expenditures v.ftei complying with the annual require ment of the sinking fund act, was $17,- 859,735.84; during the year ended June 30, 1886, such excess amounted to $49.- 405,545.20; and during the year ended June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,- 567,849.54. The annual contributions to the sink ing fond during the three years above specified, amounting in the aggregate to $138,058,320.94, and reductions from the surplus as stated were made by calling in tor that purpose outstanding three per cent, bonds of the government. During the six months prior to Juno 30, 1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large by repeated accumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people, would so effect the business of the coun try that the sum of $79,864,100 of such Surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the three per oent. bonds still outstanding, and whis& were then payable at the option of Iho government. The precarious condi tion of financial affairs among the peo ple still needing relief, immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887, the remain der of the three per oent. bonds then out standing, amounted with principal and interest to the sum of $18,877,500, were called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the treasury department representations of distress in business circles not only con tinued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these circumstances the contributions to the sinking fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by tbs expendi ture of $27,684,285.55 in the purchase of government bonds not yet due bearing four and four and a half per cent, interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about twenty-four per cent, for the former and eight per cent, for the latter. In addition to this the interest accruing during the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the government was to some extent an ticipated and banks selected as deposi tories of public money were permitted to ■somewhat increase their deposits. While the expedients thus employed, to release to the people the money lying in the treasury, served to avert immedi ate danger, our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting to, on the first day of December, $55,258,871.19, and estimated to reach the sum of $113,- 000,000 on the 30th of June next, at whioh dale it is expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the sur plus in the treasury to $140,000,000. There seems to be no assurance that, with such withdrawal from use of the people’s circulating medium our business community may not in the near future, be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced from the same cause, and while the functions of our na tional treasury should be few and simple, nnd while its best condition would be reached, I believed by its entire discon nection with the private business inter ste, yet when, by a perversion of its pur poses, ifc idly holds money uselessly sub tracted from the channels of trade, there seems to bo reason for the claim that Ugi'imate means should bo devised by ihe government to restore in an emerg ency without waste or extravagances such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now t xists no clear and undoubted executive tower of relief. Heretofore the redemp tion of three per cent’s only, which were payable at the option of the government has afforded a means for the disburse ment of the excess of our revenues; but these bonds have ah been retired and there are no bonds out standing the pay ment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund which furnishes the occasion for expenditures in the purchase of bonds has been already made for the current year, so there is no outlet in that direc tion- In the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing execu tive power to restore at this time, any part of our surplus revenues to the peo ple by its expenditure, consists in the supposition that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market and pur chase the bonds of the government not yet due, at a rate of premium to be agreed npor. The provision of law from which such a power could be derived from is found in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago, and it is subject to the sup position that it was intended astempoary and limited in its application instead of conferring continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official upon bis judgment of its necesssity, to withhold from or re lease to the business of the people in an unusual manner, money held in the treasury and thus affect at his will, the financial situation of the country; and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds. It should bo plainly vestal, and provided as far as possible with such checks and limitations as will define his official right and discretion, and at the same time re lieved him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchas ing bonds as a means of restoring to cir culation the surplus money accumulating in the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must, of course, be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as in vestments, which cannot be purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell may un reasonably enhance cost of such bond to the government. It has been suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest, and the difference between the old and new securities paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the treasury. The suc cess of this plan, it is apparent, must be founded upon the violation of the hold ers of the present bonds; and it is not entirely certain that the inducement which must be offered them would result in more financial benefit to the govern ment than the purchase of bonds, while the latter proposition would reduce the principal of the debt by actual payment, instead of extending it. The proposition to deposit the money held by the govern ment in banks throughout the country for use by the people, it seems to me an exceeding objectionable principle as reaebisg too close a relationship between the operations of the government to the business of th:*- country, and too exten sive a commingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance in pri vate business upon public funds. If this scheme should be adopted, it should only be done as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive effort should generally be in the opposite direction and should have a tendency to divorce, as much and as fast as can safely be done, the trea sury department from private enterprises. Of course it is not expected that un necessary and extravagant appropria tions will bo made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure besides the demoralization of all just concep tions of public duty whicn it entails em ulates a reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and beneficent pur poses of our government. I have deemed it my duty, thus to bring to the knowledge of my countrymen as well as the attention of their representa-/ tives to the responsibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our nfianoial situa tion. The failure of the congress hereto-v fore to provide against tke dangers it was quite evident, the very nature or the difficulty must necessarily produce, causing a condition of financial distress and apprehension since their last adjourn ment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within executive control; and these appear now to be ex hausted. If disaster results from the continued inaction of congress, the re sponsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should bo fully realized, and though it presents fea ture of wrong to the people as well aa to th© country, it is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproducing the same alarming circumstances a congested national treasury, and a depleted mone tary condition in the business of tho country. Itqeeds hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a predicament in the future by the removal of the cause. OUB 

SCHSMI oy TAXATION, by means of whioh this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be considered that none of these taxes re-, lates to things subjected to internal revenue taxation are strictly speaking necessary, audit so appears to be no just cause of complaint of the consumers of the articles, and there seems to be noth ing so well able to bear the burden with out hardship to any portion of the peo ple. But our present tariff laws, the various, inequitable and illegal source of j unnecessary taxation ought to bo at once revised and amended. These laws, ae their primary and plain effect raise the price to consumers of ail articles im- j ported and subject to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these imported articles. Many of these things however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now lev ied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these horns manu factures, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufac turers, to make these taxed articles and sell them for prices equal to that de manded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens, that while comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people, who never use and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon, into the public treasury, bat the great majority of our citizens who buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least ap proximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws Is not made by way of instruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in whioh they impose a bur den upon those who consume domestic products as well as those who consume imported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively con tinued as the source of the government’s income, and in a readjustment of our tariff the interests of American labor en gaged in manufacture should be carefully considered, as well as the preservation of j our manufactures. It may bo .called " nroteotlon or by any otner name, bat re lief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be devised with especial precaution against imperil ing the existence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard to the public welfare or national exi gency, must always insure the realization of 

IMMENSE PROFITS instead of moderately profitable returns. As the volume and diversity of our na tional activity increases, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuance of the advantages which they conceive the present, system of tariff taxation di rectly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present condi tion been resisted by those of our fehow citizens thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of the suspicion enter tained to a certain extent that there ex •iste an organized combination ail along the line to maintain their advan tage. It is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufactures, result ing from the pres&rt tariff, is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to OUR 

WORKING MEN, employed in manufactories, when they are compared with what is called pauper labor in Enrope. We all acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboricg people. Ail labor is honor able in the eyes of every American citi zen and lies at the foundation of our de velopment. It is entitled without affec tation or hypocrisy to the utmost regard. The standard of onr laborer, life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored and they are entitled to their full share of our advantages. By the last census it is made to appear, that of the 17,392,099 of our population ougngsd in ail kinds of industries 7.670,- 493 are employed in agriculture, 4,074,238 in professional and personal service, 2,499.876 of whom are domestic servants and laborers, while 1,810,256 are em ployed in trade and transportation, and 3,837,112 are classed as employed at man ufacturing and mining. For 4 present purposes, however, the last number given 'should be considerably reduced. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be conceded that there should be deducted from those which it includes. 375,143 carpenters and joiners, 285,170 milliners, dressmakers and seam stresses, 172,126 blacksmiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 107,000 ma sons, 76.241 butchers, 41 Z )9 bakers, 22,182 plasterers, and 4,801 manu facturing agricultural implements, leav ing 262,308 persons employed in manu facturing industries as are claimed to be benefitted by “high tariff.” To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change, and there should bo no dis position to answer such sugges tions by the allegation that they are in a minority among those who labor and therefore should (forego an advantage in the interest of ,lsw prices for the majority. Their com pensation, $s li may be affected by the operations of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view, and yet with slight reflections, they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers with the rest, they too have their own wants and those of their families to sup ply from their earnings and that the prices of the necessaries of life as well as the amount of those wants will regulate the measure of their welfare and com fort. But the 

EEDUOTION OF TAXATION demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman nor the lessening of his wages, and the profits' still remaining to the manufacturer after a necessary readjustment should furnish no excuse for tue sacrifice of the inter ests of his employers in either their op portunity to work or the diminution of their compensation. THH WOSKINGMAN’S NEED. Nor can a worker in manufactures un derstand that while a high tariff is claimsd to be necessary to allow the pay ment of remunerative wages, it certainly results in e, very large increase in tho price of nearly all sorts of manufactures which, in almost countless forms, he needs for tue ute of himself and his family. He receives at the desk of his employer hie wages, and, perhaps, before he reaches hie home, is obliged, in a purchase foi family use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return, in the payment of the increasing price which the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensation of many days of toil. The farmer and the agriculturalist, who manufacture nothing, but who pays the increased pries? which the tariff imposes upon every ag ricultural implement, upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase cf his flocks and herd* and such things as his husbandry produces from the soil is invited to aid in maintaining the present situation. When he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep <o sheer, in order that the price of their wool may be increased, they of course are not reminded that the farmer who has no shaep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchases of clothing and woolen goods, to nay a tribute to his fellow farmers, as well as to the manufacturer and merchants, nor is any mention made of the fact that the sheep owners them selves a v ud their households must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consum ers must return their share of the in creased price to the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large pro portion of the sheep owned by the farm ers throughout the country are found in small flocks numbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty os the grad© of wool which these sheep yield is ten cents on each pound, if of tue value of thirty cents or less, and twelve cents, if of the value of more than thirty cents. If the liberal es timate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be taken as the ultimate enhance ment sf its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent the increas ed price of his wool from twenty-five sheep, and thirty-six dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep; and at present values this addition would amount to about one-third of its sale, the farmer receives this, or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which, in all its changes, will adhere to it until it reaches the consumer, when manufac tured into cloth, and other goods and ma terial for use. Its cost is not only in creased to the extent of the farmer’s tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer, under the opera tion of other tariff laws. In the meantime, the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe him self and family tor the winter. When he faces the tradesman for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged, not only to return in the way of increased prices his tarriff profit on the wool he sold, which then perhaps, lies before him in manu factured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a fur feher increase in cost, caused by a tariff duty on the manufactures. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme, vhich when he sold his wool seemed so profitable an increase in price, more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool rais ing is compared with all the farmers in *ha country, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered; when it is made apparent that in the case of a large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory, and above all, when it mnst be toncedecrl that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means, and the poor, the employed and the un employed, the sick and well, and the yout g and old, and that it constitutes a tax, which with relentless grasp, is fas tened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduo firm of this duty should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. 

INCREASED COST TO OOHSUMEB3. In speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our home man-' ufactures, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact Is not over looked that competition among our do mestic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious *hat this com petition is too often strangled by combi nations quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration in Ihe operation of these selfish schemers. If known in the absence of such combina tion a healthy and free competition re duces the prices of any particular duti able article of home production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under onr tariff laws, and if with such reduced price its manufacture con tinues to thrive it is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxa-, tion. The necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity and that such prices are remunerative, and later prices produced by competition prove tbe same thing. Thus where either of these conditions exist, a case weuld seem to be presented for an easy reduction of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are in tended only to enforce an earnest recog nition that .he surplus revenue of the government be prevented by the reduo-! tion of our customs duties, and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that we are accomplishing this purpose. Wo may discharge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters, where it is most needed, and from sources where it cannot fairly and justly be ac corded. Nor can the presentation made of such consideration be with any degree of fairness regarded as evidence of un friendliness toward our manufacturing interests, or of any lack of appreciation of their value and importance; these interests constitute a leading and moat substantial element of. OUB NATIONAL GBEATNESS, and furnished the proud proof of our country’s progress. But if in the emer gency that presses upon us our manufac turers are asked to surrender something for the public good, and to divert disas ter, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already af foided, should lead them to be willing. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental regard, but they cannot fail to be admon ished of their duty as well as their en lightened self-interest and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that a finan cial panic and collapse, to which the pres ent condition affords no greater pro tection to our manufactures than to our other important enterprises. The opportunity for safe, careful and delib erate reform is now offered, and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those who have received timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radi cal and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The difficulty attending a wise and fair revision of our tariff laws is not under-estimated. It will re quire on the part of the congress great labor and care, and especially a broad and national contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard ol such local and selfish claims as are unreason able and reckless of the welfare of the entire eountry. Under our present laws more than 

FOUB THOUSAND ABTICUES are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own man ufactures, aad many are hardly worth at tention as subjects of revenue. A con siderable reduction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries present no features of hardship, but the necesl sarries of life used and consumed by al the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home should be greatly cheapened, the radi cal reduction of the duties imposed upon raw matgrial used in manufacturers or its free importation is of course an important factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries. It would not only relieve them from the in creased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such products as a compensation to our manufacturers for the present price of raw material, could be accordingly modified. Such reduc tion or free importation would serve be side to largely reduce the rev enue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effects upon our manufacturers On the contrary it would appear to give them a bet*ir chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other coun tries, and cheapen their wares by free matenaL Thus our people might have the opportunity of extending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption, saving them from the depression and in terruption in business and loss caused by a glutted domestic market, and affording heir employes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and con tentment. The question thus imperatively presented for eolation should be approached in a spirit higher than parti sanship, and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty, which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the wealth of a confiding people. Bat the obligation to declared party policy ami principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented in the government have, by repeated and authoritative declarations condemned the condition of the laws which permit the collection from the people of unnecessary revenue, and have in the most solemn manner promis ed us correction, and neither as citizens or partisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will best be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protec tion and free trade. This savors 100 much of bandying epithets. It is a con dition which confronts us not a theory. Relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire withdrawal o: such advan tages should not be contemplated. The question of the free trade is 

INFANT INDUSXBIES. We are in the midst of our centennial celebration, and with becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a century of na tional growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a tax to b laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufac turers quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it suits the pur poses of these manufacturers to main tain that these “infant industries” still need the highest and greatest degree of f avor and care that can be wipng from federal legislation. ABSOLUTELY IBBELETANT, and the persistant claims made in certain quarters that a'l efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecersary tax ation are schemes of so-called free trad ers, is mischievous, and far removed from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economic operation of the government, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in tha treasury through the per version of governmental powers. These things can and should ba done with safety to allow industries without danger to the opportunity of rennmerative labor which our workingmen need and with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsistence and increas ing the measure of their comforts. The constitution provides that the president shall from time to time give the congress information of THE 

STATE OF THE UNION. It has been the custom of the execu tives in compliance with these provisions to annually exhibit to the congress at the opening of its session the general con dition of the country and to detail with some particularity, the opperations of the different executive departments. It would be especially aggreoable to follow this course at the present time and to call attention to the valuable accomplish ments of these departments daring the last fiscal year. But I am so much im pressed with tke paramount importance of the subject to which this communica tion has thus far been devoted that I shall forego the addition of any topic and only urge upon your immediate consid eration the state of the union, as shown in the present condition of onr treasury, and our general fiscal situation, upon which every element of our safety and prosperity depends. The reports of the heads of departments which will be sub mitted, contain full and explicit inform ation touching the transactions of the business intrusted to them, and such rec omendations relating to legislation in the public interest as they deem advisa ble. I ask for these reports and recom mendations, the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the government. There are other sub jects not embraced in the departmental reports demanding legislative considera tion, and which I should be glad to sub mit. Some, however, have been earnest ly presented in previous messages, and, as to them, I beg leave to repeat prior recommendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the department of state, a brief history of the transactions of that important department, together with other matters which it may hereafter bee deemed essential to commend to the attention of the congress, may furnish the occasion for a future communication.
