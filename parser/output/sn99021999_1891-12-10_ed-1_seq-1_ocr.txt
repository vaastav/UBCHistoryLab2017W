Tne prsal- - / dcnt's message wns transmitted to congress ntnooti today. Following is the full text of the document : To the Sonata nnd House of Represen tatives : The reports of the heads of the several executive departments , required by law , to Uo submitted tome mo , which are herewith transmitted , nnd the report of the secretary of the treasury , and the attorney general made directly to congress , furnish u compre hensive review ef Iho administrative work - of the lust fiscal year relating to internal af fairs. It would bo of great advantage if these reports could have an attentive pcru- Ubul by every member of congress , and by all who take an Inleicst In publlo affairs. Such a perusal could no * , full to excite a higher ap preciation of the vast labor and conscientious efforts which are given to the conduct of our civil administration. Tno reports , will , i believe , show that every question has been approached , consideredund decided from the Biiindpolnt of public duty , and upon consid erations affecting the public interests alone. Again , I Invite to every branch of the ser vice the attention aud icruuity of congress. STATK DEl'Alt'CMKST. It * Worlc OufliiK the hist Fiso hl Year Irnr.t'.cx Made , 13to. The work of the state department during the last year has been characterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and by diplomatic results of a notabla aud highly beneficial character. Among those nro the reciprocal trade arrangements which have been concluded in tbo exorcise of the po\vers conferred by section ! ! , of the tariff law , with tbo republic of Brazil , with Spain for Its West India possessions , nnd with San Domlnco. Like negotiations with other countries have been much ad. vanced , and It is hoped that before the closet of the voar further definitive trade arrungo- n.cnts of great value will bo concluded. In view or the reports which had boon re ceived as to the diminution of thu seal herds in the Boring sen , I deemed It wlso to pro pose to her mnjcsty'8 government In Feb ruary last that nn agreement for a closed season should bo made pending the negotia tions for arbitration wnlcb then seemed to bo approaching a favorable conclusion. After much correspondence nnd delays , for which this government wns not responsible , an agreement was readied and bigued on tbo 15th of Juno by which Grout Britain under took , tram that data and until May 1 , IS' ' ) . ' , to prohibit the killing by her subjects of teals in the Boring sea nnd tno government of the United States during tbo same period to en force its existing prohibition against polagio scaling ana to Ilm tbo catch by the fur seal company upon It tbo islands to 75,000 akins. If this agreement could have boon reached earlier , In response to the strenuous en deavors of this government , It would have neon more effective , but coming us Into as It did , It uiiquostlonablyresultod in not greatly diminishing tha destruction of the seals by Canadian sealers. In my last annual incssngo I stated that the basis of arbitration proposed bv her majesty's government for the adjustment of the long pending controversv us to the seal fisheries was not aocoptablo. I am glad now to be able to announce that terms satisfactory to this government have been agreed upon , and that an agreement as to tbo arbitrators Is all that Is necessary to the completion of the convention. In view of the advanced position which this government has taken upon tbo subject of International arbitration , this renewed ex pression ot our adherence to this method for the settlement of disputes , such as have arisen in tha Bering sea , will I doubt not , mcut with the concurrence of congress. Boundary Disputes , Provisions should bo made for a Joint do- maicatlonof tbo frontier line between Can- mi a and the United States whenever required by tbo Increasing border settlements , and es pecially for the ovoot location of the water boundaries In the straits and rivers. I should have been glad to nnnounco somu favorable disposition of the boundary dispute between Great Britain nnd Venezuela. touchIng - Ing the western frontier of British Gulnua , but the friendly efforts of the United States in that direction huvo thus far been unavail ing. This government will continue to express - press Its concern at any appearance of for eign encroachment on territories long under tin ) administrative control of American elates. The determination of a disputed boundary Is easily attainable by umtcablo ar bitration , where the rights of the respective parties rest , as here , on historic facts , readily useurtahmblo. Pleat Inspection. The law of the last congress providing a BVHtoin of Inspection for our moats Intended for export , and clothing the president with power to exclude foreign produce from our market In case the countrv sending them should perpetuate unjust discriminations nifulnst any product of the United States , placed this government lu a position to of- fcoilvoly urzo the removal of such discrimi nations against , our meats. It U gratifying to bo. able to stnto that Ggrminy , Denmatlt , Italy , Austria and Franco , lu the ovdor nnmed , have opened tholr ports to Inspected American pork products. The removal of these restrictions In every Instance wus united for and glvon solely upon tha ground that wo had now provided a meat Inspection that should bo accepted as adequate to I lit complete removal of Iho danger * , real or fan cied , which had been provlotislv urged. The itato department , our ministers abroad , and the ftocrotary of agriculture have co-opo.-atod with uullagglug and intelligent iaal for the accomplishment of this front result. The outlines of nu agroonicnt hava been reached With Germany , looking to equitable trade joucowlous iu conilUorntlpu ot the continued free Importation of her sugars , but the tlmo Lai not yet arrived when this correspondence can bo submitted to congress. lirnzlllnn Tr.iublc * . The recent political disturbances In the re public of Brazil bavo excited regret and solicitude. The Information wo possessed was too moftgro to enable us to form a satis factory Judgment of the causes leading to the temporary assumption of supreme power by President Fonseca ; but this government did not fall to express to him Its anxious solicitude for the peace of Brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institutions which had recently been established there , nor to offer our advice that great moderation should bo observed In tbo clash of parties and the contest for leadership. Theio coun sels were received In tuo most friendly spirit and the latest Information Is that constitu tional government has been ro-cstabllshod without bloodshed. of Italians nt New Orloann. The lynching at Now Orleans In March last of eleven men of Italian nativity by a mob of citizens was a most doplorublo nnd discreditable Incident. It did not , however , have its origin in any general animosity to thc < Italian people , nor In any disrespect to the government of Italy , with whlcn our ro- lullons wrro of the most friendly character. The fury of the mob was directed against these men as tbo supposed participants or accessories of the murder of a city officer. I do not allude to this as mitigating In any do- Itrco this offense against law and humanity , but only us affecting the International ques tions which grew out of It. It WHS repre sented by tha Italian minister that several of these whoso lives had boon taken by the mob were Italian subjects , nnd a demand wns mudo for tha punishment of the participants and for an Indemnity to the families of those who were killed. It Is to be rogrcttcd that the manner In which these claims were presented was cot such its to promote a calm discussion of the questions Involved , but this may well bo at tributed to the excitement and indignation which the crime naturally evoked. The view of tills government as to Its obligations to foreigner * domiciled hcio , were fully stated In the ccrrospondar.ee , as well ns Its purpose to make nu investigation of the affair with a view to determine * whether there were present any circumstances that coulO , under such rules of duty as wo bad Indicated , create nn obligation upon the United States. The tomporarv absence of n minister plenipotentiary at this capital has retarded tbo further correspondence , but It is not doubled that a frlnndly conclusion Is attMiiablc. Some suggestions growing out of this unhappy Incident are worthy the at tention of congress. It would , I believe , bo entirely competent for congress to make olTansos against the treaty-rights of foreign ers domiciled in the United States cognizable in the federal courts. This has not , however - over , been done , nnd the federal oillcers and courts have no power in such cases to Inter vene cither for tho' ' protection of a foreign citi/.en , or for thu punishment of his slayers. It seems to mo to follow In this state of the law that the officers of the state , charged with the police and Judicial powers In such cases must , In the consideration of interna tional questions growing out of such inci dents , bo regarded In such sense as federal agents as to make this government answer able for their acts In cases wboro It would ba answerable If the United States used Its constitutional power to define and punish crime against treaty rights. ' Our KcliitioiiH with Chill. Tno civil war In Chill -which began In January last , was continued , but fortunately with infrequent and not important armed collisions until August 123 , when the congres sional forces landed near Valparaiso , and , after u bloody engagement captured that city. President lialrnaccda nt once recog nized that his cause was lost , nnd a provis ional government was speedily established by the victorious party. Our minister was promptly illrectcd.to recognize nnd put him self In communication with this government so soon as It should have established a do facto character , which was done. During the pendency of this civil contest frequent indirect appeals were made to this government to extend belligerent rights to thu insurgents and to give audience to their representatives. This was declined , aad that policy was pursued throughout , which this government , when wrenched by civil war , so strenuously Insisted upon the part of European nations. The Itata Affair. The Itata , nn armed vessel comma. idoil by a naval officer of tno Insurgent fleet , manned by Its sailors nnd with soldiers on board , was seized under process of tbo United States court ut Sad Diego , Cal. , for n violation of our noutrallty laws. Whllo In the custody of an oflicor of tbo egurt the vessel was forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It would have been Inconsistent with the dig nity nnd self-respect of this government not to bavo Insisted that the Itata should be re turned to Sin Diego to abldo tbo Judgment of tha court. This was so clear to the Junta of the congressional party , established at Iqulquo , that before the arrival of tuo Itata at that port the secretary of foreign relations of tha provisional government addressed Hear Admiral Brown , commanding the United States naval forces , a communication , from which tbo following Is an extract : The nrovIfilonM government has learned by the cublourums of the Associated press that thu transport HaUi. dotiilnud In San Diego by order of tliu United States for taking onboard munitions of war and in possession of the United States marshal , loft the port , carrying on board this olllul'il , who was landed ut u point near the coast , and then continued her voyauo. If this nuwa bo correct , thU govern ment would deplore the conductor the Itatu. and us an ovldenco that It Is not dlsuoscd to support or aureu to the Infraction ot the laws of tno United States , the underlined taltes advnntuKO of the personal relations you have been good unoiuh to maintain with him Hlnco your arrival In thin port , to declare to you that us soon assho Is within reach ot our or ders this govorninunt will put the Itatu. with the arms nnd munitions she look onboard In Hun Dlcio , nt the disposition of the United btUtCH. A trial in tbo district court of tha United States for the northern district of California has recently resulted in a decision- holding , among other things , that , Inasmuch ns tbo congressional party had not been recognized as bolllgorants , the nuts done In Its Inter est could not bo u violation of our neutrality laws. Fiom this Judemcut tbo United States has appealed , not that the condemnation of the vessel Is a matter of Importance , but that wo may know what la the present state of our laws , for , If this construction of tbo statute - ute Is correct , there Is an obvious necessity for revision and amendment. Kflbrts to Bring ; About Ponce. During the progcss of the war In Chill , this government tendered Its good offices to bring about a peaceful adjustment , and it It wus ut one tlmo hoped that a good result might bo reached ; but , In this wo were disappointed. The Instruction to our naval officers aud to our minister ut Santiago , from the first to the last of this struggle , enjoined upon them the most Impartial treatment and absolute nou- Inlorforoncc. I nm satisfied that these In structions were observed and that our repre sentatives were alwnvs watchful to use their Intluonco Impartially in tbo interest of hu manity , and on more than onaoccusion , did so effectively. We could not forgot , however , that this government was In diplomatic relations with the then established government of Chill , as It is now In such relations with the successor of that government , I am quite sura Presi dent Montt , who has , undorclrcunistancos of promise for the peace of Chill , bon Installed us president of that republic , will not doslru that , In the unfortunut event of any revolt against his authority , the policy of this gov ernment should to ) other than that which wo have recently observed , No official complaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval officers during the struggle has been presented to this govern- men"and ; It is a matter of regret that so many of our own people should have given oar to unofficial charges aud complaints , that manifestly had tholr origin lu rival Interests and In a wish to pervert tbo relations of the Untied States with Chill. HlfhtH of Asylum. Thu collupso of the government of Balraa- ccda brought about a condition whlcti Is unfortunately too fumlltar In the history of tbo Central aud South American states.

Notwith standing the fact that the organization of both branches of congress has been perfected In Its main details and the president has been Informed that they uro ready to receive his communications , It still remains for the man- ngors at each end of the capital to supply tbo all-Important parts of tbo legislative ma chinery tbo committees before the wheels can bcglu to revolve nnd the Fifty-second congress can begin to discharge Its proper functions. Already the managers in both branches of congress are struggling with the problem of how to accommodate each aspirant for n com mittee assignment of his personal preference without causing discontent and with duo re gard to public policy. Appropriations Committee. In the senate the only contest likely to bo expected Is ono relating to a committee of minor Importance that on the library where at least Senators Stoekurldgo of Michigan , Dlxou of Hhodo Island and Wol- cott of Colorado are anxious to succeed the late chairman , Senator Evnrts. A struggle h possible , however , over the vacancy on the appropriations committee caused by Sen ator Fnrwell's retirement , Inasmuch as a place on this committee ls of much moro 1m- portanco locally tnan on other committee , as It Is supreme In the inattor of expenditures of the public motioys , but beyond tno foot that the committee will probably go to ono of the far western senators there is no visible determination. Senator Mitchell , who has boon chairman of tbo railroad committee for two terms , ex pects to fill Senator Spoonor's place as chair man of the committee on clajms , nnd ho Is likely to got It without much opposition. Senator McMillan of Michigan will prob ably assume the chairmanship of the com mittee on District of Columbia vacated by Senator Inealls , but this may require him to relinquish bis present chairmanship on the manufacturers committee , which will naturally pass to Senator Quay. Senator Casey of North Dakota Is as good as boouod for 'Senator Mitchell's present po sition as chairman of the committee on rail roads , as ho has had no chairmanship slnco no entered the senate. Possibly Senator Wilson of Iowa , -though a member of several hurdworkcd committees , may oo induced to accept too chairmanship of the committee on education vacated by Senator Blair , as be stands next in .order of promotion , but this will result In his holding two chairmanships , and so , It may reason ably be expected that this ratnor undesira ble place will bo banded over to a now sen ator. Senator Hoar goes , by order .and by pref erence , to the head of the Judiciary com-- mltteo , vice Edmunds , resigned. Senator Teller takes his place as ch.atr.man of the committee on privileges and elections. This places Sanutor Platt In position to take tbo lead.in tUo patcnts.committco. ,  . . . There is some talk of glying Senator Pfeffor n place on the agricultural com mittee. Some politics nro Involved in thin and it may bo that the alliance senator will secure a moro desirable place as a result of the efforts of the republican and democratic managers to keep him on their rcspoctlvo sides. Nobody has undertaken as yet to assign Senator Kyle , the South Dakota nlllanpo sen ator , but thc > expressed views of Mr. Irby , the South Carolina nllmnco senator , have caused htm to bo assigned to the minority representation. Ilotiso Committees. It is said upon good authority that Speaker Crisp hod not up to this morning offered a single committee chairmanship to any mem ber of the bouse , and for that reason reports as to bis intentions are purely speculative and conjectural , based on considerations of geographical location , experience , prominence in special lines of legislation nnd adherence or non-adherence to the late canvass of the now speaker. Though Mr. Crisp has said ho will not punish his opponents , his friends will naturally not bo overlooked. The speaker has , to u few frlonds , outlined the policy which will govern him , so far as individual characteristics of measures will permit , In tlio make-up of committees. Ho will , It Is learned , endeavor to give the west ana north prominence In the membership in the leading committees and avoid , as far a possible , charges of sectionalism. Tha few experienced democrats from north of Mason and Dlxon's Una will , therefore , faro well nt tbo Hands of the speaker , and Mr. Crisp will advance to Important committee places a number of the newer men whoso abilities , it Is believed , will qualify them for the assump tion of important trusts , even though their experience has not boon so great us is usually necessary to secure much coveted committee honors. The committees on rules , enrolled bills , ac counts nnd mileage will bo appointed a * soon us possible.t Wnys nnd Menus Committee. The custom of recent years has made the chairman of the two most important com mittees these on ways and moans and ap propriations tbo party associates of the speaker on the rules committee. Mills is ex pected to bo tendered the chairmanship ot the ways and moans committee on account of his Identification with the tariff reform movement , but personal considerations may Induce him to decline this honor and to pro- fora place as simply a member of the com mittee. Ex-Speaker Hood and Mr. Burrows of Michigan nro named as tbo republican mem bers of the rules committee. In advance of a tender of the place , dofl- nlto Information as to whether or not Mr. Mills would accept tbo ways and means chairmanship cannot bo had , but Mr. Mills , it Is known would prefer not to bo on the rules committee nnd should the custom of coupling the two places bo followed this would Increase the probabilities of a declina tion of both. As Mr. Springer Is a northern man , there Is reason to believe ho U not unlikely to bo Mr. Hill's ' democratic ) successor , nnd Is almost certain of being a member of tbo ways and moans committee , if not the chairman , Mr. Holman of Indiana Is tbo most prominently mentioned representative for the chairmanship of the appropriations committee , out the name of Mr , McMillln ot Tennessee wus today suggested for the honor , nnd asldo from experience , ability , and the knuck of feeling the temper of tbo house , bo has In his favor the fact that two adjoining states ucldom got tbo two most Important chairmanships , and It would bo a graceful thing for the speaker to appoint ono of his principal opponents. Mr , Me- Millln can , of course , stay on tbo ways nnd moans comailueo If ho prefers. But north ern men will dominate these two principal committees. Messrs. Hatch and Bland of Missouri are slated with the chairmanship of the agri cultural and coinage weights nnd measures committees. Amos Cummlngs of New York Is the probable chief of the committee on inarmo and fisheries , and postofllccs will go to Blount of Cloorgta , Its chairman In the Fiftieth congress. - ' a Herbert of Alabama tias n sort of proicrlp tlvo right to the naval nfTdlra committee' , through beinK its former chairman. In which position ho had an Influential part in the up building of the now navy. I < 'orelK Affairs "ommlttoe. Tbo foreign affair * committee will bare lor i : . two of its members Chlpman of Mlchlcan nnd McCroary of Kentucky , wTlHJKOograpnl- cal location In favor of the former as chair man , and longer experience on the sldo of the latter. 't ' Mr. Fitch of Now York will , It U believed , locuro either a chairmanship' ' or 'an almost equally eligible committee place , and may bo the New York member of the ways and moans committee. Mr. Outhwalto ot Ohio In the probable chairman of the Pacific railroads committee , unless ho should prefer elections. Being n Georgian Is the principal point tignlnst Mr. Turner of Georgia , In connection with the chairmanship of the committee on commerce , and either ho or Isadora Raynor of Maryland will flguro'ln this plncn , n mem bership on the ways and moans committee going to the ono losing the chairmanship. Unless WiUon of West Virginia ifooson the ways and means committee , ho will get n chairmanship. Ho has seen scrvlco on the manufacturers committee , but probably pre fers soinu other committee , The public buildings committee will go to the north , very likely , and Forney of Ala bama can look after the militia If ho wants to whllo attending also to the appropriations. Culbortson of Texas and Dates of Alabama are the host qualified for the hoa'd of the Ju diciary committee. The Immigration committee will very likely go to Covert of Now York. The needs of the District of Columbia will bo looked after by Homphill of South Car olina. Andrews of Massachusetts stands the best chance of loading the civil scrvico reform committee. , , . .

Monn & Co.'s wholesale sandy and fancy grocery house , n square above the Boone Paper company's building. The origin of the llro is a mystery. Forty girls were at work on the fourth floor nnd all were not able to escape. The bodies of six girls have already been taken out burned almost beyond identification. G. S.

The flro is supposed to bavo arisen from ono of the candy furnaces , which pos sibly exploded. The flames com municated with a big stock of Christmas fireworks. Tbo first explosion among tbo fireworks scattered flro brands all over the store. The skylight foil in and the ontlro stoclt was" fiercely blazing almost im mediately. The bodies of the girls were removed as soon as possible to the nearest undertaking establishments. Two of the girls have Just been laoutlflcd as Mary Walsh and Amelia Dickey. Great confusion exists.

( Special Tele gram to TUB BuE.J-Tho examination of United States Deputy Marshal F. M , Canton of this city , who was at his own suggestion arrested cm complaint of Al Allison on the charge of killing John A. Tisdalo , a brother of the latter , began yesterday morning at 10 o'clock before Justice C. II. Parmoloo. The arrest of Canton was the sequel to an Inter view which ho had on Saturday with hulf u dozen friends of the murdered man , In the course of which Canton tola them ho under stood they were of the opinion that ho had committed the deed and ho would llko to have a chance to go into court and clear himself of tbo odious charge. The warrant was Issued on Monday morning and shottly thereafter Mr. Canton was taken In churpo by the sheriff nnd kept under official sur veillance till the end of the trial. At the examination the state was represented by County Attorney Alvlu Bunnott , iibslstcd by J Walter \ \ ilson of Sliorldmi county. C. H. Burrltt was counsel for the defense. The court room was crowded with spec tators throughout the trial , conspicuous among the anxious ones being Allison and his friends. The chief witness for the prosecu tion was Charles F. Bi'-seh , a ranchman liv ing sixteen miles from Buffalo , through whom the first intimation of Tisdnlo's fate Touched the authorities at Buffalo. Bajcn tostilted that ho rode within lifty or sixty yards of the mau who did the shooting and ho was posltlvo that ho was riding Canton's horse. The man were a light overco.it and soft felt hat similar to these worn by Canton , but his face was hidden by a mulllcr aim lie could uat swear that ho know him. Basch hoard two shots ilrcd after ho passed the gulch in which the murder was committed and niter wards saw the mur derer rldo rapidly across the country to wards Buffalo. Others tostllled that they had two or three days before the murder soon Canton con versing with Leo Moore , an enemy of Tis- dale's and that the defendant , who Isudltctcd with rheumatism , bad boon out riding on his horse the preceding day. Tbo prosecution had eighteen witnesses , the only material ovldenco boitig that of Basch. For tbo defense , business men of the city stated under oath that they had soon , n.o't and conversed with Canton In Buffalo at various times during the entire period wlien one must have been eight miles from town in order to commit the crime- and a perfect alibi was provon. Tho' rest of tun testimony was submitted at 10 o'clock last hlght and the justice took tbo case under advisement , totting the tune lor the announcement of his decision at 0:30 : this morning. There was llttlo doubt as to what tha de cision would bo in the f coof--tho evidence , and when the Justice announced the acquittal oftho herelidantuo-surpi'.lso.'was-iriautfested. ' ? In the crowded co'urt room. Canton's Iun6- ccnco wa ? established beyond the shadow of doubt. The cowboys who ilockod to Buffalo after news of the trial have at no tlmo made any demonstration of violence nnd after the announcement of tno decision this ruorulnjr they qUotly dispersed. There Is great un easiness among thn alleged cattle rustlers who fear that more of their number uro on the list , nnd It is predicted by those wLo are in a position to know , that recent occurrences will result in an exodus of a large number of the residents of the Powder river country Within the next six months.

OMAHA'S ' BEET SUGAR PLANT , Now York Capitalists Will Ejtablish a Factory in This Oily , INTERESTING POINTS ON THE SUBJECT , Homo ItonnoiiH Why the lUislncs * Uhoitlil Hi'comn an Knoriuoiia Source of llovoiiue to All Concerned. WASHINGTON BUIIKIU OF TUB BBB , ) 813 FOUIITKKNTII STKKKT , V WASHINGTON , I ) . C. , Deo. 0. | Information has Just been received at tha Department of Agriculture that New York capitalists aio to establish beet sugar fac tories nt Springfield , III. , and Omaha. Mr , Tuppor , chief of the sugar bounty division , said today ; "Tho sorghum and beet sugar Industry has now become established and paying nnd capitalists , realizing this fact , Intend to Invest largo sums In establishing factories. It is true that n number of failures nro reported all over the country , but I am certain that those result more from bad management than bad buslnois. 'Tho failure of the Topeka factory certainly was so caused. I nm told there was n woman at the head of this plant. Whether or not sbo had anything to do with the fall * uro , I nm unable to say. The output of the sorghum nnd boot factories nro not tip to the estimate by any means , falling short nbout two-thirds. However , when an estimate was made it was placed at the very top notch , oven before It wns known how much sugar a beet contained. I nm very well satisfied with the showing this Industry has made nnd con skier it n much mora paying business to the farmer thnn raising cereals. Most of the poor boot crops nro duo to the fact that they arc given Insufliciout attention and the wrong seed used. "To mnko beet raising a success it Is nec essary to glvo the boots proper care. They must bo looked after and not planted and tended llko corn. Again , tno only seed that Is used to any oxtontBliccossfully Is Imported. This has been proved by an export employed by the agricultural department. With the national nnd state bounty on boot and sorghum ghum sugar , there Is no reason why It should not bo nn exceedingly prolltablo.liulustry. Interested In the Chilian Affair. Men of affairs and' these In prlvato life who keep closest run of current events , first turned to President Harrison's treatment of the Chilian Incident , when the message was laid before congress this afternoon nnd copies of it distributed nt the capital. The greatest interest wns shown In this , the first official statement of the status of the caso. Tha linn manner in which tbo case throughout wns stated in the message was very Kratifyintr to nil who have the welfare of American citizens uppermost In their hearts nnd in the estimation of almost nil men in congress the president has added another wroatn to his croivn In the effort to elevate the rights of American citizens abroad and command roapoct everywhere for the stars and stripes. Itva ? especially gratifying to congress to learn that the president Intends to depart from the old custom of secrecy nnd send to congress , and thereby glvo to the ontlro country , all of the facts relating to tbo killIng - Ing of American sailors In tno streets of Val paraiso because they wore the uniform of tha United States ; also that ho believed the present status of the case warrants some sort of action on the part of congress. In tbo on tlro treatment of the Chilian affair the president govo oyldonco. of Jils old tlmo de termination maintain 'tbo rights "of out American citizens in foreign lands. War or any hostile stop can only bo taken by direc tion of congress nnd the reference to Chill's attitude Is regarded as significant. Next In Importance hero and that which was quickly turned to was the president's reference to the financial condition of the country and the operation of the MoICinloy law. Many supposed the question so ener getically evaded by the democratic leaders at present , that of free coinage , would be "straddled" or ignored. Ills Views of Free Coinage. Not so In this instance. President Harrison while not evincing a dogmatic disposition earnestly points out the disastrous effect that absolute free coinngo would have upon this country If undortanon before nn Interna tional standard nnd action were effected. There wore these who expected to see the president "fight" oft a fair and square en dorsement of tno tariff law as It stands and hoped to see him point out objections and make suggestions of amendments. On the contrary , his comment on the lav Is full and direct. Tbo president oxprosscs the belief that It Is the best that could have been In vented , taken in connection with reciprocity provisions. Presidential messages huvo here tofore boon largely ravlowa of exclusive de partment work , dealing in figures and stereo typed facts. This evening's Star voices the sentiment of hundreds of statosraon at tha capital today when It says that"while it is long it is packed so full of meaty Interesting matter , edited with nlco discrimination , that It is hard to suirgcst where the cut would bo properly made , " that "it is not a formal rehash of the department reports" and that "tho president has im pressed Ills individuality upon every .sentence. of it nnd the art of putting things effectively of which ho has shown his mastery In the ad mirable condensed speeches which ho has nmda from tlmo to tlmo during bis adminis tration.1 The message is complimented by men In both branches of congress , not alone for Its originality of Idons and now matter but for Its business qualities. It Is on every band taken as an nppoal to tbo Americanism of our citizens and their best sense of Judgment , rattier than their political prejudices. Tha message was attentively listened to by men in all parties wnon read In coneross , and will have an unusual impression upon future log- Islatlon , for It bears upon its facn ovidenca that It was prepared by ono whoalonodoilroa the best for the people.
