The Seventh Annual Message of the President, was submitted on Monday 7th inst., to Congress. It Is a plain business pa'per, in style such as any intelligent busi ness manager might with propriety submit as his annual report to those with the con trol of whose affairs he was intrusted. It only differs from such a report in that it deals with questions of Statecraft instead of more sordid questions of trade ; its superiority and interest lie in the matter more than the maimer. The President, as the Chbf Executive of national affairs, has something to say, through Congress, to the nation, and he says it clearly and pointedly, without evincing any particular regard for the nice requirements of rhetoric. Presi dent Grant writes with the directness with which General Grant fought , he writes to be understood precisely as he fought to be victorious. The Message covers almost every question which has engaged the at tention of the government and country dur ing the year past, and a more exhaustive resume of public affairs has seldom been presented to the country by any of our Presidents. Apart from that, however, it has other claims for popular consideration. Besides detailing with considerable minuteness what has been done, and what is doing by the government, the Message presents several suggestions and recommendations, about some of which opinions will widely differ, and some others of which will be certain to create vehement, if not bitter feelings among the people. Tho President, in concluding, refers in a manner so marked to his early retirement from the Presidential office as to seem to make unecessary and impertin ent any further reference to the lately re newed third-term discussion ; and, indeed, there are portions of the Message likely to provoke so much hostile criticism, and to be so generally unpopular, as to render their author altogether unavailable as a possible future candidate. In them the President lias clinched the nail which he drove home in his speech on the School Question at Des Moines a day or two prior to the Ohio election. The pajKjr bfgins with a well-drawn con trast between the first and the one-hundredth year of the nation's independence. Its earliest and its latest condition is set forth iu terms of excusable exultation. What we were and wc are the President briefly, but clearly shows, and then he goes on to the discussion of the educational ques tion, supporting lib propositions with well considered argument. He demands that education shall be general, compulsory and unsectarian, ami that it alone shall confer the right of suffrage. The earnestness with which he urges and reurges his views upon this matter is likely to create much discus sion, and so also is his recommendation that church property shall be taxed fully as other property. Our foreign relations are declared to be mostly satisfactory ; where they are not so is with Sp:tin, and to the discussion of Spanish and Cuban matters, the President devotes a large portion of his Message. At the present time diplomacy is busy in the endeavor to ctiect an amicable understand ing between the Governments of Washing ton and Madrid ; but thus far diplomacy has not effected all that is desirable, and the President, while declaring as inexpedi ent recognition of the Cuban patriots, or conferring upon them the rights oi belligei ents, or directly interfering in their behalf, savs that he may during the present ses sion make a further and more explicit com munication to Congress, in the shape ot a recommendation as to what is best for this country to do between Spain and her col onv. The President informs Congress that the government long ago offered its services to Spain as a mediator between hersclt and Cuba, but that the otter was courteously declined,, with thanks and an intimation that some future time it might be accept able and accepted. The Message, while not Fpcakiug directly to the point, clearly enough demonstrates why such energy lias recently been displayed at all our naval stations, and why all our available ships are afloat, manned and equipped for any possi ble emergency. As regards the Mexican business, cattle stealing and the like, upon the Piio Grande, the Message merely rc cites what the country already knew. It i3 gratifying to learn that the views of the President upon the character of the Centennial celebration and the propriety of Congress voting it the appropriation asked for by the Commissioners are those sharod by all patriotic and intelligent Americans For a long time it was doulted if the au thorities at Washington recognized the Exi)osition as both national and interna- ..... .. tional, and their lukewarinness about it lea many to infer that the higher authorities were not only luuillerent out inimical to its receiving any help lrom Congress. Upon the subject of resumption the President is as direct and emphatic as it is Iossible for the very hardest money man to be. He is not satisfied with resumption so late as lp, but demands it not later than January, 1877: but his diffidence leads him to say, "I am not prepared to Kay that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the end most heartily commended. Whether or not forced, premature reaump tion "would be a srreat blessing" is at least a mooted question, and one that will bear much further discussion. There are contractionists and expan sionists. hard-money men and paper-money men, but wc doubt if any considerable number of either or any sort are prepared to adopt, as wise, the President a recom mendation to Congress to pass an amena mcnt to the Legal-Tender act, which, after January 1 1S77, will work virtual repudia tion by the government of its own promises to pay. That we may not be thought to strain this matter we print precisely the re commendation and the addenda to it. They are in the words following : There are a few measures which seem to e important in this connection, aud which I commend to your earest consideration. 1 repeal of so much of the Legal Tender act as makes these notes receivable for debts contracted after a date to be fixed in the act itself, say not later than the 1st of Jannan, 1S77. " c should then have quotations at real values, not ficttitious ones. Gold xcould no longer be at a' premium, but currency at a discount, a healthy reaction would set in at once, and with it a desire to make the cur rency equal to what it purports to be. We do not think, that the country is pre pared to go quite that length, even in or der to secure a chance to resume specie payments. The price repudiation would be rather high, and to accept it would be common ruin and common dishonor. The government issued, in its time of sore dis tress, the present greenbacks as money, pledging its sclemn faith and credit for their redemption, and, relying upon that pledge, the people, in patriotic faith, took them as money. For Congress, therefore, to so amend the act which created them as to force them to a discount, or to make them of no more value than that of the paper on which they arc printed, would be to perpe trate a wrong without precedent. In regard to reducing the expense of the government, words contained in live lines of glittering generalities cover the whole subject ; to increasing the revenue many lines are devoted, and a strong recommenda tion to reimposc the obnoxious duty on tea aud coffee, is made. Another recommendation which demands that all merchandise packages shall be ex cluded from the mails, docs not seem to us wise, r.or likely to benefit any one but the express companies, and that at the expense of the people. A summary of the chief recommenda tions of the Message the President himself supplies as a conclusion, as follows : As this will be the last annual 3Iessage which I shall have the honor of transmit ting to Congress belore my successor is chosen I will repeat .or recapitulate the questions which 1 deem of vital importance, which may be legislated upon and settled at this session : First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good school education to every child within her limits Second, jso sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or m part by the State, nation or by the pro ceeds of any tax levied upon any commun ity. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who cannot read aud write from becoming voters after the year 1SU0, disfranchising none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third. Declare Church and State for ever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres, and that all church property shall bear its own propor tion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as pol3Tgamy and the importation of wo men lor illegitimate purposes, lo recur again to the Centennial, year, it would seem as though now, as we are to begin the se cond centennial of national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms. Huh. .knact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency sue has will command the respect of the world. Believing that these views will com mend themselves to the great majority of the right-thinking and patriotic citizens of the United States, I submit the rest to Congress.
