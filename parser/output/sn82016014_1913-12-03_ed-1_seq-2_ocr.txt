Three school boys came from the cut last lummer to earn big wages In, the Kansas harvest field. But In stead of fat wages, they nearly starved to death. Then they stole some cloth ing and groceries from a Mexican, railway camp In Mankato. were ar rested, convicted and sentenced to terms In the Hutchinson reformatory. This morning Governor Hodges gave the boys a pardon when he received petitions signed by every merchant In Mankato. - ' - John QuinUn, Herman Kraus and Clifford Clotsenberg lived in an east ern town. One day they picked up a, newspaper that told of the demand for harvest hands in Kansas. They read the glaring headlines which told how western farmers stopped the trains, dragged people into the wheat fields at the point of a gun. fed them fried chicken and dumplings three times a day and when the wheat was tacked paid the harvesters enough wage to buy an automobile. It all seemed very real to the three school boys who had never seen a harvest field and knew nothing of the Kan sas grain crop. So, that night the three boys boards ed a local freight train bound for Kansas. They arrived In Mankato, the county seat of Jewell county. They were nearly starved to death and began to look up and down the track for the farmers who were clamoring for help. But there were no farmers In sight. No one wanted harvest hands. No one had a kind word for the boys and no one offered them pie and cake and chicken. There wasn't the price of a square meal in the pockets of the lads and they gath ered on the depot platform to talk things over. Then the town marshal told them to move on and threatened to throw them in Jail as suspicious characters if they loitered In their travels. It was after the Interview with the town constabulary that the boys broke into a Mexican hut on. the rail road right of way and stole some clothes and enough groceries to af ford a square meal. The marshal ar rested the boys after their meal. For five and a half months the youngsters stayed in jail waiting for a trial. They were convicted and the district Judge's only course was to sentence them to the reformatory. In the meantime the town had learned the story of the three mis guided youths. They went to the county attorney and the district judge with the facts and these men signed a petition for a pardon. Then all the merchants of the town and all of the tax .payers who could And a place on. the petition for their signatures, at tached their names to the prayer for a pardon. More than 100 people signed the application. - . The petition was received in the governor's office today and the boys were given par dons. But back in the little eastern town where the boys live, there will be no undue haste in future years to come to the Kansas harvest fields. These boys have learned that the Kansas farmer does not look for harvest hands with a shotgun and that the stories of apple dumplings and chick en pie and extravagant wages are not true and next year they will stay away. WILSON FAILED THEM. Snffragists Criticise Omission of Their Cause from Message. Washington, Dec 8. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the Na tional Woman Suffrage association, created a sensation at the night ses sion of the convention, when she de clared President Wilson had fallen short of the greatest opportunity he ever had or ever would have, in fail ing to say a word -In behalf of the woman' suffrage when he read his an nual message to congress. Her re marks provoked loud and prolonged applause. Dr. Shaw said she Had hoped the S resident would' arise to the occasion, ut that while he had recognized the necessity xor tne extension of the bal lot to the Filipinos and urged terri torial voters' rights for Alaska, he had failed to mention woman suffrage in his message. "President Wilson," she continued, "referred in his message to the fact that the time had come for an exten sion of greater social justice, and we women eagerly listened to this. We had hoped that social Justice would Include some measure of political Jus tice to the women of the country. I feel fully the measure of disappoint ment which under the circumstances is natural, for the time had come for the president to say a word in our be half. "We feel that President Wilson has fallen short of the greatest opportun ity which has come to him or ever will come to him. No other president has ever had such an opportunity. President Wilson has had the oppor tunity of speaking a word which might ultimately lead to the en franchisement of a large part of the human family. Even Lincoln, who by a word freed a race, had not this op portunity to release from the bonds one-half of the human family. "I feel that I must make this state ment as broad as it is for the reason that we at Budapest last year realized that ' womankind throughout the world looked to the United States to blaze the way for-the extension of universal suffrage. In every quarter of this globe. President Wilson has missed the one thing that might have made it possible for him to never be forgotten."

Two Men Have Narrow Escape at Oak Hill. Oak Hill. Dec. 8. While grubbing trees on the F. D. Wendt farm, F. E. Wendt and Fred Blake came near meeting death In an explosion of dynamite. A heavy charge had been placed under a large tree. The explosion did not occur as soon as was expected, and so an Investigation was started, Blake probing under ' the tree with a crowbar. He was hurled thirty feet and badly injured and may lose his eyesight. Wendt, who was knocked down but not injured,-carried Blake to a farm house nearby. Later he was taken to Oak Hill and Is receiving treatment here. Both men were within six feet of the explosion, which was so severe that the heavy crowbar, an inch thick, was broken to pieces. TRIBUTE TO WASHBURN Coach Ixrvrman of Aggies Says Blue Great Team. In connection with writing the State Journal about some other mat ters, Coach Lowman of the Aggies has the following to say about the Washburn football team: "The people of Washburn should be prouM of their team. I certainly hand it to that bunch and want to say they have the best team that Washburn has had since I have been at the Agri cultural college. I feel equally proud of my bunch, although we did not win the game. The people who paid to see the Thanksgiving game sure got their money's worth. It was one of the best exhibitions of straight foot ball that I have seen In many days. Both of us resorted to that style of attack in order to wear the other team out. I note that your paper seems to make something of the fact that Hoover was an old' Aggie player. There is nothing in this. Hoover never attended Agricultural college, but Is an ex-Baker man. Am sure Washburn has the right man In Gray." HIS FIRST REPORT. (Continued from rw one.) ready to issue $500,000,000 of emer gency currency under the Aldrich Vreeland act to prevent restriction of credits and to ease any situation. Mr. McAdoo details the treasury s offer to loan to banks of the country money to move the fall crops. The sum of $46,500,000 out of $50,000,000 estimated to be needed was appor tioned among the states. "It was essential," says the secre tary, "that the action of the depart ment be non-partisan and non-political; the crops of Republicans, Demo crats and Progressives, and all other classes of people had to be moved, and the earnest effort of the depart ment was to have the benefits of this action diffused as widely and impar tially as possible." The New Tariff law. ; Of the new tariff act Secretary Mc Adoo says it has not been in force a sufficient length of time to make pos sible an accurate estimate of it Ulti mate revenue- nroducing powers. He asks congress to impose a nominal tax of 1 per cent proor gallon on a alcohol withdrawn for denaturation and legislation requiring every dealer in leaf tobacco to make an inventory of stock January 1 of each year and make a report of his transactions quar terly or monthly, and that every dealer be required to give oona. The present oleomargarine law is de clared to be unsatisfactory and the government is said to lose more taxes from illicit practices in oleomargarine than through moonshine stills. The difference in the tax on colored and uncolored "oleo" is held responsible for the loss and congress is asked to im pose a flat nominal tax without any difference for color with provision for individual stamped or original packages of certain- sixes adequately marked and safeguarded. The law governing the ale of adulterated batter is declared to have brought about unfortunate conditions through the difficulty of its Just enforcement. His. Recommendations. Among his principal recommendations to congress the secretary placed the following: Enlargement of the public health ser vice and a closer co-operation with state authorities to prevent and stamp out epidemics of disease. Building of four revenue cutters, for need of which the secretary points out, the service is seriously crippled. Consolidation of the revenue cutter and life-saving services into one or ganisation to be known as the coast guard. Such a consolidation, the secre tary says, would increase the efficiency of each service with the idea that the new coast guard should become a first naval reserve in time of war. The in crease in cost would be about $400,000. In that connection the secretary also recommends passage of legislation for the retirement of life-savers on pen sion, and declares that unless some such measure is made law, the efficiency of the service will be impaired and it will become increasingly difficult to ob tain good men. He gives point to his argument by showing that the revenue cutter and life-saving services saved 4.423 lives In 1913 and salvaged property woth more than $16,000,000. . Establishment of revenue cutter headquarters at Louisville or Cincin nati, at .St. Louis or some other point on the upper Mississippi and at Hel ena, Ark or Vlcksburg, Miss., is urged as a measure for the saving of live in the floods time in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Three light draught cutters to cost about $80,000 each are recommended. With the rivers at normal stage they would be used in patrol to enforce the naviga tion and motor boat laws. Tax on the Banks. The report refers to the require ment that banks which hold govern ment deposits made April SO, 191$, pay interest at two per cent, declar ing that it means an annual revenue' of $2,000,000 to the government and showing that if such a regulation had been made in 1897 the government would now have received in interest more than $80,000,400. The income tax is not dwelt upon at length, but the report estimates that 425,000 individuals are subject to it and that corporations not heretofore subject to .tax will number about : 150,000. Speaking of scientific research fav the public health service the report says: On account Of the announeementa of discoveries of alleged cures for tu berculosis and their bearing on public health, important Investigations of them have been undertaken. Studies of the Friedmann treatment were sufficiently advanced by May 16, 1918, to justify a report that the observa tions made up to that time did not warrant the confidence In the remedy which had been Inspired by wide spread publicity. This investigation is being continued, as are also studies of other . preparations claimed as cures." Secretary McAdoo estimates that the revenues for the fiscal year exclusive of iwsioince receipts win De 3728,000,000, only $8,000,000 less than the estimates for the fiscal year 1914. To make that total he expects the customs to bring in $249,000,000, ordinary internal revenue $315,000,000 and the income tax $105,000. 000, of which $40,000,000 is to come from corporations, the remainder from indi viduals. From sales of public lands he exnects to cover into the treasury $3,000,000 and irom miscellaneous sources $56,000,000. He expresses the belief that the ordi nary receipts for 1915 will exceed the disbursements sufficiently to pay out about $26,000,000 from the treasury gen eral fund for the Panama canaL FLY TO

He thereby gives testimony of his bad faith towards things Mexican." - " The Imparcial says: "From a good source it is known that some of the foreign ministers accredited to Wash ington criticise the message severely. They say it would be impossible to guarantee the re-establishment of peace and good government in Mexico if Provisional President Huerta, whose vigorous efforts at the pacification of tne country are well known, should leave the presidency." What Wilson Meant. Washington, Dec 3. The flight of Huerta's generals in northern Mexico, federal evacuation of Chihuahua and Ouaymas and the refusal of Mexican oil companies to furnish fuel for movement of federal troop trains were pointed out by officials here to day as such events to which President Wilson referred In his message to congress yesterday when he declared the Huerta regime was crumbling-"by a iitue every aay." Flght Near the Capital. Mexico City, Dec 3. A sharp fight occurred today near the federal capital between a small detachment of rural guards who were caught in ambush by a body of followers of Emilliano Za pata. The rurales returned the fire of the rebels for twenty minutes, during which the rebels -are said to have fled. The casualties of both parties number ten dead and thirty wounded.

MERCHANTS WANT KENNEDY. Lawrence Students and Alumni Start ing Something. Lawrence, Kan.. Dec 3. The mer chants - of Lawrence plan to start a petition for the return of Bert Ken nedy to K. U. .football. This petition is said to be a forerunner of one that the students' will circulate soon. The coaching situation at the university Is in an awful muddle. Chancellor Frank Strong, in opposition to the general sentiment of the students and alumni, -declared for Mosse and stated that the present head coach should be retained and be allowed to pick his own assistant.'' Coach Kennedy's record with the Haskell Indians this season was re markable from many angles. His team piled up a total score of 419 against 31 for their opponents. This is a bigger score than any team in the country made. The highest score made in any one game was 101 against Mid land college. The last three games of the season were played within ten days and only fourteen men were used, showing the excellent condition of the players. The Indian players proved to be the best exponents of the open style play of any gridiron warriors In the valley. At times during the season the team used the Minnesota shift play with success. Kennedy had his men train ed in the fundamentals of football that they were experts in every phase of the game. There is a strong sentiment at the university for the return of Kennedy. The students believe that the popular mentor is the logical man to head the coaching staff of the school. Already it is rumored that raosse in tends to name Jay Bond, this year's freshman coach, as his assistant for next year. HAS
