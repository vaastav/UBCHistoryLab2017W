The message of the President of the United States, which, we published in full in Tuesday's Hekald, although Borne what exceeding in length former messages, Is an able, comprehensive, ' business-like document. lie has no new or startling theories to advance or advo cate, but lays before Congress and the country, In appropriate language, the existing condition of affairs, coupled with such recommendations, as seem to him proper, for the more efficient carry ing out of the policy of the administra tion and the general progress and pros perity of the country. He congratulates Congress on . the results of the Geneva arbitration and Euggesta the creation of a board of commissioners to exaro'T- he several claims that may be present for the Indemnity fund awarded by that tribunal; so that 'when . the award, is paid, at the end of the year, Congress may be prepared to act intelligently In the matter. This, it seems to us, is a very timely and necessary recommenda tion. Of course, Congress itself cannot, as a body, investigate the justice, equity or legality of the large class of claims that will undoubtedly be presented. They must be examined, and some meth od of proof adopted for their verification, and this can properly be accomplished only through the Court of Claims or by a special tribunal or commission.. The nature of the claims, the almost uniform policy of the country, as well as the al ready great pressure of business before the Court of Claims, seems to render the latter course preferable. The settlement of the San Juan ques tion is detailed at some length, and the announcement made that the "joint military occupation" of these islands has ceased, and that the United States is now In the sole and exclusive possession thereof. The award of the Emperor of Germany, on this question, leaves us for the first time in the history of the Unit ed States as a nation, without a question of disputed boundary between our terri tory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is recommended that the survey of the line, thus estab lished, be at once entered upon, that commissioners bo appointed for that purpose, and that the line be marked by natural objects, or monuments, so that hereafter, disputes may be avoided be tween the, two countries, as to its loca tion. He also, in view of the future settlement of the northwest,proposeB the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminous possessions of Great Britain. In reference to our relations with other foreign powers, the Prssidcnt says "with France, our earliest aliy, Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United States, Germany, with whose govern ment and people we have so many causes of friendship, and the other powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms." Treaties have been concluded with the Austro- riungarian empire, and Sweeden and Norway, on the subject of naturaliza tion, and with the German empire on trade marks, etc. The International Statistical Congress is" alluded to, with the recommendation that suitable appro priations and power be granted, by Con gress, so that American inventors and manufacturers may avail themselves of the opportunity for exhibiting their pro ductions at the Exposition in Vienna, in 1873, it being the first exhibition of that Congress in Eastern Europe. Our rela tions with Mexico are friendly, notwith standing the troubles on the Texan bor ler, which are ascribed to the revolu- tionary condition of Mexico, and not to the ill will of her people or government. The government of Mexico, and the public press of that country, has shown every disposition to repress these out rages, and the President believes that our government will receive their hearty co-operation to that end. In Cuba, the condition of affairs re main unchanged, there having been no advance towards the pacification of the insurgents, while the insurrection has jained no advantage and exhibits no additional prospects of ultimate success, neither has Spain succeeded in repressing the rebellion. The President justly re marks thnt there can be no doubt that the continued maintenanne of slavery In Cuba is one of the strongest induce ments to the continuance of the strife, A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms. in the administration of the government in Cnba, could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. The fee ble step towards emancipation, contained injtbe law of 1870, has not resulted in anything, and there has, in fact, been no attempt to enforce the law. In refer ence to American citizens holding slaves In Cuba, the President says: "Deeply impressed with the conviction that Jthe continuance of slavery as one of the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as property, but which is for bidden and denounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus, in den ance of the spirit of our laws, contrib uting to the continuance of this distres sins and sickening contest. In my last annual mcpsage I referred to this subject and I npnin rfoomnicrid such legislation as may be proper to denounce raid, if not prevent, at least to discourage Amer- lean citizens from holding or dealing in slaves." After referring to the condition of the South American States, he states that Venesuela lias made no further payment on the award," under the convention of 1830. Our relations with Japan are un changed, but it is hoped that arrange ments may soon be perfected for placing ua on the same footing with other loreign powers. The attention of Congress is called to tin fact, that, under existing law?, no provision i3 made for the relief of sick and destitute citizens of the United States temporarily in foreign countries, appropriate legislation upon this subject Is recommended, as, at present, persons ' In this situation must perish, cast them salves upon the charity of foreign gov. ernments, or bo relieved at the private charge ofour own officers, who usually, pven with the moFt benevolent cnsposi. tion, have nothing to spare for such purposeF. The several departmental reports are referred to and summarized. They demonstrate the prosperous condition of the country in all branches and depart ments, the gradual reduction of the pub ic debt, and a decrease in the burdens of taxation. It is not necessary to speak of this branch of the message, in de tail, but we cannot forbear quoting the 'resident's language on the subjects of internal revenue and currency. "It is very doubtful, however, whether any farther reduction of so vexatious a burth en upon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure of justice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, 1 would recommend that no more legisla tion be had on this subject, unless it be to correct errors of omission or commis sion in the present laws, until a sufficient time . has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the current expenses of the gov ernment, pay interest on the public debt and provide for the sinking fund estab lished by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the highest import ance. . Next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to provide a national cur rency of fixed, unvarying value, as com pared with gold, and, so soon as practi cable, having due regard for the interests of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade, convertible into gold at par." The ' subjects of cheaper transporta tion from the Mississippi to the Atlantic ; the postal telegraph, ocean steamship lines, a new census in 1875, education, etc., are urged upon the attention of Congress. To some, if not all, of these subjects, we shall refer at length, hereafter and, therefore forbear com ment at the present time. Upon "Civil Service Reform," the message contains nothing new, but commends the subject to the ( attention of Congress, for their action.; Other matters are treated of, but we have presented the principal points, and repeat, what we stated at the outset, that the message is an able, comprehensive, business-like document, and is worthy of the careful attention and perusal of all. Tns . Credit Mobilise. The Wash ington correspondent of the New York Times writes that the decided sensation in the House, Monday, was when Mr. Speaker Blaine,' descending from the chair, and placing Mr. S. S. Cox in it, took his position on the floor near where he sat before he became presiding officer. The movement riveted every eye, but comparatively few suspected what was coming. With great dignity and equal positiveness the speaker stated the case of the Credit Mobilier slanders, and ex pressed his purpose to demand a prompt and searching investigation, recapitulat ing the grave charges and the eminent names inculpated. The attention of the House and galleries became concentrated upon the speaker and his utterances, and when he moved the special committee of five, with the condition that it should be composed of a majority of his political opponents, one could almost hear the murmur of approbation which ran through the hearts of the listeners. Peo ple were surprised, but they approved the. purpose. Mr. Archer, of Maryland, a Democrat, however, hoped the investi gation would not take place, because the people had passed a verdict of condem nation upon these slanders at the polls, Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, was in favor of the investigation, as was also Mr. Dawes, who pungently remarked that having always been in favor of the widest latitude of investigation in regard to others, he did not propose now to shrink from it himself. Mr. llolman was also for it, and the resolution then passed with but one dissenting vote- Mr. Archer's. After some lit,tle delay, Mr. Cox appointed Judge- Poland of Vermont, Gen. Banks of Massachusetts, Mr. Beck of Kentucky, Judge Niblack of Indiana, and Mr. Creary of Iowa a committee which will be recognized as composed of men abundantly able and willing to probe the matter to the hot torn. Resignation of Jfdgk Nelson. The resignation of Justice Nelson of the United, States Supreme Court was re ceived , by the President Monday. Judge Nelson retires from the bench af ter twenty-seven years' service in his present position and forty in State and federal courts. Several names are sug gested for the vacancy, and it seems generally conceded that the appointment will go either to New York or the South. Judge Woodruff and ex-Judge Johnson of New York are understood to be will ing to take the place, while, if the selec tion should fall upon the southern States, ex-Solicitor General Jlristow is the most favorably regarded candidate from that section. It is believed the appointment Would be acceptable to the ether members of the court, and it is ad vocated by many prominent members of the bar. General Bristow is in Washing ton and would exchange his recently as sumed position for a seat on the supreme bench. Senator Conkling and Pool are ineligible until the expiration of their present terms. Judge Nelson retires on full pay for the remainder of his life. Congress. We give the following brief summary of the proceedings of Congress on Monday, our telegraphic re port, owing to the storm and the Presi dent's message, being somewhat imper fect. In the Senate, Mr. Machin of Kentucky took Garrett Davis's seat Several bills were introduced, one by Mr, Wilson to allow a drawback on duties on materials imported at Boston to be used for rebuilding in the burnt district,, and another by Mr. Sunnier to strike from United States regimental fiags the names of battles of the rebellion. In the House of Representatives, General Banks ten dered his resignation as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, but the House refused to accept it." . Speaker. Blaine took the floor and offered a reso lution for a special committee toinvesti gate the Credit Mobilier charges. After some discussion the resolution was adopt ed, almost unanimously. Messrs. Twich ell and Butler of Massachusetts offered bills for the relief of Boston, substanti ally the same as that introduced in the Senate by Mr. Wilson. Resolutions on the death of Horace Greeley were adopted. Greeley's Wealth. It is the general impression among the villagers at Chap paqua that Mr. Greeley's farm and dwellings at that place will pass under the hammer . when his estate is settled. It belonged to Mrs. Greeley and she will ed it to her two daughters. It is under stood that the latter will never eccupy it again. The farmers in the vicinity say that Mr. Greeley spent between $60, 000 and 170,000 upon it in improvements. t has three dwellings on it. Mr. Gree ley enlarged his farm some time ago by the purchase or seventy acres ox wood land from Mr.J Haight. - His entire for tune is estimated by one of his intimate f riemls to he less than &100.000. but it is thought by some that it will exceed this figure. He made a will in 18oj, out n is understood that a new one has lately been drawn uri bv a Westchester county lawyer, in which the bulk of his fortune is left to his orphaned cnuaren, wun a few small bequests to tnenas ana dis tant rplativps. The iron. R. B. Roose velt suggests that the money toward erecting a monument be given 10 nis children. Kew York Sun. ' Vermont's Electoral Vote. The electoral vote of Vermont will be given to-day, for the twenty-first time. I he first presidential' election, in which Ver mont participated, was in 1792, when she gave . three votes for. George v ash inrton and John Adams. We were en titled to four votes, but one of the Elec tors was unable, from sickness, to attend and. the there being no provision for fill ing vacancies, only three votes were re turned, r . In 179G the four votes of, Vermont were for John , Adams and Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina. In 1800 John Adams and 'Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, received our four votes, and at the sub sequent elections, the votes of V ermont were given as below : ' 1804 Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton of New York, six votes. 1808 James Madison and John Lang- don of New Hampshire, six votes. 1812. James Madison and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, eight votes. 1810 and 1820 James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins of New York, eight votes. 1824 John Quincy Adams and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, seven votes. 1828 John Quincy Adams and Rich ard Rush of Pennsylvania, seven votes. 1832 William Wirt and Amos Ell- maker of Pennsylvania (anti-masonic) seven votes. 1836 William Henry Harrisou and Francis Granger of New York, seven votes. 1840 William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, seven 'votes. 1844 Henry Clay and Theodore i re- linghuysen of New Jersey, six votes. 1848 Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore, six votes. 1852 Winfield Scott and William A. Graham of North Carolina, five votes. 185G John Charles Fremont and William L. Dayton of New Jersey, five votes. 1860 Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, five votes. 18G4 Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, five votes. 1868 Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, five votes. 1872 Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Wilsou of Massachusetts, five votes. From the above it will be seen that Vermont cast her vote thirteen times, and once (1832) she stood "solitary and alone." Reported for Thk IIrhald. Senior Exhibition of OTiddlcbury College.

Editw Rutland Ilerilkl : We are most heartily glad to see some reference to our common school system from the Legislature ; for ouly a glance will suf fice to see that we are in a most deplor able condition. The grade of scholar ship is miserably low, and growing no better but worse day by day. There is little interest to gather the pittance of intellectual pabulum offered. There may be few in the State who cannot read, but how few who can read well, and it would almost startle us if we knew how little district scholars know above and beyond mere common read ing. 1 am inclined to believe, from con siderable observation, that children in out districts are learning less of all the fundamental branches than twenty years ago. In arithmetic, they are exceptions who have anything more than a good knowledge of the four simple rules ; and wo may say none learn to read well. Some are frightened from school from the expense attending the purchase of books, and with some reason. For look at the series of readers, five different books, and a frequent change at that. Three or four different arithmetics and as many geographies. We presume to say that in such schools one kind of reader may be planned so as to serve the whole school, the spelling book including the elementary lessons. It is quite forgotten that scholars are Jearning to read from their readers and not gath ering a bit of historical knowledge or being pleased by a story. They are there to learn to read. A book of twen ty pages would suffice Professor Russell for years ia training his pupils in read ing. As to arithmetics we guarantee that few who have "been through," not to say mastered Greenleafs university edi tion, are equal mathematicians to those who have mastered old Colburn's arith metic, and the latter begins simple enough for the youngest. We can con ceive of a geography too, which may suffice for all classes in this branch. We consider this flood of books a detriment to the district system, It draws unnec essarily upon the poor man's purse, to fill that of the book sellers. Of course, good teachers cannot afford to teach these schools. Districts cannot pay such, and examiners are tried and often blam ed for leniency they cannot avoid, ex cept by closing the school houses. Hence it is, that about one-third of the schools teach more boorishness and sauciness than anything else, and are a curse rath er than a blessing. Some new system is imperatively demanded in these dis tricts repleted by three-fourths of the number twenty years ago. Parents wha would educate cannot now do so. Here is work, and a wide field for the wisdom of our State superintendent ; but where is he ? The low intellectual grade is telling upon the general interest in ed ucation. Something should be done and done at once. Cannot the State wake us up, and suggest some way out of this difficulty?, , , . , , t;U H. Out of Town Notes. .' .. . 

CASTLETOJT. ' S. M. Dorr, of Rutland, ; advertised in The Herald, lately, his grist mill and the property, in this village, for sale or exchange for a farm ; the result is that Mr. Dorr has exchanged the pro perty for the farm and stocks of Mr. L. L. Bardwell, situated in the northeast part of Poultney. It is the stock and dairy farm formerly owned and occu pied, for many years, by H. Armstrong of this town. . ' . . , Mr. and Mrs. W. N. Bachelder ar rived in town last week, from Colorado. Bachelder is doing a paying business in the wool and sheep interest, several first premiums having been awarded him at the fair of the Colorado Agricultural So ciety, this fall, for the best grades of sheep and wool. , t The father of the ' Hon. William Pitt Kellogg, the governor elect of Louisania, was a native Castleton. His studies preparatory to entering the' min istry were persued at the Rutland Coun ty Grammar School at an early day. Daniel Dewey, whose sudden death at Flint, Mich., was recently chronicled in The Herald, passed most of his boy hood davs m Uastleton. His lather, !i B. Dewey, was the first landlord of the old Mansion House, and was an exten sive stage proprietor previous to A. W. & P. W. Hyde. . Painful tidings of the death of A, W. Briggs of Colorado, was received by his parents here last week. He was three years a student in the Seminary under Mr. Hallock, and was an, only child of aged parents. Mr. C. Swain, formerly of Castle ton, but now of Rutland, has been buying and shipping potatoes by the thousand if not by the million of bushels, to Bos ton. He has bought in Pittsford, Fair haven, Poultney and Castleton, and is styled the potato King. The' old one-eyed grey horse of our village was quickly dispatched by the cruel locomotive, one day last week. He went on the railroad track, and thereby forfeited his life. Rev. Mr. Safford of Burlington, occupied the pulpit for Mr. Francis on Sunday of last week, preaching a most excellent sermon from the words, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to-day and forever." It seemed to be a fitting subject to present before reading an un welcome communication, from Mr. Francis, tending his resignation as pas tor of this church. The society was invited to meet Mr. Francis at the cha pel Tuesday afternoon to take action in the matter. b. w. b. 

MIDDDEBVRY. A Thanksgiving ball was held in the armory in our village on the even ing of the 28th inst. About 30 couple were present, and a "free time" was ex perienced by the happy party. Dancing was kept until the small hours of the morning. Addison County Court commences its session Tuesday, December 10th. His Honor, Judge Pierpoint, presiding. I am glad to note the fact that only one criminal is confined in our jail. The general docket for the County Court is not very large. This is highly encour aging to all but the lawyers. Pursuant to arrangement there was held in the M. E. Church Thanksgiving day a " Union Meeting" of the Congre gational and Methodist Episcopal churches and congregations. A large audience was present. The discourse whs delivered by A. F. Bailey and a very able one too. The topics treated upon, were handled with great skill and mark ed power. He pictured in vivid colois the degeneracy of the age. He spoke of the lack of moral and political honesty, the insane seeking after wealth and of fice, and the great lack of moral stamina in the church and world to stay the tide of evil that is surging through our coun try and world. What he said was no doubt too true, but I thought that al though there was much sin and wrong in the world, and that there was a great want of moral courage to stem the tide of eil that was urged on by bad men, yet there w as much good in our land, that there were thousands of good men and women who have never bowed the knee to Baal and never will, that our country was progressing in intelli gence and virtue, not as rapid it is true, as we could wish, 3ret making progress ; that the age was marked by the advent of heroic christian men and women, and that amid all the horror that prevails, there is much joy and happiness. I know that the war of truth and virtue against sin and wrong will go on. In that I want it should, until truth tri umphs over error and right over wrong and the world be handed over to the Savior, for his peaceful kingdom and righteous reign. So while we view the dark shade, let us remember that there are silver linings to all dark clouds, and that humanity has many bright fea tures. 1 would not discourage christian effort. If we are led to believe the world is growing worse and worse, notwithstanding all the mighty efforts put forth to make it better, there is cer tainly poor encouragement to labor on. For one, I believe truth is going for ward. Good people are pressing the hosts of satan hard. Iniquity abounds I am aware. So docs grace abound, and it is to abound still more and more. But with all my criticism the sermon of Mr. Bailey was a very able one. But I wished he had given the bright side of humanity as well as the dark side, as I think the effect would have been soul inspiring upon his audience. Candor. LUDLOW. G. L. Fletcher of Chester, delivered a temperance lecture in Ludlow Hall, Sabbath evening, Dec. 1st. He dwelt largely .upon- the adulteration of liquors and their baneful effects upon soul and body, and gave us statistics of liquor merchants and consumers worthy of the consideration of every community. Such instances and appropriate addresses will doubtless do ?ood. On Thanksgiving day union servi ces were held at - the Baptist house. The pastor preached to a respectable au dience, from Psalms 136 : 1. Religious services should be more generally attend ed on Thanksgiving and Fast days, in accordance with the recommendation of our worthy chief magistrates and in harmony with the divine economy. There was a general renewal of mutual friendship, I should judge, and as usual, the inevitable turkey enhanced the pleas ures of the day. Kind friends remem bered your correspondent with substan tial expressions of regard, rendering the home circle pleasant, for which they will receive our thanks. Winter has come in good earnest. A foot of snow has recently fallen aad as fast as the horses recover we may expect it will be well improved. Then " Ring, ring, merry bells." Another entertainment in the Lyce um course was given in Hammond Hall, Monday eve, Dec. 2d. Dr. J. Hazard Hartzell, of Albany, N. Y., delivered his lecture on the "Door of Opportuni ty." The next will be the Heme Con fort, Monday eve, Dec. 16. Blind Heine, the violinist, and Ida Heme, a London pianist, with other artists, are announced to be present. It is expected that "New Years' eve," a cantata in three parts by XL Schoellir, will be given in Hammond HalL Monday eve, Dec. 9th, by Miss HattieM. Smith of this place, assisted by thirty-four of our young friends. It promises success. itjx. - - 4 r " FAIR HAVEN. ' ' - - j Thanksgiving in this place has been an unusually pleasant one, s especially to some families of the laboring class. The workmen employed in the marble mill j of J. Adams & Sons, were ach the re cipient of a fat turkey, and by this lit tle act of kindness, many hearts were made glad, and to them the day was lit erally one of enjoyment and thanksgiv ing. By doing likewise, - other firms would be surprised to know how little it takes to make a poor man glad. To Messrs. J. Adams & Sons are due the thanks and best wishes" of their Many Workmen. November 29, 1872. ' . , - CHESTER. ' ' . The holidays are coming, and with them many anticipated joys. Friendly reunions will occur, and tokens of affec tion will be freely exchanged. A pleas ing custom, truly, and one that serves to bind still stronger the ties of love and friendship. , Happy days may they prove to, all. ,: . . The newspaper scriblers at Wash ington are already assigning eminent politicians to important positions in the new cabinet. But we doubt whether the President has unsealed the precious parcel he has so long kept closed, and given, even correspondents, a sight of its contents, ji : , , , Building operations in this town during the past season have been quite limited in extent. The dwelling' house of Lauren A. Bolles, on Depot street, is rapidly draw ing to completion, and the owner will occupy the same in a short time. Mr. Warner, formerly of Ludlow, now in the employ of Cram & Smith, has a dwelling house well under way, on First avenue, and when completed, this house and its surroundings, will form one of the most desirable locations in town. Friday evening, Nov. 22d, a kero sene lamp was accidentally overturned bv an inmate of the house of Georga P. Heald, on Bridge street. The oil caught fire, and in a few moments the whole room was enveloped in a sheet of flame. But for the presence of mind of Mrs. Heald, a serious accident would have oc curred. In the room there were several small children. Mrs. n., in a shorter time than it takes to write the fact, con ducted them to a- place of safet)', and then seizing a large bed quilt, threw it over the flames and smothered the same, thus preventing the destruction of her house by hrc. v idex. 

T1C05DEU0GA. Mr. Carlos Bugbee has sold his farm to Roger Delano for $15,500. Mr. Hiram Kimpton is just recover ing from an injury received at the hands or rather feet of a vicious horse. , There have lately been held in town a horse suit and a suit for assault and batter', but for prudential reasons I forego the pleasure of giving an account thereof in detail. Mr. Rosrcr Delano has sold his farm to C. II. Delano and Geo. C. Weed for $10,000. The board of education has secured the services of Mr. W. B. Davidson, of Steuben county, as principal of th Union Free School. Look out for a horse trot as soon as the ice in the lake becomes sufficiently stronsr. Zero. Safe Robbery. Ou Thursday of last week, the safe of Frank Felt, one of- the proprietors of the steam mills, at "Si monsville;" in the town of Andover, was broken open and robbed of one hua dred and fifty dollars. On that day Mr. Felt and his wife visited Chester, leaving their house in charge of one of his em ployes, by the name of Jay Davis, who is about twenty years of age. Soon af ter returning home, Mr. F. had occasion to go to his safe, and upon examining its coutents, discovered that the money had been abstracted. Suspicion at once rested upon Davis, and on searching for him it was found that he had fled with his ill gotten gains. Constable G. P Spaulding, of Chester, was immediately notified and started in pursuit of Davis, and overhauled him in Clarendon. The criminal was searched, and one hundred and eighteen dollars of the missing funds found upon his person, the balance hav ing been expended for clothing in Rut land and Ludlow. The officer visited the parties who sold the clothing to Da vis, and returned the articles purchased by him and the money paid for the same wras refunded, and it will now find its way back to the rightful owner. A little even handed justice dealt out to this person will doubtless do him an in estimable amount of good. Crime is wonderfully on the increase, and justice demands that transgressors be punished to the fullest extent of the law. The iron hand of the law is encased in a vel vet glove and it is high time that crim inals of all grades are made to realize the fact that sometimes the velvet is ex ceedingly thin. Thk Electoral Vote. The Electors of President and Vice-Presidents Mill cast their votes to-day. The five votes of Vermont will be given, of course, for Ulysses S. Grant for President and Ileury Wilson for Vice-President. The last statement, apparently well founded, in reference to the action of "Greeley Electors" is that they will cast a blank vote for President. The result of such action would be the unanimous re-election of General Grant, he receiving the entire electoral vote cast. We were in hopes that the advice of the Brooklyn Eagle and other leading democratic newspapers, would be followed, and that their votes, under the circum stances, would be given to Gen. Grant, thus ushering in the era of good feeling, the signs of which, in the near future, are so propitious. A Great Teleraihic Feat. The President's message was sent specially to The Ri tland Herald (no other pa per in Vermont or northern Xew Eng land taking i') from the Boston office. The operator at Bos' on va (Miarh-s IL Finch, and the r reiver at Rutland was Alfred B. Connor. The message con tained 11.83-1 words, just seven hours was consumed in taking, being an aver age of twenty-seven words a minute. Important Decision. The case of State vs.- Baldwin, heard at the last January term of our Supreme Court, has just been decided. This was a com. plaint against the respondent, who res ides in South Burlington, for peddling meat in the streets of the city during market hours, in violation of the city ordinance establishing a market. The Supreme Court held the ordinance valid, affirmed the judgment of the City Court and fined the respondent five dollars and cost. This decision is of. great practical importance to the village of Rutland, as well as to every incorporated village or city in the State, affirming, as it does in effect, the right of Cities and villages to regulate peddling, etc., within their cor por at 3 limits, and, undoubtedly, estab lishing their authority, generally, over all matters of police regulation. Fire in Bejtsox. A large barn owned by D. L. Osgood, of Benson, and situat ed about half a mile from bis residence, and not exposed to fire, .was burned Monday evening, November 25th, with its contents, consisting of thirty-eight tons of hay and a fanning mill." There was, also, therein stored thirty barrels of Bradley's Phosphate, fa commercial fertilizer, owned by Dorsey &' Howard. They lose about $150, having recovered about twenty barrels in a damaged con dition. The origin of the fire is a mys tery, but is supposed to have been caused by an insane man, who has been wander ing about in that part of the country for a few days past. His name i3 unknown, as well as all other facts relating to bis history. He appears to be a man about 60 years old, and has sandy complexion with full beard. He has been arrested, as a vagrant, and is now confined in the jail at this place, and M ill probably be taken to Brattleboro as soon as proper papers can be procured. A Broken Bank. It is stated that ex Senator Graham, president, and Charles II. Horton, cashier of the Wallkill Na tional bank of Middletown, N. Y., have lost, by their speculations, $150,000 of the funds placed in the bank for safe keeping. They were caught in the Northwest . corner and swamped, when the defalcations were brought to light by a $14,000 draft on the bank. A run on the bank resulted, and it has suspen ded. The total defalcations are com puted at $200,000. Horton has fled. He was the late candidate for Congress against Charles St. John, is son-in-law of E. II. Wheeler, vice-president of the Midland railroad, and a leading member of the Presbyterian church at Middle town. Accident to Gov. Stewart. Gov ernor Stewart, on Tuesday last, while kindling a lire in his furnace in his house, was severely burned in the face and one of his hands. It came very near proving a serious affair, but aside from consider able inconvenience, it will not prove such. At first severe pain was experi enced, but this has all passed away, and the Governor is at his business as usual. "Belle Britton." We learn that "Belle Britton," one of the most valua ble breeding mares on the Vermont Stock Farm, died of dropsy on Friday of last week. She had been previous ly suffering from the epizooty. Death of Mr. TnoMAS Keightley. The London journals a few da3'sago recorded the decease of an honest, care ful, laborious historian, Mr. Thomas Keightly, which happened at his resi dence in Kent, at an age extended be yond eighty years. He was, we believe, of Irish extraction, being a native of Dublin, and was educated, iike so many of his countrymen, at Trinity College, Dublin, where he took his Bachelor's Degree, in the spring of 1808. His ori ginal destination was the Bar, for which lie read during a short period ; but cir cumstances arose which altered his" course of life, and he resolved to aban don the labors of the law for those of literature. With this view he came to London when about five-and-twenty vears of age, and joined the late Mr. Crofton Crocker in the production of his Fairy Legends of the South of Ire land, at the same time filling his leisure hours by contributions to the periodical literature of the day. To us his name will be familiar as the author of several useful and able school books, though rather dull and dry m point of style, more especially his histories of Rome, Greece, and England, and his Outlines of History, which formed one of the early volumes of Dr. Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia. He also edited the Fasti of Ovid, and compiled a work which enjoyed, very deservedly, no small popularity in its day, Fairy Mythology. This, however, is far from a complete list of Mr. Keightley's labors the full amount of which is recorded in the pa ges of the British Museum Catalogue. Besides his classical works, Mr. Keight ley was known as the translator of at least one work from the Dutch, aid as the editor of Milton's Poems and the Plavs of Shakspeare, his edition of the latter having appeared about eight years ago. Mr.. Keightle' was for the last few years of his long life in receipt of a literary pension from the Engiish Gov ernment, which it is hoped may be con tinued to his sister a septuagenarian lady, if not older still who used to help her brother in the production of his learned and pains-taking works. Donkeys and Donkeys. Says the Naples correspondent of the Swiss Times: "If the poor, heavy laden beasts of burden, the donkeys of Eng land, had the power of making compari sons, they would be thankful they are not Neapolitan donkeys. They have had for a long time .much to suffer, without the power of complaint, but there is a society for their protection from cruelty, and many kind subscri bers keep an eve upon those ruffians who sometimes dare to ill-treat them. Thej' have been cruelly driven, beaten and knocked about streets, roads and heaths, an5, up and down hills, but in England I never heard of donkeys being driven up stairs. Here, however, they are driven up stone stairs hundreds of them with the thermometer over 80 in the sun, their toilsome route being from Naples to the Castle of St. Elmo, situated on a hill anciently called Ermo, signifying "high and sublime," and most worthy is it of such a title. Indeed, there can hardly be obtained elsewhere so fine a yiew of Naples, which certainly should be seen once from this point, though the journey is tiring, even on a donkey, who toils up zig-zag," and fatigues his rider almost as much as walking would do. The donkeys cost about six sous (l v. the use of one, though I did see one bony creature I should consider dear, as a purchase, even at that I") The Spanish Republicans. The Spanish Republicans are qaartIlinr anions themselves. They are divideu into two parties, one of "men of action," who are ever ready for armed insurrec tion, and the other of "men of propa ganda," who are unwilling to wait their time, and Castellar has been obliged to publish a manifesto, telling bis republi can adherents what their duty is. On the lath of last month: a general meeting was to be held, and Castellar and his companions of the Directory probably resigned their power into the hands of the electors, and disturbances will no doubt follow. The manifesto has, there fore, naturally very much the tone of a parliamentary confession of faith, in which they extol all the good they have done to the cause, and nobly inveigh against the Monarchists. . Two mem bers of the "Directory" refused to sign the address. The remaining five and the secretary have signed it. The Epoea, in a leader on the impeachment of the Sagasta Ministry, sa3rs, with regard to the republicans : "Action and influence, to-day, rests with the republican minori ty, thanks to the alliance which have been formed by part . of the majority. In a country like Spain, familiar , with political changes and subversions, ac customed to the worship of force, infill. ence and preponderance, cannot long be 1 separated troni power. Reason, , a3 Se nor Castellar would say, come to allay itself with reality. Ideas and opinions are not slow in transforming themselves into facts. It is certain that the repub- lican triumph is due to the weakness of the Zorilla Cabinet, ' and to divisions of the majority, and that it tne accusea, to-day, is Senor Sagasta, it does not ap pear impossible that the condemned will be the elected 'Monarchy raised by the Revolution." , -, . ; -.
