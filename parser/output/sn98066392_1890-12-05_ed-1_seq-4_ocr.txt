Gfficui nm of he tin, CIVIL aKUYUK. The 4? are the days in which the Tery air i rr...o!ent w.th civil service reform. It n the on thins which is found m all j Art j p'atforirn, and is tho ihitboleth of th (iturtf" Wiilum CurLiitf. To ths Utur it is the pinion upon which th wnol nvt'.d turns. Cut with all th'.a talk of civ.l MrTiciam, is the idea i thoroughly und-frstooil a it hou!d le? lh) the popl know that to carry tae idea to the cxtrerue to which wine of its loudeit proclaimul adherent are dfroi.n of carrying it, the ferrico of the Kovfrnmtfnt would be eeriously cr;p;.t d? An rCicient discharge of the duties of apfrMMi in the government's employ is certainly the one thing to be moil desired. Is this Wit obtained by announcing to the employe that he need have co fear of losiug hii position? That aftor hating stood an examina tion, which may not hare had much to do with his duties as an employe, he is reasonably sure of a life position. "While it is evident that changes should r.ot l-o made ia the personnel of any department of government in such a manner as to seriously impair the- efficiency of that depart ment, yet there are many reasons why tho party in power should have all okvs from President to Tathmas tor Tvithm its control. And especially should the head of a department, the conduct of which he is held responsible f jr, havo the r:?ht to saywithout teicg called to answer for a reasonable exrrc;s of such r:ght who should be employes under him. He is the one l?t calculated to know what constitutes efficiency in his department, and to him the public looks for a proper dis c har:9 of th duties of hi department. Kich U'ing the cae an tmployo under him should understand that he is under his control. This we think vrou'.d lead to a more proper discharge of an employe's duties. Nw lite blood in tha service of the tovcrnmnt is much better than a lot of pensioners upon the gooa prace of th? (rovernment, after efficicucy has departed from them. ruINCITLES NOT

Fays Mr. la:iA, of the New York efuo thaa whom a more aituto ob server does uot exist ia the Democratic party; "Thero are Republicans enough in all the Republican hute tht went lernccrat;o this year U elect the Re- Iiubiicaa ticket, but half of them tayed way tro:n the polls. The t cial causes that wurked against the Repub tan Mates, will nutte in tho way iu the National campaign. 'Tha various independent move ments that have naeu at the expen of the Republican party will dwindle The Republicans do a good dtal Oi kicking, but they do most of it in oil" yta'.s. The remarkat le instinct of or ganization and disci pi me th.at distin gulsnes the Republican arty reasons illf afttr a period of mdt penlence." Mr. Dana's precienco should be taken into account by Democrats in the prejent session of Congress. UXQL'ALlrieD ASSENT. The New York World, while con demning tho general matter of the President's message, has this to say: Mr. Harrison makes one suggestion in his message which is thoroughly wise and sensible. He says that there ought to bs some provision by general law for a due inquiry as to the actual need in the matter of proposed public build ings, so tnat appropriations for them may be founded upon public policy in stead of local vanity or gred'and niay be kept within tho bounds of propriety." 

WHAT OTHERS SAY Tea, Verily. Columbus Evenlns Dispatch: Speaker Reed and the leaders of the House of Representatives have given early indications that they mean the second session of the Fifty-first Con gress to be devoted to busiuess. The adherence to that determination will be met with satisfaction from all quar ters of the country. The Journal of Finance: The discovery of a great nickel mine is reported from Queen's county, Nova Scotia. Examinations and tests made by New York specialists show that the find is a wonderful one. A find of con glomerate ore at Stewinke, Nova Sco tia, is also creating great interest. A great demand will soon be created in the United States, where, unfortu nately, hardly any exists, for nickel ore, to be used in the compound plates for the new men-of-war. Very Probable. Detroit Tribune:. Governor-elect Winans has probably made up his mind thatG. William Cur tis was right when he said that the Democrats were very hungry and very thirsty. When h" looks at the little bundle of spoils he has to distribute and then at the bur crowd of spoilsmen that surround it, no wonder he feels like taking to the woods. Who Is lie? Detroit Times: A Grand Rapids man who has been elected to the Legislature, admits that he never read the Constitution of the State until last Sunday. He is prob ably not more ignorant than many of his colleagues, but is a little more frank about it. Not Tet, Chicago Evenlns Journal: Our Democratic friends are already involved in a scandalous row over the Presidential nomination in 1502, being inflated with the false notion that the prize is just as good as caged. rertlnent for Democrats. Toledo ir.ate: The Democratic freet-trade organs, which have b en asserting that the new tariff is "prohibitory," will plense ex plain how it happened that "the im ports at the port of New York for the tirst three weeks of November were nearly 8 per c-nt. greater than for tho same period m l&tf, and L'9 or cent, greater than in the same period of 1 which statement is given in the President's mrwagp, and whoso truth is shown by the official records.
