PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. : fjlloif citizens of the Senate and House of ftqresentatives: jnMe millet of unprecedented political r,,aWes, we have cause of great gratitude to God for. unusual good health and most jtondant harvest. Tou w'll not be surprised to learn that a lie peculiar exigencies of the time, our !s:?rcourse with foreign nations has been ittended with profound solicitude, chiefly mrnin" upon our own domestic affairs. A di-lojal poition of the American people lave, during the whole year, been engaged in ao attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factions and domestic division is subjected to disrespect abroad, and one party, or both, is sure, Eooneror later, to invoke foreign interfer ence. Nations thus tempted to interfere arnof always able to resist the counsels of smwg expediency and ungenerous ambi tion, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortu nate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States, rji have offered the ruin of our country irireward for the aid and comfort which thtj have invoked abroad, have received Jo? patron age and encouragement than they probably expected. U it were just to suppose, as the insur ants have seemed to assume, that foreign anions in this case, disregarding all nat aral, social and treaty obligations, would rt folely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce.including especially the acquisition of cotton those nations 3fpcar as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are ac tuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a second agreement could be male to show them that they could reach their aim more readily and easily by aid ing to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it. The principal lever relied on by the ex citing of foreign nations to hostility against :s, 83 already intimated, is the embarrass ment of commerce. Those nations, how ever, not improbably saw from the first tbat it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. They cp n scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that our strong nation prom ises more durable peace, and a more exten sive, valuable and reliable commerce than can lYie tame nation broken into hostile fragments. It is not ray purpose to review or discuss i(b foreign States, because whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integ rity of our country is the stability of our Government, and mainly depends, not upon them, but upon the loyalty, patriotism, vir tue and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual eservations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality to wards foreign powers, averting causes of imitation,' and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other (ate, foreign danger necessarily attends domestic difficulties, I recommend that ad equate and ample measures be adopted for Maintaining the publio defenses on every which under this general recommend- & '-a provision of defending our coast line ftxtily occurs to the mind. I &Uo in the same connection ask the Mention of Congress to our great lakes sd rivers. It i believed that pome forti fications aud depots of arms and munitions ith harbor and navigation improvements at well selected points upon those, would be a great importance to the national defense nd preservation I ask the attention to the tiews of the Secretary of War, expressed in bis report on the same general subject. I deem it of importance tbat the loyal regions of .Last lennessee and Western orth Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the nion by railroads. I therefore recommend as & military measure, that Congress pro vide for the construction of such a road as Pedily as possible. Kentucky will no uuot co-oDerate. and through her Lemsla tore make the most judicious selection of ime. fee northern terminus must c?n with come existing railroad; and . , the route shall be from Lexington a KhuUville to Cumberland Gap, and ,. m fbanon to the Tennessee line in the eciion ot Lenoxville, or 6ome different tu t Can easi'v determined. Ken CJ and the General Government co-op , lng. the work can be completed in a nme, aud when done it will be not v i t Vast Present usefulness, Dut aso an its . . an permanent improvement worth pi in an the future. Dor f commerce and having no grave aj " "nportance, have been negotiated, u. m be submitted to the Senate for luer consideration. Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable amelioration of the rigor of maritime laws, we have thus far removed all the obstacles from the way of their human reform, except such as are merely of temporary aod accidental occur rence. I invito your attention to the correspond ence between .Her Britannic Majesty's Minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary of State, relative to the deten tion of the British ship Perthshire, in June, by the United Stales steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as jus tice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded on strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recom mend that an appropriation be made to sat isfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her deteution. I repeat the recommendation of my pre decessor in December last, in regard to the deposition of the surplus which will prob ably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of March 3, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed ad visable to carry the recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal over the surplus referred to, in good securities with a view to the satisfaction of such other claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that empire. By act of 5th August last, Congress au thorized the President to instruct the com manders of suitable vessels to defend them selves against and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual com merce in Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to au thorize the commanders of sailing vessels lo recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels, and their cargoes, and Consular Courts established by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recog nition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to -discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugu rate a novel policy in regard to thm with out the approbation of Congress. I submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining Charge d'Affairs near each of those States. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them. The operations of the Treasury during the period which ha9 elapsed 6ince your adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the peo ple has placed at the disposal of the Gov ernment the large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been taken of the citizens of the in dustrial classes, whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal for their country's deliverance from its present peril, have in duced them to contribute to the support of the Government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in the disbursement and energy in action. The revenue from all scources, including loans, for the finan cial year ending on the 30lh of June, 1C61, was 886,835,900,27, and the expiditures for the same period, including payment on account of the public depts, were 84,578,- 034 34 leaving a balance in the treasury on the first of Julv of 82.257,865 93. For the first quarter of the financial year, end ing the 30ih of September. 1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance from July 1st, were dollars. The ex penditures, , leaving a ballance, Oct. 1st. 1861, of 849 277.618. Estimates for the remaining three-quar ters of the year and for the financial year of 1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands contem plated by them will be submitted to Con gress by the'Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenses made necessary by the rebellion are not be yond the resoursed of the loyal people and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it till peace and union fehall again bless the land. I respectfully refer to the Report of the Secretary of War for information respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recomendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well-being of the various branches entrusted to bis care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people is equal to the occasion, and tbat the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me lo call into the field. I refer with pleasure to those portions of his Report which make al lusions to the credible degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire ar my. . The recomendation by the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uni form basis, is ajsubject of vital importance to the future safety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Con gress. A large addition to the regular ai mv is, in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its c Seers, gives peculiar importance to his reccoraendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the mill lary academy. By mere emission, I presume. Congress has failed to provide chaplains for the hos pitals occupied by volunteers. This sub ject was brought to my notice, and was in duced to draw up the form of a letter ( one icoppy oi wnicn properly addressed to each of the persons and at the dates respectfully named, and stated in a schedule containing also the form of the letter marked A and herewith transmitted.) These gentleman, I understand, entered upon the duties des ignated at the times respectfully stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein, ever since, I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that genera provision be made for chap lains to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Navy preseuts in detail the operations of that branch of the service, and the activity and energy which have characterized its admin istration, and the results of measures to in crease its efficency and power. ,Such, bvel been the additions, by constiuction and purchase, that it may almost be said a na vy has been created and brought into ser vice since our difficulties commenced. Be sides blockading our extensive coast, squad rons larger than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat, and peiform ed deeds which have increased our naval renown. 1 I would invite special attention to the recomendations of the Secretary of the JNavy for a more perfect organization, as it is de fective and unsatisfactory, and the sugges tions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if addopted, obviate the difficul ties alluded to, promote harmony and in crease the efficiency of the navy. I respectfully recommed to the considera tion of Congress, the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope thai Congiess will be able to find an eaily remedy for many inconveniences and evils which con stantly embarrass those engaged in their practical administration. Since the organ ization of the government Congress has en acted some five thousand acts and joint res olutions, which fill more than 2000 closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or conflict with each other. It is difficult even for the best in formed persons to ascertain especially what statute law really is. It 6eems to me very important that the statute law should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may be consistent with the fulness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws and would bs a. lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelli gible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. I am informed by 6ome whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in in force and of a paramount and general na ture, might be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume, or at least two volumes of ordinary and convenient size, and 1 respectiuny recommend to con gress to consider the subject, and if my suggestion be approved, to devise such a plan as, to their minds, shall 6eem most proper for the attainment of the end pro posed. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court two by the decease of Justices Daniels and McLean and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so Jar forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which 1 will now state: Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the States now overthrown by revolt, so that if successors were appoint- ted in the 6ame localities thev could not terve upon their circuts and many of the most competent men there probablv would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the supreme Bnch. I have been unwilling to throw all the ap pointments Northward, thus disabling my self from doing justice to the South on the return of peace, although I may remark that to transfer to the North one who has berelofore bean in the South, would not with reference to the territory and population be unjust. During the long and brilliant career of Judge McLean his circuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts more than a nominal attention rising in population from 1,470,000 in 1831 to 6,101,405 in 1861. Beside this, the country has gener ally outgrown our present Judicial system if uniformity was at all intended. The sys tem required that all States shall be accom modated with Circuit Courts attended by Supreme Judges, while in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California and Oregon have never had mch Courts nor can this be wellremedied without a change of the system, because the adding of Justices to the Supreme Courts enough for the accomodation of all parts of the country with Circuit Courts, would create a Court altogether too cumbrous for a judicial body of any sort, and the evil, if it be one, will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should be de nied them. If not useful, no Stale should have them. Let them be provided for all or abolished as to all. A modification oc curs to me here wnicn 1 tuinic would be an inprovement upon our present system. Let the Supreme me Court be of convenient number in every State then let the whole country be divded into circuits of conven ient size, the Supreme Judges to serve in a number corresponding to their own number. and let independent circuit judges be provi ded for. all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme Judges be relieved from circuit duties and Circuit Judges provided for all the circuits; or, thiidly, dispense with cir cuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the District Court. One of the unfavorable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire sup pression in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in forms of existing law.' This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the iusurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of these States, the practicle evil becomes more ap parrent. ' There are no courts or officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of sheir lawful claims against the citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt consti tuting such claims some have estimated as high as 200,000,000 due in large part from citizens even now making great sacri fices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to-support the Government. Under these ciacutnstances I have been urgently solici ted to establish by military power coruts to administer justice in such cases. . I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt the end proposed (the collection of debt) was just and right in itself, but be cause I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the casual exercise of power, but the powers of Congress, it is supposed are equal-to the anomalous occa sion and therefore refer the whole matter to Congress. It is supposed the whole matter will be left to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the adminisrtation of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under con trol of this Government whether by a volun tarv return to allegiance and order by the power of arms. It if, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute and to cease as soon as the ordi nary Courts can bo re-established in peace. It is important that some more convenient means should be provided if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the Gov ernment, especially in view of their in creaed number by reason of the war. It is a3 much the duty of the Government to ren der prompt justice againrt itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same bo tween private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of al, claims in their natur belonging to the ju dicial Department, besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for 6ome time to come with great national questions. It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of buisness from the halls of Congress; but while the Court has proved to be an efficient and valu able means of investigation, it, in a general degree, fails to effect the object of its creation, of want of power to make its judgement final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgements final may not be prop erly given to the Court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to thiS upreme Court with such other provisions as experi ence may have shown to be necessary. I ask attention to the report of the Post master General. The following is a sum mary statement of the condition of the De partment: The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1861, including the annual perma nent appropriation of 8700,000 for the transportation of tree mall matter, was 9, 049, 296 40 being about 2 per cent, less than the revenue of 1860; the expen ditures were 813.606,709, showing a de crease of more than 8 per cent., as compar ed with those of the previous vear, and leaving an excess of expenditures of the revenue for the last fiscal year, of over dollars. The ' gross revenue for the year ending June 30th, 1861, is estimated at an increase of 8 per cent, on that of I860, leaving 88.683,000 which should be added to the earnings of the department for car rying free matter, viz: 8700,000,-making 89.382.000. The total expenditures for 1S62 are estimated at 812.528,000 to be supplied from the Treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac river at the time of establish ing the Capital here, was eminently wise. and consequently that the relinquishment of the portion which lies in the btate of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expedi ency of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Vir ginia. The report of the Secretary of the Inte rior, with the accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branch es of the public business pertaining to that Department. The depressing influences of the insur rection have been especially felt in the op erations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of Publio Lands during the last quarter have exceeded the expenses of our land sys tem about 8200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the. Southern States, while the interruption to the business of the country and the' drawing of' large numbers from hbor to military service has obstruct ed settlements in the new: States and Ten i tories of the Northwest. The receipts of the Patent Offic hve-leelined, in nine months, about 8100,000s including a large reduction of the force employed -necessary to make it self-sustaining. . The demands , upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by :be insurrection. Numerous applications for ; pensions based upon the casualties of the existing war have alredy been made. There is a reason to be lieve that many who are now upon the pen sion rolls aad in receipt of the Government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving aid and comfort. The .Secretary of the Interior has d Tree ted the suspension of payments of such persons upon proof of their dieioyalty. I recomena that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of eucb persons to be sticken from the pension rojls. ' The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by the insurrection, especialy in the Northern Superintendency and that of New Mexico. The Indian country South of Kansas is in possession of the insurgents, from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of . the United States, appointed 6ince the fourth of March, for this Superintendency, have been unable to reach their posts, while most of those who were in office before that time have es poused the insugents' cause and assumed to exercise the powers of agents by. virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. -It has been stated in the publio press that a portion of these Indians have been organized as a military force, and are attached to the insurgents, but I have nothing official upon the subject. Letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, by several prominent chiefs, giving assurances of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing the wish for the presence of Fed eral troops to protect them. It is believed that on the repoe ession of the country by the Federal forces, the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the Government. Agriculture, confessedly the largest in terest of the nation, has not a department or bureau, but a clerkship only assigned it in the Government. While it is fortunate that that great interest is indipendent in its na ture as not to have demanded and extorted more from the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with gen eral advantage. Annual reports exhibiting the condition of agriculture, commerce and manufactures would present a fund of prac tical value to the couutry. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized. The execution of laws for the suppress ion of the African slave trade has been con fided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that the ef forts which have been made for the supres sion of this inhuman traffic have recently been attended with unusual success. Few vessels being fitted out for the 6lave trade have been seized and condemued. Two mas ters engaged in the trade, and one person equtping a vessel as a 6laver has been con victed and suoieciea to me penalties ui uu and imprisonment, and one captain taking up a cargo ot Alt icans on Doaru nis vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under out laws, the punishment of which is death. The territories of Colorado, Dakota and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when we consider that the leaven ot treason was iouna existing in some of these new countries when the fede ral officers arrived there. The abundant natural resources of these territories, with the security and protection of an organized government, will, doubtless, invite to them a large immigration when peace shall re store the business of the country to its ac customed channel. I received the resolu lions of the legislature of Colorado, which evinced the patiiotic spirit of the people of the territory, bo far the autliontory of the United States has been upheld in all the ter ritories, as it is hoped it win be in the fu ture. I commeud their interest and defence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress. I recommend lo the favorable considers tion of Congress the interest of the District of Columbia. Ihe insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacraGce to ihe inhabitants, and as they have no repre sentation in Congress tbat body should not overlook their just claims upon the Gov ernment. At your late session a joint resolution was adopted, authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper repreeen ta'ion of the industry of all nations, to be holdeu in the year 1862. I regret to have been unable to give my personal attention to this subject, inseperably connected with the material prosperity of the world. Tt-rough the Secretaries of State and In terior, a plan or system has been devised and partly matured, which will be laid be fore you, and by virtue of the Act of Congress entitled "An Act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purpo ses, approved Aug. 6th, 1861." The claims of ceitain persons to labor and service to certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent upon the United States, aud must be provided for in some way Besides this it is now possible tbat some of the states will pass similar enactment! for tbeir own benefit, respective of the opera tion of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for their disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress, for accepting such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu of pro-rata of direct taxes, or upon some other plan, to be agreed on with Such States, respectively; that such persons, on such acceptances - by the General Govern ment, be at once deemed free, and that in any event, steps be taken for colonizing both. classes, or the one first mentioned, if the other should not be brought into exis tence, at some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored peo ple already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be inclu ded in such colonization. " '' To carry out the plan of colonizaton may involve the acquisition of Territory, and also an appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. tory for nearly fifty years, the question of constitutional power to do so .is no longer an open one with us. The power was just ly inaugurated by Mr. Jefferson who, how- ever, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the pleaof the great expe diency. If it be said that the legitimate object of acquisition of Territory is to fur- t r .1 nisn comes lor ih wuive man, inese meas ures effect that object for the emigration of' the colored men, leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population. Including the appro priation of money with the acquisition of Territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity without which Govern ment cannot be perpetual. In considering the policy to be adopted for the suppression of the insurrection, I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore thought proper to keep the integrity of the Union promi nent, as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital importance to the more delib erate action of the Legislature. In the ex ercise of my best discretion I have adhered to a blockade of the ports held by the in surgents instead of putting in forces proc lamation, the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing the ports, also obeying the dictates of prudence as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcend ing I have adhered to the Act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrection ary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed its propriety will bo duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all defensible means be employed. We should not be in haste to determine what radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable. The Inaugural Address at the beginning of the Administration, and the message to Congress at the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy, at one of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract from the principles or general pur poses stated and expressed in those docu ments. The last ray of hope for preserv ing the Union peaceably expired at the as sault on Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred since may not be un profitable. What was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now, and the progres of events is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confident ly claimed a strong support from north of Mason & Dixon's line, and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This, however, was soon settled definitely on the right 6ide. South of the line, noble little Delaware went off right from the first. Maryland made to 6eem against the Union, our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned and railroads torn np within her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the Capi tal. Now ber bridges and her railroads are repaired and opened to the Government. She already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and none to the enemy, and her people at a regular election have sustained the Union by a large majority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate on any ques tion. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and unchangebly ranged on toe6iaeoitne union. .Missouri is com paratively quiet, and I believe cannot again be over run bv insurgents. These three States Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for the Union, while of tbeir citizens not more than a third in number are among the insurgents, and they of doubtful whereabouts. After a some what gloomy fctruggle, the months of winter close upon the Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country. An insurgent force of about 1500, for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomao and Northampton and known as the "Eastern shore" of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have renewed their allegiance to and acceptded the protection of the flag. This leaves no armed insurrectionists north of the Potomac, east of the Chesapeake. Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the southern coast of Hatteras, Port Royal and Tybee Island and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements on behalf of the Union men in North Carolina and Tennesee. These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily southward. Since your last adjournment Lieut. General Win field Scott has retired from the head of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit, yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country from a time far back in our history when few of the, now living, had been born, and thence forward continued. ; I cannot ; but think we are still his debtor. I submit therefore for your consideration what far ther mark of recognition is due to Lim and ourselves as a g restful people. With the retirement of Gen; Scott it became the Exe ecutive's duty to appoint in his stead a gen-eral-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country has there been so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person, to be teleted. The retiring chin repeaitd-
