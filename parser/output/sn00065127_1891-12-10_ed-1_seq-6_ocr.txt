WASHINGTON, D. C., DEB/ 10.—Special Correspondence: President Harrison, mayor may not have been greatly sur prised when he was called on by presi dent Polk and Messrs. J. F. Tillman and H. W. Ayers, of the National Farmer's Alliance but in ten minutes from the time those gentlemen entered the portals of the white house there were a dozen political stories concerning their visit flying along newspaper row, none with a firmer foundation than the imagination of the relater. Your cor respondent saw the trio just after their interview with Mr. Harrison and in response to questions was smilingly in formed that they had merely called as dutiful and patriotic citizens to pay their respects to the president. There is reason to believe however, that they took occasion while paying their respects to say something about the vacancies on the interstate commerce commission, and the desirability of the alliance hav ing a representative thereon. Although this is the last week of the speakership campaign there is just as much doubt as ever as to who is to be speaker of the house. Each one of the five active candidates—there are a number of dark horses—will tell you that he is confident of being the man, and that confidence is reiterated by each and every one of the friends of each candidate. Four of them are dead wrong in their calculations, and may be all five are, as it would create no great surprise if, in case of a protracted fight in the caucus, all of them were dropped and some man like Wilson of West Virginia, nominated. Things are very lively around the several headquart ers, members are coming in on every train and it is expected that, they will all be here by Wednesday. Then it will become largely a question of manage ment. The senators are taking sides in the contest to a considerable extent, and Crisp is credited with having secured Gorman's active aid. If this be true it adds largely to Crisp's chances of winning, as there is no man in con gress who approaches Gorman has a manipulator of men. Springer is ap parently developing more strength than anybody had given him credit for having there is a big delegation from Illinois here working for him. Henry George is an interested spectator of the fight, and while he says he has no in fluence with any of the members he is nevertheless doing lots of talking for Mills. Jerry Simpson is seen every where and he says that the alliance men will vote for a candidate of their own, but some of the alliance members from the south have already announced their intention of going into the democratic caucus, and it will not be surprising if they all do so. Candidates for minor house offices are multiplying and it is noticeable that many of them are ex members of the house. Somebody said once that an ex-congressman always be came an office holder or a lobbyist, and he was pretty near right. With few exceptions they become one or the other and in some cases both. The silver question ia giving the democrats as much trouble as the speakership. The free coinage demo crats, under the lead of Bland, of silver dollar fame, are on the rampage, and it is said that fearing that they may get left in the nomination of speaker they will introduce the resolution in the caucus before the balloting commences pledging the house to pass a free coinage bill. This the eastern members of the party do not want done. If such a resolution comes up in the caucus it will certainly be carried by a decisive majority. While there are lots of demo crats who are perfectly willing to have the silver question let alone for awhile there are few who will dare to vote against such a resolution if it is brought up in caucus. If President Harrison signs the treaty now in his possession and the senate ratifies it, the United States will have absolute' free trade with, one country and that country will have the same with us. The country is Hawaii, which has had a representative here for some time engaged in. the negotiation of this treaty. Probably this negotiation has been the foundation upon which the numerous stories about the annexation of Hawaii have been built. The Tatifl' cation of this treaty would, as far commerce is concerned, put Hawaii precisely the same footing as any state in the union. President Harrisoh has about com pleted his message to congress, being now engaged in revising and polishing it up with the able editorial assistance of private Secretary Halford whose long experience as a managing editor makes him a valuable assistant. It has been some years since a president's message was prematurely made public, and, so long as the present present precautions are continued, it is impossible to be'done without detection. Rumors of a rumpus between Post master-General Wanamaker and Civil Service commissioner Roosevelt are plentiful, aiidthe reticense of all parties makes it look as though something in it. I 

WORTHING WAITS. A Few Items From Our Regular Correspondent From Worthing. 7 Business dull past week. The fine rain last week will moisten the soil to some extent. ., Henry Gerber and sister has gone to Sioux Falls to attend school. Silvey Morris and Berthy Whitehead are attending school at Canton, also George Woodley's little daughter. Our Agent spent several days at court at Sioux Falls last waek. Everybody husking corn and it is turning out much better than expected. Our lumber man took in Sioux Falls Suuday. We expect to soon be able to see Canton's electric lights. Grain still continues to come in at the rate of one to two cars daily. James Woodley has a fine well on his lot, seventy feet deep and thirty foot of good water. Health is good. It is rumored that we are to have a bank. We learn in a round about way that there will be a large tract of land laid laid off in lots and be put 'Up at auction in the near future. If so it is a good thing we area thriving little town. Everybody believes in government control of rail roads and telegraph lines up this way. One of Canton's best young men paid our town a pleasant call on Sunday, returning by the evening train. H. J. Frank was up to Sioux Falls Monday on business. Some of our people think Blaine will be our next president, while some say Cleveland. We predict both otf parties will grasp for breath after the next election for the people are in it and to stay. Hotiee to Subscribers. Notice is hereby given that the names of all subscribers of the Leader who on January 1st.,. 1892 are in arrears cue year of over will be discontinued, and the amounts due will be collected unless otherwise specially arranged for with the publisher. The former publishers of this paper have done themselves and the paper a great injustice by permiti ng subscription accounts to run oyer a year. Many persons are not aware how they stand with the publisher, and how few of them recognize the fact that a paper bill is a legal debt. This has been done, how ever from a desire to be accomodating, but this good nature of editors has been sadly abused. The publishers can not pay their bills with delinquent sub scription accounts and of course we are compelled to adopt a more stringent business method. If any subscriber who can not comply promptly with the above, can call Or address the publishers, and make the gaxbe satisfactory. Ample warning is hereby given to all delinquent sub scribers so that no one will have any reason for felling aggrieved if his paper is cut off. •ftp in the Kiddle of the Bold." People's party Medal!
