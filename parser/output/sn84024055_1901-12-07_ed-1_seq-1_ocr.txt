Mea4a73)ec 2, both, braaohes.of the United States Congress convened ia regular sesskm, sad the day follow ing President Roosevelt's first message was read for the benefit of that na-, Uoa&T body of law-makers. Is some respects it is a very remarkable docu ment; it la extremely leagtky and 11 covers ail subjects wtich effect oi which, ay effect the welfare of al .-the'Aimerkaa people, except mob an? lynch 3aw aad the disfranchisement of the Negro hy the people residing In jBost f'the Soethera States. The 'first question discussed by the president Is "Anarchy," and in the disoueeiea of that great subject many of -his propositions are unsound. He maintains that Anarchists "are high waymea; .that so bos, or body of men, preaching aaarchistlc doctrines should he allewed at large any- more than if preacalBstSfe flBBrder of some specified private individual. Anarchistic speech es, writings aad meetings are essen tially -eukteus and treasonable." We are sot defending anarchy or anar chists, feat "we do believe in free speech as long as the person does sot ad vocate vSeteace or murder, like Ben Tillman. PreaideBt Roosevelt would have-oafsrred a -great blessing apoa humanity if he Jsad only naiaoaished TnUaasH.rjfraia frem preaching: an archy, s-sbot-gaa. poKcy aad mar der, iaae'Awerkaus.

IfBch taffy is thrown at the trust kings 1r his message. He. is of the opisioa that In some cases the trusts are a great evil, that they iafllct many hardships on the people; but now that they are. here to atay the people will have to ; ssake Ifee best of their very bad bargain.

THAT SOUTHERN POLICY. George R. Kocster, the South Car-, ilina democrat, who was recently ap pointed collector " of interaal revenue "or that state to succeeedTCo. E. A, .Vebstcr (deceased) is charged with peniy boasting of .haviag fired the .rat shot at an Afro-American who had oeen strung to a tree by a mob ef lyn chers, citizens of Columbia. He docs not deny .having been one of the lynchers in question, and in addition to this iact has anything but a good record. The republicans of South Carolina have ap pealed to President Kooserelt to wita draw Koesters appointment, aad Bay thst if this is not done, they will an tagonize his confirmation in the United States senate when it convenes. We trust they vill do -so. Two leadiag white republicans by the names of Clay ton and Huggins, men of excellent char acter and standing, the latter first depu ty under Co. Webster, were urged as the Utters successor by the repablicaa organization of South .Carolina. Beth gentlemen are above the average critic ism of either the repabUeaa or deaw cratic press of that state," and there is no reason in the world for Koester' appointment, except that the president in his blind determination to follow the southern policy ef the MeKialey adaOais. I tnKn;n h aim determined to eofiUBHe I .Jt--, . '.ST. i .. -tt. . , " totHrndownoySactt " a : republicans of the South, and particular ly that state. There are, as we have said many times before, an abundance of splendid material in the raaks of the black and white repablfcaas of the south from which to fill every position at the command of the president The repabl' can narty will never be made respect able in the eves of. the voters of the soath by the appointments of democrats to offices which should be filled by deserv ing republicans. Therefore there is ab solutely no excuse for the co-called southern -policy of the last and present kuOional administration, except that it is the intention to. build up a white republican party at the south and eah crdinatc or exclude the long-suffering, true and tried black republicans of that section. If this be the case, the nnrth em Afro-American cannot understand it too quickly, and take sach sctiea as rrill redound to their cerlasting credit and establish or re-establish, in the minds of the powers that-be, their ster ling manhood and thorough race inter estEx.

ATTACK A GIRL IN NEGRO GUI Friends of Miss langstone, Prominent la Society, Enter Her Home. Oae Shot aad Locked Up. Columbia, S. a, Nov. 29. Two young men attacked Miss Langstbse,: a prosalBeat society girl, in her home;t A aelghbor, Clarence Babb, saw the; men fleeimr when she screamed. . He shot at them and braaghtdowri Heary S. Sullivan, a. frienof the Langstone family, disguised as a Ne gro. Sallivan is not seriously injured and is locked up. The Chicago American.' f Within the last four months five whke men residing in the various parts of the South have been detected, or caught in the act of outraging their white female friends and associates, while disguised as Negroes. J These cases prove what we have- maintained all along that there are; hundreds, of white men throughout. the South, who have nothing to boast of except their white skin, who for many years resorted to the d able practice of blackening themselves up as Negroes in order to gratify their oeastly and lustful passions upon their own female relatives and friends and. then charge the crime or the crimes; ap to the Negro race. Bat it is nothing new in this or in those acts for any race of people that will deliberately sell their own flesh and blood, ia order? to wax fat and rich, its members are' prepared for the commission ef any; aad all crimes against their xneaasr their fellow-men and against sod It4aHelesa4e.staterthatsiC-SalU was a Negro "he?wonld not have lived long enough to go to Jail, but he would have been mobbed and lynched in leu time than it takes to tell the story, or lf Sullivan had succeeded in escaping by this time many innocent Negroes would have been shot down by the so-called friends of Miss langstone. One thing is certain, that Is, if Prof. Booker T. Washington wants to be known as the true leader of the Negro race it ia his .solemn duty to cause a thorough investigation to be made of every case of rape which occurs in the sooth, in so far as the Negro-Is concerned, for If he does not take this .courso the Negro race will be forever blasted in this country. Many peoDte woald contribute money to aid Ppg. Washington In this direction. It .Is his further duty to adhere to the trSh as to the moral relations of the whites and blacks though the heavens fall. He should not hesitate in letting the world know that in Lousiana: over two thoasaad white men, leaders olUift best -society, are right now maiatagj lag or living with Negro women as their mistresses; that in Alabama and in the other Southern states the same condition of affairs exists; that 90 per cent of all the bastard children born to Negro women in the South have white fathers: that these same men are ..ever, ready to mob., lynch,, .burn, murder and otherwise torture the first Negro who'happens to look cross-eyed at a white woman. . .
