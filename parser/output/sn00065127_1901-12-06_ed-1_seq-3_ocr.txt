On the sixth of September, President Mc Kinley was shot by nil ntiarelilst while attending the Pan-American Exposition •t Buffalo, and died in thnt city on the fourteenth of thnt month. Of the lust seven elected Presidents, he Is the third who has been murdered, •nd the bare recital of this fuet is suffi cient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third assassi nation of an American President, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfor tunately not uncommon in history: Presi dent Lincoln falling a victim to the ter Mble passions aroused by four yearn of civil war, and President Gnriiold to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office .: seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belong ing to that body of criminals who object to all governments, good and bail alike, who are against any form of popular lib erty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of i'ree people's, sober, will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. '. It is not too much to say that at the tiuie of President McKinley's death he "was the most widely loved man in all the United States while we have never bad any public man of his position who has been so wholly free, from the bitter animosities incident to public life. There could .be no personal hatred of him. for he never acted with auglit but considera tion for the welfare of others. The de fenders of those murderous criminal* who seel to excuse their criminality by assert Jng that it is exercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. When President McKinley was assas sinated the blow was not aimed at tyran ny or wealth. It was aimed at one of jtlie strongest champions the wage work er has ever had at one of the most faith ful representatives of the system of pub ]ic rights and representative government who has ever risen to public office. Presi .Hit McKinley filled that political office 'or whicli the entire people vote, and no __.._ident—not even. Lincoln himself— fi#was ever more earnestly anxious to rep '--resent the well thought-out wishes of the people his one anxiety in every crisis, was to keep in ^closest touch with the people—to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to •their thought, after haying endeavored to guide that thought aright. That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his ict, the assassin took advantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the people generally and advancing as If to take the hand outstretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow. There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime. Nation Mourns McKinley. The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of ah. We mourn a good and great President who is dead but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of liis life and the grand heroism with which he met his death. When we turn from the man to the na tion, the harm-done is so great as to ex cite OUT gravest apprehensions and to de mand our wisest and mut resolute, ac tion. This criminal was a professed an archist, inflamed by the teachings of pro fessed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped. The blow was aimed not at this Presi dent, but at all Presidents at every sym bol of government. Anarchy is no more an expression of "social discontent" than picking pockets or wife beating. The an archist, and especially the, anarchist in the United States, is merely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity in 'a greater degree. The man who ad Vocates anarchy directly or indirectly, in jny shape'or fashion, or the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds. makes himself morally accessory to mur der before the.fact. The anarchist is a criminal who is not merely the'enemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. He is not the victim of social or political injustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of his criminality is to be .found in hia own evil passions and in the evil con «*duct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by others or by the State to do jugtice to him or his. He is a male factor and nbthihg else. No man or body vof men preaching anarchistic doctrines idioulQ be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings and meetings are essentially se- ditious and treasonable. Urges Laws Aaainat Anarchist*. I earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exerciso of its wise tliscretion it should-take into consideration tlie com ing to this country of anarchists or per sons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. If found liex-c they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came and far reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No m.-it tor calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the President or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presideny, while the punishment for an unsuccessful at tempt should be proportioned to the enor mity of the offense against our institu tions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations.' It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. This great country will not fall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institu tions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are alow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming Are. Country's Commercial Pro»pe-ity. During the last five years business con fidence lias been restored, and the nation is to be congratulated because of its pres j. ent abounding prosperity. Such prosper1 ity can never be created by law alone, S although it is easy enough to destroy it I by mischievous laws. Fundamentally the welfare of each citizen, and therefore the ,* welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the plabe of this individual capacity but wise legislation and honest and intelligent ad miiiist.rntiiin can give it the fullest scope, I the largest opportunity to work to good r: effect. The. tr(fmendous,and highly complex in dustrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the lat ter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with very seriousi social prob lems. The upbuilding of the great in dustrial centers liiis meant a startling in p. crease, not Merely in the aggregate of if! wealth, but in the number of veny large individual.- uii i'spBtfatlj .of very large HH|g||-fami corporate, fortunes The creAttgn pi ttesc great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other govern mental action, but to natural causes In the business world, operating in other countries as they operate- in-our Own/ The process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, -never before has the average man, the wage worker, the farmer, the small trader, bewiil,$« well off as in this country at jthc foresentitfnie. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealtHi "yet'lt re mains true that a fortune Vctumulated in legitimate business canvbe accumulated by the person specially nenenfal only on condition of couferring immense'incident al benefits upon others. .''i** Ciution I« Artvlsetl. The raptains of industry who have driv en the railway systems across this conti nent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our manutictnres, have on the. whole- done great g90(l to our people. Without them the material development of which we are so justly prouil could never have taken place. Moreover, we slioufd recqgijize the im mense importance to this material devel opment of leaving as unhampered as is compatible with the public good, ™e strong and forceful nien llpon whttni the success of business operations inevitably rests. An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to''W°uniI iu tlie international commerciai condi tions of to-day. The saine rbusineffs con ditions which have produced the. great aggregations of corporft'td'imd Individual wealth have made them very. potent fac tors in international commercial .competi tion. America has 0nly just bqgun to assume that commanding p(mitioi\,in tin international business, worm,,lyfiich wo believe will more aiid btf.'hCTS. It is of the utmost importance-thfft' this po sition be not jeopardized, ospwifllly at a time when the overilgwing ib)indance of our own natural resoqrtjeg arid, the skill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make fotfef^n"'markets es sential. Under-such conditions'/it would be most unwise to crain)' dr fo'ftJtter the youthful strength of oar. natioti, !-i Moreover, it cannot top often be, point ed out that to strike.,with.,i^np^a^it vio lence at the interests o'f on,e'Sjbt of riten almost inevitably endangers tile' interests of all. Disaster to gteat'buSiflfests enter prises can never have its eifacte'limited to the men at the„t«p. It. spreads throughout, and while it is, bad,tjw every body, it is worst-for those^farthe^t down. The capitalist may be_sliorn of his lux uries but the wajte WSbkdr fliay'.be oe 'prived of even bare necessities.' In facing new industrial conditions, the whole 'history of the world shows that leg islation will generally be both unwise and ineffective unless undertaken, after calm inquiry and with sober -self-restraint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly mis chievous had it not also been entirely in effective. Tlie men who demand the im possible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they Rre nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in ra tional fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and In what manner it is practicable to apply remedies. Yet it is true that there are real and grave evils, one of the chief being over-capital ization because of its many baleful con sequences and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils.- i.... Publicity a Cure for Trusto. There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American. people-that the great corporations known a^ trusts are_ in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. Combina tion and concentration should be, not pro hibited, but supervised and within rea sonable limits controlled. 1 I .'-ft- .,.- •,'•'*•'9 -A v^lr-W^'S.*A- .f :.v.- r»'*" itMM.**t-Httt HfcMi rv i. ••!:•.•::,..-•••• 1 1 The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combina tions is knowledge of the facts—j)ublic-it,v. In the interest of the public, the govern ment should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corpo rations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the only sure-remedy which we can now invoke. What further rem edies are needed in the way of govern mental regulation, or taxation,, can only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration. The large corporations,' Commonly call ed trusts, though organized In one State, always do business in many. Statp#, often doing very little, business in the State where they are incorporated. .'There is -utter lack of uniformity in the State laws about them and as hd State has 'any ex clusive interest in or power :over their acts, it'has in practice proved Impossible to get adequate regulation-through State action. Therefore, in the tatprest of the whole people, the nation.^puld, without interfemng with the power of, the States in the matter itself, also issunie power of supervision and regulfttion oVer'all cor porations doing ari lnterttflte business. I believe that, a law can bo framed which will enable the national government to exercise control along the lines above in dicated. There should be evented a cab inet officer, to bo known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries 'as provided in the bill introduced 'at the laMfsession of the Congress. It'should be'his'province to deal with commerce in'-its broadest sense including among many qther tilings whatever concerns labpr and all matters affecting the great business jjo^porations and our merchant marine.

It is therefore a,quitter for hearty congratulation that, oil. the whole wages are higher to-day in the United States than ever bt-fore ill oul ''history, and far higher than in an.V othOr country.

The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole civili'zcd world, has'to^d^al, is the prob lem which has for ope, side the better ment of social conditions, moval and phy sical, iu large cities, and for another side the. effort to deal with that tangle of far reaching questions which we group to gether when we speak of "labor.',' The chief factor in the success of .erfch man— wage worker, farmer and capitalist nlike —must ever be the sum total of his own individual qualities and abilties. There must in many cases be notion by the gov ernment in order to safeguard the, l'igSts and interests of all. Immigration 1/a.vs Unsatisfactory. Our present immigration laws are un satisfactory.

I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor. AoierieVs Mcrch nt Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such as to call for imme diate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant mariuo should be utterly insignificant in comparison to that of oth er nations which we overtop in other forms of business. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling portion of .our great commerce is carried in our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping interests, but it would also result iu benefit to all who are interested in the permanent es tablishment of a wider market for Amer ican products, and would provide an aux iliary force for the navy. Our government should take such action as will remedy these inequalities. The American mer chant marine should be restored to the ocean. The net of March 14, 1000. intended un equivocally to establish gold as tlie stand ard money anil to maintain at a parity there with all forms of money medium In use dth us. lias been sliown to be timely and judicious. The price of our Government lionils ill the world's market, wlien com pared with the price of similar obligations iHsueil by other nations, is a flattering trib ute to our public credit. Tills condition It Is evidently desirable to maintain. 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. ject of working a threefold improvement over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of anarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation.' The second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely, perfunctory educational test some intelli gent capacity to appreciate American in stitutions und act sanely as American citizens. Finally, all persons should lie. excluded who are below a certain stand ard of economic fitness to enter our in dustrial field as competitors with Ameri can labor. Both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be designed to protect and eleyate tlie general body politic and social. A very close supervision should be exercised over the^steamslviE. .companies Hvhich mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should be held to a strict accounta bility for any infraction of the law.' Tariff and Kecirrocity. There is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a National pol icy. The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business in terests of the country by any general tar iff change at this time. Our experience in the past has shown that sweeping re visions of the tariff ore apt to produce conditions closely approaching panic in the business world. Yet it is not only possible, but eminently desirable, to com bine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system of recip rocal benefit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity was especially provided for in the present tariff law. Reciprocity must' be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is need ed is maintained, and. that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home indus tries. Just how far this is must be deter mined according to the individual case, remembering always that every applica tion of our tariff policy to meet our shift ing national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection nec essary to our industrial well being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support. Ill nmny respects the national banking law furnishes sufficient liberty for the prop er exercise of tlie banking function but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging Influence of commer cial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce. The collections from duties on imports and Internal taxes continae to exceed the ordi nary expenses of tlie Government, thanks mainly to the reduced army expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to re duce the revenues so thnt there will be any possibility of a deficit but, after providing against any such contingency, means should he adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs. I call special attention to the need of strict economy In expenditures. Only by avoidance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our Income to the point required to met our needs that are genuine. Interstate Commerce. lit 1887 a ineusure was enacted for the reg ulation of interstate railways, commonly known as the Interstate commerce act. Tlie enrdiual provisions of that act were that railway rates should be ,1ust and reasonable nnd that all shippers, localities and commod ities should be accorded equal treatment. Thnt law was largely an experiment. Ex perience has shown the wisdom of its pur poses, but has also 

SWJWU, possibly that some of its requirements are wrong, cer talulv thnt the means devised for the en forcement of Its provisions are defective. The act should be amended. The railway Is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The Gov ernment should see to It that within Its jur isdiction this is so, and should provide a speedy, Inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legis lation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies. The Department of Agriculture during the last fifteen years has steadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accom plished results of real value in upbuilding domestic nnd foreign trade. It hps gone into new fields until it Is now In touch with v'- ,J -i-ft $r 'JT t- V% all sections of our country and with' two of the island groups thi^l have lately come un der our jurlstdlction, whose people must look to agriculture for a livelihood. It Is searching the world for -grains, grasses, fruits and vegetables specially fitted for in troduction Into localities In the several States and Territories where they may add materially to our resources. By scientific attention to soil survey and passible new crops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimental shipments, to.animal Indus try and applied chemistry, very practical aid had been given our farming and stock growing Interests. The products of the farm.have taken an unprecedented place Iu onr export trade during the year that has just closed. Protection of the Forest. Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a just ap preciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural growth. The great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth Is now inore fully realized than ever before. Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources, whether of wood, water or .grass, but, on the contrary, gives the assurance of larger and more cer tain supplies. The fundnmental Idea of forestry Is the perpetuation of forests by use. Forest protection Is not an end of Itself it Is a means to Increase and sustain the resources of our country and tlie indus tries which depend upon them. The preser vation of Our forests Is an imperative busi ness necessity. At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the Gen eral Land Offlce, the mapping out and de scription of their timber with the United States Geological Survey, and\the prepara tion of plans for their conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with the' general advancement of practical forestry In the United States. These various functions should be united In the Bureau of Forestry, to whlcii they properly belong. Reclamation of Arid Lnntl'. The reclamation of the unsettled,arid pub lic lands presents a different problem. Here It Is not enough to regulate the flow of strenms. The object of the Government Is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach. The pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along streams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings. Such op portunities are practically gone. There re main, however, vast areas of public lanu which can be made available for homestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main line canals impracticable for prlyate enter prise. These Irrigation works should be built by the national Government for actual settlers, and the cost of construction should so far as possible be repaid by (he land re claimed. In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the tradltlonul American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor we wish a healthy Afneriaan community of men who them selves nill the farms they own. AM our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this end In view the well-being of the average home-maker mflst afford the true test-«tf the healthy development of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as%posslble be modeled on our homestead system. It Is a pleasure to say that It is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limits. The Island Is- thriving as never before, and it Is being administered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now Enjoying liberty and order under the protec tion of the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free access for their products to the markets of the United States. I ask the attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the pub lic lands of 1'orto Rico. Cuba anil the Philippines. Iu Cuba such progress has been made to wnrd putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing thai before the present session of Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress nud to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as she un folds this new page of her destiny, we ex tend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, how-: ever, there are weighty reasons of moral ity and of national Interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar applica tion, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom. Indeed, to the vital need, of providing for a substantial reduction in the tnrl£C duties on Cuban Imports Into the United States. Cuba has In her constitu tion affirmed whnt we desired, that she should stand in international matters In clos er aud more friendly relations with us than with any other power and we are bonud by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures In the interest of her material well-being. in the Philippines our problem is larger. Thev are very rich tropical islands, inhabit ed by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the Islands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves und as an earnest of. what we Intend to do, we point to whnt we have done. Already a greater measure of material pros perity and of governmental honesty and effi ciency has been attained In the Philippines than ever before in tltelr history. The only feur Is lest In our overanxlety we give them a degre of Independence for which they are -unfit, thereby inviting re action and dlsnstcr. As fast as there Is anv reasonable hope that In a given district the people can govern themselves, self-gov ernment has been given ill that district. There is not a locality fitted for self-govern ment which has not received it. But it may well be that In ccrtnln cases it will have tn be withdrawn because the Inhabitants show themselves nnfit to exerciso it such in stances have already occurred. i| Still Troubles Ahen-1. There.arc still troubles ahead In the islands. The insurrection lias become an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the Old World. Encourage ment, direct or indirect, to these insurrectos. stands on the suuie footing as encourage ment to hostile Indians iu the days when we still had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim Is to give to the Indian who remulns peace ful the fullest and amplest consideration, but to have It understood that we will show no weakness If he goes on tlie warpath, so we must make It evident, unless we are false to our own traditions nnd to the de mands of civilization aud humanity, that while we will do everything iu our power for the Filipino who Is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path of the lnsurrecto nnd the ladrone. I call your attention most earnestly to the .firr r. Crying need of a cable to Hawaii aud the Philippines, to be continued from the Phil ippines to points in Asia. We should not de fer a jday longer than necessary the con struction of such a' cable. It Is demanded not merely for commercial, but for political and military considerations. The'lsthminn Cnnnl. No single great material work which re mains to he undertaken on this continent Is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a cuuul across the Isthmus connecting North und South America. Its importance to the nation is by no means lim ited merely to Its material effects upon our business prosperity and yet with view to these effects alone, it would be to the Inst degree Important for us Immediately to be gin It. While Its beneficial effects would per haps be most marked upon the Pacific Coast und the Gulf nnd South Atlantic States, It would also greatly benefit other sections. It, is emphatically a work whieh It Is for the Interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible It Is one of those works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of success, aud which when dofie are uot only permanent as sets In the nation's material Interests, but standing monuments to Its constructive abil ity. I am glad to.be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject with Great BHtaln, conducted on both sides In a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and respect, have resulted In my being nble to lay before the Scnnte a treaty which If ratified will ennble us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, nnd which guarantees to this nation every right thnt it has ever asked Iu connection with the canal. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal, and shall regulate its neutrnl use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or interfer ence of any outside nation from any quarter. Work on the Nnvy Mnst Continue. The work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued. N'o one point of our policy, foreign or domestic, is niore Impor tant than this to the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of our nation In the future. Whether we desire It or uot, we must henceforth recognize that we have international duties no les than International rights. Even If our flag were hanled down In the Philippines an'd Porto Rico, even if 'we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal, we should need a thorough ly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely and for all time to aban don the idea that onr nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea In ships. Un less our commerce is always to lie carried In foreign bottoms, we must have war craft to protect It. Inasmuch, however, as the American peo ple have no thought of abandoning tlie path upon which they have entered, nnd especial ly in view of the fact that the building of the Isthmian Cnnal is fast becoming one of the matters which the whole people are united In demanding. It Is Imperative that our Navy should be put and kept In the highest state of efficiency, and should be made to answer to our growing needs. So far from being In any way a provocation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The co.st of building and maintaining 'such a nnvy represents the very lightest premium for in suring peace which this nation can possibly pay. Our people Intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine und to insist upon it as tlie one sure means of securing the peace of the Western hemisphere. The Navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven aud the wenkilug. It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships must be built and the men trained long In advance. Some auxiliary vessels can be turned into make shifts which will do in default of any better for the minor work, nnd a proportion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the skill of their fellows but the efficient fight ing force of the Navy when pitted against an equal Opponent will be found almost ex clusively In the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weap ons with the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the de cisive blows al Manila and Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did because the men In the conning towers, the gun tur rets, and the engine-rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty. While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the Philippines and in Cuba, we .must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been .struck. The Congressmen who'v.oted years In advance the money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor-plate the depart ment officials and the business men und wage-workers who furnished what the Con gress had adthorized the Secretaries of the Navy who asked for and expended the ap propriations and finally the officers who, in fair weather and foul, on actual sea ser vice, trained and disciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war In sight all are entitled to a full share in the glory ef Manila and Santiago, and the respect ac corded by every true American to those who wrought such signal triumph for our coun try. It was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fnll to show forethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disaster will befall us instead of triumph and should this time come, the fault will rest primarily, not upon those whom the accident of events puts in su preme command at the moment, but upon those who have failed to prepare In ad vance. No Cessation in the Work. There should be no cessation in the work of completing our Navy. So far ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substi tute for the great war craft whose hammer ing gnus beat out the mastery of the gh seas. It Is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battle sliips and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion for the ex act- numbers and character I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there is something we uced even more than additional ships, and this Is additional officers and men. Increase of the Army Uncec.'ssury. It Is not necessary to-Increase our Army beyond Its present size at tills time. But it is necessary to keep It at the highest point of efficiency. The Individual units who as ofllcers and enlisted men compose this Army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those of any other army ill tlie entire world. It Is our duty to see that their training Is of a kind to insure the high est possible expression of power to these units when acting in combination. The conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever before upon the Individual char-ictcr and capacity of the officer aud the en.isteil man, and to make it far more difficult 'for men to act together with effect. At present the fighting must be done In extended order, 'which inenns that each man innst act for himself and at the same time act In com bination with others with whom he Is no longer in the old-fashioned elbow-to-elbow tducli. Under such conditions a few men »t the highest excellence are worth more than many men without the special skill which is only found as the result of special training applied to men-of exceptional physique aud morale. But nowadays the most valuable fighting man nnd the most difficult' to per fect is the rifleman who Is also a skillful nud. daring rider. The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been Increased. The American cavalryman, trained to maneuver aud tight with equal facility on foot and on horseback, is tlie best type of soldier for general purposes now to be found in the world. Every effort s-houlil be made to bring the Army "to a constantly iin-i-easin^ state of efficiency. When on actual service no wnrl liave that directly in the line of sncli service should be required. The paper work In tlie Armv. as in the Navy, should be great.y re duced. What is needed is proved power or command and capacity to work well In the -field. Constant care Is necessary to prevent dry rot In the transportation and commis sary departments. Onr Ariuy is so small and so much scat tered that it is very difficult to give the higher officers (us well as the lower officers aud the enlisted men) a chance to practice maneuvers ill mass aud on a comparatively large scale. In time'of need no amount of Individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole, under skillful nnd daring leadership. The Congress should pro vide means whereby It will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of rtciilars. and if ocsslble also a division of national guardsmen, once a year Army Keorcnniaatinn. Much good hag already coins from the act reorganizing the Army, passed early in the present year. The three prime reforms, all of tliem of literally Inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four-year details from the line for permanent appointments In the so-called staff divisions second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head third, tlie establishment of a uiaxlmiim and minimum limit for the Army. It would be difficult to overestimate the improvement in the efficiency of our Army which these three reforms are making, and have In part already effected. The reorganization provided for by the act has been substantial^ accomplished. The improved conditions In the Philippines have enabled the War Department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue aud to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring tills number much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit estab lished by lniv. There is, however, need of supplementary legislation. Thorough mili tary education uuist be provided, and In ad dition to the regulars the advantages of this education should be given to the officers of the National Guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty. The officers should be given the chance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this art.: At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who arc good In actual field service too much stress should not be laid cn mathematics, nor should pro ficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to corps d'ellte. The typical, American officer of the best kind need not be a good matheinntlclun but he must be able to master himself, to control others, and to show boldness nnd fertility of resource in every emergency. That the Army Is not nt all a mere Instru ment of destruction has been shown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Potto Ulco it has proved Itself a great constructive force, a most potent Im plement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civ ilization. No other citizens deserve so. well of the republic as the veterans, the survivors of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed wlilch if left undone would have meant thnt all else in our history went for nothing. The men who In the last three years have done so well In the East and the West Indies and ou the mainland of Asia have shown that this remembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis the United States must rely for the great mass of its flzktlng men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession of tlie. mili tary career: and whenever such a -crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil War will give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those whose fathers have stood valiantly lu the forefront of the battle. Our Consular Service. The consular service Is now organized un der the provisions of a law passed In 1850, which Is entirely inadequate to existing con ditions. The interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your attention. The guardianship and fostering of our rap Idly expanding foreign commerce, the pro tection of American citizens' resorting to foreign countries In lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance of the dignity pf the nation abroad, combine to make It essential that onr consuls should be men of character, knowledge and enterprise. It is true that the service Is now, in the main, efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the-prin ciples set forth iu the bills heretofore sub mitted to the Congress ou this subject are enacted Into law. For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau. Growth o* the Poslnl Service. The remarkable growth of the postal ser vice Is shown In the fact that its revenues have doubled and Its expenditures have near ly doubled within twelve years. Its pro gressive development compels constantly In creasing ontlay, but in this period of busi ness energy aud prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its expeus-es thlnt the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from §11,411,770 In 1807 to $3,023,727 iu 1901. Among' recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery wherever es tablished has been so marked, nnd actual experience has made its benefits so plain, the demand for Its extension is general and urgent. It is just that' the gnat agricultural popu lation should share in the improvement of the service. The "umber of rural routes now in operation Is ti.COO, practically all estab lished within three years, and there are 0,000 applications awaiting acticn. It is ex pected that the number in operation nt the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,COO. The mall will then be daliy carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upou distant offices, aud oue-thlrd of all that portion of the country which is adapted to It will be covered by this kind of service. The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered nnd obstructed by the heavy burden Im posed on tlie government through the in trenched and well-understood abuses which Tiave grown up lu connection with second class mall matter. The extent of this bur den appears when it Is stated that while the second-class mntter makes nearly three fifths of the weight of all the mall. It paid for the last fiscal year only $4,204,445 of the aggregate postal revenue of flll,ti31.1S8. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Comrress with the pill-pose of encouraging the dlssemluution of public In formation. were, limited to the legitimate newspapers and: periodicals actually con templated by the law, no Just exception could be taken. The Post-Office Department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so,far as Is possible by a stricter application of the law and it should be sustained iu its effort. Settlement of the Cbinese Emhroglio Owing to the rapid growth of our power nnd our interests on the Pacific, whatever haopens in China must be of the keenest national concern to lis. The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the antlforeign uprisings ill China of 1000. having been for mulated In a joint note addressed to China bv the representatives of the Injured pow ers in December last, were promptly ac cepted by till Chinese government. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a filial protocol with the Chinese plenlpoten taiies on tlie 7th of last September, setting forth the measures taken by China in compli ance with the demands of the Joint note«au(l expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before the Congress, with a re. port of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States, Mr. William Woodville Hoc!: hill, to whom high praise is due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has displayed In performing an exceptionally difficult an:I delicate task. Under the provisions of the joint note of December, 11100. China has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation nud-to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed. During these troubles our government has unswervlnglv advocated moderation, nnd lias materially aided in bringing about an adjust ment wlilch tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more beneficial Intercourse between the empire nnd the modern world: while in the criticnl period of revolt and massacre we did our full share In safeguarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating the national Interest anil honor, ft behooves us to continue In these paths, doing what lies iu our power to foster feelings of good will, nnd leaving ill) effort untried to work out the great policy of full anil fair A break.

I'cath of VictnHo. The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and heart felt sorrow, to which llie gocernmelit gave full expression. When I'res'dent McKinley died, our nation In turn received from every quarter "f the British K:n ii:v express!.ms of grief and sympathy no le sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sym pathy of the American people: aiul ills sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assas sinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilized world we received, at the time of the President's death, assurances of such grief anil regard as to touch the hearts of our people, in tlie midst onr atliicrion we reverently thank the Almighty thai we are at peace with the lindens of mankind nud we firmly Intend that iiiii- policy shall lie such us to continue unbroken these In ternational. relations of mutual icspect- aud 50ml win.

This is a considerable percentage of the total membership of 350, but the reins of government, to. a great extent, remain in the suine hands.

Murphy of Arizona, in his annual report. He advocates the sale and settlement of the large Indian reservations within the territory, with the possible exception of Navajo reservation in northeastern Ari zona, and the government construction of reservoirs for water storage for irriga tiou in suitable localities, with canals leading to lands allotted the Indians. The Governor says the latter action, in which Indian labor could be largely utilized, would help'to make farmers of the In dians, and that further maintenance of the tribal relations as now conducted, and the retention of. reservation agencies.' around which the Indians cluster and live- .51 in idleness on government rations, mosti seriously retard the civilization of the ub origines. The annual report of the First Assist ant Postmaster General shows a contin- . ual advance in all branches of the ser-| vice. In the five years just passed the number of presidential postoffices has in creased from 3,051 to 4,089, the salaries of postmasters have increased from 9lG,-s 90S.3S4.35 to $19,949,515, the allowances for clerks in first and second-class oIHces, •», from ?10,3S2,061 to $11,723,514, while the number of free delivery offices has increased from 627 to 8(56, the number of carriers from 12,834 to 16,389, the cost.'-.^ jL, of the service from $12,713,861 to $15,^ 752,000, with an increase of gross re» ceipts at free delivery offices from $52,-• 567,004 to $74,295,394.
