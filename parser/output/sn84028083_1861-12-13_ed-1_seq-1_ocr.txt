Since, however. it is appurmt that hero, as in ever v oilier State, foreign dangers necessarily "attend domestic dilllculiies, I recommend that tide quute and aiuplu measures be adopted lor maintaining the public defence on every tide; while under this general recommend atiuti provitino for dulunding our coast Hue readily occurs lo tne mind. 1 also, in tho same connection, ask the olteiilion of Congress to our great lukt s and rivers. II I believed inal some lortifica lion and depot of arm and tnuuiiion. with harbor and navigation impiovemonis. at woll eolectod points, upon liiesu, would be of great impel tanco lo Ihe natiotml de fense and preservation.

Sotno treaties designed chiefly for Ihe In terests of commerce, and having nngiavo political iinptirtuiice, huve been iiogotiated and will be submitted to llio Senate fur ihoir consideration. Although wo huvo failed induce tome of the commercial power adopt a desiiuble melioration lor thu rigor ut maritime war, wo huve far removed all tho obitueles from the way of their humane reform, except such aa uro merely of lorn uorary and accidental occurrence. 1 in vito ycur attention in the correspondence between her lirituntio Alajosty a Minister, accredited In this Government, and the Secretury of Stale, relative to ihu detention of Ihe British ship Perthshire, in June last, by Ihe United State steuinor Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of tho blockade. As this detention wa occasioned by an obvious misrepresentation of Ibe fuels, and as jus tice require that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right sanctioned by public law, I recommend that aa appropriation be madu lo satisfy Ihe reusonublo demand of tho owner of the veieel lor her detention. I repeal tho rocommondatlnu of my pred ecessor, in hi annual message lo Congress, in December last, in regard lo the disposi tion of tbo surplu which will probably ro main after satisfying tho claims of American citixen against Chins, pursuant lo the award of ihe Commissioner, under the act of Ihe 3d of March, 1859. If. howovor, il (bould not be doomed advisable lo carry that recommendation into effeot, I would (uggesl that authority bo given for investing the principal, over tho turplu referred lo, in good securities, with view to the tali faction of such other Just claims of our oltixein against China a are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the courso of our ex tensive trade with that Empire. By the act of the 6th of August last, Con gress authorized tbe President to instruct Ibe commander of suitable vessels lo de fend themselves against, aud lo capture pirates. Ibis authority bus boon exorcised iu a single instance only. For the effectual prolectton of our ex tensive aud valuable cummaicg iu (by Cut- of r i as em seas, especially. It soein to mo that it would also bo advisuble to authorixo lho commanders of tailing vessels lo leeapluro any prixos which pirulus may make ol United Slate vessel and their cargoes, and Uiuj Consular Court established bv law in Eastern countries lo adjudicate thociso in the event that this should uot be objected lo by ihe local authorities. If any good reason exists why wa should persevere longer in withholding our recog nit inn of llio independence and sovereignly of HuUi and Liberia, I am cuablo lodiacoin it. Unwilling, however, lo Inaugurate a novel pone ;n regard lo them wtthuut the approbation ol Congress, I submit for vnur consideration the expediency of n aniin pnu ion for maintaining a Charge d' Affaires near each ol' those Status, It does Mot admit of doubt thut important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable l rem I us aith them. Thu opuiutlotia of tho Treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment, have boon euuductod with signal succoks. Tho patriotism of the peo ple lint placed at the disposal of tho Gov ernment the largo moans demanded by Ihe public exigences. Much of tho National Loan has boon taken hy citizens of Ihe in dustrial classes, whose confidence ill their country's fuitli and seal for their country's deliverance from its present peril, have iu ducud iboin to contribute to the support of tint Gnvoi iiimnt llio whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact itnposos peculiar ob ligation to economy iu ditbursulneut and energy in action. Tno revenue from all sources, Including louns for the financial year ending on Ibe 3uih of Juno, lKu'l. was 80 835.1)00 27. and the expenditures for the same period, in cluding payments on account of tbo public debt, wore 84 578,034 34; leaving a bal ance in the Treasury on ihe 1st of July, of 2 257 0135 80. Fur thu first quarter of thu liuauciul year ending the 30ih of Sept., 1801. the receipts from all sources, inolud ing tlio balance from July 1st. wnre 102 5.12.- f09 27, and the expenses, 93 239.733 00 ; leaving a balance on 1st Oct , 1301, of IF4. 202.776, 18. Eitimate for the remaining ilileo quartets of I ho year and for the nniinuial yoar of 1803, together with his views of the way and ineaiii lor mooting the demands eontomplaiud hy thotn, will bo suumiited to Congress by the Seurutary ol tue i reuBiiry. Il is gratifying lo know that tlio expenses made necessary by the rebollion aro nut beyond the resources of llio loyal poo plo. und lo believe itiul the sumo patriotism which bus thus far sustained Ihe Govern moot will continue to sustain it until ponco and union shall again bless the laud. 1 respectfully refer you lo Ilia report of llie Secretary of War for information re specting ihe numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations lisving itl vivw an incrcace of it itlieienev. itnd ihe well bcini; of the varioua branches of the service entrusted lo his care. It in gratifying; to know that the patriotism of the people in equal lo the occasion, anil lb m the Dumber ol troops tendered e. really exceeds the force which Congress author ized me to cull inio tho beld. I refer with pleasure lo those perilous of hi tepoit which make allusion lo the creditable de gree of discipline already nllained by our troops, end to the excellent sanitary con dition of the en '.ire army. The recommendation by the Secretary for an orgiiniziiion of the miliiia upon a uniform basis, is a subject of vital import ance to the fuiuro timely of ihe country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress. A large addition to the regular army, in connection with the defection thut has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommundalluii for increasing the corps of cndels to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy. By meie omission, 1 presume, Congress has lailed lo provide Chaplains for the lloxpitnls occupied by volunteers. This subject whs brought to my nolicc.and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which properly addressed to euch ol the persons aud at the dales re sptclively uamed.and slated in a schedule containing also the form of tbe letter marked "A," and herewith transmitted. These gentlemen I nnderstand entered upon the duties designated, at the limes respectively staled in llie schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rale as Chap lains in the army. 1 further suggest that general provisions be madu for chaplains to serve al hospi tals as well as with regiments. Thu report of the Secretary ef tbe Navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service, and Ihe activity and energy which have characterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase ii eflicieney and power. buch have been ihe additions bv construc tion nnd purchase that it may almost bs said a navy has been created and brought into service since our dimculiies com menccd. Besides blockading our exten sive coast, squadrons larger than ever be fore assembled under our fl ig have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown, I would Invite special attention to the recommendation ol the secretary of the Navy fur a more perfect organization of Ihe uavy by introducing additional grades in the service. Ihe present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and ihe suggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate Ibe difficulties alluded topromote harmony and increase the efficiency of the navy. There are three vacancies on Ihe bench of the Supreme Court, two by the do cease of Justice Daniels nnd McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Camp bell. X have so far foreborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which I will now stale. Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the Stales now overrun by revolt, so that if successors were appointed in the same lo calities they could not serve upon their circuits, and many of the moat competent men there probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon Ihe Supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments Northward, thai disabling ! ' I : myself from doing justice to Ihe South on the return of peace, although I may re innm Dial to transler to the ISorth one which has heretolore been in llie South, would not, with referenca lo territory nod population, be unjust. During- the long ana Diiinani judicial career of Judge IMc- L,en, ins circuu grew into an empire altogether too large for any one Ju Ige lo Hive iuo iuuiii nirrein more man n nom inal attendance, rising in population from 1.47U.O0O iu 1631, (o 0.15I.4U5 in HG0. Ilesides ihis, the country has generally outgrown our prcseut Judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, (li system requires that all ihe Slates shall be accomodated with Circuit Couris. attended by Supieme Judges, while, iu fad, IF consin, Minnesota.Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Ttzia, California and Oregon have nev er had any such couris, nor can Ihis well be remedied without a change of tho sys tern, because the adding of justices lo the Sepreme Court, enough for the accommo dation ol ali parts of the country with Cir cuit Courts, would create a court altogeth er lo'j dangerous for a judicial body of any sort, anu me evil ol It be one lhal will increase as new Stales lome into the Uuion. Citctiil Couris are useful or they are nol useful. If useful, no Stale should be denied them. If not useful, no Stale should have them. Let idem be pro vided for nil, or abolished as lo all. Tlnee modifications occur to me here, which 1 think would be an improvement upon our present syslem. Let the Su preme Court be of convenient number iu every event. I hen, 6rst, lei the whole country be divided into circuits of con venient size,, lhe)Suireme Judges lo serve in a number of Idem corresponding lo their own number, and independent Cir cuit Judges be provided for nil the rust ; or, sieoudly, the Supreme Judges he re lieved from Circuit duties, nnd Circuit Judges provided lor all the Circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, leaving llie judicial functions wholly lo ihe District Courts, and an in dependent Supreme Court. 1 respeellully recommend to the consid- ertilion of Congress, the present condition of the aluiuiu laws, with thu hope that Congress wilbe Bble to find an easy rem edy for Ihe many inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those en gaged in tho practical aduiiniHiralion of them. Since the organization of the Govern ment Congress has enacted some 

CUOO acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 61)00 closelv printed paoes and arc scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste ant! without euflicient cauliun, so that their provisions arconen obscure iu them- selvei or in conHiol with each other, or at least so doubilul as lo render it vcrv difli cull for even the best informed persons to ascertain preciely what llie statute law u. It seems lo me very important that the statute law should be made as plain nnd intelligible as possible, nnd be reduced to as small a compass as may oonsisl will) the fullness nnd prccUion of the will ol Ihe legislature Had perspicuity of its language. These wrll done would, 1 think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duly it is to assist in the adminis tration of the laws, nnd would be a lasting btineCl lo the people by pi. icing belore them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. 1 am informed by tome whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in foice and of a permanent, general nature, might be revised aud re-written so as lo be embraced in one volume, or it least Iwo volumes of ordinary and con venient size; and 1 respectfully recom mend to Congress lo consider the sub ject, and if my suggestion be approved, to devise such a plan as to their wisdom shu'.l seem most proper for the attainment of Ihe end proposed. One of tho unfavorable consequences ol tho present insurrection is tho entire sup pression in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justicu by Ihe officers, and in the forms of existing law. This i Ihu caso iu wholo or in pari in all tbe insurgent States, and as our armies ad vance upon and tuko possession of parts of tboso States, Ihe practical evil becomes inoro apparent. Thero are no couris or officers to whom tho citizens of other States may apply for tho enforcement of thuir lawful cluims against citizens of the insur gent Stales, and ihero is a vast amount of dubt constituting such claims. Some havo estimated It at high as 

20UOOU.OOU dollars, duo in lurgo part from insurgents iu open rebellion lo loyal citizens, who aro evon now making groat sacrifices in tho ditchurge of their putriotio duty to support tbo Govern ment. Under llieso circumstances I havo been urgently solicited tn establish, by mili tary powor, courts to administer summary justioo in such casus. I huve tiius far do uliued to do il, nut because I had any doubt that tho ond proposed, Ihe collection of dobt, was just aud right in itsulf, but because- I have boon unwilling to go beyond tbe pressure of necessity iu the unusual ex ercise of power. But tho powers of Con gress, I suppose, are equal to llio anomal ous occasion; and, therefore, I refer Ihe whole matter lo Congress, with the hope Ibat a plan may be devisud for the adminis tration of justice In an sucn puns of Ihu in surgont Slates and Territories as may bo undur control of this Government, whether by voluntary returu lo allegiance and order, or by the powor of our arms 1 his. however, is not lo bo a pormaoonl in stituiion, but a temporary substitute, and tocoaseaa anon as ihe ordinary courts can be re-estaDiisnea in peace. It is Important ihat some more eon venient mount should bo provided, if post) ble, for the adjustment of claims against tbe Government, of peoially In view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of the Govorninont to render prompt justice againtt iisolf iu favor of citixeus as It is lo administer tbo saino be tween privato individuals. The investiga tion and adjudication of all the claims, in their nature belong to Ihe Judicial Depart ment; besides il is apparent that Ihe atten tion of Congress will bo more than usually engaged for soino time to coma witb great national question. It was intended by the organuaiiuq ol (be court i Claims, mainly n.tr r, J..!-- !....:.- .!. a ...i 1. .... I to rnmovo this branch of businns from tho nans ol Congress; but whilo Ihe Court has provod lo Im an effociive and also a valuahln means of investigation, it In a great degree mis in meet tno inject ol H creation, for want of power In niako Its judgmonis final Fully awaro of the delicacy, not lo say tho danger of the subject. I commend lo your curutul consideration whether Ibis power of limning jiiugmnnt ileal may not bo prop erly given to tbo Court, reserving the right ol appeal lo Ihe Supreme Court, with such other provisions at experience may have shown tn bo necessary. I ask attention lo tho report of Ihe Post Masler General, tbo following being a lum inary statement of tho condition of tbo De partment. Tho revonue from all source during tho fiscal year ending 30th June, 1801, innlud ing tho annual permanent ap propriation of 700 000 fur the transporta tion of frao mail mattnr, was 9 049.206.40, buing about Iwo per cent, less than tho rev enuo of 1S00. Theoxpeuditure were I3,. 600 709 1 1, thoaing a decrease ol inoro than night per omit., at compared with those of the previous yoar, and leaving an i.xcoss of expenditure over Ilm revenue for tlio last fiseal year, of ovor 557,402 71. Thu gros revenue for tho year ending June 30ih, 1KG3. it estimated 'at an increase of four per cent, on lhat of 1861, making 4S.683.000; which should bo added the Cuming of the Popartniuul for carrving free matter, via ! 700.000. making 9.3H2.000. Tho total expenditures lot 1803 aro estimated at 12. 02S M0, leaving an estimated dorteionny of 3 334 000 in be supplied from the Treas ury, in addiliuu to thu puraisuoul appropri ation. Tim prosout Insurrection shows. I think. ihat thouzteiisioo of Ihis District across tho Potomac river at the time of establishing Ihu Ctpital hero, wo eminently wise. and. consequently, that I ho relinquishment of mat portion ol It wliicn Hot Iu Virginia, was unwito and dangerous. I submit for your consid jraliou Iho expediency of re gaining that part of Ihe Dittrict, and the restoration of Ihe original boundariet thoio nf, through uegutialtuut with thu Slate of Virginia. Iho roporl of tho Socrotarv of tho Info- rior, with tho accompanying documents, ox hibit ihu condition ut the sevural branches of tho public business pertaining lo that Department. Tlio depressing iutl joncnt of Ihu insurrection havo boon especially tult in Iho operations of tho Patent and Gunoral Land Uilico. Iho cash receipts from tlio talus of public lands during thu past year. n ave excuuiiou tno expenses tit our laud sstoin only about 200.000 dollars. The sales havo been entirely tuspuudad iu tho Southern States, whlio llio iuterruntions to Iho business of the country, and thu di version of large numbors of men from labor 10 military survico, havo obstructed suttlo- mnuts in the now Slatet and Territories of tho Northwest. Too recoipis of tho Patent Ooioo havo de clined iu nine mouths, about 1(10,000 dol lats, rendering a la go reduction of the forco employed nocessary t.) muko it self sustaining. Tho demand upon tho Pension Oilico will bo larguly increased hy tbe insur rection. Numuious applications for pensions based upon tho casualties of the existing war, havo already been made. There is rea son to buliuvo lhat many who aro now upou tno l uimou lion, and in tlio receipt of Iho bounty of thu Govorninont, ere in the rank's of tho insurgent army or giving thorn aid anu comfort. I no Ducrotary of Iho Inte rior has direclod llio suspension of Ihe pay ment of suoh persons, upon proof of thuir disloyalty. I recommend that Congress au thorise thut nlliuur tn causa thu naiiiot of all such persons lo be strickuu from Iho Pen sion Rolls. Tho relations of the Oovornment with tho Indian tribes hare been lately disturbed by Iho insurrection, especially in tho north ern suporinloiidelicy, and in lhat of New Mexico. 7 ho Indian country south of Kan sas is in possession of insurgents from Tex as and Aikansas. Tho agents of tno Uni ted States, appointed sUico the 4th of March fur tiiis tuporinlonduiicy, bavo been unable to reach thuir posts, whilo the most of llioso who weru in oilico hul'oru that tiino have es poused iho insurrectionary causo, and as turned lo oxoroito Ihu powers of ugonis by virtuo of commissions' from tlio insurrec tionists. It has boon slated in tho public press ihat a portion of these Indians have boun orgunizod as a military forco, and are attached to the army of Iho insurgents, al though iho Government has no official in formation upon thu subject. Letters havo boon written to tho Commissioners of In dian Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyally to the Uni ted Status, and expressing thu wish for the presence of tho Federal troops lo protect thorn. It Is boliuvod that on tho repossess inn of the country by tho Federal forces, ihe Indians will readily cuasu all hostile demon strations, and resume lliuii former relations lo the Government. Agriculture, confessedly Ihe largest in lorust of ihe nation, has not a department or a burtuiu. but a clerkship only assigned to il in ihu Government. While it is loriu uuto that this groat interest i to independ ent in itt nature a not lo have demanded and extorted more from tho Government, 1 respectfully ask Congress lo conndor wheth er something more cannol bo given volun tarily with general udvuniage. Annual re ports exhibiting tho condition of our agri culture, commerce and manufactures wnuld present a fund of information of great piao licul vuluu to the country. Whilo I make no suggestions as in details, I venture tho opinion ihat nn agricultural and statistical bureau might probably be organized. Tho execution of llio laws for the sup pression of Ihu African slave trade has boon confined tn Ibe Department of the Interior. If it a subject of congratulation lhat iho efforts which have bucn made for tho sup pression of ibit inhuman traffic has recent ly been attended with usual success. Fivo vessels being filled out for tho slave trade have been suited and condemned ; two mas tort engaged in Iho Irado, aud one perton equipping tho vossol at a slaver have been convicted and imjectud lo thu penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain taking up a cargo of Africans on board his vossol has bevu convicted of iho highest grade of otTonto under our laws, Ibo punish ment of which is death. Tho Territories of Colorado, Dakotab and Nevada, created by Iho last Congress, have been organized, and civil administra tion bat been Inaugurated therein under auspicet especially gratifying, when it it considered that me loaroo oi treason wa found exitiing In tome of theso now coun tries whon the Federal officer! arrived there. The abundant natural resources of those Territories, wilb the security and protection 1 afforded by organized Government, will doubtless invito to them a largo immigration wben peaoe shall restore tho business of the country lo its accustomed chatinels. I sub mit the rosolutioui of, (ha Legislature of Colorado, which evinced the natrintm anlrlt of tho people of tho territory. So far Ihe uuiunij or tno united states has been upheld in all tho territories, a Il it hoped It will be in Ihe futuro. I commend lliuir in tercet and defence to tlio oulightouod and generou tsero of Consrost. I recommend lo the fuvnrablo considera tion oi Congress tho interests of the District of Columbia The Insurrection has been Ibe cause of much suffering and mention to the inhabitants, and at they havo no rnpre sentut vo in Congress, lhat body should nol overlook their jusl claims upon ibu Govern ment. At your Into Session a joint resolution wst adopted authorizing ihu Prosiden! to lake measures for facilitating a proper repre sentation of the industrial interests of tho United 8tatot sl Iho exhibition of tho in dustry of all nations, to bo holdon at Lon don in the yoar 1802. I regrot lo havo boon unablo lo give personal attention to Ibis sulject. a subject at onoo to Interesting in ilaulf. and so extensively and intricatelv connected with the material prosperity of mroiigii inn ciccroiarics of tho State and Interior a plan or ystem hat boon devised and partly matured which will be laid before you. Under and by virtue of tho act of Con gross, entitled an act lo confiscate property used for insurrectionary purpose. approved Aug Clh, 1801. legal claims of certain per eons to Iho labor and service of certain other persons havo becomo forfaited, and numbors of iho tailor thus liberates! are already dopoodont on Iho United States, and must bo provided for in tnnio way bo sides this. It is not impossible lhat some of Iho States will pus similar enactment for tltcir own botufit letpectirely, aud bv tho operations of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disnosal. In-auch ease I recommend that Cougress provide for accepting such portons from such Stales, according to sainn inndn ,l valuation, in lieu pretat.lo of direct taxes, or upou rang oiuor plan lo be agreed upon with such States respectively ; lhat such persons on such acceptances bv Ihe Oen oral Ooverntnont. bo at ooce doomod froe. aud lhal in any event, steps be lakon for coloniiing; both classes, oi tho one first mentioned if iho other shall not be brought into existence, at somo place or pluci s in a climate congenial to them. It might bo well lo consider, too, whether Ihe froe col ored people already in the Uuiiod S ates could not, so far as individuals may desire, bo included iu tuch colonization. To carry out the plan of colotiixing may involve tho acquiring of lorritory. nnd also tho appro priation of money beyond that lo bo ex pended In tho Territorial acouisition. Hav ing practiced the acquisition of Territory lor nearly fifty years, the question of Coif ttitulionul powor to do to is no longer an open one with us. Tho power was first questioned by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in Iho purchase of Louisiana' yielded bis scruplos on the ptoa of groat expediency. If it be said lhat the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for while men, this measure effects that object, by the emigration of colored men, and leaves additional room for while men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the im portance of purchasing Louisiaua more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population. On this whole proposition, including the appro priation of money with Ihe acquisition of territory, does not expediency amount to absolute necessity; that w:thout which the Government cannol be perpetual? In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I have been anxious and careful lhat the inevei table conflict for this purpose shall not de generate into a violent nnd remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore, in every case, thought it proper to keep me integrity of tbe Uuion prominent as the primary object of the conlert on our part, leaving nil questions which are not of vital mililary importance lo the more deliberate action of Ihe legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion, I have adhered lo the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation, the law of Con gress enacted at the late session, for clos ing those ports, also obeying the dictates of prudeoce as well as the obligations of (aw. Instead of transending I have adhered to Ihe act of Congress to confiscate prop erty used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject should be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved; hence all ihdispensable means must oe employed. We should not be in haste to determine what radical and extreme measures which may reach the loyal ns well as the dis loyal, are indispensable. The Inaugural address al the beginning of the adminis tration, and the Message lo Congrets nt the late special session, were both mainly devoted lo the domestic controversy, out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from Ihe principles or general purposes staled and expressed in those documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the assault upon Fort Bumpier, and a general review ol what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncer tain then, is much better denned aud more distinct now, and the progress of evnts is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a stong. support from north of Masons and Dixon's iine, and the friends ol the Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This, however, was toon settled de6nilely and on the rizhl side. South of Ihe Line noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made lo seem against Ihe Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned and railroads lorn up within her limits, and we were many days nt, one time without the ability to bring a single Regiment over the soil to the Capital. Mow ber bridges and railroads are repaired and opened lo tbe Government. She already gives seven Regiments lo the cause of tbe Union and none lo the enemy, and her people al a regulai election have sustained the Union by a large maiot ly, and larger aggre gate vote than they ever before gave to any caudidate or ny question. Kentuckj aasaasassaaaaawaassssMsaaaaBBi roo, for sometime In doubt. Is now decid edly, and I think nnchangably ranged on Ihe tide of the Union. Missouri is com paratively quiet, and I believe cannct again be overrun by the insurgents. These three Stales, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which wonld promise a single soldier at 6rsl, have now nn aggregate of not lest than 40,000 in the field for the Union, while of their citi zens not more tban a third in Dumber are) among Ihe insurgents and (hey of doubt ful whereabouts and existence. Aftor m bloody struggle of months, win ter closes on tbo Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them matter of Iheir own country. An insurgent force of about 1600 for month! dominating tbe neraow peninto lar region constituting Ihe counties of Ae comao and Northampton, and known as Ihe Kastorn Shore of Virginia, togethor with somo contiguous part ot Maryland, have laid down their arm, and the people there have renewed Iheir allegiance to, and ac cepted l lie" profociion of Ihe old flag. This leaves no armi.."? force north of Ihe Potomac or east of ihe Chesapeake', Also wo have oblainod a fooling at each of the Isolated points on the southern coasts of IUtierai, Pnil Royal, Tybee Island near Savannah, and Ship Island, and wo likewise have tome general accounts of ihe popular movement in behalf of Ihe Udumi ia North Carolina nnd Tconeseee. Those thing dem onstrate that Ibo cause of the Union is ad vancing steadily southward. Since your last adjournment Lieut. Gen. Scot', has rttiied from the head of the army. During his long life the nation nns not oeen unmindful of his merit ; yet on calling lo tnicd how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back to our history, whea few of tle now living bad been born, and thenceforward continually, 1 cannot but think thai we are stiff his debtor. 1 sub mit, therefore, for your consideration what fur'.her mark of recognition is due to Lim and ourselves as a grateful peonJe. with '.ne retirement or Gen. Scott enme the Executive duty of appointing in his place a General-in-Chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in councii nor country was there so far aa 1 know, any dillerence or opinion as to the proper person to be teleced. The retir ing chief repeatedly expressed his judg ment in favor of Qen, McClellan (or the position, and in this the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. The designation of Gen. McClellan is therefore in a considerable dogree tbo selection of tbe country as woll as of Ihe Executive and bonce there is bettor reasoa lo 4Kpa there will be given him tbe eocfidence at.4 cordial support thus by fair implication promisod, and without which' be cannot witb so full efficiency sorve the country. It ho been said that one bad General ik better then two good ones, and tho saying is lruo,if tsken lo mean no more tban rha an army is bettor directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones at variance and cross purposes, and tbe tamo it true in all joint operations wherein ibose engagod can have none but a common end in view, and can differ only as to the choice of moans. In a storm at tea no one on board can wish the ships lo sink, and jet not uufrcquenil j all go down togotber bo cause too many will direct, and no single mind can ho allowed to control. It con tinues to develope lhat the insurrection ie largely it not exclusively a war upon tfca first principles of a popalar Government and the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of ihis is found in the most grave and maturely considered publie documents as well as in tbe goneral tono of the insur gents. In these documents wo 'find the abridgment of iho existing right of suffrage and ihe denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislative body, advocated with, labored arguments to prove that largo con trol of ibe government in the people is tbo source of all political evil. Monarchy itsolf it sometime bin led at as a possible refuge) from Ihe error of the people. lo my pres ent position I could tcarcoly be justified, were I lo omit ratting a warning voice agaiust ibit approach of returutog despot ism. It is not needed, nor fitting bere, that a goneral argument should be made in favor of popular Institution, but there is one point, with its eonneetions, not to faacknoyed as roost others, tn which I atk brief atten tion. It it tbe effort to plaee capital on an equal footing with, if not above, labor, in ibe structure uf government. It is assumed lhat tabor it available only tn connection with capital that nobody labort nolets somebody else, owning capital, snmobow by ibe uto of it, induces them to labor. This assumed it is next considered whether it it best lhat capital shall hire laborers, and thut induce thorn to work by their own consent, or levy them and drive them lo it without their consent. Having proceeded so far it is naturally concluded ibat all labor ers aro either hired laborers or what we call slaves, and further, It is assumed ihat who ever is ooce a hired laboror is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no aucb relation between capital and labor at assumed, nor is there any aucb thing at a freeman being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these assumptions are false, and all inference from them are groundless. Labor is prior lo.and independent of capi tal. Cnpiln! it only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor it the superior at capital and deserves much the higher con sideration. Capital baa itt r inula which are at worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor it it denied lhat there is, and probably always will be a relation be tween labor and eapital producing mutual bene6ts. The error is in assuming that Ihe whole labor ef community exists with in lhat relation. A few men own capital, and lhal few avoid labor, and with ibeir capiial bire or buy a few to labor for Ibem. A large majority belong to neither class, neither work for oihers, nor bavc oihera working for them. In moat of the South ern Siatet majority of tbe whole people of all color are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large maioriiy are neither birera nor hired men. Men with their familiet, wivet son and daughters, work for themselves on tbair farms, ia their house, and in their shops, taking the whole product to- themselves, and asking uo favor of eapilal on the on hand, nor of hired laborer! or alarei on ibe
