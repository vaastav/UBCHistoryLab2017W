PRESWS MESSAGE. (t ontiuii 'd fit ill Fust a our laws, should not only zenship, be denied citi­ but a domicile. National Bankrupt l.mv. The enaiitnient of a national bankrupt law of a character to be a |K'rinahent part of our general legislation is desira­ ble. It should be uiniplo in its method and inexpensive in its administration. PoMtofllue Depart meat. The report of the postmaster general not only exhibits the operations of the postoffice department for the fiscal year, but contains many valuable suggestions for the improvement and extension of the service, which are coimiumded to your attention. The saving of one day in the transmission of the mails between New York and San Francisco, which has recently been accomplished, is an inci­ dent worthy of mention. The plan sug­ gested of a supervision of postortices in separate districts, thai shall include in­ struction and suggestion and a rating of efficiency of the postmasters, would,I have 110 doubt, greatly improve the service. A pressing necessity exists fur the erection of a building for the joint use of the de­ partment and of the city postolilce. The unsatisfactory condition of law relating to the transmission through the mails of lottery advertisements and remittances is clearly stated by the postmaster gen­ eral, and his suggestion as to amendment should have your favorable considera­ tion. Tin) Siivy. The report of the secretary of the navy shows a reorganization of the bureaus of the department that wili. 1 do not doubt, promote the efficiency of each. In gen­ eral. satisfactory progress has been made in the construction of the new ships of war authorized by congress. The report of the secvetary shows that, while the ef­ fective force of the navy is rapidly in­ creasing by reason of the improved build and amount of the new ships, the num­ ber of our ships lit for sea duty grows very slowly. Twenty-six additional ves­ sels* have been authorized and appropri­ ated for, but it is probable that when they are completed our list will only be increased to forty-two, a gain of five. The old wooden ships are disappearing almost as fast as the new vessels are ad­ ded. One of these new ships may, in lighting strength, be equal to two of the old, but it cannot do the cruising duties of two. It is important, therefore, tliut we should have a more rapid increase in the number of serviceable ships. Indian Jue»tion. The report of the secretary of the in­ terior exhibits the transaction^ of the government in connection with the In­ dian tribes. Substantial progress has been made in the education of the child­ ren of school age and in the allotment of lands to adult Indians. It is to be re­ gretted that the policy of breaking up the tribal relation and of dealing with the Indian as au individual did not ap­ pear earlier in our legislation. Large reservations, held in common, and the maintenance of the authority of the chiefs and head men, have deprived the individual of overr incentive to the exercise of thrift, and the annuity has contributed au affirma­ tive impulse towards a state of con­ firmed pauperism. We can no longer push the Indian into the wilderness, and it remains only, by every suitable agency, to push liim upward into the state of a self supporting and responsible citizen. For the adult,*the lirst step is to locate him upon a farm, and for the child, to place him in school. SioiiK lU'scrvHtiun. The last congress enacted two distinct laws relating to negotiations with the Sioux Indians of Dakota'for a relinquish­ ment of a jHrt:on of their land to the United States, and for dividing the re­ mainder into separate reservations. Under the lirst of these the-commis­ sion appointed by me secured the con­ sent of a majority of the adults to the agreement, but their report has not yet been made to me. I shall not. as at present advised, deem it necessary to submit the agreement to congress for ratification, but it will in due course be submitted, for information. 

CJITMOKEE OUTLET. A conference between the Cherokee commission and the Cherokees was be­ gun Nov. 0, but no results have yet been obtained, nor is is believed a conclusion can be immediately expected. The cattle syndicate now occupies the lands for grazing purposes is ciearlv one of the agencies responsible for the obstruction of negotiations with the Cherokees. Th« large body of agricultural lands consti­ tuting weat is known as }he Cherokee outlet, ought not to be, and indeed can­ not long be heUl for grazing, and for the advantage of a few against the public interests and the bet advantage of tlw Indians themselves. (lovrrniiunil ,|:r Oklahoma. 1 did. on the 2ud day of March last, is­ sue a proclamation declaring that tin lands known us Oklahoma would he open to settlement under the provisions of the law on the 2'.M day of April following at 12 o'clock noon. Ii is much to the civdit of the settlers that they very generally observed the limitation as to the time when they might enter the territory. Care will betaken that those who tyitered in violation of the law did not secure the aduantage they unfairly sought. It is estimated that there are now in the terri­ tory about K),000 people, and several con­ siderable towns have sprung up for which temyorary municipal government have been organized. I very urgently recom­ mend that conjoess at once produce a territorial government for these people. Serious questions which may at any time lead io violent outbreaks are awaiting the institutions of courts for the peaceful adjustment. The American genius for self government has been well illustrated in Oklahoma, but it is neither safe nor wise to leave these jieopie longer to the expedients which have temporarily served them. ttMiiiuiuemlnl fur Alaska. Provisions should be nutde for the ac­ quisition of titles to town lots in towns now established in Alaska for locating low* sites and for the establishment^of municipal governments. Only the min­ ing laws have been extended to that ter­ ritory, and no other form of title to land can now lie obtained. The general land laws were framed with reference to this dis|Kisition of agricultural laud, and it is doubtful if their operation in Alaska would lie beneficial. We have for­ tunately not extended to Al­ aska the mistaken policy of es­ tablishing reservations for the Indian tribes and can deal with them from the beginning as individuals with, 1 am sure better results. Hut any disposition ol the public lands and any regulations re­ lating to tinilter and to the fisher should have a kindly r«-gard to tlu-i.- .n- terests. Having no power to levy taxes the people of Alaska are wholly depend­ ent upon the general government, to whose revenues the seal fisheries make a large contribution. An appropriation for education should neither he overlooked nor stinted. The smallness of the popu­ lation and the great distances between the settlements offer serious obstacles to the establishment of the usual territorial or in of government. Perhaps the or­ ganization of several subdistricts, with small municipal council of limited pow­ ers tor each, would be safe and useful. I'ttllNioilM. The law provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who wii3 mustered into the service of the United States during the civil war and is now suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in the service and the line of dutv. Two of three necessary facts, viz: Muster and disability are usually susceptible ot" easv proof: but the third origin in the service is often difficult and iu many deserving cases impossible to establish. That very many of those who endured the hard­ ships of our most bloody and arduous campaigns are now disabled from dis­ eases that had a real, not trace­ able, oaigin in service we do not doubt besides, those are another class composed of men. many of whom served an enlistment of the full three years, and of re-enlisted veterans, who added a fourth year of service, who escaped the casualties of battles andthe assaults of disease, who were alwavs ready for any detail, who were in every battle line of their command, and ere mustered out in sound health, and have since the close of the war, while fighting with the same indomitable spirit Un­ contests of civil life been overcome by disease or casualty. I am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large annual expenditure, neither am I deterred by that fact from recom­ mending that congress grant a pension to such honorably discharged soldiers and sailors of the civil war. as having rendered substantial service during the war are now dependent upon their own lalx»r for a maintenance, or by disease or casualty are incapacitated from earning it. Many of the men who would be in­ cluded in this form of relief are now de­ pendant upon public aid, and it does not my judgment consist with the na­ tional honor that they shall continue to subsist on indiscriminate local relief given to paupers instead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation they served so gallantly and unselfishly. Our people will, I am sure, very gener­ ally approve such legislation, and I am equally sure that the survivors of the Union army and navy will feel a grate­ ful sense of relief when this worthy and suffering class of their comrades is "fairly cared fox*. There is some manifest irreg­ ularities in the existing law that should be remedied. To some of these the sec­ retary of the interior has called atten­ tion. The N«\v States. The auvent of four new states South Dakota, North Dakota. Mantana and Washington into the Union under the constitution in tiie same month, and the admission of their duly chosen represen­ tatives to our national congress at thu Bailie session is an event as un­ exampled as it is interesting. Each of these states has within it re­ sources the development of which will employ the energies* of and yield a com­ fortable subsistence to a great population. The smallest of these new states, Wash­ ington, stands twelfth, and the largest, Montana, third among tiie forty-two in area. The people of these states are al­ ready well trained, intelligent and patri­ otic American citizens, having common jnterest* and sympathies with those of the older states, and common purpose to defend the intesrity and uphold the honor of the nut.'o.i. Railway Legislation. The attention of the interstate com­ merce commission has been called to the urgent need of congresional legislation for the better protection of the lives and limbs of those engaged in operating the great interstate freight lines of tb- coun­ try. and especially of the yard men and br«ikemen. A petition signed !iv nearlv 1U.00I) railway irakemen was pre­ sented to the commission asking that steps might lie taken to bring about the u.-.e of automatic brakes and couplings on freight cars. At a meeting ot the state railroad cum misfioners liul their acredited reprctsen tatives, held at Washington in ilxrch last, upon the invitation of the interstate commerce commission, a resolution was unanimously adopted urging the com­ mission **to consider what can be done to prevent the loss of life an limb in coupling and uncoupling freightcars and in handling the braues of such cars." It Is competent. 1 think, for congress to re­ quire uniformity in the construction of cars used in interstate commerce and the use of improved safety appliances upon such trains. Jf]iui'tiiii'iit of Agriculture. The creation of an executive depart­ ment to le known as the department of agriculture by the act of Feb. 9. last, was a wise and timely response to a re­ quest which had long I.een respectfuliv urged by the farmers of the the country hut much remains to be done to perfect the organization of the de­ partment. so it fairly realizes the expeet ations which its creation excited. In this connection attention is called to suggestions in the report of the secretary which is herewith submitted. The neeil of a law otlicer for the department, such as is provided for the executive de|»art ments. is manifest. The failure of the last congress to make the usual provi­ sion for the publication of the annual report, should be promptly remedied, public interest in the report and its value to the farming community. I am sure, will not bo diminished under the new organization of the department. Signal Service. I recommend that the weather service be separated from the war department, and established aa a bureau iu the agri­ cultural department. This will involve an entire reorganization, both of the weather bureau and the signal corpa, making of the first a purely civil organ­ ization. an»l of the other a purely mili­ tary staff corps. The report of the chief nigiial otticer shows that the work of the corps on its military $ide has lieen dete­ riorating. World's Fair. The nroposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by the opening of a world's fair or exposition in some one of the great cities, will be presented for consid­ eration bv congress. The value and in­ terest of audi au exposition may well claim the attention of the general gov­ ernment. IHnlriil of Columbia. The interests of the people of the Dis­ trict of Columbia should not be lost sight of in the pressure for consideration"of measures affecting the whole country. Having no legislature of its own, either municipal or general, its people must look to congress for the regulation of these concerns that are the subject of local control. Our whole people have an interest that the natiooal capital should be made attractive and beautiful, and above all that its repute for social order should be maintained. The laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks in the district should be revised with a view to bringing the traffic under strin­ gent limitations and control. I-aiul l.avvK. Iii the administration of the land laws the policy of facilitating in every proper way the adjustment of the honest claims of individual settlers on the public lands has been pursued. The number of pend­ ing cases had during the preceding ad­ ministration has been greatly increased under the operation of orders for a time suspending linal action in a large part of the cases, originating in the West and northwest, and by the subsequent use of unusual methods of examination. Only those who are familiar with the conditions under which our ag­ ricultural lands have been settled, can appreciate serious and often fatal conse­ quences to a settler of a policy that puts his title under suspicion or delays the is­ suance of his patents, while care is taken to prevent and expose fraud. It should not be imputed without reason. The manifest purpose of the homestead and pre-emption laws was to promote the settlement of the public domain by per­ sons having a bona iide intent to make a home upon the selected lands. Where this intent is well established and the requirements of the law have been substantially complied with the claimant is entitled to a prompt and friendly con­ sideration of his case. But where" there is reason to believe that the claimant is the mere agent of another, who is seek­ ing to evade a law intended to promote small holdings, and to secure by fraudu­ lent methods large tracts of timber lands and other lands, both principal and agents should be thwarted and punished. Civil Service. My predecessor, on the 4th day of January. 18S!, by an executive order to take effect March 15,brought the railway mail service under the operation of the civil service law. Provision was made that the order should take efTect sooner in any state where an eligible list was sooner obtained. On the 11th day of March .Mr. Lyman, then the only mem­ ber of the commission, reported to me in writing that it would not be possible to have the list of eligibles ready before May 1, and requested that the taking effect of the order be postponed until that time, which was done, subject to the same provisions contained in the or­ iginal oroer as to states iu which an elig­ ible list was sooner obtained. As a re­ sult of the revision of the rules of the new classification and of the inclusion of the railway mail service, the work of the commissioner has been greatly increased, and the present clerical force is found to he inadequate. I recommend that the additional clerks asked for by the commissioner be appropriated for. The growth of the country and the con­ sequent increase of the civil list have magnified the appointive function of the executive disproportionately. It cannot be denied, however, that the labor con­ nected with this necessary work is in­ creased often to the point of actual dis­ tress by the sudden and excessive de­ mands that are made upon an incoming ulniinist ration for removals and appoint­ ments. But on the other hand it is not true that incumbency is a conclusive ar­ gument for a continuance in office. Im­ partiality. moderation, fidelity to public duty and a good attainment in the dis­ charge of it, must be added before the argument is complete. AVlien those holding administrative offices so conduct themselves as to convince just political op)Hnents that no party consideration or bias affects in any way the discharge of their public duties, we can more easily stay tiie demands for removals. 1 aui satisfied that lioth ill and out of the clai-fcitied service great benefit wouhP ac­ crue from*tlie adoption of some system hv which the otticer would receive the distinction and benefit that in all private employments comes from exceptional faithfulness and efficient:}' in ttie per­ formance^ dutv. 1 1 On the 4th of March, last, the civil ser­ vice commission had but a single mem­ ber. The vacancies were filled on the Tth day of May. and since then the com­ missioners have been industriously, though with inadequate force, engaged in executing the law. They were as­ sured by me that a cordial support would be given them in the faithful and impartial enforcement of the statute and of rules and regulations adopted iu aid of it. Heretofore the book of eligibles lias been closed to every one, except as certifications were made upon the requi­ sition of the appointing officers. This secrecy was the source of much suspi­ cion and of many charges of favoritism in the administration of the law. What is secret is always suspected and what is open can be judged. The commission, with the full approval of its members, has opened the list of eligibles to the pub­ lic. The eligibles for jHjstotfice and cus­ toms are now publicly posted in the re­ spective offices as are the certifications for appointments. The purpose of the civil service law was absolutely to exclude other consideration in connection with appointments under it than that of merit as tested by the examinations. The bus­ iness proceeds upon the theory that both the examining board and the appointing officers are absolutely ignorant as to the political views and associates of all per­ sons on the civil service lists. It is not much to say, however, that some recent congressional investigations have some­ what shaken public confidence in the im­ partiality of the selections for appoint­ ments. The reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory ad­ vance until the present law and its equal administration are well established in the confidence of the people. It will be my pleasure, as well as my ihitx, to see that the law is executed with firmness and impartiality. If some of its provi­ sions have been fraudulently evaded by appointingofticers, our resentment should not suggest the repeal of the law, but re­ form in its administration. We should have one view of the matter, and hold it with a sincerity that is not affected by the consideration that the party to which we belong is for the time in power. 1 1 KlilH'MtlMH. The interest of .the general govern­ ment in the education of the jieople found an early expression, not only in the thoughtful and sometime* warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, but in lib* ral appropriations from the com­ mon resources lor tbesu|)jK)it of educa­ tion in the new states. So one will de­ ny that it is of the greatest national con- cern that those who hold tin ultimate control of all public affairs should have the necessary intelligence wisely to di rect and determine them. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grunts, and in that form the constitutional power of congress to promote the education of people is not seriously questioned. I do not think it can le successfully questioned when the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the public treasury. Such aid should be as it always has been sug­ gested by some exceptional conditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves, the bestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of theabil ity of the states where these new citizens were chiefly found to be adequately pro vided with educational facilities, pre sented not only exceptional but unexam E1 led conditions that the situation has een much ameliorated, there is no doubt. The ability and interest o.f the states have happily increased, but a great work remains to be done, and I think the general government should lend its aid. As the suggestion of national grants in aid of education grows chiefly out of conditions aud needs of the emancipated slave and his designs, the relief should, as far as possible while necessarily proceeding upon some gen­ eral lines, be applied to the need that suggests it. It is essential, if much good is to be accomplished, that the svnipathy and active interest of the people of the states should be enlisted, and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate aid, and not to supplant local taxation for school purposes, as one con gress cannot bind a succeeding one in such a case, and as the effort must, in some degree, be experimental. I Tl»e Coloretl Vote. The colored pesple did not intrude themselves upon ns. They were brought here in cliainsand held in the community where they are now chiefly found by a cruel slave code. Happily for both races. they are now free. They have, from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty which was our shame, not theirs, made remarkable advances in education and in the acquisition of property. They have, as a people, shown themselves to be friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptations of tremendous strength. They have their representa­ tive.? in the national cemeteries where a grateful government has gathered the ashes of those who died in its defense. In civil life they are the workers of their communities', making their full contribution to the widening streams of prosperity which the communities are receiving. Their sudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disor der in the household. Generally they do not desire to quit their homes and their employers resent the interference of the emigration agents who seek to stimulate such a desire. But, notwithstanding all I this, ill many parts of our country where the colored population is large, the peo pie of that race are by various devices deprived of any effect of their political rights, of many of their civil rights. The long does not expend itself upon th(«c whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged, It has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of respect foT the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils. Surely no one sup poses that the present can be accepted as a permanent condition. If it is said that thesu communities must work out this problem for themselves, we have aright to ask whether they are at work upon it? Do they suggest any solution? When and under v, hat condi tions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he, in fact, to have these full civil rights which have so long*been his in law? When is that equality of influence which our form of I government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? This genera­ tion should courageously face these grace questions, aim not leave them as a heritage of wee to the next. Tiie consti­ tution should proceed upon lines of jus­ tice and humanity and not of prejudice and cruelty. No ocestion in our country can l)e at rest except upon the firm basis of justice and of la»«. 1 earne.-tiy im ite the attention of congress to the consider­ ation of such metir-uiva within it-, well defined con.^tiiuiioiial powers as N\ii! cure to ail our people a free exercise of the right c.r slit:rage and every other civil light under the constitution and laws of (lie I nited Suites.

A partial and qualified supervision ot th.*se elections is now provided by law. ami. in mv opinion, the law may be i-o strength­ ened and extended as to secure on the whole better results than can be attained bv a law taking all the processes of such election into federal control. The col­ ored man should lie protected in all of his relations to the federal government whether as litigant, juror or witness in our courts, as an elector of members of congress, or as a i»eaceful traveler on our interstate railways. Merchant Marin*. There is nothing more justly humiliat­ ing to the national pride, and nothing more hurtful to the national prosperity, than the inferiority of our merchant ma line compared with the other nations whose general resources, wealth and sea coast lines do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on the sea. It was not always so. and our people are agreed. 1 think, that it shall not continue to W so. That the great steamship lines sailing under the Hags of England. France.

That the American lines of steamships have been abandoned by us to an unequal contest with the aided lines of other nations until they have been withdrawn, or in the few cases where they are still maintained are sub­ ject to serious disadvantages is a matter of common knowledge. I recommend that such appropriations bo made for ocean mail service and American steam­ ships between our ports and those of Central and South America,China, Japan and the important islands in both of the great oceans as will be liberally remu iterative for the service rendered as will encourage the establishment and in some fair degree equalize the chances of Amer­ ican states lying south of us will cordi­ ally co-operate in establishing and main­ taining such lines of steamships to their principal ports I do not doubt. We should also make provision for a naval reserve, to consist of such merchant ships of American construction, and of a spe­ cified tonnage and speed as the owners will consent to place at the use of the government in case of need, as armed cruisers. England has adopted this pol­ icy, and as a result can now upon neces­ sity at once place upon the naval list some of the fastest steamships in the world. A proper supervision of the construction of such vessels would make their conversion into effective ships of war very easy. I am an advocate of economy in our national ex­ penditures, but it is misuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds an expenditure for the pur­ pose of extending our foreign commerce. The enlargement and improvement of our merchant marine, the development of a sufficient body of trained American seamen, the promotion of rapid and reg­ ular mail communication between the pcrts of other countries and our own and the adaptation of large and swift Ameri­ can mercliant steamships to naval uses in time of. war are public purposes of the highest concern. The legislation which. I have suggested, it is sincerely believed.'will promote the peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and security of the people. I invoke the diligent anil serious attention of congress to the consideration of these and such other measures as may be pre­ sented, having the same great end in view. BENJAMIN HARRISON.
