Wkt Sfottias Mief SOL. 3ILJER, Editor. TftOY, KAXSAS: Thursday, December 5, 1878. State Pjuxtec The State Printer contest come np again, this Winter. We have a prefer ence among the candidates, lint hare no interest in the office, and shall, therefore, not advocate the claims or any caudldato. Bat there is a candidate who is malting a strong effort, whom we do not want to see elected. That candidate is Samnel Dodsworth, of Leavenworth. It has been charged that George Martin does commer cial printing, that ought to go to the offices in the several Cocntie. Unt Mr. Martin says he never solicit sneh wojlc, and takes it only when it is tbrnst upon him; and tbt tbe major part of the commercial work that he does, is such a the country offices are not prepared to do. Unt Samuel Dodsworth is the worst competitor that Kansas country printing offices have. He is constantly, in person or by letter or sample, so liciting work tUat Intimately belongs to offices in the several Counties. Year after year, Coun ty Doardi are solicited to give him the printing of assessment blanks, tax receipts, County war rants, and all manner of other County blanks, that the offices in ilie Comity are prepared to do. By gettiug the work fur a large number of Counties, he is enabled to do It at reduced pric es, and therefore ho is constantly undermining the conutry i.fflerJi. The St. Joe. Steam Print ing Company do not do this, and we do not be lieve that George W. Uarllti d, or that other candidates for Printer wonld. Mr. Dodsworth is the only mau who noses in, and seeks to take from the country primer bis legitimate patiou oge. We hpe the KaiiMi pspe rs n ill pass bim around, and do all in their pmvir to keep him out of a ponitiou iu which he could do them still greater damage. Bkfobm A glorious thing is Reform. If Ke pnhlicans can be baten ou the issue of Keforni, itis a graud achievement, although Republicans may have conducted public affairs with the strictest integrity. Brown County, west of us, has experienced the benefit of Reform. For years, the Republicans bad control of the Connty offices, and iu that time not dollar was lost to the people. But the Grange reformation struck the County, and the people wanted Reform. They elected a Reformer County Treasurer, over a good Republican, and re-elected him; and when he could no longer be re elected, by reason of a wise provision in onr laws, his deputy was elected to the office. Then a settlemeut with the Reform Treasurer was necessary. It is now openly asserted that at least $12,000, if not more, has somehow slipped out, during the adminis tration of this Reformer and his Reform depnty. But if the people of Brown County are williug to pay for Reform, they ought to enjoy It. The Democrats aud Reformors have for years been trying to get bold of the important offices of Donlphao County. The Republicau officers liavo never stolen a dollar from the County, but fttill some people are clamorous for Reform. If they ever do succeed iu their designs, it will turn out to be such Reform as the people of Brown Connty have enjoyed. ty The Holton Recorder disputes our asser tion, that Hayes' policy secured Democratic ma jorities in both branches of Congress. It says the House was Democratic beforo Hayes was in augurated. We do not charge that Hayes' pol icy was responsible for every Democratic vio tory, before his election ; but we still staud by our assertion, that be is responsible for Demo cratic majorities in both branches of Congress. Ho betrayed the Republicans of the South, and demoralized and disheartened, for a time, those of tho North. Had he not betrayed tboSmth ern Republicans, they would have elected enough members of Congress, this year, to have made the House Republican. Had it not been for him, the Republicans would have had two Senators from South Carolina, two from Louisi ana, one from Ohio, aud one, if not two, from Indiana. He was responsible for Ohio going Democratic, last year, enabling them to elect a Senator, and to Gerymauder th Statu so as to gain half a dozen or more Cuugressiaau. Hois a first-class fraud, and has done the Republicau party more harm than he could do it good, were he to lire a thousand years, aud devote bis whole time to the business. X5T And now the man who defeated the rene gade, Curtin, in Pennsylvania, is to bo contest ed ont of bis seat. Tho reason, as giveu, is, that tho District Is very strongly Daiuocratic, and everybody expected that Curtin would bo elec ted by at leant 3,000 majority; but he was very sick ut the time of the election, and, to the sur urise of everybody, he was defeated. This makes tho election fraudulent. It is very sin gular that, with every County iu the District having over 1,000 Democratic majority, the Re publicans were able to perpetuate such enor mous frauds at the polls. But a Democratic Congress will place Cnrtiu iu a poiition where the people refused to pnt bim. jf Onu ot the latest Constitutional amend tueuts provides that when the right of suffrage in auy State is abridged or denied to any class of citizens, the representation of that State iu Cougress shall be leduced in proportion. Rep resentative Page, of California, will offer a res olution reducing the representation of those Southern State in which Republicau have been deprived of a vote. But as Congress is Dem ocratic, thcru is no prospect that such a meas ure can pass. However, it will offer an oppor tunity to the Democrats to practice their pro fessions of accepting the Coustitutioual amend ments iu good faith. S We recently mentioned that W. V. Barr, "formerly of Kansas," was the candidate of the Greenbackers, or Nationals, or whatever they call themselves, for Congress in the First Illi nois District, in the vicinity of Chicago. Per haps the reader would like to know how ha came out. lie came out the hindmost of four, falling even below the candidate who ran as a "Socialist-" Out of 23,013 votes cast iu the District, ho received but 1,85.. Ban's popularity docs not seem to increase by immigration. CF Congress is in sessisn. The Southern Democrats and their Northern donkeys express surprise at the President's changed tone. Sena tor Blaine has offered a resolution for investi gating the Southern electiou outrages, and the Democrats are surprised again. They never beard of any oatrages iu the South ; and they want the resolution to include election outrages in the North. t?Tfae slander suit of F. P. Baker, of the Topeka Commonteealth, agaiust tbe publishers of the Kansas City Timet, was tried in the United States Circuit Court at Jefferson City, last week. Baker sued for $20,000 damages. He was award ed $1. Now that he has it, what will be do with it GT It is stated that D. W. Wilder will be ap pointed Chief Clerk of the Secretary of Bute's office, by Mr. Smith. It is a first-class appoint ment. This will leave Ed. Downard out, who lias occupied the position for the past eight years; ty Tho Atchison Globe will please take no tice tkat we know what we are talking about, whoa we fiTe Guthrie tbe credit of writing tbe editorial the Btlleti. concerning Guthrie. jy Learenwortii County seems to be tbe Ga 'jfle od f the State, this ytr.

Now they are won dering why the paper has stopped coming. Tby ought to hare governed themselves by the good common sense and bnsiness rule, which teaches .that when a man offers anything for less than it is possible to product it, the loss must be made good by stealing or swindling, or the enterprise fails. The white paper for that publication alone cannot be bought for lea than about 50 cents a year. How, then, could the printed pa per be offered fur 23 cents a year T The sub scibers might have expected it to stop on their hands, at auy time. It was charged, before tbe electiou, that the baukers and brokers were backing the paper, for the purpose of advocating the most foolish and disgusting Greenback and Communistic doctrines, as the surest way of set ting public opiniuu agaiust them. This charge is still made. Now that tbe elections are over, tbe paper is permitted to die. It would be better if Kausas people patronized home papers, at living prices, rather than send their money to cheap Eastern concerns, to bo swindled. EP Levi Heusel, known as "Bana," well known, a few years ago, as tbe travelling corres pondent of tbe St. Joseph Gazette, bas been in Colorado, for several years past. A late Pueblo paper meutious bis sudden and mysterious dis appearance, aud intimates that a certain female womau bashitnoqapiu-bouk. We don't believe it of Heusel.

The fact is, Guthrie must take charge of the Bulletin, and fill it up regularly. He is old lightuiug with a peuos be is with bis jaw, wbeu tbe subject is himself. ST Louis A. Godey died at Philadelphia, on the 2Stb of November, iu tho ?5th year of bis age. He was the founder of GoJefi Ladj'e Book, and its publisher from that time until about two years ago, when ho retired from business, and his magazine passed iuto the bauds of a Company, possessing noue of the tact or liberal ity of Mr. Godey, and who are rapidly sinking it into oblivion. X3f Douglas was another Kansas County that got tired of Republican rule, aud wauled Re form. They got it, to the tuueof $20,000 to $30, 000 short in the County Treasury ; and it is said that not a dollar of it w ill be recovered. Cy Albert D.

Editor Chief : Here we are, iu the metropolis of the United States, and, as we expect to stay awhile, we shall try to send you a letter weekly, telling your readers the most important news, gossip, etc Tbe police are no nearer a clew as to who desecrat ed the grave of A. T. Stewart than they were two weeks ago ; iu fact, things seem to become more com plicated and confusing as time passes, and the sensa tional New York dalies are about out of material for scare heads. Judge Hilton has offered an additional $5,000, making $30,000, for the arrest and conviction of tho thieves, and return of the body, or $10,000 for any one of tho ghouls, (it is conjectured that there are five men implicated,) and the return of the body. It is a pnzxle to us to know how it will bo proved that the right corpse er bones arc returned. Mrs. Stewart is in very delicate health, and this event has causrd bar to grow worse. The weather has been gloomy and disagreeable, for the past week, but the people move to and fro as lively as on clear days, and business, to all outward appearance, is lively, but on investigation, it is dull, and hundreds are out of employment. This has been the complaint for the last five years, throughout the wfaola country. Talmage draws crowded audiences every Sunday, at the Brooklyn Tabernacle, who listen with the most profound attention to h(s descriptions of the night side of New York. No one nods or sleeps in his presence. He is so full of life himself, that be stirs np every one within hearing distance ; wp think, however, he is too sensational, exaggerates his awful pictures, and describes the disease to soch an extent that he forgets to give a remedy. Perhaps he will give it pretty soon, for he hss promised to tell of tbe bright side of Gotham, as soon as he has finished narrating his dark journey. How the New Yorkers who live on tbe streets whero the elevated railroad passes manage to keep from tearing np the whole roadway, is beyond onr comprehension. Soch a clatter! Every two minutes a train goes thundering by, making more noise than well, we can't tell what. Besides, in the narrow streets, the iron frames and girders shut out the light, and the smoke and dust remain, to make the bad air worw. This mode of transit is of great benefit to those living far from their business, and is a great improvement on the strut cars, for one can keep warm, and get home In a few minutes from his place of teal. A great blessing it is to some, while to oth ers it is a nuisance. CARLOS NOGGS. isawi IX .TIEJIOHIAJ1. nEAD'WaTEK or Salt Rivxk, ) November 15, 1878. $ Ma EblTOE : As tho Greenback party dies an an nual death, I thick it well that we should leave some memorial of onr existence and onr mission behind us. From my present position head waters Salt River I can survey tbe field, and correct our bearings. This shall be done in due time ; and when we enter tbe field in 1879, we shall come a "a giant refreshed from his slumbers." But, in the meantime, let me say to my Greenback friends "who still lire" Be of good cheer. One more funeral like tho present, and we rise to die no more forever. In this contest va bare done well ; we have more than tripled onr num bers, and hold the balance of power in the next Con gress ; and, God be prsissd ! CTen in Kansas, we hare not been unmindful of our dnty. Let ns keep the watch-fires burning, and light oar beacons oo every hill, so that by 1830 we can be prepared for victory, stemember, onr cause is just, and our means are honest. We demand "equal and exact jnstiee for all men." We deroacd that legislation shall b for the interests of off the people the whole people "the greatest good to the greatest number." For these end are governments established among men. For these ends the Revolution was fought and the Re bellion pnt down ; and for these ends are the work ing own combining, and the Greenbackers organiring. We want no rings, no monopolies, no class legisla tion, no bond, and no delated monrgt Away with banks of issue and shoddy money! We want no Peter Funks to tell us how much money we shall use, or of what kind it shall be. Away with them and it give us the greenback without the debasing brand on its back gennine greenbacks and the people shall live again. Give us equal laws, and equal taxation, so that the hardens and blessings of government shall fall, as do the showers of rain, up on all alike; the high and the low, tbe rich and the poor. We ask, in the language of James Madison, in his seventh annual message, that "the notes of the Government shall be issued upon motives of general policy, as a common medium of circulation.' Genu ine greenbacks, these. Now. sir, we Greenbackers have determined not to be "hewers of wood and drawers of water" to this congregation of bondholders, forever. No, sir; that condition of things must cease We can see no in justice iu paving these men in full, in genuine green backs, full legal tenders for all debts, and not all in Fiat gold and Fiat silver. This would give us, in greenbacks, about $1,800,000,000, and something less than we had in 18GG, when the shoddy bankers, with out the fear of "inflation" before their eyes, shoved ont 171,000,000 of their currency onto the people. This 'currency' we can dispense with ; bnt give us good money Uncle Sam's money and the country is safe, and we are content Wonld to God that this could be brought about without the intervention of the Greenback party. Bnt this cannot be done, hence we most organize, let us honor the men who, without money and without price, have borne the brunt of battle, and hild up the cause of honest money, Such men as Taylor, Elder, Gsle, and above all. our gal lant Mitchell, who, by word and work, day and night, everywhere, all over the State, spoke to and stirred the hearts of tbe people as they had never been moved before. Bravely done, "Elder" Mitchell. Ton failed, bnt you deserved success; and every Greenback man will wear you in his heart as a cham pion worthy of his cause, and yet to be honored; for Truth crushed to earth shall rise again, The eternal years of God are hers ; But Error, wounded, writhes in pain. And dies amid her worshippers. In 1830, we shall call you to the front again, and marshal our forces for ono grand charge on the hosts of shoddy. Then shall a ransomed people rejoice, for Itrsumption will have done its work. Resump tion i ah, yes, Resumption will seem a blessing for two months or more, whilst Congress is in session, at least ; but from March 4 to July 4, it will be a vcrv different matter. Then there will be "weeping and wailing, aud gnashing of teeth." Then will Sherman izing be the order of the day. Then we will find that the repeal of the Bankrupt law cannot prevent bank ruptcy, as Sherman promised it would do ; and when Scott, Gould, Vanderbilt, aud Garrett shall have pooled their interests against our Resumption sham, as they will surely do in March next, it will be worse than Jim Fisk or Black Friday. Then look out for Shermanizing on a grand scale ; for it will be nice weather until Congress meets again, and gold and silver are the only legal tenders after Januray next, and shoddy money will be at a discount. Now, in conclusion, let me thank my friends, per sonal and political, who havo honored me by such a generous support, running me ahead of my ticket, even in the face of falsehood and trickery. That I had nothing to do with the passage of the herd law, all inquiring men well know. True, I favored the law, and acted as the attorney of those favoring it, in 1876, and I desired it to be submitted to a vote, and expected it to be done ; and here my mission ended on this subject. Again, I thank you, fellow-citizens, for this evidence of your confidence. Friends of Burr Oak and Wayne, I thank you ; and colored friends everywhere, I more than thank you. Yours, etc., B. 

O'DRISCOLL. JOHN GRABLE. Eiiitob Chief: No person, whether Jew, Gentile, Mohammedan, Brahmin, Free Thinker, or devotee of any other of the one thousand religions of the world, ever walked down into the dark valley of the shadow of death with a firmer step with more fortitude than did John Grablc I visited him at the begin ning of his sickness, and when later he came to the conclusion that ho was soon It, go, and sent for me, I found him cheerful, and perfectly reconciled to tbe mandates of Nature. Knowing nothing of the future, he could frame no belief concerning it. Belief with out evidence he regarded as superstition. Heap, plied the samo rules of reasoning to the solution of this problem that he did to all the questions of life. "As the world goes," said he, "proofs arc called for in finance, politics, bpsiness, law, mathematics, the sciences, etc., and evidence must precede conviction and belief everywhere bnt in theology. There you must go it blind shut your eyes, and run with the crowd." lie thought that whatevor future awaited him, woujd be for the best. Nature committed no wrongs. She dealt honorably and equitably with her children sought their good in this life, and would undoubtedly do so in the next, if there was onr. He was not afraid to trust her. He had a cu riosity to know what, if anything, was behind tbe veil. If he awotp to another existence, he felt as sured of greater scopo for enjoyment than in this life. If he should never wsfcr, he wonld never know it. If he had ever wronged a human being, be did not know it. He thought tbe best preparation fur the next life, if there was one, wss to follow the impulses of love, gnided by the dictates of reason, in this one Reason was the gift of the Infinite, to be a lamp to our ieet a light to our path. A man without reason is a brute a religion without reason was on the same let el. There was bnt one only true religion tbe re ligion of Nature natural religion, and not unnatural religion. His conversation showed that be contem plated death with a philosophic mind, and a simple, childlike trust in the infinite goodness of Nature. He requested me to take his body, after death, to the St. Joseph Medical College, for examination and dissection, and the preparation of his skeleton for lecture-room uses and the museum. I endeavored to dissuade him from this purpose. lie finally said I might do as I thought best bury bim under a tree there, either with or without autopsy, or give his body to the college. If I buried him, I must, of course, use the forms of the Liberals. He did not want a clergyman to officiate. Not that he had anything agaiust them, as individuals, but no did not believe in their doctrines. He thought that if a man belong ed to an organization, whether Masons, Odd-Fellows, Methodists, Catholics, or what not, it was right for his society to bury him with its peculiar honors and rites. As for him, he belonged to the grest church of humanity, apd he wanted to be buried, if buried at all, by its forms. lie knew that I had the song and form books of both the English and American lib erals. Nothing was said about cremation, at that time. The editor of the Ciiemisunderttood me. It was weeks before, while spending the night with me, at Troy, that we talked about cremation. The next day, Mr. Grable seemed better. I bade bim good-bye, and it was the last time I saw him alive. A few days later, he requested his daughter Rose to write for me to come again, bnt the letter never reached me. At his death, he was conscious, and conversed InteUigently to tbe last moment. In deed, he was in the middle of a sentence when life expired. After his death, Mrs. Grable telegraphed for me, as be had directed her to do. I went, ex pecting to bury him. But it appears that in the meantime he had entered into definite arrangements with the college for tbe reception of his body. Upon learning this, 1 made no objection to the carrying ont of his wishes. While I well knew that he had a right to dispose of his body as in his judgment he saw fit, yet I could not help feeling and expressing regret that he had made such a disposition of it imperative upon his family and friends. Dr. Crippen, who was employed by Mrs. Grable to attend the body in a professional capacity, expressed himself as feeling in the matter precisely as I did. It was noon the next day when we got started. To Wathena it was about six miles, and tbe roads very heavy. There a consultation was held, and as Dr. CripPfB willingly offered to assume the responsibili ty of delivering the body to the college in person, withoat farther assistance from ma, it wu thought best for Mrs. Grable and myself to not go over the rirer, bnt trust the body to him. I was" anxious tq get borne, as my wife was sick; and if I went to St. Joseph, it wonld necessitate my remaining away from home another eight- I there handed to Dr. Crippen the paper signed by tha tamily, and request ed him to take receipt for tbe body, and returait to Mr. Grable. Whoever started the story that I re fused to deliver Mr- Grable' body Jo. the Medical College, either started an Intended falsehood, or was incapable of discriminating between a refusal, and language intended to express my willingneM to do it. at the same time wishing it had been otherwise. Perhaps it is wrong for me to entfcrtabi a preference for burial, but nothing was more foreign to my hon est intenllehi than a refusal to carry out Mr. Grable wishes, after I found ont what they were. Arriving at Troy, I met Col. Tracy, of the Herald, just starting tor St. Joseph, and we had a talk about Mr. l.rable s death. I. briefly wrote tbe tacts, ana handed them to him, which appeared in the Herald, signed "S." It is not stated there that I delivered the body to the college. The Chief, however, infer red that I did. Bat it does state that I was commis sioned by Mr. Grable to dispose of his body, and. that it had been delivered to tbe college, in accordance with hut wishes. AU of whkb. was literally true. It is not a matter of overwhelming importance how far I went with the body, or whose custody it was in the balance of the way. I bad so authority to publish Dr. Crippen's name in connection with the matter, and therefore did not. From some remarks of bis, I have serious donbts about his thanking any one for his name being used. After the issue of November 1, the editor of the Chief met me upon the street, and we had some talk abont Mr. Grable' death, but he did not hint that he intended publishing anything further on the subject. In interviewing for publication, it is nsual(l J to In form the victim to that effect, thereby putting him on his guard ; and (2) to put it in writing, and read it to him for approval. Neither was done. I was sorry any reference was made in his editorial to some of Mr. Grable' neighbors, or to hi property, or to tbe theology of the tamily, ot to the crowd that gath ered there that night. I did not say I was in danger of being mobbed, bnt that at one time I thonght, If tbe liquor hebl out, there might be a mob or a row before morning. At one time, by actual count, I saw fifteen men inside and several outside the house, be sides tho hired maa and myself; Dr. Crippen not hav ing arrived. They conversed among themselves, bnt I overheard some denunciations abont the disposition of the bod v. There were no threats or demands made, that I know of. Some drunken ruffians came into the room where the hired maa and I;had retired, and jerked the clothes off the1 bed, and wanted to fight. One of them offered to ump" me for "two cents." The price appeared extremely low, but not being In fighting condition, I declined the entertainment. This might or might not havo been an attempt to get a row started. They stole a rair of gloves out of my overcoat pocket, and a monkey-wrench ont of my buggy- But it was not my intention to make tbe affair public, and I regret that the Chief mentioned it, The faets, however, are as I state them. People can draw their own conclusions. Instead of 210, Mr. Grable owned 433 acres of land. Liabilities, HfiOO, at 10 per cent, $900 having three instead of two years to run. Mr. Grable was sot what I call an Infidel. Rev. John Cook's definition of tbe word is unquestionably correct. In a sermon here in Troy, he held that church members who were unfaithful to their pro fessions and their beliefs, wrro the real Infidels, and not those unbelievers who eert consistent and faithful to their beliefs. The word Infidel means not faithful. Mr. Grable tntlr faithful in every sense of the word. He did not dis-believo in a future life, as yon stated. On that question he 'was negative or passive neither believed or disbelieved. Still, he thought the evidence was against it However, he hofed that, in her intricate and mighty potencies and powers, Nature had made provision (by a higher stato of existence, where he could go on with the re searches and studies begun in this. And when you come down to the point, that is where most men stand. When yen find n man that Jruoirt all about the In finite and the future existence, &c, 4c, you gener ally find an ass. Mr. Grable prudently refrained from guesting about what he knew nothing of, but still thought that his guess was as good as a preach er's. Mr. Grablc didnt believe in "speerits." He thought that if he survived the dissolution of this body, he would exist still in a natural body ore fined and ethererialized form of matter and that in time, one might wear out, nnd give place to a higher type, and so on. He thought that a thing was either something or nothing, and it couldn't be something unless it had substance. Outside of matter in some of its forms, visible or Invisible, thcrp w as nothing. As to his financial scheme, it was not so visionary and Utopian as some wonld make ns believe He had advocated it for forty years. It was simply to have our paper circulating medium based upon real estate, instead of gold and silver. The specie basis, said he, a like an ash hopper standing on the little end no basis no foundation ten dollars in circu lation based on one, (perhaps -nothing.) and that one a little scrap of metal that was neither food, raiment, or shelter. The land basis was the ash-hopper stand ing on the big end, like a pyramid no panic could overturn it. He had it arranged so as to bo sclf-reg-ulating as to volume, and largely beyond tho control of those enemies to their race those human vultures who are tbe authors of more misery than war, pes tilence, aud famine and w ho, for a dozen years, have fattened and gloated over the wretchedness they caused and are causing in our lamb Mr. Grable had corresponded with philanthropists, and his theories may, in time, conic to the front S.
