THE PRESS COMMEfJTS ON MESSAGE EASTERN PAPERS GENERALLY HAVE KIND WORDS FOR TAFT BUT RATHER PErLORK WHAT TTIKY CALL "THE EVIDENT LACK OF LEADERSHIP." (united picas LaAmw wins. New York, Dec. 7. Tho New York newspapers, commenting on President Taft's annual message to congress, call It restful after "the procedure practiced In the previous administration," but not a few of the commentaries contain a note of disappointment because there Is .no note of leadership. The World finds the message con ciliatory, but Btrangely unresponsive to the popular needs of the nation. and towards Its aspirations. It sums the document up as a "stand- pat" message. The Sun-Is apparently most satis fied with Taft's work. "Look before you legislate," Is the substance of the message as the . Sun editorial puts It. "How different was tho procedure consistently practiced In the previous administrations," the editorial . continues. The Herald finds the message one of "rest and peace." In commenting on the message the Press finds some cause for defend ing the president. "Taft's careful ness in dealing with a situation dif ficult of management, does not mean that at the right moment he would not act positively and forcefully,'' says the Post. "The tone of the message la ad mirable. It is as straightforward as the character of the writer," says the American. The Tribune finds the message a "persuasive utterly honest docu ment, marked throughout by patri otic Intent to serve the nation's best "Of actual recommendations for new laws there are not a few In the message," the Times says, "but none are of a disturbing nature." The Evening Post criticizes the lack of leadership. "The message Is uninspiring and gives no positive lead," says the Post . "Instead of a call to action, Taft has written a te dious, practical review."
