The exact figures as prepared by the newly-created budget bureau and transmitted by President Harding in a special message, were $3,505,745,- 727, including an estimated deficit of $21,509,000 in the operations of the postal service. This total represented u decrease of $402,107,639 from the $3,907,922,- 800 estimated expenditures for the ■current fiscal year uud $2,032,285,902 from the actual expenditures in the fiscal year 1921.

Actual appropriations asked of con gress for the various federal depart ments and agencies for 1923 total $3,- 224,875,592, exclusive of postoftlce de partment.

The navy estimate of $431,754,000, It might be explained, does not take Into account any possible reductions that might be brought about as a re sult of the arms conference.
