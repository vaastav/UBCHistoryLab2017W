Those who have the time and inclination to read the long message sent by President Arthur to Congress on Tuesday, will find it a businesslike document, and remarkably free from clap trap and sensational effects.— The state of our diplomatic relations wllb the hig and the little governments of the world is mentioned. A summary of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury is given, showing that the re ceipts during the present fiscal year will rcacli $400,000,000 and the expenditures $270,000,- 000, leaving a surplus of $180,000,000 for pay ment on the public debt. In view of Ibis large surplus the President recommends tbe abolition of all revenue taxes except those on tobacco and alcoholic liquors, and a revision of the tariff laws. Under the present rate of taxation the public debt might be paid in ten years, but the President thinks it would be better to relieve the people, in some measure, of the burden of taxation which they have borne so long. He favors on increase of the regular army to 30,000 men, and recommends the rehabili tation of the navy. He treats at length of Indian affairs and re commends the passage of an act extending the protection and authority of the courts and laws over the Indians and Indian reser vations ; the allotment of lands to the Indians individually and liberal appropriations for Indian schools. He also asks for stringent laws to suppress polygamy in Utah. The President has a good deal to say on the subject of civil service reform, but the country is used to the promise and never ex pects to see the performance. President Ar thur will take good care to appoint only stal wart Republicans to office, and if any other •class of politicians expect to come in for places under bis civil service reform, they will probably find themselves mistaken. Deepening Hush River. In another column Capt. Eidridge AV Gallup, of the Dairy Farm, gives his views in relation to the subject of deepening Bush river. He shows how advantageous to the fanning and canning interests of a very large section of Harford reliable water communica tion with market from the head of Bush river would be. lu sending grain alone to market the advantage of water transporta tion is easily seen. If wheat, for instance, i sent by the cars, besides the freight it is sub ject to charges for drayage, and if Hie buyer happens to reject the lot, for any reason, an other charge for drayage must be paid On the contrary, if grain is sent by vessel it can be unloaded at the elevators at once and the certificates received for it have a standard market value, according to the quality of the grain. The charges for drayage' are also avoided, and the shipper is no longer subject to the wh m of the buyer. It is true that for a portion of the year river-navigation might he interrupted by ice, but generally farmers anil emitters have hauled out the bulk of their crops before the river closes. The improvement contemplated,is a. most important one, ami we therefore hope that Mr. Scager, whom Col. Craighill has assigned to the duty of deepening the channel of Bush river, will receive every assistance Irotn the farmers interested. On Tuesday, aa announced last week, Mi . Seager, assistant engineer, was at Bush river Bridge, for the purpose of meeting parties in terested in the improvement of the river.— Capt. Gallup was the only person present Mr. Seager informed him that he had made an examination of the river, from the railroad bridge to the Public Landing, and also a par tial examination of Bush creek to the Furnace wharf. He thought that at a small expense a channel could be opened to the Public Land ing, giving six feet of water at medium low tide. Mr. Seager proposes to make two esti mates, one for a channel of 30 feet and the other for one of 130 feet in width, affording from seven to eight feet of water at average high tide. Mr. Seager is desirous of obtain ing all tlie information lie can in regard to the amount of freighting before the river be came obstructed, and what would probably be the advantages of clearing out the channel. It is believed there will lie no difficulty in se curing the necessary appropriation, if our cit izens will manifest sufficient interest in the matter. The Trial ofGniteaii. The cross-examination of Guileau, which was concluded Inst Friday, probably left the Jury in doubt whether he is more knave than fool. Ho manifested a strong aversion to having ins act spoken of as murder. He re marked that it was such a “cold-blooded word ” He would not admit that lie was insane, but said that was a question for the experts and the jury to decide. He clung to his inspiration theory, however, declaring thjt the killing of tire President was the Deity’s act, not his. On Saturday Senator David Davis was called to the witness stand by the defence.— He was examined ns to the political condi tion of the country before the assassination of President Garfield. He gave it as his opin ion that the success of the Democratic party at this time or at the next Presidential election would not imperil the republic, or bring on another civil war. If there be any war it will come from some where else than the South. A number of medical experts, who have been watching Guileau closely during tbe trial, were examined. To a hypothetical question, based upon the truth of the evi dcncc to which thij had listened, all of them pronounced Guitcnu insane at the lime he shot the President. The trial, it is now thought, will soon he over. The result is, of course, extremely doubtful, since no safe predictions can lie made upon the decision of a jury. The pub lic, however, lias generally come to the con clusion that Guitean's insanity is not of the character which would relieve him of re sponsibility to the law for the murder of the President. He is undoubtedly insane, just ns hundreds of other people may be said to be insane—when they pursue one idea to the exclusion of everything else, Guileau ap pears to be insane upon the subject of Ids own self-importance, and mistook an inspira tion of Satan for an inspiration of the Deity V The New Congress.— I The forty-seventh Congress assembled at Washington on Mon day. The Republicans, as was expected, con trolled the organization of the House and elected J. Warren Keifcr.ofOhio, as Speaker, and Edward McPherson, of Pennsylvania, as Clerk. The Democrats voted for Mr. Ran dall for Speaker, and Geo. M. Adams, of Kentucky, for Clerk. The Grcenbackers, eight in number, also went through tlie form of making nominations and voting for their candidates. In tlie Senate, business began at once. Among tlie first hills proposed wns one by Senator Sherman lo provide for the issue of tlirce per cent, government bonds. At tlie last session of Congress the Democrats passed a bill to fund a large part of Hie national debt at three per cent., but President Hayes, with the sanction of Sherman, vetoed it, anil Hie rate was fixed at 8$ per cent. Hayes’s stupidity lias thereby cost Hie country a mil lion and a-half of dollars a year more than was necessary in interest on Hie public debt. Tills fact should be borne in mind when the Republicans begin to boast of their economi cal finance measures. Both houses of Congress are now in full accord with President Arthur's stalwart ad ministration. No place was found in the or ganization for Garfield Republicans, Secretary Kirkwood for President. — Tlie Cleveland (Ohio) Herald predicts that “the next Republican candidate for President of the United Stales will come from lowa, and his name will be Kirkwood.” While wo should be highly gratified if a native of old Harford should receive so dis tinguish! d a mark of the confidence ami es teem of ids parly, we can assure our co-tem porary that if Gov. Kirkwood should I t nominated as the Republican candidate for Hie Presidency be cannot win in Hie contest of 1884. Wc will “predict” that the next Democratic candidate for the Presidency, will, in all probability,conic from Pennsyl vania, that ids name will he Hancock, and Hint he will be elected. —The Baltimore Gazette lias been Bold to a syndicate, composed of members of Hie Mer chants’ and Manufacturers’ Association, of which ex-Mnyor Lntrobe and James A. Garv Into Republican candidate for Governor, arc said to be Hie principal parties interested.— Mr. Win. B. Ilnzolton, managing iditor of Hie American, is to have charge of it. Mr. Hnzelton wields a pen as keen and bright as Sidndin’s scimitcr, and will put new life into Hint journal, which will, after January Ist, lie called The Times. L‘ocal Affairs.

Surprise Party to a Minister —On Thanks giving night a number of members of Mt. Ver non M, E. Church called in a body at the res idence of their pastor, Rev. J. Duey Moore, in Dublin, taking bim and his family by surprise. Their visit proved to be something more than a mere friendly call, for they had taken with them provisions of all kinds to replenish tbe larder, and also feed for his hard-worked horse. A pleasant incident connected with the affair was Hie presentation of a handsome buffalo robe to Rev. Mr. Moore, from friends belonging to Mt Vernon, Emory, Dublin and Franklin appoint ments. The presentation was made by Mr. E Iwin Williamson, in a neat speech, to which Mr. Moore responded in a feeling manner. Alto gether Ihe affair was a merited compliment to a faithful, efficient and beloved pastor. Ice in the Pulpit, and Who Put it There, was tbe title of an entertaining lecture, deliver ed at the Court House, on Monday night, by Rev. O. F. Fltppo, of Alexandria, Va. The lec turer graphically and humorously depleted Ihe causes which conspire to freeze Ihe warmth out of ministers in the pulpit, such us Inattentive, pre occupied and sleepy hearers, disaffected and over-sensitive members, scientific singing, Ate. Tbe entire fault was not laid at the pew doors* however, but ministers themselves came In for a share of bionic for lee in the pulpit—their blunders and occasional want of tact and com mon sense being also discussed. The lecture, while it abounded in many happy hits and mirth provoking illustrations, contained also Hashes of earnest eloquence, that checked for a lime the flow of laughter in (he audience. The lecture was highly uppreelat. d by the audience, which consisted of about 150 persons. A Chase and a Capture-—On Monday Rev. A. J. Burrow, rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church, Kingsville, Baltimore county, while on a visit to a brother clergyman in Bel Air, left his horse and carriage at the Grangers’ Hotel. Dur ing the afternoon two men adroitly managed to obtain possession of the horse and vehicle and drove off in It. One of them engaged in t onver sation in the bar room with Mr. Forwood, the proprietor of the’hotcl, while the other went lo the hostler in the yard, and ordered the horse and carriage. The hostler asked him where the other gentlemen were who came in the carriage, and the reply was that they were waiting in front of the hotel. The two men then got into the carriage and drove off, in the direction of Churchvilic. Several hours afterwards Rev. Mr. Barrow came for his horse, when the robbery was discovered. Mr. Forwood, Mr. J. H. Ber* rlan, of New York, who hud accompanied Mr. Barrow to Bel Air, and Deputy Sheriff White ford, immediately started in pursuit, and traced the men lo (Jhurchville, whore they stopped to take a drink. From there the men went to Hopewell, and turned at that point in the direc tion of Glenville. Near the cheese factory, on the Hopewell and Glenville road, they were overhauled Mr. Forwood sprang out of his buggy and seizing the bridle of the stolen horse ordered the men to surrender. They threatened resistance, but the sight of u pistol in Mr. For woud’h hands quieted them. They were brought back lo Bel Air, with the stolen pioperty, and lodged in jail. Their names are John H. Fergu son, living near Prospect School House, and David A. Hawkins, of Stafford Locks. Justice Snowden committed them to Jail, in default of 

SBOO security each, for their appearance ui the February term of court. An Important Insurance Decision.— Points of considerable interest and impoitanee to nu m bers of tlie Harford county Fire Insurance Com pany were decided by Judge Grasou, in our Cir cuit Court, ou Tuesday, in the case of Ihe Heirs of Henry Nelson, deceased, vs. The Mutual Fire Insurance Company in Harford county. Tlie facts were as follows : Mr. Nelson, at the time of ills death, owned three farms In Bush River Neck, the buildings upon all of them being insured by one policy in the Harford company. Tlie property not being susceptible of division among tlie heirs, it was sold by a trustee. One of the farms was purchased by Rudolph Lay and Jus. L. Richard son, on thcSth of April, 1878. Under the by-laws of the company, the mem bers are allowed sixty days grace, at the expira tion of the year, in which to pay the interest on their premium notes. The interest being due on the Ist of January, they arc allowed until tlie Ist of March to pay When Messrs. Lay and Richardson bought the property, In April, 1878, the interest on the premium note for the undi vided property hnd been paid up to January Ist, 1879. On the last day of January, 1879. a build Ing, on the farm purchased by Lay and Richard s n, tlie specific insurance on which was SBSO. burned down. Messrs. Lay and Richardson, knowing that the heirs of Henry Nelson, de ceased, held the policy covering the insurnne on their burned building, made no claim upon the company It is alleged that evidence would have been offered, if the case hud come before a jury, that one of tlie Nelson heirs, prior to the Ist of March, 1879, Informed a director of the company of Hie loss, and was assured that it would be adjusted by the company. On tlie 25th of March, 1879, the company was formally notified of tlie loss by the Nelson heirs, and application for payment of the same de manded. The application being refused, suit wns (nought. The insurance company was represented by Henry I) Farnandls and Wm. G. Scott, Es(|S., and the plaintiff's by Henry W. Archer and Geo. Y. Maynadlcr, Esqs. The company offered In plea for the non-pay ment of the claim that notlceofthc loss had not been given within 30 days after it occurred, as re quired by the terms of the policy; that the inter est on the premium note, due January Ist, 1879, hud not been paid or tendered ; that a portion of the property covered by the policy hnd been alienated. For these and other reasons, the company held that til** policy was vitiated and refused payment of the insurance. Counsel for the plaintiff demurred to the pleas, seven in number, but Judge Grasoo, after hearing argument, overruled tbe demurrers, and ordered Judgment to be entered lor the Insur ance company. Judge Watters, being a member of the com panv, was disqualified from sitting in tbe case. The points to be observed by members of the company ore, that unless the Interest on premi um notes is paid before the Ist of March in each and every year, no claim will lie against the company; that the Interest must be paid al though Hie property may have been destroyed fay lire lictwi'in the Ist of January and the lat of March. Also that an alienation of any por tion of the property Im'ludrd underline |*oli(-y vitiates tlie entire policy, unless an ahntenn nt tin. hern m-kril for and granted hy lire coint nor; and Hint rlniinn for lowing JUUbt be presented within SO days alter tbe fire. Shooting Affair in Havre de Grace —Last 1 Saturday afternoon a shooting atlalr took place at the Furnace Wharf, Hayre de Grace, In which the honored name of the Father of his Country figures in singular coincidence. George Wash- j Ington, colored, was shot by George Washing- i ton Stillwell, a deck hand on George Washing- 1 ton Barnes' gunning yacht. An opossum be longing to the colored man was in Stillwells possession. Now ’possum fat Is a luxury much ’ prized by the colored man and brother, and ac- 1 cordiugly the owner of the marsupial went to , claim his property. Stillwell refused to give it . up and Washington started to invoke tlie aid of < the law. As he turned on the wharf Stillwell, , who was standing on the dcckoftbe vessel, tired al him with a gun, the load of shot striking him 1 in the back and neck. Drs. R. 11 Smith and S. 1 D. Jay arc attending him His condition is cri- , Meal, but he will probably recover. On Sun day Mr. John W Dever lodged the accused In Bel Air Jail, on a commitment by Justice Adams. —, • Strike at the Slate Quarries. —It has been the custom among the owners of slate quarries to lower the pay of their hands from 10 to 25 cents a day, during the winter months, on ac- ‘ count of the short days. The reduction takes effect on the Ist of December, and on the Ist of j April the customary rate ot wages is again , paid. Last Friday the hands engaged in the 1 quarries on S ate Ridge, in Harford and York | counties, refused to work, unless the same rule j per day was paid I hem as in the summer. The | bit Ike began at the quarry of Robert L. Jones & J Co., in Harford. The hands at this quarry, ten or ( twelve In number, slopped work and m&rebing \ to the next quarry were joined by the hands there. The procession then kept on from one quarry to another, until upwards of 150 men, embracing workmen In all the quarries except that of Isaac Scarborough A Co., had assembled together. They demanded not only that their wages shall not be reduced, but that they shall receive their pay every month in cash. Hereto fore It has been the custom to pay them by orders on stores. The hand-* declare that they will maintain the stand they have taken for six months at least. Some of the principal firms engaged .n the business arc Robert L. Jones A Co., John Humphrey & Co., Win. E. Williams & Co., Wm. C. Roberts A Co., Reese A Co., John Parry A Co., and John W. Jones A Co. There arc besides a number of small quarries.— The strikers say that slate having advanced in price $1 per square and being In great demand, they should have a better price for their labor. Court Proceedings.—On Friday the case of the Slate vs William Bush, charged with corn mil ting an outrageous assault upon Miss Mary Bull, a respectable young lady, 16 years of nge, was tried before Judge Watters. The assault occurred on Sunday morning. October 2d, 1881. The young lady, while walking along the road leading from the Hickory to Forest Hill, in the direction of her home, was overtaken and roughly seized by a man, who endeavored to drag herinto the woods. She resisted and escaped from him. Miss Bull Identified the accused as her assailant. Win. B. Vancourt testified to having seen Hush following Miss Bull down the rood. Several witnesses testified to the good char acter of Bush. Witnesses were examined by the Slate to Im peach the evidence of Wm. Mlnnlek and others, who testified that at the time the assault Is said to bare been committed Bush was in another place. Judge Walters decided that the identity of the prisoner as the man who com ml‘ted the assault, was not clearly proven, nor was the cred ibility ot William Mlnnlek successfully impeached, and accordingly he render ed a verdict of acquittal. Maynadier for the State, Archer A Van Bibber for the defence. State vs. Samuel Ward, Indicted at the Feb ruary term of court, 1881, for the larceny of three hogs from Thackeray Smith, of Dublin district. Mr. Smith testified that having lost his hogs he charged Ward with killing and converting them to his own use. The offence was neither denied nor admitted by Ward, but after some conversation and threat of prosecution by Smith, Ward, who had sold some pork, paid Smith sl7. Subsequently Smith made a demand upon Ward for $25 additional, upon the ground that by los ing the hogs in question he had lost a particular breed, which was valuable to him, and that he imposed the additional $25 as a “punishment” to Ward. The latter agreed to pay this amount also. After pin ing a portion of it Ward refused or neglected to pay any more, and was then In dicted. Ward gave ball but left the county.— He was apprehended last week at Lancaster, Pa., by Constable R S. MuNutt. The jury rendered a verdict of not guilty, Maynadier for the State, Slump ami Win. Young fur defence. State vs. John Pierce, assault and battery.— Plead guilty and fined $1 and costs. Maynadier for the State, Cooley for defence. Slate vs. John Miller, Indicted for gambling on the fair grounds with a “wheel of fortune.” Many complaints bavin • been made in relation to this particular form of amusement at the fair, Miller was indicted, in order to test the right of the agricultural society to sell a privilege of the kind. Miller, pleading gulty, was fined $1 and costs. Maynadier for State, Hopkins for de fence. DcirdUun-hcunl 31cius. West Hungor. STRIKE OF THE SLATE WORKERS. The principal topic of Interest here is the strike of the slate quairy hands The strike is for the same wages thev have received during the sum mer. The employers wish to deduct 10 cents per day from the laboring hands, who have been getting 11.10 per day. and 25 cents from the quarrymen’s $1.50 per day. The hand* Insist that since the prices of slate have advanced and the demand Is Increasing every day, they should receive the same wages ibis winter as during the summer, and in the spring should have them advanced 25 cents per day. Should t e strike continue H w II create a stagnation in the slate trade of the Ridge The authoritiesof the bor ough of Delta are having their sidewalks laid with slate slabs three feet wide, and it is high time they were getting the work done, ns the streets In that place are in a very had condition, the mud and sand being from a foot and-half to two feet deep.

Tho Deer Creek Farmers’ Club met. on Satur day, Dee fid, at the residence of Mr. James H. nail. The committee of inspection, consisting of Messrs. Janney, Moores and Castner, after look ing around the premises, reported through the chairman. Mr. Janney, who said that the reports of the Inspection committees had been monoto nously favorable, and he had therefore looked around for something to criticize, but could find nothing Mr. Ball’s farm stock, sheep, cows and young cattle are in good condition, bis harness hung up carefully, his barn well stocked with provender and Ills corn crib well filled. Me was rather surprised to see the latter, as Mr. Ball was extensively engaged in canning tomatoes and ap ples Mr. Moores said that Mr. ‘‘all’s wheat, al though sowed late, on tomato ground. Is healthy and strong; his pasture land and mowing field look well; the fence rows are clean and the stones picked up. Mr. Ball stated that within the last 8 years he had built a barn and straw house, a mill, 2 dwelling houses, a hog house, canning house ami a number of outbuildings on his farm. Tho ques ion for discussion was as follows: “Best system of farming to keep up tho fertility of farms, while raising produce for canning pur poses.” Mr. Ball said the question Implied that farms must necessarily g< down, while raising canning produce, but the country around Aberdeen, where the canning business In extensively prose cuted, has improved very much within the last ten years. To keep up our lands wo must have a mixed system ut farming. Wo must sow clover, corn and wheat. Mr. Bail thought it might prove to be u good plan to sow clover at the last work ing of the tomatoes. He lid not believe a crop of tomatoes Is any harder on land than a crop of corn He advised a plan by which tomatoes would follow corn, and wheat follow tomatoes.— He would rather risk wheat after tomatoes than after oats. L. W. Loo. of Kansas, said that if he wore a Deer ('reek farnn r ho would not undertake to raise canning produce, because the land is rolling an 1 hilly and he did not tad I eve It could be kept fertile by the constant plowing require * for corn and tomatoes. By a proper system of rotation it might be kept up. but if a man has a canning house he wants to put In all the land ho can. and therefore can not rotate. The best plan is to ro tate with corn, oats and wheat, applying the necessary fertilizers. NV. W. Castner said ho did not see any reason why. with proper rotation, the fertility oi the soil could not la* kept up, but if land Is continually cropped in tomatoes and corn, it can not be kept up. Ho advised following canning crops with wheat and grass. It had been suggested to sow clover after tomatoes and plow the clover under, hut he doublet! whether fertility could be kept up by plowing under a heavy green crop A heavy growth of clover, he thought, would sour the land, (’lover should not be plowed under until thoroughly ripe. R John Rogers sai l he would bn opposed to going Into canning on a large enough scale to re quire plowing up the whole of his farm. Ho would prefer to grow tomatoes, because, to do a large business, so much land need no' be plowed up as if sugar corn were raised. He thought the fertility of land could not be kept up without grass Artificial manuring alone will not keep it up. Our rolling lands would suffer from washing by farming them continually in corn and toma toes. A good crop of clover following tomatoes might help to keep up fertility. The President, Geo. K. Silver, did not agree with Mr. Rogers in regard to the difference in the quantity of land required to raise sugar corn as compared with that for tomatoes. J. Thomas Bradford said that no system would keep the fertility of hilly land under constant cropping. By breaking it up frequently the soil will wash away. He thought Mr. Rogers correct about raising corn and tomatoes. You can raise .500 bushels of tomatoes on an aero, while 75 bush els of sugar corn is a good crop. To keep up fer tility. after working land two or three years you should sow it in wheal and grass, and let It lay until it gets something on it again. He did not think sweet corn us hard on land as field corn.- Land can be kept fertile by r mst&nt plowing if it is covered over every yea' with manure, as our gardens are. James Leo never thought the fertility of his land, which Is rolling, could be kept up by cun ning. His idea of canning would bo to work it in with the present system, and only put in canning crops such land as you intended to plow under any circumstances. wm. Munnikhuyscn thought tho only way would be by a rotation of crops. It he were to engage in canning, ho would not put in more land for the purpose than he expected to sow In wheat and gross the same fall. Commercial fertilizers will help land, in connection with vegetable mat ter. but you can not make land rich by artificial fertilizers alone. Wm •*’. Hays said his system would be to put on plenty of fertilizers and all the beef you can, Bennett H. Barnes thought fertility might be kept up by sowing clover after tomatoes and let the land lit; for a couple of years. Most of the cun tiers in his neighborhood after tomatoes sow wheat and clover, pus uring the latter one or two years. Some sow in clover and nothing else. Joseph A. Ball could not see why fertility can not l>(3 kept up for canning as for anything else, Tho farms in tho lower part of the county have been kept up better, since they have been raising canning crops, titan when they raised wheat and other crop-. They have* made money canning, while if their lands had laid in grass they would have grown poorer every year, if you cun sell tomatoes at the average price of the last few years it will piy better than ar usual crops, even if tin* land does deteriorate a little. If be had only a small place he would bo willing to risk it all in tomatoes. A t unato field will not wash more that a corn field Ii is plan would be t 'farm the land four or five years, using commercial fer tilizers. and then let it rest. The fertility can be kept up with wheat straw, barn yard manure,&c., if you can get them, but the most economical plan is to let tlx; land rest. Thomas A. Hava thought Mr. Bradford's ideas very good. He did not believe you can keep up fertility by pi owing constantly and applying com mercial fertilizers. 8. C. Andrews said ho hud had four years ex perience in the canning business, and knew that, wheat wdl grow thriftily after tomatoes. Toma toes can be grown yea' after year In the same field, and each crop will be belter than the pre ceding one, provided bone and phosphate are ap plied every year. Wheat is always good after to matoes. Mr. Charles James, with whom he had lived, raised oil an average 23 bushels of wheal to (he acre, on tomato ground. 250 bushels of toma toes Is an average yield. That would make 150 eases, or about 14 eases to a bushel If il can be done it would he better to sow tomato ground in wheat and clover, even if you plow it the next yea**. Bod ground is best for tomatoes, as they will stand the drought better. Thomas Loohary said that keeping up tltu fer tility of land with artificial manures depends very much on the land itself. The land around Aber deen bad been improved during tho last 15 years by this means, but if our Doer Creek land.on which from 15 to 80 barrels of corn can be raised to the acre, were plowed every year it would go back.— It might be kept, up with bone, but il would cost more than tho crops would Justify. John Moores thought Lind might bo kept up while canning. Tho eatmer. he thought, should also be an extensive feeder of stock. He would then have plenty of barn yard manure, which would certainly keep any level land fertile. He would not advise canning on hilly land. Corn meal at s.’i) or $25 a ton, or bran at one cent a pound, would be the cheapest fertilizer to buy.— Feed it to stock and you would feed It to profit. You would not only get. fertilizer, in the shape of barn yard manure, but a profit on your stuck lie sides. Cunning houses might be turned Into houses for wintering stock and the feed oould be advantageously cooked. He did not think toma toes exhausted the fertility of ground, nor did he think there was much difference between corn and tomatoes. In their exhausting effects upon ground. He was not satisfied that bought fertilizers would keep up fertility for canning on all lands. Johns H. Janney thought fertility could be kept up while canning. Our gardens are plowed up every year, and they grow very rich. He thought It might be advantageous to sow rye in tho corn field at tho last working, and plow It un der In March or April. With vegetable matter and bone he was satisfied fertility can bo kept up, particularly while raising sugar corn, which is not alio wo to ripen on the laud. If cannors have a farm of any considerable size they might feed cattle extensively. If they raise sugar corn they should build a silo, cut up the fodder, and feed with a little meal. One hundred acres of sugar corn should feed 100 steers. After three or four crops ho would advise sowing clover, allowing it to stand two years. The President, Geo. R Silver, said ho believed It almost impossible to keep up the fertility of hilly land under constant pi *wmg. Such land, after 2or 3 years, would become very light, and much of the soil would ho washed away. On level land the fertility might be kept up fora number of years, by artificial manures, especially bone. He did not regard corn tomatoes or peas any harder on land than our present crops and ho did not see why sqgar corn should boas hard on U as field or horse corn, as it is called. There Is no reason why fertility should not be kept up If we follow our psual rotation. Bay plow two or throe years, then throw the land in grass and lot It lay. He did not believe we could put enough ; on hills to make up for the constant loss by wash ing. but level lands may he kept up by bone and phosphate. The question is will cunning Justify this expensive outlay ? Jas. It. Ball said that tho question resolved It self Into this: If wo keep up our ays'em of fann ing and raise tomatoes, coni r peas, shall wc not have to devote our usual corn ground to raising those things, and buv corn for our stock ? The oluh then adjourned to moot at the farm of William V. Hays, on the 7th of next January. — — Feeble Ladies.

Hop Bitters. Irregularities and obstructions of your ; system are relieved at once, while the special cause of (>■ rl 'dlcal pam H oormanently removed. Will you heed this?— Cincinnati Saturday Night, | I lie Improvement of Bush River. Mr. Editor-. The deepening of the chan nel of Hush river would bo of more importance to the funning interests of a large portion of Har ford county than any public improvement that could bo made. The change of our system of farming to canning, Ims necessarily produced u largo amount of freighting, and as it is always difficult to got cars at the way stations, the can ners are subjected to great in -onvcnience and cost to get their cans and cases from the city ut the time which would suit them best to haul them from the station. The same inconvenience exists in shipping their goods. Besides, the railroad company has instructed its agents to charge de murrage on all cars that are not unloaded or load ed within twenty-four hours after the time they arrive at the station, fanners who have to haul Bor 10 miles—as many do—can scared* loud a car without considerable loss in the way of demur rage Now, if you cun, through The eEgie, get the far mers and others interested In the subject of deep ening Hush Klver, and the project is successful, they will soon see tho advantages of having water facilities for shipping their canned goods, hay. grain and other products. Forty-five years ago 1 was engaged in the carrying trade of Hush Kiver. Then I could load my vessel at the Public Land ing. at a depth of seven feel of water. Now, you can only find there, at high water, an average of from 4to 4 1 * feet—showing that In 4r years the river has filled up from 2X to 3 foot, I'onsequcnt jy it is difficult to get a sufficient number of boats of light draft of water to do the freighting that would find its way to market by the river. The advantage of shipping grain by vessel to market Isabout three cents per bushel, as com pared with car transportation, as water-borne grain will always sell for more than car grain, and the expenses of shipping by ear are always from 2 to 51 cents per bushel. If, therefore, we can get a channel dredged out from the railroad bridge to the Public Landing, say 100 feet In width and Bor 10feet deep,there will benodlflieul ty In getting a large warehouse built, that will ac commodate all the fanning ami canning interests within 10 miles of the head of the river. Nor will then- be any difficulty in getting vessels to do the carrying, when there is no delay in loading and getting out. Several appropriations have been made for tho rl ers of he Eastern Shore, and I see no reason why we should not have our river made naviga ble. There is no regular channel above the Bridge, and I am confident that if one were cut the How of water from Hush and Church Creeks would always keep if open, and from the passing of vessels and steamboats up and down it would get deeper. I will state that a gentleman of means has offer ed, if the channel is deepened, to build a ware house and get a largo barge steamer to run to tbe head of the river. Eldridob w. Gallup.
