AVe can M-cure in no other quarter of th& world such Immediate benefits In friendship and commerce as would flow from the es- , tatil:ehiritni of direct lines of coin-: inun. cation with the countries of Lat-1 in Ameiica. I alluded to this most Important subject in my last annual message; it has often been before you and I need not recapitulate the reason for Ha recommendations. Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the I'ananij will l.nd tni.x tin.- only great' commercial nation unable to avail in internatinal muritinie bus ness of this ' great contribution to the means of 1 the world's commercial intercourse. . Wuite aside from the commercial i aspect, unless we create a merchant marine, where can we find the' sea- I faring population necessary as a nat- j ural naval reserve and where could j we find in case of war the transports end subKidiary vessels without which j a naval fleet is arms without a body. For many reasons I cannot too strong- ly urge upon congress the passage of 1 a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee the establishment and rapid develop ment of an American merchant ma rine, the restoration of the American (lag to its ancient place upon the seas. I strongly commend to the favor Able action vt the congress the enact ment of a law applying to civil ser vice to the diplomatic and consular service. The excellent results which have attended the partial application of civil service principles to the diplo matic and consular services are an object lesson of the benefit to be wrought by a wider and more per manent extension of those principles to both branches of the foreign ser vice. During many years past appeals have been made from time to time to congress In favor of government own ership of embassy and legation prem-is'-.s abroad. The acquisition by the government of such suitable resi dences and offices for its diplomatic offices is so Important and necessary to an improved diplomatic service that I have no hesitation in urging upon tin- innsri'fs the parage of some measure that would authorize the gradual und annual acquisition of j reiniss f r diplomatic employes. Treasury Dcportn-uMit. Ki-tiniate-! f ,r next year s expenses: Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1912. These estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will mainta'n the department bureaus and offices of the government and meet its other conditions under existing law anj that a cut of these estimates would result In embarrassing the ex executive branch of the government. This remark does not apply to the river end harbor estimates except to those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under authorized contracts, nor does It ap ply to the publ'c building bill nor to the navy building program. The final estimates for the year end'ng June 20, 1912, as they have been sent to the treasurer on Novem ber 29 of this year for the ordinary expenses of the government, Inctsd ing those fur public building, rivers and h-arbors and the navy building program amount to $630,491,013.12. This is $52,964,887,365 less than the appropriations for the fiscal year end-in- June 3. 1S11. It Is $16,883,153.44 less than the total estimates Includ ing supplemental estimates submit ted to congress by the treasury for the year 1911 and Is $5,574,659 i9 les than the original estimates sub mitted by the treasury for 1911. These figures do not Include the appropria tions for the Panama canal, the pol icy in respect to which ought to be, and Is, to spend as much each year as can be economically and effective ly expended in order to complete the canal as promptly as possible. It will be noted that the estimates for the I'.-nama canal for the ensuing year are. more than fifty-six millions of dollars, an Increase of twenty millions over the amount appropriated for this year, a difference due to the fact that estimates for 1912 Include something over 19,000.000 for the fortifica tion of the canal. Against the esti mate! expenditures of $630,494,013.- 12. the treasury has estimated receipts for next year $680,000,000. making a probable surplus of ordinary receipts over ordinary expenditures of about $50,000,000, or taking Into account the estimates for the Panama canal which are $56,920,847.69, It will mean a deficit for the next year of about $7 000,000 if congress shall conclude to fortify the canal. The cost of the fortification of the canal Is about $19,000,000. The president refers to the anti quated methods In vogue In the treas ury department and says that the head of that department haa for two years been devoting his time to bring ing the department up to date, elimi nating waste and reducing the force, largely In the Interest of economy. By the detection of frauds In weigh ing sugar upwards of $3,400,000 have been recovered from the beneficiaries of the fraud and an entirely new sys tem tfree from the possibility of such a fraiJd has been devised. The de partment has perfected the method of collecting duties at the port of New. j York co as to save the government upwards of ten or eleven million dol lars. There are entirely too many cus toms districts and too many customs collectors. These districts should bo consolidated and the collectors In charge of thorn should be abolished or treated as mere branch offices In accordance with the ptan of the treas ury department which will be present ed fur the consideration of congress. An investigation of the appraising system now in vogue In New York city has shown a sacrifice of the In terests of the government by undcr appralsement which Is In the course of being remedied by reorganization and the employment of competent ex pert. Very great Improvements have been made In respect to the mints and nssay offices. There Is an opportu nity for further economy In the abo llmitlon of several mints and assay of fices that have now become unneces sary. In the bureau of engraving and printing great economies have been effected. In our public buildings we still suf fer from the method or appropriation which has been so much criticized In connection with our rivers and har bors. Some method should be devis ed for controlling the supply of pub lic buildings so that they will har monize with the actual needs of the government. Not only buildings ap-
