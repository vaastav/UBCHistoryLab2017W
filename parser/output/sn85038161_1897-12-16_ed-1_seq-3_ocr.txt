R P nj,J - 'A V , V- ,'l- ' NEWS-HERALD, HILLSBORO, O. T&URSDAY, DECEMBER 16. 1897. 3 r 'K k . l Y WAHH1NUT0N LETTER. From Our feegnUr Correspondent. Washington; D. 0., December 10, 1897. The most astounding thing brought to i light by the first week of the session of Congress is the audacity of the agents of the lobby which is trying to prevent the annexation of Hawaii. It is only neccessary for a Senator or Representa tive of prominence to express in private conversation the slightest doubt of the wisdom of annexation to have these agents announce through such news papers as they control or can by hook or crook obtain space in cash Is un questionably paid in some instances that the Senator or Representative in question is straining every nerve to de feat annexation. They have thus mis represented Senators Morrill and Hoar and Speaker Reed. It seems as sure as anything can be that such audacity is in the end bound to react upon those who employ it, and to result in making more votes for annexation than against it. This lobby was started by the sugar trust, but there are reasons for believ ing that a portion of the money it is spending so liberally comes from the secret fundB of ,ttiree foreign nations . which desire to prevent annexation, but have no reasonable excuse for attempt ing to do bo openly. Some of the Dem ocratic Senators who talked the loudest against trusts, during the campaign, aro acting in concert with the sugar ttust now. In fact, with two exceptions, ( Gorman and Morgan, all the Democratic Senators appear to have landed, bag and baggage, in the lobbyists' camp. Senator Davis, of Minn., chairman of the com mittee on Foreign Relations, which has charge of the treaty, is thoroughly confident that annexation will be ac complished through the treaty, and ab solutely certain that a bill providing for annexation can be passed by both Sen ate and House, shuld the power of the lobby be sufficient to prevent the ratifi cation of the treaty. 'It is his intention to push the matter to a conclusion in the Senate at the earliest possible mo ment. Senator Chandler, chairman of the committee of Elections and Privileges, says that committee will decide upon its report in the Oregon case at its next meeting and that he has no doubt the report will be in favor of seating Hon. H. W. Corbett, as successor to Hon. H. H. Mitchell, whose term in the Senate expired last March. If the Democrats who have expressed themselves in favor of seating Mr. Corbett vote that way he will be seated. The House committee and Appropria tions broke the record when it reported the Pension Appropriation bill to the House this week, thus furnishing evi dence that Chairman Cannon and the industrious members of his committee intend to do their part towards pushing the imperative business of this session, in order to help along the project for early adjournment, which is generally favored by Republicans. The Pension bill carries $141,218,830,of which $140, 000,000 is for the payment of pensions. It has already been made apparent that a serious attempt is going to be made at this session of Congress to mod ify the civil service rules. President McKinley having stated in his annual message that he believed many posi tions were now embraced by the civil service rules which ought not to be, Re publicans in Congress do not feel that they are antagonizing him or the party platform in taking part in this move ment, although so good a Republican as Representative Johnson, of Indiana, has told them in a speech made in reply to Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio, that he disa greed with them. Gen. Grosvenor's idea, which he will endeavor to get through in the shape of a bill, is that the only employes of the government who should be embraced by the civil service rules are the clerks, whose duties are not executive, in the departments at Washington and employes of the postal service in all branches. All other posi tions he desires to have thrown open and the Democrats who now fill nine tenths of them thrown out to make room for the Republicans. President McKinley !s being detained, at Canton by bis sad duty has not in any manner inconvenienced Congress, as he arranged all matters requiring his per sonal attention before starting upon his last trip to the bedside of his dying mother. Everywhere bis name is men tioned the deepest sympathy is expressed for him. The Committee on Banking and Cur rency has obtained permission from the House to sit daily during sessions ot the House, and will at once endeavor to agree upon one or more bills embodying portions of the financial recommenda tions made by the President in his an nual message and by Secretary Gage, in his annual roport to Congress. Secretary Gage has been asked to put his idea in to a bill and submit it to the committee.

The above we copy from the News Herald, published at Hillsboro, which reminds us of two incidents that occurr ed in West Union, which came under our immediate notice. The first one oc curred in the summer of 1830, when a neatly dressed gentleman came into the shoe shop, then being carried on by Nicholas Burwell, father of the senior editor of this paper, and applied for work, representing himself as a first class workman. My father gave him a trial job, and as he was so well pleased with the work gave him a permanent situation. The gentleman gave his name as Rob ert Collins, and his former residence ,as Lexington, Ky. He was a very intelli gent gentleman, of good habits, and was taken into my father's family for board. He soon became well acquainted and mingled with the best and most stylish young ladies in our town. About four weeks after Collins arrived, while work ing at the front window of the shop he discovered four gentleman riding down Maine street, and as quick as thought he jumped from the bench, threw off his apron and run down through the back lot and into the wooded hills north of town. In less than an hour after Collins had left the shop, two strangers came in and inquired if there was a journeyman working in that shop ? "Yes, sir," said my father, "I have a man by the name of Collins in my employ." "That's him," said the stranger, and then related, "I am his master, and have owned him from infancy, and while in his teens I bound him out to learn the boot and shoe business, and just at the time he would be of service to me he ran away. I have offered $1,500 reward for him." Three months after Collins left, my father received a letter from him dated Montreal, Canada. About all it con tained was the emphatic words, "I have broken the shackels safe, safe, safe !" Another case Along in the '50's James Lyon's, colored, who resided in a log building at the extreme northwest corner of West Union, came to my house in the fall of that year, about 0 o'clock at night, and invited me to his house, stating that there was a fugitive slave at his home and that he wanted some in formation in regard to the nearest and most practical course for him to take, in striking for his liberty. We, of course, went to see him and gave our best coun sel, together with some material aid. We also suggested that N. W. Darling ton, who is still an honored citizen of our town, be sent for. We afterward learned that Mr. D. piloted the fugitive across the hills to Mr. Mclntire's, on Cherry Fork, which was a prominent station on the Underground Railroad. W. U. Scion. Relief in Six Hours.
