Their Plan Deeply Before Issuing tlio Manifesto Only Salvation for Uie Country, it is Declared, is the OTcrthrow of the Autocracy by a Constituent Assembly Conspiracy to Seize and Carry G.T Witte Shown to Have Existed. St Petersburg, Friday, December 15 (Morning) via Eydtkuhnen, Eatt Prussia, December 16. The proletariat organizations through the invisible government threw a bomb into the camp of the official government dur lg the night, issv.mg a minfesto, fol wing the form of a regular Imperial ument, deck: ring the bankruptcy ol treasury, ordering the proletariai cvery where to refuse to p-y tsH&4iOf any description, to insist on f payment of wages in gold or sil ver, and to withdraw all their deposits from the savings banks in gold. A manifesto is a terrible indictrr.eui of the manner which the beaucracy nan Drought the country to financial ruin, asserting that the government has squandered not only the country '3 . income, but the proceeds of the foreign j loans oa .reserves, the army and I be fleet, leaving the people without schools or railroads. It is declared vre is no money to feed the 1 Vtixrs, and everywhere there are insur 'rections of the Veggars and starved troops and the s.iilors. The manifesto even charges the government with us ing the deposits in the government savings banks to speculate on the bourse, and with covering up its chrjn ic deficits in .the interest on the im mense debt by the proceeds of the for eign loans, which are at last exhaust ed. The rich, t is further declared have already taken warning and are converting their property into securi ties and gold and are sending them abroad. The only salvation for the country according to the manifesto, is the overthrow ot the autocracy by a constituent assembly and "the sooner the government fails the better. Th be fore the last source of existence of 'he old regime, its financial revenue, mus be stopped." The document is signed by the mem bers of the workmen's council commit tee of the pan-Russian union and the central committees of the social demo crats, social revolutionists and the so cialists of Poland. This irreat steo of the revolutionaries olutionists WES CHARGES which throws down the guage of ba.tle to the government was prepared with . such secrecy tha? the authorities were Awaken off their guard and did not even -attempt to .prevent its publication in the newspapers. The revolutionary leaders expect it will be followed by re prisals and arrests but all this has been foreseen. The leaders laid thoir plans deeply before issuing the maul festo. New committees of the variois organizations have been placed in 'he third and fourth degree. If one set of committees iv put behind the os smother will take its place and carry on the work. The league of leagues was not asked to join in the manifesto being regarded -with some jealousy by the proletariat organizations which claim to be bear ing the brunt of the revolution and t be entitled to the fruits thereof. The proletariai leaders claim to have absolute knowledge that the govern ment has just issued $125,000,000 in paper money. Under the provisions of the press law the editors of every pa per which printed the manifesto has rendered himself liable to eight months imprisonment and $1,500 fine. Now -must come the test of the govern ment's power. It develops that among the papers of M. Krustaleff, the presi dent of the executive committee on the workmen's counsel, seized at the time of his arrest were documents which for oisa evidence of a well planned con npiracy to seize and carry off Premier Witte.

Charles Rey nard, president of the Isle of Piaes Association, forwarded today by the advice of his attorneys a letter in re ply to Secretary 01 State Root's com munication of November 17th, in which the secretary outlined to Mr Reynard the attitude of the United States government to a proposal ofr the forming of a territorial govern ment in the island, as part of the Unit ed States. Mr Reynard contradicts Mr. Root's statement that Isle of Pinc3 is lawfully subject to the Cuban gov ernment, and savs the Cuban republic exists solely by virtue of a constitu tion, the terms of which explicitly ex elude the Isle of Pines from the domain of the republic.

The. latter says that Secretary Root's opinion as to the validity ol the claim of the United States to the Isle of Pines is opposed to the opinion of President M.-Kinley, Secretary ot State Hay and Governor General Loe.i ard Wood, and it quotes some official CnLf marKS 1 ?wihem 1 The letter reg'ets that Mr. Root as, "Tlfl"!-1!1 SUC? aim uegieui auu uiauueuieuce aim auuS' that "Mr. Root, in opposition to thei expressed wishes of Secretary of Stat Hay insisted upon the negotiation of a treaty and abandoning any claim to the Isle of Pines to Cuba, thus cov?r ing nnd concealing Illegal acts and omissions of the department of the government for which you were then responsible."

Associated Frees Reports Came Around by Louisville and Nashville -Greens-boro Isolated The Western Union. Postal and Bell Telephone, Compa nies All Suffer. Heavy sleet prevailing in states north of North Carolina, and in some sections of this state, have played Hiavoc with telegraph and telephone wires, all communication with most of the northern cities having been en tirely broken yesterday. The storm has been raging for a day or two, but it was only when sleet began to fall. burdening the wires with heavy weight, that any great damage re sulted. All day yesterday the Western Un ion office here was -making valiant ef fors to get connection with their northern offices, but except at long in tervals, this was impossible. Only a very . few of the market quotations were received at the Chamber of Com merce, and there were no grain and provisions report from Chicago. Conse quently the day was a dull one- on 'Change. The greatest trouble with the wires seemed to be north of Pe tersburg, to Washington. The only communication had with New York yesterday was circuited around by Nashville and Atlanta. For awhile last night it siene:. probable that The Messenger would be unable to get any Associated Press copy at all, and that it would appear without any telegraphic service this fiorning. Finally, however, a circuit was fixed up from Washington to Louisville to Atlanta and then here. t So dispatches that generally come di- t to Wiimington Washington we weeded over this lbng circuit last niKnf Wilmington still has wire connection with Norfolk, but is cut off from Rich mond. The lines between Richmond and Norfolk are also down. The Postal Company also suffered as a result of the storm, though they had communication with New York Their trouble is also north of Rich mond, though it is reported that the storm is moving south and damage in this section of the country is feared. . . The vj; 11 Telephone Company re ports that it has been unable to reach lireenstoro will amount to iu,uuu. Word was sent out yesterday irom Grensboro asking for as many linesmen as could be spared from the local ex change here. Manager McManus sent off four men and others from different towns in the state are on their way to Grensboro to repair the damage. Of course all the companies are exerting ill tho power at their com mand to restore and repair the dam age done. Great forces of linemen are at work patching up fallen wires and it is probably saCe to assert that with- in a day or two full wire connection rracticallv isolated from the outside world Greensboro has been in the grip of one of the worst sleet storms for the past forty-eight hours, it has experienced for years. Telegraphic and telephonic communication was cut off for the best part of the day, due to broken wires and falling poles. This damage was temporarily repaired late this afternoon and ail wires were ln fair Working order before midnight inestimable damage was done to trees an(j foliage crushed beneath the v.eifrht of ir-v tendrils. Street car ser- vecie was seriously hampered and gen eral discomfort ensued. . Lynchburs: Also Suffers. Lynchburg, Va., December 10. Ex cept for a sincle wire to Danville and another to .
