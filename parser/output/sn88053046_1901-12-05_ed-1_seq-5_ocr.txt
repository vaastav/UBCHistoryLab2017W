'STHMIAN CANAL The Report.or flirr» great V Associated Press Dispatch by Special W Washington, Dec. 4.-—The report of the isthmian Canal Commission sent to Congress today. The commission, au anticipated several weeks ago, favors the Nicaragua route,« and estimates 8180,861,062 as tbe total cost ut the construction of the canal through Nicaragua. The estimated cost SÄ It Imu'm •109. 114,OIK), to obtain the Panama con - cession. The commission vnluee the work done at «10,060,000. Tbe report snys the i'anama route is feasible as a eea level canal, while the Nicaragua route must be by looks, but Lake Nicaragua will furnish an innxbausti bio supply of water for the canal. The Nicarngna route has no natural bnrbors at either end. but satisfactory harbors may be constructed. Harbors already iet ot each end of tbe Panama route, but considerable work must be done at the entrance to the harbor on the At lantio side. With adequate foroo ai d plant, tbe commission estimates that the Nina ragua Canal can bo completed in six years, exclusive of two years for preparation. Ten years aie estimated ! to complete the Panama Canal. The t total length of the Nicaragua route is 188.66 mi les, and the Panama mats 41). 00 j miles. The estimated cost of operot. ing and maintaining the Nicaragua Canal annually is 81,850,000 greater than that of (he Panama Canal. Tho I estimated time for a de m draught ! vessel pass throuuh the Pana ua ! Canal is lii bouts, and through the i Xicaraugu Canal 83 hours. 'The Nioa- j route, tbe report says, is more advantageous for commerce, save that iginating on the west coast of South America. For the gulf ports the ad vantage is two days, and for most of the ports on the Atlantic and Pacific day. The Nicaragua route is said to be better for sailing vessels, on account of favoring wind. Hygienic conditions also faver Nicaragua. The comm lesion says th lisHion Kant to Cor should acquire control of a strip cf forrilory 10 miles wide, from sea to sea, j through which to build the canal. Tbe j consent of Nioarngua and Costa Rica 1 musc be obtained to construct the canni, but tbe report says this can easily be seoured. The concessions granted by the Columbian government to the i'anama Canal Co. have many years to run, and now oonoessions can not t... prallt ml tha Unitod Ht.1.0. The report concludes as foffowH : "After considering all the facts de veloped by tbe investigations the com mission is of the opinion tnat the most praoticab.e and fensible route for an i . I United States istbmi canal, to bo under the trot, management, and ownership uf tho United b'.aies, is that unown as the Nicaragua route. " Treaty Sent to th© Senate.
