An inspection of its subscription list is invited by those contemplating ad? vertising. The President's message was long enough. Let's agitate the Kentucky road question. We Methodists arc the stuff. Just watch us." We'll meet at Phillipi in the sweet bye and bye. Winteh, frosty winter is treading on the heels of summer. Everything in the Post is not calculated to please everybody. Sec. Tin-; goose hangs high and evcry thing is as lovely as a smiling seraph. ChbistmaS with its ehimnig bells, will soon be here. The small boy will then be in his glory. We have received about a hnudred sucscribcrs since the election. We are flying mighty high just now. Gen. Walknr has supcrccded Gen. Mahone, and the Bristol News still gives forth its song of woe. When will we have a rest. John Mahoncy announces that the (..ate City Gazette will, in the near future, be conducted under a new man? agement. We hope, John, that you will continue with it. Jealousy, whose tongue is sharper than the sword; whose breath rides on the posting winds'and doth belie all cor I ners of the earth. Kings,nations and even the secrets of the grave cannot escape this venomous, ruthless, .infa? mous jealousy. The Post is published for the good of Big Stone Gap and the adjoining section of country, It has a large sub? scription list inScott and Lee counties and is the best advertising medium in this section of Virginia. Now is the time to advertise. We are much gratified to note that our brilliant young townsman and' friend, John Fox, Jr., is having great success in New York. The last we heard from him he had given a read? ing to.the young ladies of Yassar. We guess ?John was in his glory there, as he generally takes with the fair sex wherever he goes. \ . A Judge of Human Nature. He who .ascends to mountain tops shall Hml, Tho loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow. ? ~. Me who conquers and subdues mankind, Must look down on the hate of those below. ?Byron. A distinguished philosopher upon a memorable occasion once said that j language was given man to conceal thought. The Post is very much inclined to the opinion of the philoso pher but does not upon all occasions observe his teaching as in the present instance it does not intend to. By? ron, the grandest, sweetest of all the poets, in the humble opinion of the Pos t, was the best judge of human nature of'which we have any intcl* ligible account. He knew men, he could discern their motives, could read their character as God and their acts through life implanted up? on their countenance. * He was a man of wonderful experience, and a close observer. To the mind of a thinker, he gave a correct definition of man in the above short but brilliant lines. A man that succeeds iu the world, who. rises by the force of a superior will, by superior intelligence and by superior birth, on. his march to the mountain tops of-[which the poet speaks must oncounter at every turn the opposition of the little seurlmg worms who ate destined through life, no matter what position they may at? tain, by luck, perseverance, or the devil knows how, to bow their smirk? ing heads to true worth and to their superiors. ?'^gS^^-WT' Force of character goes a great wayin this burly, burly old world. A good name is greater than riches, but oftimes the good name, which smirk? ing hyppocritical religion and lying give the man, behind it is hid, a char? acter the devil would refuse and shun to own. True worth and true char? acter lises above the petty forms adopted by most men. It stands out in bold relief like, some great time worn gnarled oak b?3idc the sappling of diminutive proportions. Like a Blaze of light iu the heavens beside a spark of fire. Live according to the dictates of the conscience that God has given you, and ever hohHn con? tempt the men who live and act a lie merely for the sake of effect and indi? vidual advancement. Hon. Waltor E. Addison. We again place in nomination for State Senator from t It in Districr, Hon. Walter E. Addison of Big Stone Gap. Mr. Addi? son knows nothing of this, it is not done at his request, but is done simply because the editor or the Posr thinks that such services as he has rendered theDemocrat ic party calls for and demands rccogni tion. In the last canvass Judge Morison had no warmer supporter, no more cour? ageous and indefatigiblc worker than he! The speeches that he made won for him a reputation and a standing in the Ninth District of which any man might justly feel proud. He invaded the hot bed of Republicanism, Tazewell county, and threw in the teeth of the ablest Republi? cans iu the State the gunge of battle. The night has never been too dark, or the day too gloomy but that this noble repre? sentative of Democracy has obeyed his party's call. True as steel to his frieuds and his convictions, wearing as he does upon his countenance the stamp of intellectual vigor, in every sense of tho word worthy, the Democrats of this Sena toral district could not do better, could not honor themselves more, than by plac? ing the standard of Hie party in his hands. And he will carry it bravely, he will un? furl Jil upon the very ramparts of Kc puclican wickedness. He will beard the lion in his den, and what is more, he will be elected. The Carlisle Currency Flan. A full discussion of the new plan for the issue of bank currency pro? posed by Secretary Carlisle would be premature before the appearance of the report in which it is elaborated. As outlined in the message of the President, it presents some points in common with the famous Baltimore plan recommended by the American Bankers' Association, with very marked differences in other respects. Some of the prominent features that the two plans have in common are these: 1. That the deposit of bonds as a security for circulation shall no longer be required. 2. That banks be permitted to ?issue notes equal to 75 per cent, of their paid up, unimpaired capital. Under the Baltimore plan, 25 per cent, of this is to be subjected to an extra tax, so as to make it an "emer? gency circulation,"to be retired when the emergency is past. 3. That a tax of one-half of 1 per cent, per annum be levied on the circulation out of which to pay ex? penses of printing notes, etc. 4. That the notes be issued to the banks by the Treasury Department. 5. That a fund of 5 per cent, of total circulation be paid by the banks into the Treasury for the immediate redemption of the circulating notes of banks that fail.. This is called a "guarantee fund" in the Baltimore plan and a "safety fund" by Mr. Carlisle. The "guarantee fund" of Mr. Carlisle's plan has no counter? part in that adopted at Baltimore. It is impoatant not to confound these two "guarantee funds." These features of the Baltimore plan adopted by Mr. Carlisle are es entially modified by other provisions. The great point of divergence is in the "guarantee fund" which is to consist of greenbacks or Treasury notes of 1890, equal to 30 per cent of circulation. This provision, of course, has a dou?e purpose. It aff? ords much better security to the Gov? ernment than the Baltimore plan, which is important, and it afiords an? other use for the greenbacks than drawing gold out of the treasury, for which they are now largely employed, Elasticity of the currency is to be se? cured by allowing the banks . on re? tiring any part of their notes to with? draw a ratable amount of the green? backs deposited. Another striking point of difference j is with reference to the redemption of the bank notes.. The Baltimore plan would throw this burden wholy on the Government. It proposes that j the redemption of'^the notes of solvent j banks be made as now provided by law, while the notes of insolvent i banks are to be redeemed out of the guarantee fund if sufficient, and if not, out of any money in the Treas? ury.?Courisr Journal. B. Johnson Barbour. Mr. B. Johnson Barbour, whose '^death we announced this morning, was one of the-shining lights -in the old Whig party of Virginia, and was the orator of the day at the unveil* ?. iug of the statute of Henry Clay in our Capitol Square. He was gifted with rare graces as mi orator, au& shone brilliantly as a conversational* I ist, and was always a dilligent stu? dent. He came of a family distinguished ! in Virginia history, his father having j been that James Barbour who was j Governor of this State, United States Senator, and Minister to England. The deceased was bat little in pub lie life, as in olden times he was a Whig: living in a Democratic district. His attachment to the Union was strong, and he never approved of the secession of Virginia; but hundreds of our officers and soldiers who were on doty in the neighborhood of his home,jln Orange county, greatefully remember how kind he was to all of them'who wanted food or shelter. Just after the close of the war our people, we think-we arc not quite sure elected Mr. Barbour to Congress, but the Radicals would not admit him to a seat. Some years later he was elect? ed to the Virginia House of Delegates. He was a devoted friend of the Unr-' versity of Virginia, and was 1 for ! many years prominent in the State Agricultural Society. His orations and public addresses, of which there were many, were marked by accurate scolarship, great enthusiasm for the'eause which he es pouscd, and eloquence of a very high order. Withal he was a Christian and was prominent and useful in Church work. There will be many to mourn him.?Richmond Dispatch. THE 

PRESS. Cincinnati Post: The treaty re? cently signed in Washington by Sec? retary Gresham Minister Kurino, and which in allprobability the senate will ratify, places Japan in the family of civilized nations. This compact pro? vides for the abolition in Japan of the American consular courts, which are maintained only in semi-barbarous counties, and concedes to Japan the same jurisdiction over the persons and property of American residents in that country that the. United States Government exercises over Japanese residents within its borders. It is undeniable that the Japanese have since their struggle with the Chinese began shown that in war as well as in . peace they are worthy of being ranked with the civilized nations of the world. Courier Journal: Canada recent? ly negotiated a loan of $12,250,000 for public improvements. The bonds were o per cents., and the average price realized was 98. The loan was subscribed nearly four times over. The United States placed a $50,000 000 loan at a 2 7-8 per cent, rate and a few days later the demand for these securities was so great that thesyndi cate which took them at 117.077 had sold $8,000,000 for a profit of nearly $170,000. At this rate the syndicate will clear about $1,060,000 on the issue. There is such a vast amount of money seeking investment that the successful placing of these loans should surprise no one. Government bonds are convertible into cash at al? most a moment's notice should there come an opportunity for a better in? vestment, but the rate of interest is declining so rapidly that the invest? ors are likely to hold on until obliged to part with them. Auingoon Virginian*: There is an i effort made in certain quarters to lhave the Governor convene the Legis ature in extra session this winter. The pretext for it is to have the con? stitutional amendment, recently be? fore the people, put. in operation. To convene the Legislature would cost the State from $00,000 to $70,000 before it could be adjourned. No great emergency exists, such as alone warrants tho expense of reassembling this body, and we aie pleased to note that the Governor hitnslf does not approve of this idea. C incixnatiPost: T1) ePcnn sy 1 vania Railroad Company has constructed a locomotive which it is claimed will travel at the enormous speed at 100 miles an hour,with steam as the pro? pelling power. Contrasting the im-, provements made in ocean and rait transportation,with reference special- ] ly to the question of comparative! speed, it must be admitted that the j former's record is a little the better. With the 100 miles an hour locomo, however, all comparisons cease. 

WASHINGTON LETTE?. ( Po'bl'ts Regular Correspondent.) Washington. Dec. 3, 18M. The greater the number of Sena- j tors and Representatives with whom i you talk the more apparent becomes the fact that finance is the all absorb? ing question of the hour, and also that those is next to no hope that anything of any importance in that line can be accomplished at this ses? sion, owing to the existing differenc? es of opinion as to what should be done. Although President Cleve? land endorses in his annual message to Congress Secretary Carlisle's scheme for financial reform, neither of them have the slightest idea that it will be accepted as a whole by Con? gress. The most either of^them.hope for, according to my information, is that some sort of a financial measure may be agreed upon which will em? brace some of the feature recommend? ed by Secretary Carlisle. In this connection it may be stated that a movement is on among conservative men in all the parties, having for its object some sort of a compromise fi? nancial measure that will be support? ed by a majority of the House and Senate; that will make it impossible for the great moneyed interests to force the government to issue bonds whenever desiied, and will at the same time secure the President's sig-i nature, or at any rate escape his veto. -??-3* Whether this can he done is quest? ionable. Some of the shrewdest and most experienced men in Congress, who themselves hold radical views one way or the other, declare it im? possible. It is only getting at it the right way that is difficult. The opening of Congress was quiet? er than nsal arid the attendance smal? ler, both on the floor of the House and Senate and jn the galleries. The public seemed to know that the spec? tacular part of the session would not begin until after the opening formal itics, when they arc expected to be? come fast and furious, unless some of the more turbulent spirits can be control cd in some manner. The sugar trust may discover that it made a serious mistake in shutting down its refineries and throwing sev? eral thousand men out. of employ? ment at the beginning of the winter. That it was done to make the count? ry belisve that the business of the trust was poor and t:> furnish the Senate an excuse for not passing the bill, already passed by the House, putting sugar on the free list, is so apparent that it may, instead of pre? venting, result in the passing of the free sugar bill by the Senate. Cer? tain it is that men who favored let? ting the whole tariff alone during this session of Congress arc, since the inhuman action of the trust, which is said to have made a profit of more than $20,000,000 since the first of last January, earnestly advocating the early passage by the Senate of the free sugar bill. But even with this increased sentiment in favor of free sugar and the destruction of the trust it would not be safe to predict the passage of the free sugar bill by theSenate. There are men in theSen whojarejreally and conscientiously op? posed to trusts, but they do not in? clude all the Senators who publicly talk against trusts and monopolies, nor past experience shown them to be numerous enough to control the Senate when there is a real opportun? ity to injure some trust, although they do so easily when some elligible anti-trust measure?the present law for instance,?is up for action, Senator Palmer, of 111., who is himself opposed to the free coinage of silver, expresses the belief that a free coinage of silver bill will be passed at this session, notwithstanding the efforts of the administration to pre? vent itpand that it will be vetoed by President Cleveland. It may not be a miss to mention that Senator Pal? mer's record as a legislative prophet has not been a successful one, Senator Teller,whose silver senti? ments are known to all, says: "We have very little hope, if any, that this Congress, or even the next, will do anything for silver. There will be many plans brought forward relat? ing to the currency and its revision, and there will be much severe criti? cism of the administration for its rep? rehensible conduct in issuing bonds. I am certain that the so-called Balti? more plan will never meet the situa? tion. It is a very poor plan, and will be jumped on and trampled to death by the Senatars from the western States." Opinions of the financial part of President Cleveland's message are very generally withheld, until the de? tails of Secretary Carlisle's financial scheme, which is to be submitted to Congress to-morrow, can be careful? ly studied. There are lots of men in Congress who are not wedded to any particular scheme of finance, although the most ot them have pronounced ideas as to what the foundation should be, who are willing to accept anything that they can be convinced will be an imbrovement upon present conditions, even though it does not agree with all tne opinions they have herctojorc held. These men will not condemn Secretary Carlisle's plan without a hearing; they will closely study it and if they think it good I will support it, otherwise not. It is not a subject upon which a man can make up his mind properly in an h our or in a da}*. ISttckler rt Atmua Salve .
