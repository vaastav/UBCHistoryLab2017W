IT PLEASES ENGLAND President's Message Generally Com mended by the London Papers. CALLED SOBER AND BROAD-MINDED References to Nicarauguan Canal Not Altogether Satisfactory. FRIENDLY SPIRIT PRAISED LONDON. December 6.?The afternoon newspapers here express satisfaction at President McKinley's message to Congress, 1 with the exception of the allusion to the Nicarague canal, which to the minds of the editors, does not show sufficient apprecia tion of British treaty rights. The Pall Mall Gazette says: "In language of studied moderation, but which leaves no room to doubt its meaning-, the President foreshadows the fixed deter I ir.inatlon of the government to stand by the ! policy of the 'open door' in the east. That declaration brings the United States in line with us, if ever the time comes to speak with enemies in the 'open door' way." 1 Referring to the Nicaragua canal, the Pall Mull Gazette remarks: "While fully admitting the validity of the President's i claims for the complete protection of the commerce of the United States, we may be permitted to point out that British interests are no less entitled to consideration, and that the government at Washington is al ready bound by definite obligations. We are convinced, however, that when it comes to business there will be no disposition in the United States to question the friendly equality of the two countries in this nat ter." St. James tiaueette lMeaned. The St. Janus' Gazette says: "The mes sage will be read with pleasure. The Presi dent faces new issues in a broad-minded way and suggests the solution of their problems on large and generous lines." The St. James Gazette reads the refer ences to Nicaragua and the friendly rela tions with Great Britain together, and draws the inference therefrom that Presi dent McKinley recognizes the binding char acter of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. "It would be strange," the article contin ues. "if the opportunities just now afforded by the Canadian negotiations do not result in the near future in a comprehensive un derstanding between the two great branch es of the English-speaking race, not merely on the broad, general linen of common com mercial Interests, but on such closely re lated details as the creation and guarantee of the interoceanic waterway." There is a certain tone of disappointment in the morning paper editorials on the mes sage. Tts non-committal character is at tributed to the fact that the negotiations of the peace commissioners at Paris are not yet finished. Considerable satisfaction is expressed at the references to Anglo-American relations and at the coldness displayed toward Russia. The Daily News complains of the "am biguity of the message on commercial and currency matters," and "the conspicuous absence of any allusion to free trade." t'omaieaded by llie Thunderer. The Times says: "It is creditable to both the dignity and good sense of the American people that a message announcing the victorious ending of the great war, the acquisition of terri tory and the initiation of an imperialist policy is sober in tone and moderate in recommendations. The war has finally healed the half-closed wounds after the Titanic conflicts of the secession and we hope it lias exercised a healing influence to be felt even more widely and deeply in another direction. "Not since England recognized the United States government power has an American President alluded to the mother country in language so cordial and friendly as Mc Kinley's." Discussing the message approvingly in de tail and referring to British rights in Nica ragua under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, the Times says: "If the freedom of the waterway is se cured to ships of all nations, as in the Suez canal, we shall not need to stand strictly upon claims which originated when the circumstances were altogether different." The Daily Chronicle also pays a tribute to the "sober, sound, common-sense and straightforward language" of the message, pointing out that President McKinley's ref erence to the military occupation of Cuba virtually outlines a polit y "precisely the same as that of Great Britain in Egypt and likely to have the same effect.' Commenting upon "the President's sur prising language concerning the Nicaragua canal, which utterly ignores British treaty rights, ' the. Daily Chronicle says that "this matter will arise ere long in a more acute form." The editorial highly approves Mr. Mc Kinley's references to China and Great Britain. VieivN oC th* Standard. The Standard says: "Few could have foretold that the war would work so rapid and drastic a change. How absolute the metamorphosis is may best be gathered from a comparison with previous messages. It is not rash to predict that the United States will advance in the path upon which their feet are now firmly set." The Standard construes Mr. McKinley's references to China as "a declaration that, had the 'open door' been closed or obstruct ed, America would have interfered active ly." It adds upon this point: * "For all purposes of British policy no in timation could be more welcome than that the United States will appoint a commit tee to study the conditions In China." The Daily Telegraph, which regards the announcement that the United States will support the "open door" in China as the weightiest which the message contains, says: "With such common interests to unite us, formal alliances are unnecessary." The Daily Mail says: "We are disappointed and surprised at this attempt to set aside the Clayton-Bul wer treaty, especially in view of the Anglo American entente." The Morning Post, on the other hand, says: "Circumstances have changed, and tn-.* American attitude toward the treaty is quite intelligible, but the immediate task awaiting Mr. Chamberlain is the assimila tion into his admirable sentimental view of th?* Anglo-American relations of the thorny problem associated with the Clayton-Bul wer treaty."

PUBLIC .'SITUATION I T Representative Hopkins Talks About It and the Message, o A WISE AND PATRIOTIC PAPER ' _ f > More Time Needed for Informa tion as to New Territory, j * TREATY TO BE RATIFIED Representative Hopkins of Illinois, who *1. one of the leading republicans in Con gress and who has the reputation of a thoughtful man, well Informed on public questions, talked very Interesting* U s morning on the subject of the Presidents message and the public situation "The President's message appears to me " he said, to have been very carefully con sidered. It is wise to reserve for future consideration the question of the disposi tion of new territory. The important thing at the outset Is to know Just where we stand rhe President presents to our con sideration the situation as it has thus far developed. The message is patriotic in tone and felicitous In expression, and is calcu lated to hold the country united. It would not be wise to undertake at the present time, deficient in Information as we must of necessity be, to determine a policy as %hergr;riment ?f -,h" n"w territory. Tlieie is comparatively little that this ongxoss can do, and the message evidently does ?ot contemplate broad, general leg . latlon at this session.

Representative Bland commented on the ; absence of any comment on the subject of silver. Chairman Dingley of the ways and means committee said: "The message is an excellent resume of the important events ; of the last year, with a clear presentation of the existing: situation and valuable sug gestions that will aid materially at the proper time hereafter in solving the dif ferent problems before us. It is to be not ed that the President states that our rev enue laws are working well, with no sug gestion of any needed modification. The message, although lengthy, is so valuable a recital of the history making events of the last year that it will be read with un usual interest.*' Mr. Richardson (Tenn.): "The President makes a most interesting and satisfactory review of the Spanish war. hut it is dis appointing that he failed to.tell us what we are to do with the new possessions. It is just as appropriate now as it will be after th? treaty of peace for him to tell us what is to be the future of the new territory. It might help to get the treaty ratified if he had solved that problem. It is interesting to note the fact that thr*e fourths of the message relates to foreign affairs and less than one-fourth to home matters. Banking and currency and all financial reform legislation, so -properly promised in 1890. g-et no mention, and our condition in respect to these matters is to be left unchanged." Views In the Senate. Senator Jones of Arkansas expressed sur prise at the absence of any recommendation concerning the Philippines. "The question of the "government of the Philippines is at tracting much attention," he said, "and the fs.ct that the President utterly ignores it strikes me as very singular." The senator also announced himself as opposed to a subsidy to vessels connecting the United States with Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines; as opposed to legis lation for the construction of the Nicaragua canal as at present contemplated, and ex pressed the opinion that the President was inclined to go farther in tie1 matter of the government of Cuba than the resolution of intervention had called for. "We declared." he said on this point, "in favor of taking them to that, point at which they could maintain a 'stable government.' and T do not see how we can go beyond that." The senator objected to a large standing army. "Some of us do not favor the iixr crease of the standing army," he said, "ancT the President has no right to assume that a majority stand with him on that proposi tion." lie also questioned the President's right to hold the volunteers in service be yond the time of signing the peace treaty. Senator Piatt of New York commended the expression of a determination to in crease th?* standing army and to maintain order in Cuba until the Cubans can take care of themselves. Senator Wolcott said It was an admirable document. Senator Lodge said It was "able and ex cellent." Senator Perkins: "An able resume of the situation and the facts leading up to the war." Senator Teller said: "The friends of bimetallism, either na tional or international, will find no encour agement from anything that the President says in his message. No reference is ma-de to international bimetallism, but the Pres ident in the most emphatic way indicates h:r intention to maintain the gold standard. The so-called silver republicans who re main in the republican party and contend that the republican party is friendly to sil ver will find no encouragement in the Pres ident's message, and It will strike all as somewhat singular that if the republican p*.rty, as it is claimed, Is in favor of Inter national bimetallism, the President makes n ? reference to it." Senator McMillan: "The message is a very able and graphic account of the events leading up to the war and of the war it self. Every recommendation it contains is worthy of being acted upon promptly by Congress." Senator Simon of Oregon appeared in the Senate today and occupied a seat on the right of Senator Marion Butler of North Carolina. His seat is on the end of the last row on the republican side. There was no seat there previous to today, and the one Mr. Simon occupies was removed from the democratic side of the chamber. Thousands of situations have been ob tained through the want columns of Th* Star.
