THE MESSAGE. President Harrison's Communica tion to Congress. Be Believes Tariff Revision Should Be Left Co the Next Congress A General Re view of the Condition of the Country The Treasury. Washington, Dec. 6. Both houses of congress were presented with thepres ident's message on assembling to-day. As will be seen it is devoted, in addition to the usual review of executive work, to a consideration of the effect of the changed political conditions on the com mercial and financial business of the country. The message as read is as follows: To the Senate and House of Representatives: In submitting my annual message to congress. I have great satisfaction in being able to say that the general condition affecting the com mercial and industrial interests of the United States are in the highest degree favorable. In comparison of the existing conditions with those of the most favorable period in the his tory of the country will, I believe, show that so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts of life were never be fore enjoyed by our people. The total wealth of the country in 18(50 was l6,ln9.tni,0S8r In : -3 it amounts to t62;01O,6OO, OGO, an increase of -85 per cent The .total mileage of railways In the United States in 1860 was 30,626: in 1W3 it WM 167,741, an increase of 488 per cent : and it is estimated there will be about 4,0 0 miles of track added toy the close of the rear of 1692. The (.facial returns of the eleventh census and those of the tenth census for seventy-five leading cities fur nished the basis for the following comparisons: In tle capital invested in manufacturing was 11,232,830 '.7J. In 1893 the capital invested Sn manufucturin? was i2,930,7 35,344. Ia 1880 the number of employes was 1,301,338, In 18W the number ot employes was 2,371,134. In INK) the wages earned were 8 1,963, 778. In 19 the -wages earned were Sl,221,17,-S."4. la 1880 the value of the product was f&,7U 579,999 In 1S30 the value of the product was 84,869,288.837. ' 1 am informed by the surxrintendont of the census that the omission of certain industries in 188', which were included in 1838, accounts in part for the remarkable .increase thus shown But aftrr making full allowances for differences of method and deducting the returns for all in dustries not included in the census of 1?83 there remain in the reports from theso seventy-live .. an iiicrua.se in capital employed of 81,525, V45,6el, In the value of the product of S2,024.23S, 106, in wages earned of 3077,9 13, 9. "9. and in the number of wage earners employed of 856.02:). The wane earnings not only show an increased aggregate, but an increased per capita from 838 ) in 1883 to Sair in 189), or 41.71 per cent. The newPidustrial plants established since October 6, 1890, and up to October 2i, 189-'. as pania'.ly reported in the American Economist, number 315, and the extension or existing -slants 18; the new capital invested amounts to ).449,:i5), and the number of additional em ployes to 37, -'83. The Textile World for July. 1832, stated that during the first sixteenth of the present calendar year 135 new factories were bnilt, of which 40 are cotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 28 woolen mills, 15 silk mills, 4 plush mills and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in the southern states. Mr. A. B. Shep jperson, of the New York Cotton exchange, esti mates that the number of working spindles in the United States on September 1, 1832, at 15,201.000, an increase of 663,000 over the year 189L The consumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,336,000 balos, and in 1892, 2.581,0'JO bales, an increase of 188,00) bales. From the year 1869 to 1892, in clusive, there has been an increase in the con sumption of cotton in Europe of 92 per cent., while during the same period the increase of consumption in the United States has been About 190 per cent. The report of Mr. Ira Ayer, special aent of the treasury department, shows that at the date of September 30, 182, there were thirty two companies manufacturing tin and terne ,rplate in the United States and fourteen com gpaalcs b::ildinsc new works for such manufact- urv The estimated investment of capital in bui.dinjrs and plants at tha close of the fiscal . year June 30. 1893, if existing conditions were to &e continued, was 85,000.000, anb the estimated -rate of production 200,0.0,000 pounds per an num. The actual production for the quarter ending September 30, 189i, was 10,9V2,7J5 pounds. Tu- report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of Kevv York, shows that during the year 1831, in about 6,003 manufacturing establishments in that .l:ite embraced within tho special inquiry snade by Ivni. and representing six tv-seven dif ferent industries, there was a net increase over -the year 189) of .31,315, 13 ).63 in the value of the product, and of ?6, 377,9:25.09 in the, amount of wa-.i s paid, The report of the commissioner of labor fir the state of Massachusetts, show that 3,745 industries in that state paid $129,416,243 in Wages -luring the year 1891, against 5126,030,333 la an increase of $3, 335,945, and that there was an increase of 19,932.190 in the amount of capital, and of 7,346 In the number of persons i employed in the same period. 1: rincr the last six months of the year 1891 aud the first six months of 1892 the total pro duction Of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, as against 8.209,7 J3 tons in the year 1830, which was the largest annual production ever attained. For the same twelve months of 1891-1892 the pro duction of Bessemer ingots was 3,8r8,581 tons, n increase of 183.710 gross tons over the previously unprecedented yearly production of 3.688,871 gross tons in 1800 The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first aix months o' 1892, was 772,436 gross tons, as against 70-',080 gross tons during the last six months of 1891. The total value of our foreign trade (exports and manufactures) during tho lasl fiscal year was (1,887.680 610, an increase of 8188,368,804 over the fiscal year. The average annual value of our imports and exports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891, was 41,457.322,019. It wfO be observed that our foreign trade for 189- exceeded this annual average value by 810 '.:; '8.391, an increase of 27.47 per cnt. The Significant and value of this increase are shown by the fact that the excess in the trade of 1802, -over IfcSl, was wholly in the value of expirt3, for there was a decrease in the value of im ports, of 417,513, -51. The value ol our exp-fils during the fiscal year 1SU2 reached the highest figures in the his tory of the government, amounting to 4M,OiO,27sU, exceeding by $145,737,338 the cx--ports oi and exeat din'- the value of the im ports by 22, i7.".6.f. A oomparisoarof the value of our imports for 1892 with the aunua! average for the ten years prior to lsl thews an excess of v-6. 142.671, or of 84.65 per cent. The value of - our imports of merchandise lor 1 3 2 which was 8829. IW.46H, also exceeded ttie annual average value of the ten years prior to 1891 by ;!3'21o. B4 . During the fiscal year ls92. i he value of imports free of duty amounted to 8i57,Q99.658, th- largest aggregate in the history .f our com merce. The value of the imports of merchan dise entered free of duty.in K-92 was B&.85 per cent, of the total value of imports, as compared with 43 35 per cent, in 1891 and 33.63 per cent, in 180 . In our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress, there having been in the last four years an increase of 10 per cent. In internal commerce, the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has ever before existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of the great lakes in 1890 aggregated 28, 2S5.959 tons On the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic ag gregated 29,404,406 tons and the total vessel ton- nage passing through the Detroit river during that year was t:i,09i,uuu tons. Tne vessel ton nage entered r.nd cleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890 amounted to 13,483,767 tons, and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total for these two great shipping norts of 24.422,5.8 tons, only lightly in excess of the vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit river. And it should be :::.! That the season for the Detroit river was bu' 228 days, while of course in London and Liverpool the season was for the entire year. The vessel tonnage passing through the St. Mary's canal for the fiscal year 1892 amounted to 9,828,874 tons and the freight tonnage of the Detroit river is estimated for that year at 25, C03.003 tons, against 23,209,619 tons in 1891. The aggregate traffic on our ra-rtroads for the year 1891 amounted to 704,898,609 tons of freight, com pared with 691,344,437 tons igjl890, an increase of 13,054.172 tons. Another indication of tho general prosperity Of the country is found in the fact that the number ol depositors in savings banks in creased from 63,870 in I860 to 4,258,893 in 1S9:. an increase of 513 per cent, and the amount of deposits from 8194,277.564 In 1863 to 31,524,344,?66 in 190, an increase of 921 per cent. In le91 the amount of deposits in savings banks was 1,623, -879.749. It is estimated that 93 per cent of these deposits represent the savings of wage earners. The bank clearings for tine months ending S tptember SO, 1891. amounted to S41,6i9, 896,368. For the same months in 189: they amounted to 145,185,861,917, an excess for toe . months of 14,110,211,139. There never ha been a time in our history when work was so abundant, or when wages were so high, whether measured by the cur rency in which they are paid, or toy their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the fanner cannot produce upon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate pro duction of the year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows over production. But while the facts I have stated are true as to the crops I have mentioned, the general aver age of prices has been such as to give to-agriculture a fair participation in the general pros perity. The value of our total farm products has increased from 81,363, 610.866 in 1863 to 84 500,000.000 in 1S31, as estimated by statisticians, an increase of 230 per cent The number of hogs January 1, 1831, was 50,625,103 and their value 8210,191,925. On January 1, 1892, the num ber was5-',393 019 and the value 241, 9:1,415. On January 1. 1891, the number of cattle was 36, 875,618 and the value 8541,127,998 On January 1, 1892. the number was 37,651,239 and the value 2570,749,155. If any are discontented with their state here: if any believe that the wages or prices, the returns for honest toil, are inade quate, they should not fail to remember that there is no o;her country in the world where the conditions that seem to them bard, would not be accepted as highly prosperous. The English agriculturist would be glaa to ex change the returns of his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester work men their wages for these of their iellows at Fall River. I believe that the protective system which now for something like thirty years has pre vailed in our legislation has been a mighty in strument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful agency in protect ing the homes of our workingmen from the in vasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread, but supply a comfortable margin for th'.se borne attractions and family com forts and enjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are Amer ican citizens a part of the great people for whom our constitution and government were framed and instituted-and it cannot be a per version of that constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the comfort, inde pendence, loyalty and sense of interest in the government whicii are essential to good citi zenship and which will bring them, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag when it is assarted. It is not my purpose to renew here the argu ment in favor of a protective tariff The result of the recent electioa must be accepted as hav ing introduced anew policy. We must assume that the present tariff, constructed upon -the lines of protection, is to bo repealed and that there is tO-bo substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference to revenue: that no duty is to be higher because the in crease will keep open an American mill or keep dp the wages of an American work man, but that in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring the treasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The contention has not been between schedules, but between principles and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into legislation the principles ad vocated by it and the pledges given to ihe peo ple. The tariff bills passed by the house of representatives of the last session were. I sup posed, even in the opinion of their promoters, inadequate and justified only by the fact that the senate and house of representatives were not in accord and that a general revision could not, therefore, be undertaken. I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the incoming congress. It is a matter of regret that this work must be de layed for at least three months, for tho threat of great tariff changes introduces so much un certainty that an amount not easily estimated, of business inaction and of diminished production, will necessarily result. It is possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased reve nues from customs duties. for our merchants will make cautious orders for foreign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and the un certainty as to when it will take effect Those who have advocated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous fore casts of a change of policy disappointed. If a system of customs duties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign made goods and at the same time keep our mills busy: that will give us an increased participa tion in "the markets of the world" of a greater value than the home market that we surrender; that will give increased work to foreign work men upon products to be consumed by our peo ple without diminishing the amount of work to be done here: that will enable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 53 to 100 per cent- more ia wages than is paid in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our mar kets and in foreicrn markets with the foreign producer: that will further reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the wages of those who produce them; that can be celebrated, after its effects have been realized, as its expectation has been in Europe, as well as in American cities, the au thors and promoters of it will be entitled to the highest praise. We hae had in our history several experiences of the contrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff: but this generation has not felt them and the experi ence of one generation is not highly instructive to the net. The friends of the protective sys tem, with undiminished confidence in the prin ciples they have advocated, will await tho re sults of the new experiment. The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the employes and employers in our great manufacturing establishments have not been favorable to a consideration by the wage earner of the effect upon wages of the protective system The fact that hts wages were the highest paid in the like callings of the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wages in the ab sence of protective duties upon the product of bis labor, was impossible, were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review th3 question in the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby maintained or increased, either ab solutely or in their purchasing power and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is increased or even maintained; that there are more or as many davs' work in a year at as good or better wares for the Amenc workman as has been the case under the pro tective system every one will rejoice. A gen eral process of wage reduction cannot be con templated by any patriotic citizen without the gravest apprehensiou. It may be. indeed. believe. Is, possible for the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branches of production without the defense of protective duties, if the pay rclis are equalized: but the conflict that stands between the producer and that result and the .distress of the people, when it is at tained, are not pleasant to contemplate. Th society of the unemployed, now holding its frt quent and threatening parades ia the streets of foreign cities, shouid not be allowed to acquire an American domicile Reports of Departments. The reports of the heads of the several execu tive departments, which are herewith sub mitted, have very naturally included a resume of the whole work of tho administration, with the transactions of the list fiscal year. The attention, not only in congress, but of the conn try. is again invited to the methods of adm:n:s tration which have been pursued, and to the re suits which have been attained Public revert ues amounting to 81,414,09.292.28 have been col lected and disbursed without loss from mis appropriation, without a single defalca tion of such importance as to attract the public attention, and at a diminished per cent, of cost for collection. The i nubiic business has been transacted not onlv with fidelity, but progressively and with a view to giving to the people in the fullest pos sible degree the benefits of a service estab lished and maintained for their protection aad comfort. Relations With l-'orelg- Power. Our relations with other nations are now un ; disturbed by anv serious controversy. The ; complicated and threatening differences with j Germany and England relating to Samoan i affairs, with England in relation to the seal i fisheries in the Bearing sea and with Chili growing out of the Baltimore aflair have been adjusted. There have been negotiated and concluded under section 3 of the tariff law commercial agreements Telating to reciprocal trade with the following countries: Brazil, Dominican republic, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Kico, Guatemala. Salvador, the German empire. Great Britain for certain West Indian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras and Austria-Hungary. Of these, those with Guatemala, Salvador, the German empire. Great Britain, Nicaragua, Honduras and Austria-Hungary have been con cluded since my last annual message. Under these trade arrangements, a free favored ad mission has been secured in every case for an important list of American products. Especial care has been taken to secure markets for farm products in order to relieve that great under lying industry of the depression which the lack of an adequate loreign market for our surplus often brings. An opening has also been made for manufactured products that will undoubt edly, if this policy is maintained, greatly aug ment our export trade. The full benefits of these arrangements cannot be realized instant- ly- The following statistics show the increase In our trade with the countries with which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when such agreements went into effect up to September 30, 189.', the increase being in some almost wholly and in others in an important de gree the result of these agreements: The domestic exports to Germany, Austria and Hungary have increased in value from S47, 673,756 to S57.993 064, an increase of ?10,319, 308. With American countries our ex ports have increased from 84,160,283 to 54.613,594, an increase of ?10,458,3ia or 2a 67 per cent. The total increase in the value of exports to all the countries with which we have reci procity agreements has been 523,672,621. Tht3 increase is chiefly in wheat, flour, meat and dairy products, and manufatures of iron and steei and lumber. There has been a large in crease in the value of imports from all these countries since the commercial agreements went into effect, amounting to -i74,294.525. but it has been entirely in imports from the American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, India rubber and cruJfe drugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for the South American market has been attracted to this new American policy and to our acquisi tion and their loss of South American trade. THE 

CANADIAN DIFFICCT-TIES. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain and the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bchring sea was concluded on tho :29th of February last. This treaty was accompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitra tion and a vigorous effort was made durinz this season to drive out all poaching steamers from the Behring sea. The case of the United States for the tribunal of arbitration has been prepared with great care and industry by Hon. John W. Foster, and the counsel who represent this government ex press confidence, that a result substantially es tablishing our claims and preserving this great industry to tho benefit of all nations Will be at tained. During the past year a suggestion was re ceived through the British minister that the Ca nadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of enlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canada and of ihc United States, and a con ference was held at Washington, with Mr. Blaine acting for this government, and the British min ister at this capital and three members of the do minion cabinet acting as commissioners on tho part of Great Britain. The cor.fer:nee devel oped the fact that the Canadian government was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for the concessions asked the ad mission of natural products. The statements they made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother country. This admission 3S foreseen necessarily terminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange of the natural products would be almost wholly with the peo ple of Canada. Other topics of interest were considered in the conference aud have resulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary, the waters of Passama quoddv bay adjacent to Eastport, Me. , and on the initiation of an arrrngement for the protec tion of fish life in the coterminous and neigh boring waters of our north boundary. The controversy as to the tolls upon tho "VVel land canal, which was presented to congress at the last session by special message, having failed of adjustment, I felt constrained to ex ercise the authority conferred by the act of July 26, 1892, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St. Marys Falls canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada. The secretary of the treasury established such tolls as were thought to be equivalent to the exactions un justly levied upon our commerce in the Cana dian canals. If, as we must suppose, the political relations of Canada and tho disposition of the Canadian government, are to remain unchanged, a some what radical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be made. Our relations must continue to ba intimate, and they should be friendly. I regret to say, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those as to the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific and the canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain have continuously been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and un friendly objections and protests from Canada. In the matter of the canal tolls, our treats rights were flagrantly disregarded. It is hard ly too much to say that the Canadian Pacific and other railway lines which parallel our northern boundary are sustained by commerce havin.7 its origin or the originators, or both, in the Cniied States. Tho Canadian railroads compete with those of the United States for our traffic and without the restraints of our iri- er-state commerce act. Their cars.pa3S almost without detention in and out of our territory.' The Canadian Pacific railway brought into the United States from China and Japan via British Columbia during the year ended June SO. 189:2, i3,239.6S9 pounds of freight and it carried from the United States to be shipped to China and Japan via British Columbia 24,068,345 pounds of freight. There were also shipped from the United States over this road from eastern ports of the United States government and Pacific ports dur- the same year,13,912,013 pounds of freightand there were received over this road at the United States eastern ports from ports on the. Pacific coast 13,293,31.5 pounds of freight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, former chief of the bureau of statistics, when before the senate committee on relations with Canada, April 26, 1890. said that' the value of goods thus transported between different points in the United States acro&s Canadian territory, probably amounts to il 00, 000, 030 a year." There is no disposition on the part of the peo ple or government of the United Stp.tes to in terfere in the smallest degree with the political relations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It is time for us, how ever, to consider whether, if the present state of things and trend of things is to continue, our interchanges upon lines of land transportation should not be put upon a different basis, and our entire independence of Canadian ca nals and of the St Lawrence as an outlet to the sea secured by the construction of an American canal around the falls ol Niagara and the opening of ship com munication between the great lakes and one of our own sea ports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade ad vantages. We should withdraw the support which is given to the railroads and steamship "lines of Canada by a tradla that properly be longs to us and no longer furnish the earn;n?o which lighten the otherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have been jiwn to thm. The nhtant of the nower of the treasury to deal with this matter without 1 further legislation has been under considera tion, but circumstances have postponed a con clusion. It is probable that a consideration of the nroprieW of a ihodlfieaiion or abrogation of the article of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit or goods in bond is involved in any complete solution of the question. THE 

AFFAIR wmi CHILL Congress at the last session was advised of tho progress of the threatening differences with the republic of Chili. It gives me now great gratification to report that the Chilian, govern ment, in a most friendlv and honorable spirit, has tendered and paid as an ind?mnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who were killed and to those who frere injured ia the outbreak in the city of Valparaiso tho sum of ?75.(). This has bsen accepted, not only as an indemnity for a wron; done, but as a most gratifying evidence that the government of Chili rightly appreciates the disposition of this government to act in a spirit of absolute fair ness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people. A farther and conclusive evidence of the mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact that a j convention submitting to arbitration the mu tual claims of the citizens of the respective governments has b -ea agreed upon. Soma of these claims have been pending for many years ! and have been the occasion of much uasatis factory diplomatic corrsspondence. II have endeavored in every wav to assure our Sister republics of Cenral and South America that the United States government and its I people have only the most friendly disposi- I tion toward them all. We do not covet j their territory. "We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in our dealinss with any of them, even the ! weakest Our interests and our hopes for them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their people and of the largest development of their commercial resources. The mutual benefits of enlarged commercial intercourse with our people we do desire and in this have sought their friendly eo-operation. 1 have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the greatest sincerity, that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injuries inflicted upon our official representa tives or upon our citizens This icsistance kindly and justly, but firm'y made, will I be- lieve promote peace anu niw respect OTHER FOBEIGS MATTERS. Our relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increased interest and must con tinue to do so. I deem it of great importance that the projeeted subirarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should be promoted both for naval and commercial uses. We should have quick communication. We should before have availed ourselves of the concession, made manv years ago to this government for a harbor and naval station at Pearl river. Many evidences of the friendliness of the Hawaian government have been given in the past and it is gratifying to believe that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very close relations is appre ciated. The friendly act of this government in ex pressing to the government of Italy its repro bation and abhorrence of the lynching of Ital ian subjects in New Orleans by the payment of 125,000 francs, or 521,333.90, was accepted bv the king of Italy with every manifestation of grate ful appreciation, and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will. In consequence of the action of the French government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa, eastward of the San Pedro river, I have felt constrained to make protest against this encroachment upon the territory of a republic which was founded by citizens of the United States and toward which this coun try has for many years held the intimate rela tion of a friendly counsel. Th3 recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican frontier have afforded the government an op portunity to testify its good will toward Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill its obligations of international friendship by pursuing and dis persing the evil doers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of Guadalupe Hi dalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably. Our in :ercourse with Spain continues on good terms. I regret, however, not to b3 able tore port as yet tho adjustment of ihe claims of the American missionaries arising from tho dis orders at Ponape. in the Caroline islands, but 1 anticipate a satisfactory adjustment of ur gent representations to tho government at Madrid. Tho treatment of the relig ious and educational establishments of American citizens in Turkey has of late called 'for mora than the usual share of attention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficially prevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest remonstrances of this goverpment. Harassing regulations ia retard to schools and Churches have been attempted in certain localities, but not without due pro test and the assertion of the inherent and con ventional rights of our countrymen. Violations of domicile and search of the persons and ef fects of citizens of the United States by appar ently irresponsible officials in the Asiatic vil layets have irom time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of injury to tho proper ty of an American missionary at Bourdeur, in the province of Koni, called forth an urgent claim for reparation which. lam pleased to say, was promptly heeded by the government of the porte. Interference with the trading ventures of our citizens in Asia Minor is also reported, aud the lack of consular represen tation in that region is a ssrious draw back to instant and effective protection. I cannot believe that these incideats represent a settled policy and shall not ceaso to urg3 the adoption of proper remedies. International copyrigut has been extended to Italy by proclamation in conformation with the act of March 3, 1891, upon assurance being givea that Italian law permits to citizens of the Unitrd States the bene'it of copyright on sub stantially the same basis as the subjects of Italy. By a special convention proclaimed January 15,1893, reciprocal provisions of copyright have been applied between the United States and Germany. Negotiations are in progress with other countries to the same end. I repeat with great earnestness the recom mendation which I have made mention in previous messages to the inadequate support given the American company engaged in con struction of the Nicaragua ship canal. It is impossible to over state the value from every standpoint of this great enterprise, and I hope there may be time given in this congress to give to it an impetus that will insure the 'arly completion of the canal and secure to the United States its proper relations to it when completed. THE MONETARY COSFEREMCS. Congress has already been advised that the Invitations of the government for the assemb png of an international monetary conference to consider the question of an enlarged issue of silver was accepted by the nations to which they were issued. The conference assembled at Brussels on the 22nd of November, and has entered upon tho consideration of this great question. I have not doubted and have taken occasion to express that belief. .3 well in the invitations issued for this conference, as In my public messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an acrreed international ratio would great ly promote the interests of our people and equally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may be accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or de lav intervenes, I believe that very soon com mercial conditions will compel the now reluct ant governments to unite with us in this move ment to secure tho enlargement of the volume of money needed for the transaction of the business of the world. Executive Departments. THE TREASURY. The report of the secretary of the treasury will attract special interest in view of the many misleading statements as have been made as to the state of public revenues. Three preliminary facts should not only be stated but emphasized before looking into details: First, that the public debt has been reauced since March 1889, 8355,074,200, and the annual interest charges $ll,6St,40O; second, that there have been paid out for pensions during this administration on up to November 1, 1893, 5432,5(54,178. 70, an excess of 8114,456.306.09 over the sum expended during the period from March L 1885. to March 1, 1389; and third, that under the existing tariff up to December 1 about 593,000.000 of revenue, which would have been collected upon imported sugars if the duty had been maintained, has gone into thepccket3of the people and not into the pub lic treasury, as before. If there are any who still think that the surpius should have been kept out ot circulation by hoarding it in the treasury, or depositing it in banks with out interests while the government con tinued to pay the very banks interest, upon the bonds deposited as security for the deposits, or who think that the extended per sion legislation was a public robbery, or that the duty on sugar should have been maintained, I am content to leave the argument where it now rests, while we wait to see whether these criticisms will take the form of legislation. The revenues of the ti seal vear ending June 2 . IS92, from all sources, wore $425,8d3.38Jl23, and the expenditures for all purposes were 5U5.9"3,81j 55, leaving a balance of eU,914 453. 06. There was paid during he vear upon the pub lie debt $4 3. 570, 167. 93. Tbesurplusin the treasury and the bank redemption fund, passed by tho act of July 14, 189', to the general fund, fur nished in large part, the cash available and used for the payments made upon the public debt. Compared witb. the year 1831, our re ceipts from customs duties tell off 5I-,069,2U.:)8, while our receipts from internal revenue in creased ?8,-38 1,8.13. 13 leaving the net loss of revenue from those principal sources S33,74, 417.93. The net loss of revenue from all sources was f 32,675, 9 72.81. The revenues, estimated and actual, for the year ending June i'0, 1S33, are placed by the secretary at 8461, t30, io . 44. and the expendi tures at 54 31, 333,350.41, showing a surpius of receipts over expenditures of ;2.0vK). Ox). Tho cash balance in the treasury at the end of the riscal year, it is estimated, will be ?2J,932, 387.03. So far as thsse figures are based on estimates of receipts and expenditures for the remaining months of the current fiscal year, there are not only the usual elements of uncertainty but some added elements Now revenue legislation, or even the expectation of it, may seriously re duce the public revenues during the period of uncertainty and during the pres3 of business adjustment to the new conditions when they become known. But the secretary ha3 very wisely refrained from guessing as to the effect of possible chinirss in sur revenue laws, since the scope of those changes and the tL-ne cf their taking effect cannot in any degres be forecast or foretold by him His estimates must be based upon existing laws and upon a continu ance of existing business conditions, except so far as ihese conditions mav ba affected by causes other than new legislation. Tho estimated receipts for the fiscal year June ?0. 1893, are $493,121,365 S3, and the esti mated appropriations 457,261,835.33, leaving an estimated surplus of receipts over the ex- elude anv oavment to tho sinking fund. In the ( recommendation of the secretary that the sink ing- fund law be repealed I concur. The re- demption of bonds since the passage of the law to June 33, 18b2, has already exceeded the re quirements by the sum of 8993..-10,6S1.49. The retirement of bonds in the future before ma turity should be a matter of convenience, not or CDtnpulsion. We should Kot collect revenue for that purpose, but only use any casual surplus To the balance of J3.,863,0iJ.0o of receipts over expenditures for the year 1894 should be added the estimated surplus at the begin ning of the year, 820,932.377. 0& and from this aggregate there must be deducted, s stated by the secretarv, about 844,030,000 of estimated un expended appropriations The puDlic confluence in the purpose and abil ity of the government to maintair. the parity ot all "ttr Trv.-c- jssnes, whether coin or paper, must remain unshaken. The demand for gold In Europe and the consequent calls upon us are i n a considerable degree t e result ol the efforts of some of the European governments to increase their gold reserves, and these ef forts shouid be met by appropriations upon our part The conditions that have created this drain of the treasury gold are in an important degree political and not commercial. In view of ie fact tuat a general revision of our rev-enii'- iavs in the near future seems to be probabie it would be better that any changes should be a part of that revision rather than of a temporary nature. During the last fiscal year the secretary pur- caaseti uncer the act of July 14, ISA). 54,335,748 ounces of silver and issued iu payment thereof ; 45l,i0i,$S in notes. The total purchases since ! the passage of the act have been 123.479.981 j augurated by rhs legislation and that the !xp ounces and the aggregate of notes issued, prupriatioas required to meet the obligations $!lti.3J,59J. The average price paid for j of the gove-.nnent under the contracts silver during the year was tf4 cents per j mar be promptly mdo so thai th lisos ounce, tho highest price being S1.02V i that have entered iuto th-.se rniifrttiwf July 1. lSJl. and the lowest ?0.83 March 21, 1392. In view of the fact that the monetary confer ence is now sitting and that no conclusion has as yet been reached I withhold any recommen dation upon this subject. THE WJLB OFFICE. The report of the secretary of war brings again to the attention of congress some impor tant suggestions as to the reorganization of the infantry and artillery arms of the service. which his predecessors have before urged that j they be pressed. Our army U small but its or ganization should all the more be put upon tho most approved modern basis. The conditions upon what we have caiied ihi "frontier" have heretofore required the maintenance of many small posts, bur now the policy of concentra tion i3 obviously the right one- The new posts should have the yruper stragetic relations to the only ' -front iers" we now hsve, those of the. seacoast and of the northern part of our south ern boundary. I do not think that anv question of advantage ia localities, or states, should de fcrmins the location of the new posts The organization and enlargcmant of the bureau of military information which the secretar .- has effected is a work the usefulness of Which will become every year more apparent. The work of building heav- guns anl the construction of coast defenses has been well begun and should be carried on without check. JC-TiCS. The report of the attorney-general is by law submitted directly to congress,' but I cannot refrain from saying that ho has conducted the increasing work of the department of fostlCQ with great profes sional skill. He has in several directions se cured from the oourts decisions ra.king in creased protection to the officers of th United States and bringing some classes of crime that escape 1 to puaishrnent in the tribunals of the United States, where they could be tried with impartiality. The numerous applications for executive clemency presented in behalf of persons con victed in the United States courts and g.ven penitentiary sentences have called my atten tion to a fact referred to by tho attorney-gen- erat in hts report, namely that a time allowance for good behavior for such prisoners is prescribed by tho federai statutes only where the state in which the pen- j iteatiary is located had made no such provisiou lrTisoners are given the beneut ol tne provi sions of the state law regulating the peniten tiary to which they m .y be sent. Thes3 are various, some perhaps too liberal and some per haps too illiberal. The result is a sentence for five years means one thing if the prisoner is sent to one state for confinement, and quite a different thing if he is sent to another. I rec ommend a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribed by congress I have before expressed my coceorrence in the recommendation of the attorney-gocisroJ that degrees of mutder shall be recognized in the federal statutes, as they are, I believe, in all the states. These grades arc founded on correct distinctions in crime. Tne recog nition of them would enable tho courts to exercise some discretion in apportion ing punishment and would greatly relieve the executive of what is coming to be a very heavy burden- the examination of these cases on application for commuutioa The aggregate of claims pending in the court of claims is enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly 840,030,008 for injury to persons claiming to be loyal during the war are now before that court for examination. "When to these are added the Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation claims an ag gregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defen ,,..,,,.",... Ti.-,u-,.wnt- h-,T- at a gre . - preserved their evidence whereas tn; govern- i menthas to send agents to rummage the field for what they can find. This difficulty is peculiar ly great where the fact ts be established is the disloyalty of the claimant during the war. If this great threat against our revenue is to have no other check it is certain congress should sup ply the department of justice with appropria tions sufficiently liberal to secure the best legal talent in the defense df these claims and to pursue its vague search for evidence. TEE POST OFFICE. The report of the postmaster-general shows a most gratifying increase and a most efficient and progressive management of the great busi ness of that department. The remarkable in crease in revenues in the number of post offices and in the miles of mail interchange furnishes further evidence of the high state of prosperity which our people are enjoying. New offices mean new hamlets, towns, routes mean the extension of our border settlements, and in creased revenues mean active commerce. The postmaster-general reviews the whole period of his administration of the office and brings some of his statistics down to the month of November last. The postal revenues have in creased during the last year nearly 8", 000,003. The deficit for the year ending June 30. 1892, is f8(3,341 less than the deficiency of the preced ing year. The deficiency of the present fiscal year it is estimated will be reduced to -51,752,423, which will not only be extinguished during the next fiscal year, but a surpius of nearly $1,003, 000 should there be shown. In these calculations the payments to be made under the contracts for ccean mail service have not been included. Tuere have been added 1,590 new mail routes during the year with a mileage of 8,863 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips added during the year is nearly 17,OOJ,000- The number of miles of mail journeys added during the last four years is about 76,000,0X1, this addition being 21,000,000 of miles more than there were in operation in the whole country in 1831. The number of past offices has been increased by 2,790 during the year, and during the past four years and up to October 23 last, the total increase: of the number of offices has been near- ! great n..val power, ly 1,03 . The number of free delivery offices the UttMHDS has been nearly doubled in the pasijkmr year3 j The work of the interior department, always and the number of mony order offices more : very burdensome, ha bon larger than ever be than doubled with that time. For three years ! fore, during the administration of Secretary ended June 30, 192, the postage revenue j jfoble. The disability pf-nsion law. taking the. amounted to 519.741.359, which was an increase eleventh census, the opening of vast areas of of 552.2! 3.153 over th-. revenue for three years Indian lands to settlement, the organization of ended June 33, 18-8, the increase during the Oklahoma and the negotiations for the cession of last three years being more than three and a half 1 Indian lands furnish some of the particulars of times as great as the increase during the three years ended June 3j, 13i8 No such in crease as that shown for these three years has ever previously- appeared in the revenues of the department. The postmaster-general has ex tended to the post offices in the larger cities the merit of promotion, introduced by my di rection, into the departments here, and it has resulted there, as in the departments, in a large volume of work, and that better done. Ever since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel cruisers during the war of the rebellion, the Unite I States has been paying an enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in the shape of freight and passenger moneys, our grain and meats have been taken j at our own uocus and o ir large imports tncre ! laid down by foreign shipmasters. An increas ing torrent of American travel to Europe has ' contributed a vast sum annually to the iivi f dends of foreign ship owners. The balance of trade shown by the books of our custom houses has been largely reduced ! and in many years altogether extinguished ; by this constant strata In the year lf2 i only 1-3 per cent, of our imports were brought j in American vessels. The foreign steamships I maintained br our traffic are many of them tin : ' der contract with their respective governments I i by which in time of war they will become a part of their armed naval establishments. : j Profiting bv our commerce in peace, they will ' I become the most formidable destroyers of our commerce in time of war . I felt and have be ! fore expressed the feeling that this condition of ' thinsrs was both intolerable and disgraceful. A wholesome change cf policy and having so much promise as it seems to me, was begun by the j law of March 3, Under this iaw contracts have been made by the postmaster-general for eleven mail routes The expenditure involved by these contracts for the next fiscal year an- nroximatsd 098 123.33. A3 one of the good re - suits reached, sixteen American ships of an ag- euurL wmcn a. benson was con gregate tonnage of 57. 4J0 tons, costing : 7.000.000. 1 1 victed of the murder of Mrs. Theresa, have been built or contracted to be built ia : Mettman on the military reservation at American ship yards.

We have had br reason oi connections with th" trans-couti-nental railway linos constructed through our own territory some advantages that we did not possess on the Atlantic. Tne construction of the Canadian Pacific railwav and the estab lishment under large subventions fram Canada i and England of fast steamship service from j Vancouver with Japan and China seriously j threaten o-jr smpaias Interests in th IV. ride. This line of xlngiish steamers received. as sjatea oy the commission sr oi navigation, a direct subsidy of -M03.0.O annually, or S23.7(VI per trip for thirteen voyages, in addition to some further aid from the tidmlraitv Ui connec tion with contracts by which the vessels mav be used for naval purp-ses. The compel in j American Pacific Mall lino, under the act of March 3, 1891, receives only 5w,33 per round ! I ZZfforts have been mak'ug within the last 1 year, as I am informed, to establish, under 1 similar condUions, a line between Yuncouver and some Australian port with a :ew ol secur ing there a trade in which we hive h I I .. bk? -a interrst. The commissioner of navlc.:tl.-,u states tnat a very larre per cent of am issporta from Asia are now brought to us by English steamships and their connecting railwars ia Canada. With a view cf promoting t Is trafla, especially in tea, Canada ha 3 tmpaiifil a dis criminating duty of 10 per cent, on tea an I cof fee brou :ht into the dominion from the United States. If this unequal contest between Amer ican lines without subsidy, or with dimmish! subsidies and the Kitglish Canadian line to which I have referred is to cmtianc. I ihint we should at least see that the facilities for customs entry ana transportation across curt territory r.re not sa-ch as to make the Canadian route a favored one, and that the di.crlalna- J tion as to anties, to wat-eh I have referred, is met by a like discrimination as to tho importation of these tides from C.nada. .No subject, I think, more nearly HwaTlil ll ti.e power and prosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchant marine upon the sea. 17 wc co-cld enter into conference with other compe titions and all would agree to with hold government aid. we could p-.-rhps take our chances with the r, st.but our grc- t coi.ii.etitors have established and maintained their lines by government subsidies until now they have prac aliy excluded us from partioipatioa. In my opinion, no choice is left us but to put the issue, moderately at least, on the same lines. THE SAW. The report of the secr-. tary of On navy ex hibits great progress in the construction cf our new navy. When the present secretary entered upon his duties only three modern steel vessels were ia ccmmUsion. The vessels siuce put in commission and to be put :c commission during the winter will make a total of nineteen during his administration of the department. During the current year ten war vessels and three navy tugs have been launched. Two other large ships and a torpedo boat are under contract and the work upon them well advanced and the four monitors are awaiting only the ai rival of their armor, which has been unexpectedly deiayed, or they would have been before this in commission. Contracts have been let during this adminis tration, under the appropriations for the in crease of the navy, including aew v-;.--is ani their appurtenances to thi amount of BX.000 0OJ, and ihere has been expended durin.r tho same period for labor at navy yards upon si mi. lar work ?:i Ka), oa. without the smallest scan dal or charge of fraud or partiality. The en thusiasm and interest of our naval otScers. both of the staff and line, have be-n greatly kindled. They have responded magnificently to the con- ' the world an unexcelled capacity to construct I ill crdtian and in ever vUrinff involved in i!i building, equipning and sailing of great war j ships. At the beginning of Secretary Tracy's administration several difficult problems re mained to be grappled with and solved before the efficiency ia action of our steam ships couid be secured It is believed That as the result of new processes ia the construc tion of armor plate our later ships will ba clothed wiih defensive plates of higher resist ance than are found on any w;ir vessel afloat. We were without torpedoes. Tests h ive been made to ascertain the relative -iflcic-ncy of dif ferent constructions, a torpedo has been adopt ed and the work of construction is now beimj carried on successfully. We are without armor piercing shells. We are now making what is believed to be a projectile superior to any befor: in use. A smokeless pow der has been adopted and a slow burning powder for guns of large caliber. High explo sives, capable ot use in shells fired from heavy guns have been found and the manufacture of gun cotton has been developed and the question of supply is no longer in doubt. The development of a naval militia which has been organized In eight states and brought into cordial and co-operative relations with tho navy, is another important achievement. There are now enlisted in these organiza tions 1,83 men and t.hey are likely to ba greatly extended- I recommend 6'ach legisla tion and appropriations as will encourage and develop this movement The recommenda tions of the secretary, will I do not doubt, re ceive the friendly consideration of congress, for he has enjoye, as he has deserved, the con fidence of all those interested in the develop ment of our navr4 without any division upon partisan lines. I earnestly express the hope that a work which has made - :ch noble pro gress mav not be stayed. The wholesome in fluence for the peace and increased sense ol securitv which our citizens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent ships under the American flag appear, is already most gratefully apparent. The steamships from oar navy which will appear in the harbor cf New York, will be a convincing demonstra t ion to the world that Use United States is a the increased work aiid th.- results achieved testify to the ability, lidelitv an I indnstr.' of the head of the department aud his efficient as sistants. Several important agreements for the cession of Indian lands Dcgotii.t''d by the Indian mission appointed under the act of slarea 2, 1S39, are awaiting the act of eongress. Perhaps the most important of these is that f ar the cession of the Cherokee str.p. This has been a source of preat vexation to the exec utive representative and great friction inures between the settlers in their desire to occupy it and the Indians who assert tit'e. The agreement which has been male be the com mission is perhaps the most salt-factory that couid have btren reached. It will be noticed thf it is conditioned upon its ratification by congress before March 4. 1S33. -Th injUSHaiJ of the interior, who ha3 givea the subject care ful thought, recommends the ratification of the agreement and was inclined to follow this reo ommer.dation. Certain it is that some action bv which this controversy shall be brought to an end and the lands opeaea to settlement is urgent. The rest of the president's message was devoted to departmental a"ffairs, much of w hich has already been pub lished He concJude3 by hopincr the deliberations of congress will result to the material advantage oi the country.
