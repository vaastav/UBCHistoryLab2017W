Presi dent Wilson In his annual address to congress today dealing mainly with national defense, proclaimed an ad yanced PanAmerlcanlsm growing from the guardianship of the Monroe doctrine to "the full and honorable association" of all the Americas. Although In the longest address he has yet delivered to congress the president touched upon a variety of subjects, the predominating note was the .necessity tf a policy of military preparedness to meet the readjust ments of the next generation as they will affect the American continent. He emphasised bis point by saying: "Unless you tafce It within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought, 1 can not find the right light In which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my whole nought as I address you today. I mean national defense." Finn Dlaloyal Americans. The point was not overshadowed when the president In the most unmeasured terms he ever has employed before con gress denounced naturalised American who by their sympathies with Kuropean belligerents have endangered American neutrality. While congress cheered to him loudly he referred to them as having "poured the poison of disloyalty Into the very arteries of our national life, and "who would turn In malign reaction .gainst the government and the pooplu who had welcomed and nutured them." with evidences of deep feeling, the pres' dent expressed "the even deeper humili ation and acorn which every self possessed and thoughtful patriotic American must feel when be thinks of them and of the m Jli iL.H jtfe Vatntrlnfr imrtn 111 ' aiT ST ZXSZr T ou I;, r,i tile I .niflfrftftt"" t" fnr the army and navy passed without a ripple of applause and his references to pan-Americanism . tne meeting place of the 1916 demo wera only punctuated with ijUwcm ot natlonai convention. approval republican and democrats alike . .v. .. k.ii.t ... joined in an emphatic demonstraUon at 1 The vote on the first ballot was. his words of condemnation for those he 1 St. Louis, 26; Dallas, 14; Chicago, assailed so unreservedly. 112.

We retain unabated the spirit which was so frankly in Int. .n kw PM.M.nt Unnwu 7 m national Independence and ot political liberty In America, but that purpose Is now better understood so far as It con cerns ourselves." The moral the president said Is that the states of America were not hostile rivals, but co-operating friends and that their association were likely to give them a new significance in world affairs. "Separated they are subject to all the cross-currents of the confused politics of a world of hostile rivalries," aald he. "United in spirit and purpose they cannot be disappointed In their peaceful destiny. Thla is pan-Amerlcanlam. It has none of the spirit of empire In It It la the em bodiment, the effectual embodiment ot the spirit of law and Independence and liberty and mutual service." Great Democimrlrl Peaceful.
