Tho Cologne Gazette, in an inspired comminique, says: "Mr. Krnger's visit is not agreeable to Germany, his aim being to obtain inter vention in South Africa. It would be a grave mistake, it would bo even a great crime, to allow him to entertain even a spark of hope that Germany will render him any practical support." This declaration is accompanied with reproaches, Mr. Kruger being charged with "having encouraged a useless guer rilla warfare and having disregarded Ger many's advice when he might have still followed it." The press generally strikes tho same note. 

SMALLPOX AT WINONA. More Than 400 Cases, but No Deaths Reported.

Tho Washington and Kosciusko schools were also ordered closed for the present, as were also two steam laundries. The closing of the launarios has inconvenienced a great many people, and has caused not a little denunciation of the board of health, as the local physicians aro unable to agree whether the disease is really smallpox.

A PROPOSITION FOR PEACE. The Statist Thinks Time Has Come to Stop Hostilities in Africa. London: The Statist will propose that the government should begin negotiations with Commandant General Botha and Gen. DeWet to bring the war to a close.

WEEK'S HAPPENINGS f. SOUTH DAKOTA EVENTS IN A I, CONDENSED FORM. Question Has. Arisen in Yankton and Other Counties Concerning the Eligibility of County School Superintendents—Other Items. A controversy has been raised in Yank ton County concerning the eligibility of Z. F. Williams, lately elected county iuperintendent on the Republican ticket. Bis opponents raise the point that he has iiad no state certificate for one year prior to his election, as required by law. The records of tho state superintendent show Williams was granted a certificate on June 1,6, 1900. This would make him short of the necessary time required by law, but the department of eduoation holds that he is still not disqualified, as the law permits the holder of a first grade certificate to be county superintendent of schools. A great deal of controversy has arisen in the state relating to the eligibility of county superintendents under this provision of the statute, and the ease of Mrs. Kings bury, wife of the late Superintendent Kingsbury of McCook County, who de sired to be appointed after the death of her husband, was submitted to Attorney Gen sral Pyle for an opinion in February, 1899. He held the law unconstitutional, because It sought to establish qualifications for a Bounty superintendent in addition to those mentioned in the constitution of the state, ind that a county superintendent need nVy to be an elector. Miss Luoena Triss S8r of Pennington County, who was re sently defeated for superintendent, threat ens to bring suit against her successful op ponent on the ground of ineligibility under tbe statute, in which event tbe supreme sourt will in all probability pass upon the constitutionality of the law.

REPORT State's- Revenues from Leases and) Real Estate Sales. Land Commissioner Eastman has about completed his biennial report for tbe pe riod ending June 80, 1900, in which he shows the Work which is being done toward building up a fund for the benefit of the common schools and various educational institutions of the state. After a general review as to the methods of handling tho state funds, he gives a few statements in his lctterof transmittal, call ing attention to the tabulated work in tho body of the report, which gives in full just what is being done by the office and which is of interest generally, as aro all the de partments of state which have to do with the revenues. The letter shows that th6 amount of the permanent school fund now held by the state, which has been received from vari ous sources, is $3,372,926, on which the state is drawing interest for tho benefits of the schools. The amount which the de partment has paid toward the support of the common schools of the state since 1890 is $1,377,747. The state was granted 2,150,480 acres of common school lands, w,hich does not in clude tlie sections in reservations granted for such purpose. Attention is called to tho fact that with the additional $1,200 for clerk hire and $400 for expenses granted the department by the last legislature, it lias been able to se cvuf topographical records of the state lands in a number of counties, and also to keep a man in tbe field looking after tres passers, securing by this lease funds from many tracts which, have been used for years without any revenue to the state, in which the new deputy has many times paid the additional cost to the state. A still greater appropriation is asked of the com ing legislature to further carry on this work. Attention is further called to tho fact that tfee stato owns a number of large tracts of land which it is hard to lease on account of lack of water, and especial at tention is called to a tract of 58,720 acres in Fall River County, for which an appro priation is asked to sink an artesian well, taking tho position that the Tental would soon pay any such expense and bring the state a profit from property which is now bringing nothing. Out of 238,1C3 acres of stato lands sold only 400 acres have come back to the state by the failure of the purchaser to make the required payment's. Under the provisions of tho act allowing the sale of dead and down timber on state lands, such timber has been disposed of to tho amount of $1,404.50, most of this being in Lawrence County.

Deadwood has a number of government institutions, such as the United States assay office, United States court and governmentoffices and postoffice, for which the government pays over $5,000 rent per year. Tho club will mako a strong effort to get an experimental station for the testing of ores. The bill has been re ported upon favorably by the committee on mines and mining. At present there is no place convenient to tho prospectors where analysis can be made on new finds of mineral. In Cause of Learning. At a meeting of tho state board of regents it was decided to ask for the following ap propriations for the institutions of educa tion in the state: For the state university at Vermillion, $38,000 for maintenance and $25,000 to $50,000 for a new science hall: agricultural college, $40,000 for mainte nance Madison normal, $20,000 for main tenance Springfield normal, $10,000 for maintenance Spearfish normal, $10,000 for maintenance. The faculty of the state school of mines will ask for an appropria tion for a new building and about $15,000 for maintenance. This school has out grown the buildings now used and it is ab solutely necessary that a new building be provided by the state. Shooting of Daly. What will undoubtedly be a case ol murder occurred at the Ranche, a resort about two miles up the river from Pierre. Don Daly, the victim, a hack driver, had taken a load of passengers up, and in an altercation was shot by Tom Condon, bet ter known as "Irish Tommy." Three shots were fired, one going through the head, one through the abdomen ah3 the other shattering the arm of Daly. He will probably die. Condon came down town and was arrested &»>d gives as an excuse that Daly called him a vile name, which he could not stand. Frozen to Death. Charles Mott was discovered in a remote part of Mitchell early the other morning nearly frozen to death. His feet, hands, face, ears and a portion of his legs wore frozen. He had been drinking heavily the night before, and wandered away from the house where he had been staying. His absence was discovered and parties hunted nearly all night for him. There was little hope that he would recover, and he died two days after his discovery. But little is known of his antecedents, and he was taken care of by the county. Lost His Left Hand." While engaged in relieving Bert Shep ard, the regular feeder of a corn stiredder in Madison, Ed Bowell had his left hand taken off just below the elbow joint. More than an hour elapsed before the wound could be dressod. Bowell displayed re markable nerve, bearing the intense pain wiihout a murmur or a change of coun tenance. Cuts Jurymen's Pay. The ruling of Judge Smith of Yankton County that jurymen in attendance at court were entitled to pay for the time actually employed in considering cases has created a protest among the juror.s and promises to make it difti. ult to secure jurymen ex cept by force in future. Young Carpenter's Fatal l'all. Otto MalmKren, the 19-year-old sou ol Jo.m Malinirren, a Sioux Falls carpenter, was fatally injured by falling from a senf foH wnile at work sh ngling a building. He fell a considerable distance and struck the frozen ground i-qua ely on his head. Fire Protection Provided. The authorities of Woonsocket have con uiled the laying of about two miles ot new water mains, at a cost of $6,500, and that to ^n now boasts of possessing the most effertive fire protection of any place of its size in the sta.e. ,• 7' "--V-.:

It had been planned to withhold the mes sage until Tuesday, so that both houses might adjourn immediately after assem bling on Monday as a mark of respect for the late Senators Davis and Gear, but this plan was altered after a confer ence between tho President and Senator* Fryo. The message was presented in the: usual manner and received by Senator Frye, as president pro tem. of the Sen ate, and Speaker Henderson. It was read in both houses. It was deemed best not to violate the old tradition of Congress regarding the presidential message and its presentation on the opening day of the session. No business was transacted beyond the reading of the President's message ow ing to the death of Representatives Daly of New Jersey and Huffecker of Dela ware, and Senators Davis and Gear, which occurred during the recess. The leaders of the House aro prepar ing to press with great vigor tho impor tant business of the session. Already considerable preliminary committee work has been done on the important meas ures, and the House found work cut out for it as soon as it assembled. In the Senate after tho reading of the President's message the formal announce ment of tho death during the recess of Senators Davis and Gear brought the sitting to a close. Senator Allison made the announcement in the case of his late colleague, Senator Gear. These an nouncements were preceded by the cere mony of swearing in the new members, who this year are Mr. Dollivcr. who has been appointed to succeed Senator Gear,' and Mr. Dillingham, who takes the place! formerly occupied by Senator Ross of Vermont, and the appointment of the usual committees to wait upon the Presi dent and the House of Representatives.' The opening of this session of Con gress, which will end with the first term of Mr. McKinley, has much about it to suggest the actual beginning of tho sec ond term without waiting for the inau guration on March 4. The first Presi dent directly to succeed himself since Grant in 1872, Mr. McKinley and his party associates intend to take tho ver dict at the polls last November as an in dorsement aud a mandate, and they are preparing to obey the "mandate" at home and abroad. McKinley's second term to all intents and purposes has begun. The expenses of the government, which were §360,754,159 in 1897, the last year before the war, had leaped to $487,713, 791 in 1900. Total revenues, which in 1897 were $347,721,705, have sprung under increas ed customs receipts and a war tax still in force to $507,240,851. The army in 1897, which consisted of 25,000 men, has grown to 103,000. In this the expenses have swollen from $23, 275,402 to $130,000,000, the amount of the estimate for next year. The navy has more than doubled in size its c»st has advanced from $30,500,000 to $87,000, 000. These aro only a few of the things to excite remark as Congress reassembles. The plans that are going forward fur ther to qualify the United States for holding the place it has tMcen am^ng ihe, great world-powers challenge the imag ination. The whole membership of Con gress from Senator Frye and Senator Hanna down to the youngest members of the Senate and all the Representatives from Mr. Payne of New York down to Bhort-term members are excited over a ship-subsidy bill. The great project of cutting a canal through the Central American isthmus has received a powerful impetus by ex pansion. The latest estimates of the Nic aragua canal are that it will cost $175. 1)00,000. Congress is expected to take the step, in passing the Spooner bill, that will com mit the United States to the government of the Philippines by something other than the war power under which the President is now acting, and the govern ment must meet the proposition of for tifying our colonial outposts in the Phil ippines, in the Ladrones, at Guam, in Hawaii and in Porto Rico.
