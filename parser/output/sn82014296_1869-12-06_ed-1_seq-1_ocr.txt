The re port ot the Secretary of War is pub lished to-day. The Secretary indorses a recommendation of Gen. Sherman, that legislation be had enacting the rules and articles of war adopted by the JJoard convened in conformity with the act of Congress of July 23, 8bb, and approving tho new regula- ions compiled in June, 1868. The Secretary continues, still referring to Gen. Sherman's report, that after the consolidation, -made in accordance with tbe act of March a, lbfaU, there remained in -November 1,309 uc at tached officers.' All of these Lave been assigned to duty, excepting 150. who are awaiting orders. It seems equitable and just, should a reduction be made, that the officers awaiting orders by their own request and preferring that to activo duty, should have less claim for retention than those who 'applied for, assign ment. - Of thia elat-s there are 130 oflioers. ' Same' of them, however, had special reasons for asking to be placed on the awaiting orders list which the 1epartment recognized. and which should be regarded. It is certainly fair that the consequences of a reduction ot omoers should fall proportionately on cavalry, artillery and infantry, and should Congress act in the matter, it is proper that this congregation should not be overlooked in relereuce to the question of reduc tion. I concur with tue report in recommending that authority be given to relieve a greater number of officers for this cause than is now alleged by law- seven per cent, of the officers of the whole army. Tho present maxi mum of the whole army is 52,234 en listed-men. Relying on two-thirds for actual service, the number of men is 34,822. 13y the plan of organiza tion submitted in the report, thero would be 42,650 men. Two-thirds tor actual service would be 29,750 men, be low which it would not be prudent to go, as the cecessitics of the country and the great extent of territory to be proteoted will require every man of that number. 1 recommend that the staff corps be retained at the standard fixed by Aot of J uly, lbbb, and that the clause prohibiting appointments and promotions be repeated, in order that vacancies may bo filled, aswas the practice prior to the passage of the Act ot March, loby. Although the army may be smaller than hereto fore, experience has shown that these officers are as necessary for a smaller as for a larger force. He endorses the recommendation of the Adjutant General of the army for the repeal of so much ot section six, of the Act of March dJ, Ibb'J, as prohibits further appointments or promotions, leaving the organization ot the Adjutant General's Depart ment as it was fixed by section ten of then Act of July. 1866. An increase to the number of Inspector Generals is recommended. The expenses of the Quartermas ter's Department during the fiscal year ending June 13, 18d9, were $21. 968.484 J8, a reduction of 14,5UO,000 below those of the preceding fiscal year. In February, 1869. the number of civilians hired by this department. exceeded 10 000, which has since been reduced to 4 500. Of the Q jartermaater General, the report states that the clerical force in this office has been reduced so low by late legislation as to seriously retard public business, and to provide tor settlement ot accounts some increase in the force is necessary. A building capable of accommodating all Bu reaus of the War Department, fire proof and secure, is much needed. The railway companies to whom the military material of the Quartermas ter's Department was sold, on credit, at the end of the war, incurred at a debt originally of $7,591,406 interest. bave inc?eased this amount to $9,000,- 000. about one-halt of which has been paid, but some railways being in default, and showicg no disposi tion to meet their obligations, suit has been lately ordered to be brought against them. There have been paid for water transr-ortation during the year $1,424, 222 92, and fer rail -transportation $2.2o3 304 30. Uy an arraccement be tween the Departments of War and the Interior, euppliea for the Indian service are now transported by the Quartermaster Department on routes in the Indian lerntory, the actual cost under the contracts being re funded to the War Department out of an appropriation ot $-2,000,000 tor the pacification ot the Indians, granted April 1U, loo'J. Although the amount or equipage and clothing oa . hand at the end ot the war bas been reduced by sales and issues, there still remains a stock "valued at over $12,000,000. The general depots hare been reduced to tour, and at only two ot them is there any large collection of material viz: Schuvlkill Arsenal, on tho Delaware, and at Jeffersonville on the Ohio. This latter is being drawn on constantly, but it e till con tains over fourteen million dollars worth of war material. The followin will be submitted separately for the consideration ot Coogres, as pre -cr Ir xt.t c-4t; t ir-e-ccer river and harbors, $7,961,900. -Total, $12,158 300. As to the f ortifications, I urge the appropriations asked for the forts near larger cities named in the report of the General of the Array, to wit: Portland, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and San Francisco. New Yobk, Dec. 4. Alex. Mo Douald, President of the Miners As sociation of Great Britain, who is upon a tour in this country observing the labor element, addressed the Wf rkiogmen's Union lat irghr, in regard to Chinese on the Pacific Slope.

The annual report of the Comptroller of Currency shows that 1,620 banks are in active operation, and that their condition is moregratiiying than formerly. I he opportunity afforded speculators to manipulate the money market is al most entirely done away with, and banks have a more complete control of their affairs. Tbe Comptroller recommends the passage of an act requiring all banks that go into liqui dation to deposit legal tender notes tor tho outstanding circulation, and take up 'their bond3 deposited with the Treasurer of the United States as security for such circulation within sixty days from tho date of a vote of the stockholders to wind up. lie also recommends that all taxes on banks be made returnable and pay able to the Treasurer of the Uaited States, including the special tax and dividend tax now payable to the District Collectors: that the compen sation ot Bank Examiners be in creased and provision be made for its assessment upon the banks examined. and an increase to fair compensation of persons employed under him in the Currency Bureau. Tne recommendation looking to the establishment of a central redeeming agency in New York, in the last an nual report, is renewed, lhe Comp troller says the legal prohibition to banks to have deposits is not suffi ciently explicit or positive to prevent it, and hints at legislation to that end. The Comptroller argues in favor of a national banking system as a cause of ease in the money market and lower rates of interest than would other wise be obtained. He thinks the Gov ernment circulation, which is not convertible, and therefore not elasiie, should be withdrawn and substituted by national bank notes, which are nominally redeemable, and aro cer tainly amenablo to the laws of trade. jSo check or limitation should be imposed on the latter other than the law of supply and demand. A se'f adjusting currency is the only one that is adapted to the exigencies of trade and to the wants of the country, and it is a vital question at this time whether this result can be reached before the return of specie payments. If possible at all, it is only through the agency of National Banks.. The machinery of the Government is not adapted to such ends, and further, if possible, it is so only upon the adop tion of a policy which will lead gradu ally, but surely, to th resumption of specie payments. It must be a grad ual development ot a process which shall absorb legal tenders and put in their place a papar currency which shall at all times, and under all circumstances, be exchangeable for coin, either of paper legal tenders or of gold. A paper currency which gradually increase, while tho tenders, for its redemption, gradnally decrease . in such as a" healthy demand for banking facilities may determine, while free banking may thus be established with safety, anterior to specie payments, conditioned only on the withdrawal and cancellation of a legal tender dollar for every dollar of bank currency issued. Free banking upon a specie basis may.also be per mitted with equal 6afety and without delay. With details properly adjusted, banks may be established, with au thority to issue and put in circulation gold notes, limiting the amount only to the ability of the banks to comply with the necessary conditions and redeem their issues by the estab lishment of banks on a specie basis. The resumption of specie payments is only anticipated, and familiarity with gold values will do much to re lieve the subject of the mystery with which it is associated in the minds of many looking forward to the day when uniform values will again pre vail. It may bo that by. wise legislation now, a banking gj-stem caa la estab lished truly national ia its character and scone, which will furnish any lurtner reauctiouor the army. He says the entire army ia oa du'y, and he bas constant calls fcr more troops, which cannot be granted. Ho calls the President's earnest attention to this matter, that Congress may be appealed to not to diminish the mili tary establishment, because ot the great extent' of country and the unsettled character of a -large ex tent measured North, South, West and East by thousands -of. miles. The acta ot the Indians who ia habit this region, and the 'growing necessities of affording greater pro tection to the roads that traverse this region, and itiinicg and agricultural interests therein; wherein a naticn at large is at peace a state of quoai war continues to exist over one half its extent, and troops therein are exposed to labors, murders, fights, and dan gers that amount to war; withdrawing or largely diminishing troops in Texas, the Indian country,. Ari zonia, New Mexico, Montana, Ida ho, or; Alaska, as well as in some ' parts of tbe - Southern States, would, he believes, result in a condition of things amounting to an archy. He refers to the labors and exposures, of officers and men, and hopes that they will receive the as surances to which they are fairly en titled, that their labors are appreci ated. The officers have been required to perform the duties of Indian Agents, Governors, Sheriffs, &c, for eign, fo their military training, and have done this duty without a mar tnur, and with marked intelligence. N'tyer, he says, has he known army of ficer so poor, but they hope by the appreciation of currency their com pensatiin will soon become more sat isfactory. Any diminution of their pay would result in the loes of every good officer,-to the extreme damage of the army itself. . General Sherman advises tbe adoption, ly Congress of tbe new army regulation as prepared by a special board ot officers. In re ferring to-' army commissions, he sai l there are 509 unattached officers, of whom 156 aB awaiting orders. The number of retired officers is 177. He urges that cavalry and artillery regi ments be officered alike in regimental and company organization, and asks for an extra lieutenant for cavalry companies. 'He urges that it is unjust that the reduction of the army should fall exclusively upon the infantry arm of tbe service, and reoommends that after.Congress has enacted the laws necessary, the Prcsidenr assemble a board ot disinterested General offi cers, to whom shall be committed the whole matter of reduction and reor ganization. . ' Gen. Sherman comments upon what he calls the absurdity of the staff of the army making their reports to tbe Secretary of War. If this is con tinued, he says, we have, the absur dity of the General commanding the army with his chief staff officers re porting to somebody else. He hopes for legislation that will allow officers cf the army to call upon the General for troops instead, ot tho Presidcat." He advocates an increase, of ray for the soldiers, and recommends that tbe forts covering the cities of Portland, Boston, New. York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco be completed as sooa as possible.

During this period the amount gained on spirits is- $9,586,522; the amount gained in stamps, 603 335; amount gained on Sales, $1,555,101. : The greatest loss from aoy ono ' source of taxation for this period was on in comes, which amounts to $3,717,499. In special taxes, not included under spirits, tobacco, etc., tho loss was $1,435,619. It is worthy of special notice that in reeard to the receipts, from tobacco since July 1st, 1869, and hereafter, referred to as being largely increased, the loss of revenue cn this article tor the preceding six "months amounted to $63 232, and it should be borne in mind in considering this loss that the present system of collecting tax on tobacco had not gone info full opera tion prior to January 1st, 1869. The receipts for the last six months oi the fiscal years 1803-'69, arc com pared. A comparative statement is submitted showing the total receipts from the same sources for the last nix months of tho fiscal years 1863-'69, from J anuary to J uoe, 1S69, inclusive, $90,512,760; from January to Jane, 1863, inclusive, $64,439,918.

Total gain, not including the receipts from those districts, $22,318, 863. If the receipts frora tho unre ported districts equal the above, the estimated total gain will be $23,831, 863, or 29$ ' per cent. Duiing this STiod the gain on spirits wai $11, 31,151; on tobacco, $6,603,530; on sales. $1,101,601; on incomes, $2,772,911; on stamps, $704,800; lrom banks and bankers, $3,027, 433. The gain on , ;rits during this nil months of comparison in not sp large, by nearly 6,0;0,000,a3 it was in bonded warehouses, Oo the 30th of August, 1863. when the new law went into effect, were all, by the' operation of the law. to be with drawn from bond and tax to be paid Erior fo July 1, 1869. It is a tact, owever, that the giin on tobacco for this period of comparison exceeds that for the six months ending June 30, 1809, by $2,000,000, showing a steady and continuous increase of revenue from this source tho gains on stamps incomes and sales correspond very Dearly with the gins on these ar ticles for the six months of compari son, ending Juno 30, 1869.' It is to be remembered, in referring to the foregoing comparative tablea, that they do not profess to give the gross receipts of revenue for the periods and comparison that do the receipts from the samo general sources merely. The reason is that alterations in the law changed tho subjects of taxation during the periods of comparison, and thence a statement of gross receipts would not exhibit the relative and economical increase and decrease of the revenue referring to thegaios on spirits and tobacco fur thee periods. It seems proper to say there is every cause for congratu lation that the law of July 20, 1804, taxing these articles was enacted. The following statement of receipts from tbe several general sources of revenue for tbe first quarter , of the present and last fiscal years includes the returns of twenty out of twenty six districts, not given in the table immediately preceding, and received since the ' preparation of that table. The receipts of the following districts only are therefore not included in tbe reoeipts for the year 1870: Third Mississippi and Ninth Kentucky,. for the month of July; Third Mississippi for August; Eleventh New York, Sixth Tennessee and Fourtth Texas, for September: . , .
