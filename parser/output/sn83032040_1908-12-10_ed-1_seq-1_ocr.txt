THE CAMERON COUNTY PRESS. ESTABLISHED BY C. R. GOULD, MARCH, 1866. VOL. AzZ OUR HOLIDAY EDITION. More Elaborate Than Ever. The very gratifying demand of our bufines* Arms for space in the PRKSS this Xrnas Tide has started this year in full force, our merchants having | eagerly solicited space. In order to j supply the demands of our patrons we i shall increase our space to meet all. j Those desiring increased advertise- j ments will confer a favor by calling at i once, in order that they may be served, j These great papers are not cheaply j gotten up sheets, simply for the adver- j tisements but are profusely illustrated with the best stories, appropriate Christmas and New Year's pages and all that money can purchase. Our great Serial Story, commencing this week, entitled "Minkie," superbly il lustrated, is especially adapted for the holiday season. It is a great story apd while it cost us a snug amount we feel that our patrons are entitled to the best. While it is hard work and a heavy expense we feel richly repaid for our efforts by the many expressions of pleasure from our friends and very oft en receive flattering notices from those who are not our friends, who admire a good thing when they see it. The fol lowing very flattering notice appeared in the Western Publisher, of Chicago, 111., last January, which we publish at this time in order that our patrons may see how others see us in distant cities : "H 11. Mullin, publisher of the Em porium Press, certainly did himself proud on his holiday edition, which was a wonder for so small a town. It contained four parts of eight pages each, thirty-two pages in all, printed on book paper. The edition was excel lent in every way and the surprise is how he managed to do all of the extra work in so short a time. We trust the undertaking showed up well on the profit side of the ledger." Come along friends, with your copy for advertisements. We bave plenty of type, all the latest faces, the largest line of suitable cuts, borders ; good, faithful workmen and up-to-date art ists. Be prompt, please and we will try to please you. "They Say." That phrase has blasted more char acter and wrecked more homes than any other in the language. Call a halt on the lecherous peddler who comes at you with his wares—"They Say." Fire point blank at his cowardly heart— "Who Says?" That hits the spot you cannot afford to miss The person who circulates a scandal or peddles truth (one is just as good as the other) is a vampire. He sucks the life-blood. No combination of words in the language has caused more trouble, pain or sor row. Shadowy it hits in the dark. It is annouymous. It has no personality. It cannot suffer any reaction. It is wholly irresponsible JThe phrase ought to be put under the ban. It ia this way: You speak tc some one of a mutual acquaintance. There is a shrug of the shoulders, or a lifting of the eyebrows. Then a lowering of the voice, with the preface—"They Say." Even when the gossip fails to give his authority ho has put an evil idea in your mind re specting the person he speaks of. You cannot rid yourself of the suggestion. The impression stays. The suspicion lurks. A great wrong is dene. "They say." The ears that are eager for that always have a mouth to pass it onto other eager ears. The assassinaaion of the character has begun. What "They Say," may sometimes be a true mes sage? Will it make the old world ihe better or worse for the telling ? It is very plain that much suffering and sor row might be prevented by cutting those ugly words out of the vocabulary. If a man or woman won'tcutthem out, you cut them out And be quick ! Erie Times. John Minard Injured. John Minard, son of Moses Minard, who is employed as a teamster at the Emporium Powder works, met with an accident, this (Thursday) morning, which resulted in a broken leg. The accident was caused by one of the horses falling on the ice and pinning Mr. Minard under it. Dr. W. 11.

On Wednesday morning Inst, at seven o'clock, lie left 1 his home, taking the route along the pipe line, and arrived in Emporium at ! ten minutes of twelve. When he call- | | ed at the PitESB sanctum, to get a re ceipt for 1909 paper he was as fresh as ! a peach. He started back again in the j j afternoon, over the same route. When < ' we asked him why he did not drive ] i down to Sinnemahoning, having a I , good team, he only laughed and re- 112 i plied, "Oh ! that's nothing. When I < went to Idaho last year, to look at I some land I owned there, after riding i in the cars for live days and nights, I was tired of riding and started on foot for my destination, sixty miles; I made the walk in two days." Mr. Logue's walk and return was about 34 miles. Buffalo Manufacturers' Exhibi- ( tion, Dec. 14-19. » The Manufacturers' Club of Buffalo ' will hold an Industrial Exhibition in Convention Hall, that city, during the ' week beginning Dec. 19. The Exhibi- 1 tion will be opened on Monday eve- ' ning and continue daily up to and in- 1 cludiug Saturday night, 10 a. m. until 1 11 p. m. Under the above announcement 1 there is much to arouse the interest and invoke the co-operation of not only the 1 people of Buffalo but also those of the 1 adjacent country. It means that the Manufacturers' Club, composed of 1 more than 500 members and repre- ! senting every phase of industrial activi- ' ty, will place in Convention Hall a 1 mi nature of its many booming factor- j ies. Under one roof visitors will be able to see what Buffalo produces and how it is produced, for it is the aim of the majority of the exhibitors to install working exhibits so that visitors can j see the entire process of manufacture i 1 from the raw material to the finished product. Few persons realize the extent and variety of Buffalo's manufactories. ' Not even the members of the General 1 Committee of 30 of the Manufacturers* ' Club in charge of the exhibition real ized the full scope of industrial activi ty covered by the many busy plants until they began to compile the first list of the local factories ever attempt ed. But you will begin to appreciate it when you inspect the wonderful Ex hibition in Convention Hall Dec. 14-19. It wiil be a splendid, educative and in teresting sight to see the products and processes that employs myriads of worltingmen and render the great Elec tric city prosperous. Nothing like it has been attempted in Buffalo since the Pan-American Exposition. Don't fail to see the Exhibition. Let the children gee and learn how things are made.

PRESS NOTICES. "The pictures are well arranged and are the most interesting of their kind ever shown in this city. All stages of art are represented, beginning with Egyptian architecture and coming down to modern art. The pictures are all the most careful and faithful repro ductions. The architectural subjects are reproduced directly from the origi nals, and the reproductions of the paintings are from the original canvas ses."—Boston Sunday Globe. "There is something for every taste and no one will be dissappointed."— Columbus Citizen "Those who visited the gallery last evening were struck with the beauty and artistic merit of the scene present ed. Expressions of admiration were heard on all sides, and all departed with a high sense of edification and pleasure which could only have been imparted to them by the purest merit in what they had seen. All the pictures are reproduced di I rectly from originals by the most ! scientific and modern methods of re- | production. They are all illustrative of objects of world-wide interest and of great edu cational value, and especially suitable for schoolroom decoration." —Provi- dence Sunday Telegram.

Very successful Mission services con ducted at Emmanuel Episcopal Church during the past week, (commencing Nov. 29th and closing last Monday morning). Rev. Mr. Robertson, the Rector, was very fortunate in securing the services of Rev. R. S. Radcliffe, of Ridgway, Pa., who is Rector of Grace Episcopal Church. Rev. Mr. Radcliffe was for several yearß Arch Deacon of Central Pennsylvania and very many years devoted almost his entire time to mission work in the far west, amongst the cow boys, miners and frontiers men. His eloquence and forcible man ner of speaking touched a popular chord in Emporium, the church being well filled every evening, as well as several times daily. His eloquent dis courses attracted all classes, creeds and color. Last Sunday evening being Mr. Radcliffe's last address the church was filled to its capacity—every denomina tion being largely in attendance. The week was one of good cheer to every one that attended and resulted in much good to all our religious denominations and should be the means of quickening the communicants of Emmanuel. During the meetings the large sur plice choir, with Mrs. W. H. Howard organist and Mr. W. H. Howard leader, rendered very delightful music, while the solos by Miss Grace Lloyd and Messrs. Sterner, Ellis and Leutze were highly appreciated. Rev. J. M. Robertson, who so care fully planned thij soul-inspiring treat for his parishoriers as well as our townspeople generally, may well feel amply repaid for the hard work inci dent t> the Mission services. This able divine who does things in his quiet, systematic manner, is highly respected by all denominations. Returned From Bermuda. The Misses Lena and Christy Mac- Donald, accompanied by Mrs. Wm. Mac Donald, returned home last Thurs day afternoon after a most delightful trip to the Bermuda Islands as guests of the Gazette and Bulletin, of Wil liamsport. Everything, as planned by the enter tainers, parsed away in one continuous round of pleasure, and all went well until after aboard ship in the New York harbor, they were delayed on ac. count of fog and there witnessed the sinking of a ship upon which, accord ing to report, six lives were lost. They arrived at the Islands on Satur day, Nov. 28th, and found the "good old summer time" awaiting them, which was more than welcome after leaving "King Winter" in Cameron County. After "doing the island" until Mon day Nov. 30th, the party again set sail for home and with the exception of a I little sea-sickness all went well until | they were safely landed in New York | City, on Wednesday morning at 9:30. The ladies spent a short time in Lock Haven on the return trip with Mrs. Mac Donald. Everything passed in perfect har mony and all speak very highly of the of the managers of the Gazette and Bul letin as entertainers, as everything j was the best that could be procured. Taken as a whole, the trip was a | most enjoyable affair and will long be j remembered by those who attended. Agreeable Callers. Mrs. and Mrs. Andrew Ingersoll, of More Hill, accompanied by Mrs. Addi son Gross, of town, were very pleasant and agreeable PRESS office callers on Tuesday and looked over our busy plant, studying the many mysteries of ; the art preservative.
