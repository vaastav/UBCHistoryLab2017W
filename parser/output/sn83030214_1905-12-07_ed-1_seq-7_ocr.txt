From The New-York Mail. As a State paper it Is a graphic, highly informing and singular appealing implication of the doctrine of "the sauare deal." Mr. Roosevelt, at least, as th« message again reveals him. la n standing refu tation of tho familiar charge that the American political genius is able to provide for the correction of an evil, but not for its prevention. There Is foresight as well as opportunism In his statecraft. 

PATRIOTIC. From The New-York Sun. It might have been shorter, but it could not have been more painstaking in exposition, more char acteristic in phraseology or mote patriotic, both in Intent and in tone. " DIRECT AND FORCEFUL. From The Newark News. The document is marked by directness and fores, with sufficient of that urn en and philosophic sense- with which our President strengthens his utterances and vindicates hi* title as political thinker. If there is but little that is novel or illuminating in his interpretation <.f salient needs", it is because his convictions have been so thor oughly embodied by himself and his accredited mouthpieces hitherto that it leaves no room for such treatment. Up does, however, what is need ful, offers a vigorous summary and a convincing rationale. <• ( • 

MIGHTILY UKB ROOSEVELT. From The Hartford Courant. President. Roosevelt's message is probably the longest yet written by any President. It Is, we venture, to say. altogether unlike the message of any of his predecessors, and mightily like Theodore Roosevelt. There is not a line of tabulated statis tical information: all the; deadwood of depart mental repetition is cut out. and the whole paper bristles with virile ideas, presented with the au thor's characteristic vigor of statement. It ■would be difficult to find a bettor Illustration of the splendid sort of citizenship which Roosevelt rep resents than this revelation lie makes of himself. HIS 

INTENSE 7.8A1>. From The Boston Advertiser. If anybody anywhere needed proof of the intense zeal of President Roosevelt toward reform of va ried kinds, that proof would be found in the message. No matter is too small to catch the Presidents attention and to draw out bis urgent recommendation for changed methods. No affair is so big that ho is afraid to handle it. 

CONSPICUOUSLY CONSERVATIVE. From The Providence Journal. This present comprehensive presentation of his views to Congress and the country, on practically ail the topics that could fittingly be brought within the official field of vision of a wideawake Chief Magistrate, is' conspicuously marked by a con servatism of statement, a judicial breadth of out look, a cautiousness of suggestion and a prudence of recommendation that make it seem dull by con trast with what we have iearned to expect from Mr Roosevelt. This, however, casts no necessary discredit upon him. That ther* is almost no new idea In the message is a natural consequence of the frequency and freedom with which he has pub licly discussed the questions of national interest all through the last year. *AS TO ITS 

LENGTH. From The Rochester Post-Express. Those who are inclined to criticise the length of the document must remember that Presidents' messages have not grown In proportion to the growth of the country. ONK FIGHT AT A TIME. From The Baltimore Kews. Mr Roosevelt is going to make no tight on the tariff This will doubtless excite a good deal of sarcastic criticism In some quarters, but we have never been able to pee upon what principle a i resi dent was to be expected to fight two fights at once, when one is quite big enough to engage all the energies of the strongest ami most resolute of men. THE 

MORAL INTERESTS. From Th° Buffalo Commercial. One of the secrets of the President's success as .1 leader of men is his Intense interest in the causes he espouses, hacked by an insistent temper And the causes that interest him mosl arc moral ones. The tone that chiefly characterizes this state paper Is thnt of tiv teacher and preacher of civic nght eousness. HIS 

COMMANDING POSITION From The Philadelphia Press. Neither the national legislature nor the nation , an forget that he occupies an international position held by no President in our day and by but two lti our history. He commands the confidence and support of his lellow countrymen at home and he enioys th» rrspect and admiration of the world abroad." Nothing that he says on any subject— end few are omitted from his encyclopaedic message put has a. weight and authority with the vast mass of the ljitifl not to Iw neglected and tv be reckoned with by all who challenge- h!s pol Si IME 

CONTRASTS. From The Springfield Republican. The contrasts with the conventional Presidential message are many and sharp. «Jo back to thoso messages nnd note the heavy dignit;- of literary style. Mr. Roosevelt cannot be so tied down. Note the mass of figures with which a Republican Presi dent would .set forth th* fatness of mnterial pros perity, and with which a Democratic President would' demonstrate the need of economy a'i.l fiscal reform. Mr. Roosevelt has no use for figures, and hardly one will be found In this record breaking long message. Individual character, honesty, jus tice civic courage and square dealing— what are flg ures of pounds and bushels and dollars as the measure nn<l assurance of prosperity compared with qualities such as those? Yep. there are many contrasts, and some of them at least are of the klnci to make us thankful for Roosevelt. FOR A 

BUST SESSION. From The Philadelphia Inquirer. The President has cenninly mapped out plenty of work for Congress, and hus given many hints ;\% to how it should be done. AS TO RAILWAY RATES From The Boston Transcript. Briefly. h« defines his proposal as not giving the Interstate < Commerce Commission power to initiate, or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the railroads, upon complaint and after investigation. This purpose Is not essentially different from that which inspired his recommendation of last year, but he advances his ideas now much more boldly and more clearly than he did then. 

FRENCH COMMENT ON MESSAGE. The "Temps" Expresses Surprise at Refer ence to the Monroe Doctrine. Paris, Dec. -The "Temps," In a leading article this evening discussing President Roosevelt's mes sage to Congress, says: The Monroe Doctrine is no longer confined to forbidding Europe to conquer or annex South American territory, but is also extended against the simpl° seizure of custom houses, which is tlw sole m»ans of effective reprisal against delinquent Southern republics. President Roosevelt did ;iot present this objection three years ago against the triple action of Germany, Great Britain and Italy against Venezuela. Why has he chosen the mo ment when France may be obliged to adopt meas ures of the same kind against Venezuela? The "Journal de? Debats" also comments on the extension of the Monroe Doctrine.

NEW- YORK DAILY TKTBUNE. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 7, 1005. SEPARATION VOTED. French Senate Passes Bill Dividing Church and State. Parip. D-c. 6.— The Senate to-day, after a long debmo. adopted the hill for the separation of church and state by a vote of ISI to 102. Tlie vote was announced amid enthusiastic. scenes and cries of "Loner live the republic!" and "Lrfjng: livo liberty!" This Is the final parliamentary stage of the bill, which will be promulgated in "The Official Journal" to-morrow, when it will become Im mediately effective. The Council of Stato will devote three months to the framing of the ad ministrative details. The action of the Vatican regarding the law has not yet been definitely announced. The French clergy, while opposing the measure, ap pear to be disposed to conform to the new sys tem. The public worship budget of I'.XtOt will be reduced from $3,400,000 to nearly $6,800,000 consequent on the gradual diminution of the salaries p.iid by the state to the clergy. The fundamental principles of the bill insure entire liberty of conscience respecting religion, with restrictions concerning the exercise or re ligion which are intended to preserve public order. In the future the state will b» entirely free from connection with all religious sects. FUNERAL OF LOUIS VICTOR WINTER. The. funeral of Louis Victor Winter occurred yes terday afternoon at No. 17 Sd-ave., New-Brighton. Staten Island, the residence of his father. William Winter, of The Tribune. Only a few persona were present. The remains had been cremated. The ashes were buried in the Silver Mount Cemetery, Staten Island, beside the grave of Mr. Winter's second son, Arthur. Professor Albert H. Smyth, conducting the funeral services, spoke as follows: The body of Louis Victor Winter, who died in Southern California last February, was cremated at Los Angeles, and his ashes.- brought home for burial.— are contained in this casket, which now we place in the grave. He died in his thirty-second year, after a long illness and much suffering, en dured with fortitude and patience. He. was not known to many persons, for his disposition was exceptionally reticent, and, for the most part, lie dwelt alone; but he was deeply loved by those thai knew him. and he is deeply mourned. It was nat ural that he should be loved, for his mind was noble, his character wag manly, his temperament was sweet, and his manners wore gentle. He wore with modesty the honors of scholarship: he used with grace a line literary talent: he acted with perfect Integrity in every relation of life: and he maintained a Steadfast spirit In adversity and sor row. His courage was magnificent and his sim plicity whs beautiful. His early death blighted much hope and extinguished much promise. Cut Is t : i* branch that mipht have grown full straight. An.l bum*d is Apollo's laurel bough. Standing beside this grave, let us take courage, remembering his example. He is at rest. Our duties vet bind us to this world. The monition of death is always the same— fidelity and constancy in doing right, and readiness for the inevitable, end. Let. us also trust the intuitions of the soul, the analogies of nature, and the promises of religion — looking forward to that immortality of the spiritual life In which "there shall he no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither any more pain."

Thos- who fancy that the decision handed down ■i i Albany on Tuesday in the appealed case of a speculator against the proprietors of the Knickerbocker Theatre is going to have any visible effect on the speculator nuisance in this city will probably rind themselves mistaken. What the de cision does Is to set forth in unmistakable terms the right of the theatre to refuse tickets at the door whicii have been purchased of speculators. But that this will mean any general refusing of ■uch tickets st the doors in future nia> he doubted. When a theatr>- sets out to refuse such tickets— really sets out to -and does not merely stick tip a board on the sidewalk threatening to -there Ifl al ways trouble. The theatre has to employ watchers on the sidewalk and extra men have to be at the door. There is sure every night to be some Fort of a fight— art least a verbal fight— either between the speculators and th* theatre people or bet worn pur 'ha sera to whom admission has been denied and th managers who find a considerable expense and a great deal of trouble, and it is quit« as annoying to patrons as the mere presence, un moiested, of thf speculators outside. Th" public, so th.- managers say. rlo not take sufficient Inter est in the cause to earn to witness battles while they are entering (he house. One of tlv shrewdest and oldest managers in New-York, chaiics Burnham, said last nieht: "To flslit the speculators means to lose trade. Wo don't like them any better than anybody els». but even .hough this decision (rives us the right to refuse the seats they sHi. it won't mean that we will refuse any more than in the past, for every il efforts have he- n made to refuse such tickets the public has complained of th 9 rows In the lobby and about the door. It has hurt the bus- Inesa of the theatre. The speculators are still li censed !>y the city— they still have a right to s"-ll tickets o'ltside. The only way to stop them Is to take away their licenses. And until that is done they will continue. That is the real root of the matter, and if anybody really wajits to see the speculators abolished he must work down at the city Hall. 1 ' There has bpon some debate regarding the bear- Ing of this decision on the Metcalf case, and the managers who are opposed to "Life's " critic see in it much that is favorable to their contention that they had a right to shut out the critic. The de cision affirms the right of the theatre to rim its business as it sees fit. they say. On the other hand, the decision specificially treats only of those tickets which were sold first at the box office and then resold in a place not sanctioned by the man agers. Mr. Metcalf bought his tickets directly of the hex offices. Furthermore, he is charging con spiracy against a group of managers, and. of course, this decision has nothing to do with a con spiracy case. G. F. BAEk STOPS PASSES.
