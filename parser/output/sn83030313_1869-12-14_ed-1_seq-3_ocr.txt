WASHINGTON . A Test Vote on Removing tlic Capitol. Change in the List of Circuit Judge Appointments. Proposed Reorganization of tlie Georgia Legislature. A Warning to Disi^BadPemale Clerks in the Treas^^Bptmcnt. THE GOLD CORNEB INVESTIGATION WASHINGTON, Deo. 13, 1809. Tha fl?uU4<'?tu NafMtallou. If Secretary Pish don't consukr It incompatible with tb? public Interest, we are likely soon to know the whole ?tory about Cuba, Spain and our negotia tions through Sickles. Fernando Wood introduced ? resolution to-day asking lor all this, which was ?Baatmoasly agreed to. M?natur Carbetl'n Fiidttn Bill* The provisions of senator Oorbett'a self-funding bill is to fund one thousand million of the maturing live-twenty bonds into a bond running thirty-live years, principal and interest payable la coin, and not taxable In any lorm, principal or Interest, the bonds for the first three years to bear six per ?ont Interest per annum; for tbe next six years, five per cent per annum; lor the following six years, Hour and one-half per cent per annum, and for tbe following twenty years four per cent per annum. Ths* interest for the first fifteen years will thereby average five per cent per annum, or lor the whole time of thirty-Ave years it would average 4.43 per cent per annum. It la contended by Senator Corbett that the bill offers an inducement to those holding five-twenty bonds to accept this bond In exchange for those they now hold. It would give the bondholders the same rate of interest as they now get for the next three years free from tax, and a fair rate for the following twelve years, and by the expiration or that time the bond would find a place in our trust and savings institutions and in ' foreign markets, where four per cent, free ffom all tax; would be considered a good Interest. This one thousand millions being fnnded into such a bond for thirty-five years, the balance of live-twenty and other bonds could be paid or funded into a bond bearing a lower rate of interest long before the thirty-five years' bond should mature. This bond has the advantage over any other bond of funding the entire amount at each period named Into a lower rate of interest without any cost or agi tation of tbe q uestion. Taxtnc tbe IntorrM on the Bonds. Mr. Butler, of Massachusetts, offered a resolution la the House Instructing the Committee on Ways and Means to brintr in a bill forthwith to impose the Inoome tax of five per cent on the interest on United States bonds. The House refused to second the previous question and the resolution went Over un der the rule. The Investigation Into the Gold Corner. Oengressman John Pox, of New York city, got after the gold gambierd again to-day, but bis efforts were hampered by the injudicious phraseology of tae resolution which besought to. have adopted. Mr. Pax no doubt hau buncombe In his eye when he penned that part of his resolution instructing a special committee to inquire as to tbe alleged con nection of Grant and Boutwell with |hc September speculations. Be knew as well as any one that aelthei of those distinguished gentlemen had any connection whatever with the Flsk conspiracy, but It was his cue to profess otherwise. He knew also very well that he conld not get a special committee ap pointed to make the Investigation, but as his only, or at least chicf, object was to put Fox prominently before the Mew York constituents of Fox, no cared not particularly whetbet he suoceeded in having a Is resolution adopted or tabled. Of course the Bouse refused promptly to sanction even the faintest shadow of suspicion against the charac ter of Grant or Boutwell and squelched Mr. Fox's appeal for a special Investigation. But subsequently, oorlng to-day's session, Mr. Scheuck, seeing that to deny all and every speclcs of investigation ?light look a Utile suspicious, moved to infer the matter to the Banking and Currency committee, which was agreea to. Scnenck's reso lution differed from Fox's In that It left out all ailn aion to tbe President or Secretary of tbe Treasury, though it gave full power to send for persons and papers and to examine- whether any officers of the government were implicated. Fox proiesses to have valuable information which he can fUrnlsh the oommutce and which will astonish some people. Vull lux. Appointment*. The President sent tbe following nominations to tbe Senate to-flay:? A. jv. Swain. to be Postmaster at Bellows Fall*, Vt; K. B. Pcnuiman at lioneBiiaie, Pa.; Burns C. Wood at Canton, Mass.; William H. Gilbert at chlco pee Falls, Mann.; William c. Bivins at Uo&heu, Intl., and K. K. Brush at Klkhart, 16d.

Swaine, of the United States Arm;, unasslgned, to be Judge Advocate, with the rank or Major. Nominations (TltMrawn by tbe President. The. following nominations, heretofore sent to the Senate, were to-day withdrawn by the President:? Daniel D. Snydor. to be Assessor or Internal Revenue for tbe Fourth district of ueorgia; Henry L. Jones, Receiver of Public Moneys at New Or leans; James R. Allaben, Assessor or Internal Uevenne ror the Second district or New York. Tbe Doubtful Circuit Judge*. The charges against Mr. Peareo, the nominee tor the Maryland circuit Judgeship, are said to be or the moat pnerile character, and squelched long ago by proper investigation. Among the names withdrawn to-day is that of Mr. Yeaman, the nominee for the Kentucky dlstriet. It la now believed that Mr. McKennan's name win also be withdrawn. Sdlfsnlss sf Judae Wrier. Associate Justice Crier wrote his letter of resig nation of hla place on the Supreme Conrt bench on Saturday, but it has not yet been placed in the hands at tbe President. He proposes it to take effect on the first of February, as during the Intermediate time he wishea to take part In the opinions conoern ing which he has been In consultation with his .brother judges. The roMtitntlaaallt y af Henotisf tbe Capital. Some time ago I explained that the anti-capital movers intended early in the second session of tbe forty-Ant Congress to make an effort to test toe Heme of tbe House of Representatives on the ques tion of the unconstitutionality of sundering this district, or of taking from Jt the scat of government. 1 stated that the election of Mackenzie as memncr or Congress from Alexandria waa to be made the point or attack lit this way. Over twenty years ago Alexandria was retroceded to Virmnia by Congress, although the constitu tional power to do so at the t{me waa Snvaly doubled. Since then the question has often been discussed, and very recently, when the project of removing the Capital to a position neaicr to the geographical centre of the Union was talked or, particular attention was directed to tho whole subject, the result of which is that the doubt as to Alexandria'* retrocession being constitutional has bccome still more confirmed. The argument from which Is that if Congress could not part wiih a portion of the District selected for the capital or tho country still leas can it part with tbe enure District by trans ferring tbe government scat irom Washington to some locality away ont West. To bring this question fquarelj ixtarv Congress the novel expedient waa Oil apra at naming the admission of Lewis Mackenzie, ?M rwtattr eleetad Repreaenlatjve from the Alex andra dialrtct of Virginia, oo the ground thai he (Vaokroato) really tu not ehoeen from a locality from which a constitutional represen tatlve could be sent u Congress. Papers taking thla view of the com were flscod before the Election Committee, and to day 0?teral Paine, of Wlaconaln, chairman of that committee, moved to have the cjnstitutional ques tion 4f retrocession referred to the Judiciary Committee for an opinion. This gave rise to a regu lar little tempest. The capital movers saw the drift or it right away and, headed by Logan, opposed openlig the question anew, contending that It bad teen passed upon twenty years ago, i and ?ver slnoe then antll Mackenzie's time quietly acquiesced^ In. The end of the discus sion vas , that Paine sustained a defeat, but wnether tuls betokens unexpected strength or not In the Western movement to carry off the capital, buildings and all, to the Mississippi, It is not easy to decide. It Is certain that some of the mem bers wto voted against Paine did so, not because they favor changing the capital but because they believe MackenUe Is entitled to his seat during Buch time as Alexandria may remain a part of Virginia. States which Have Ratified the Fifteenth Amendment. The President to-day sent a message to the House In response to a resolution asking what States have ratified the proposed fifteenth amendment to the < constitution ol the United States. He enclosed a 1 letter to him from the secretary of State giving the following named States aa having ratified it:?Mis souri, Kansas, North Carolina, West Virginia, Massa chusetts, Wisconsin, Maine, Louisiana, Mlcnlgan, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Connecti cut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana New York, New Hampshire, Nevada, Vermont and Virginia. Mis souri anA Kansas are generally defective in their returns. In the former the second section of the amendment la omitted, and In the latter the phrase ology of the second section IB changed. A Discourse from Mr. Drake. Mr. Drake, one of the Senators Irom Missouri, has several tunes of late attracted attention through the absurditj of some of his public aots. To day the worthy geutlcman delivered a lengthy, aston ishing and Incomprehensible harangue upon his bill to destioy the independence of a co-ordlnjte branch of the government, the Supreme Court of the United States. It is understood that the gentleman was engaged all summer preparing this windy discourse, and the Imprtssltn leit alter tie got throngn was that lie was not only oat of his element and considerably beyond his dejitl, but that he might have been more profitably employed. The honorable Senator had erected on his desk a sort of forum of dry documents, and from the summit of this pil? of legislative lore be read his piece. During tills Infliction two Senators made repeated efforts to give him their attention, but failed. The rest of the Senators took such a favorable oppor tunity to frank documents, write letters and read newspapers, For five minutes Senator Conkling was the most attentive listener in the Chamber, his seat being immediately in front of the speaker. He was evidently disturbed with so mnch noise in his rear. After Drake had taken his seat senator Edmunds, of Vermont, rose and in about five minutes completely demolished Drake and his whole argument, or rather his statements. Drake stood the scorching manfully, vigorously masticating and expectoratl ng. S cnator Saalsbury, ol Delaware, who has not been heard iroui for somu time, next took a turn and |threw In an additional peppering. Drake appeared to be satisfied and allowed bis bill to be laid temporarily aside without an effort. The Mexican Claim* Gammlanlon. Mr. AsUton, counsel of the United States, to-day presented a written statement to the Mexican Com* mission la regard to the rules prescribed by the Commissioners, suggesting among other things, that express authority be given to American Consuls in Mexico to take depositions in American claims (or use before the commission, and that copies of all papers on file In American consulates, duly certified by the Consuls, be admissible in evidence before the Commission. Mr. Cashing, In Dehalf of Mexico, asked leave to reply to this communication, which was granted by the Commission. A Prapoand Cnnlnlc at Pesth, Hungary. The attention el the government has recently been directed to the importance or establishing a United States consulate at Pesth, the capital ol Hungary. Since the elevation of tne Hungarians to a voice in the affairs of the Austro-Uungurian empire it is urged Pesth has assumed a new Importance, commercial as well as political, and nearly every European nation, includiug France, England and Prussia have established full consulates there. Native Hungarians residing In this country have petitioned Congress for the establishment 01 a con sulate at Pesth, chiefly as a recognition of the politi cal advancement of Hungary, but also on account of the commercial relations between that country and the United States. Many Hungarians who during the revolution of 1848 fled to this country and became adopted citizens have since the union of Hungary and Austria returned to their native land and are settled in Pesth. Some of them carry on an extensive business with the United States, especially In exporting wines and Importing In return agricultural implement*. Tho Hungarian government has signified its desire tn an unofficial way that tbe United States, which sym pathized so strongly with tbe Hungarians In their trouble years ago, should be* represented at their seat of government now that they have attained the much desired constitutional government controlled by independent ministers. Tne Senate Committee on Foreign Relations will take tbe matter under con sideration, and U is probable a consulate at I'eath will be created during the present session. As might be expected, Secretary Fish is indifferent about tbe matter, but Senators Sumner, Scbnrz and other members of the Committee on Foreign Relations will taice tbe matter la band without regard to the Department of State. Ben Batter** Little Game. What Is the matter with Ben Butler f They say that Ben is going Into the purchase of large and small arms to a huge extent as tbo agent of a New York Arm, and that he has recently applied to an officer or tho War Department to seil him a tremen dous assortment of warlike implements. ??What do yon want of ail these t" aaid the omcer to Ken. ?'That's my business.'' qnoth Benjamin. "I will have to refer the matter to Secretary Bel knap," said the officer. Belknap was consulted and responded "I don't care a damn what Butler wants them for ir be only pays for them. If he wants them lor im proper purposes after buying them from us, it will bo Secretary Fish's business, not mine." Ben will get the arms very likely, bnt what ho wants them for is a puzzle. It Is generally supposed to be for Cuba. Qulen tabe? PlibarMuenU of the ladinn Fund. AD official statement has been prepared showing the disbursements made from the appropriation of $2,000,ooo placed at tho disposal of tbe President by act of Congress to enable him to maintain peace among and with the various tribes and bands of Indians, nAmeiy:?Supplies of beef and transporta tion to varlons points of Dacotah, New Mexico and Montana Territories and the central superintendence, for till expenses incident to tbe service of the Whetstone, Cheyenne, Grand Hiver and Crow Creek agencies in Dacotah, and for. the purchase of all goods and supplies which have been purchased for the Sioux, $110,404; the amount placed at the dis posal urf uovernor Campbell for general incidental expenses of tbo aervlce in Wyoming Territory, by direction of the President, $10, ooo; in paying the indebtedness created by General Kearney in circus ot the ' sna of $486,7*4, appro priated t>{ act of Congress in laca, to pay the excess incurred by lilm for the benelit or the Indiana wltn whom we have treaties, or made by the Indian Commission. $04,070; tout amount expended. $8M.374; balance remaining on hand, about $1,043,820.

Tbe residue a?y $U3,0M wiu be required for the service at the different accuses m Dakota, including tb? pay of employes, completion of buildings, breaking land, planting in the spring, Ac., and forth* general inci dental expenaee of agents at these places; ais<> to meet any emergencies that mar arise at other agencies. KmhuImiIm of the Georgia Legislature. The Senate Judiciary Committee have agreed npon a bill providing for the reassembling of the Georgia Legislature, with the exclusion of the mem bers ineligible under the fourteenth amendment, and the re Heating of the hitherto excluded eolored memoers. The Legislature Is to be provisional until the United States Senators and Representailvea are admitted to Congress. The Disorderly Female Clerks la the Printing Baveaa. The expotf made in the Uxkald a abort time ago relative to a degrading search of the female employes In the Printing Bureau of the Treasury, and the lining of them seven dollars each m con sequence of the loss of some fractional cur rency, has led Superintendent Macaitee, or some one under him, to post up some very foolish orders and notices. One general order, for Instance, forbids the girls talking to outsiders about anything that occurs in the Bureau, and prohibit* I them irom giving information to the newspapers, or even bringing newspapers or needle work to the Bureau. Another notice, vtrtntim et liUn aiun, is as i follows:? ?OTIf!K. Whistling, loud taxing, profane or Improper language, smoking or lounging iu halls or passages will not be permitted. .Superintendaijih ami tneir assistants will see that this order is strictly obeyed, and report any violation thereof. By order of the chief, G. B. 

MACARTEB. This notice, be it remarked, la posted in a room where there are only two or three men and some fifty young and unsophisticated females. The iorce, therefore, of vetoing whistling, smoking or profane language in that room can be taken in at a glance. It is surmised that the publication of the contraband Information contained in this paragraph may lead to the expulsion of all female employes from the Printing Bureau. Great country this, truly. Personal. senator Featon arrived here this morning and i was warmly welcomed by his friends. A portion of I the Brooklyn delegation, consisting of Captain 0. W. Goddard, Colonel Julian Allen, Hon. William W. Goodrich, and lion. Edwin a. Stud well, who are here in regard to the case of Mr. Allaben, and also Deputy Collector Williams, of New York breakfasted with the Senator at the?ArllngtoD. Colonel J. W. Jones ana David Williams, also met the delegation. The delegation returned to New York this evening. It is understood that the with drawal of Mr. Allaben's name as assessor of one of the Brooklyn districts was owing to some charges which it is intended fully to investigate. Mr, Uamlin, of Maine, has taken the seat on the lloor of the Senate formerly occupied by his col league, the late Senator Fessenden. Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas, has taken the seat rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator Grimes. General W. X. Clark, one of the elected candidates for Congress in Texas, Is expected here to-morrow. General J. K. 0. Beirne, Disbursing Clerk of the new Post Office, New York city, Is in this city on important business connected with that establish ment. ?.Harder of a He venae Officer In Florida. An official letter to Commissioner Delano from Tallahassee, El a., dated the 8th inst., says:?'A rumor is circulating that Assistant Assessor Tome, of Marrlana, Jackson county, was murdered on the night of Dember 4, while on his way Irom Marrlana to Apalachlcoia." Post Office Inspector for Kan*tu>. Mr. A. Low, of Doniphan. Kansas, was to day ap pointed Post Office inspector for the district of Kan sas and Nebraska. The Merchant*' National llnnk of Wash ington. In the United States Supreme Oonrt to-day the case of Joseph C. Kennedy, receiver of the Merchants' National Bank of Washington, vs. Patrick Gibson al.. came up on appeal from the Circuit Court foi the District of Maryland. Kennedy, a citizen of New York, as receiver of the Washington bank, find ing that the assets and credits or tho bank were insufficient to pay its liabilities, brought this action to enforce the personal liability of the stock holders under the acts of February 6, 1863, and July 3,1804. The amounts sought to be obtained were equal to the whole arnouut of the capital stock of the bank?$200,000. The defendants demurred to the bill, submitting that the case stated did not en title the receiver to the relief sought and that the names of the creditors of the bank not being set forth the court was without jurisdiction. It was also Insls ed that all the stockholders of tne bank, whether residents of Maryland and within the jurisdiction of the court or not, could be jollied iu the action; and further, that an the amount claimed whs equal to the whole or tho capital Btock of the bank tho case watt pot within equity jurisdiction. The point was also made that the case should have been brought by the District Attorney of the district where brought instead of the counsel representing It. The court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed tne bill, and the cause thence came here where that judgment was affirmed, Mr. Justice Swayne delivering the opinion of the court. It was held that the snlt was prpperly brought in the name of the receiver, and that he was under the control and direction or the Comptroller of the Cur rency. It was the duty of the Comptroller to decide upon tho necessity gnd propriety ol the bringers of tne suits, and his decitiou was conclusive upon the receiver; but as there was no avermeut of the deci sion or direction of the Comptroller in the declara tlon, and as the demurrer was general, it should oc sustained.

Mr. Trumbull, from tho Committee on the Judi ciary, reported with an amendment the mil to re lieve meiiii>er.s of Congress from importunity and to preHervo the independence of the departments or the government. The bill as amended prohibits recommendations to office by members of Congress and appolutments in accordance therewith, under penally of a misdemeanor punishable by a line not exceeding one thousand djllais. The clause allow ing such recommendations lu response to written request irotn h-ads oi departments is stricken out. JURISDICTION OK T11K BUPHKMB COURT. On motion or Mr. Drake irep.) of Mo., the Senate took up the but ' further to dettue and regulate the jurisdiction and powers of the courts of the l ulled states." The bill prohibits any court created by an act of Congress, or judue thereof, from holding any act of Congress invalid tor uny supposed repugnancy be tween such act and the constitution or the Inited States or for any supposed want of authority in the oonstimtioti for the same; and also requires that the appellate jurisdiction ol the Supreme Court ol the luiied Slates shall not be construed to authorize that court in any case now pending, or hereafter brought before it. to affirm any judgment, order or decree of an inferior court which shall appear to have been based upon any such holding; nor shall auy justice or said Supreme Court in furtherance of the exerciBe of said appellate Jurisdiction make any order based upon any such holding by him or by the said Supreme Court. Mr. Drake addressed the Senate at length in sup port or tne bill. He said, in considering the subject the query had been suggested to his mind whether the constitution, while leaving in oue body of men the exclusive power to make laws for the nation, hail, at the same time, given to another body or men the power of annulling those laws. To answer thts affirmatively, as the Supreme Court, in effect, claimed it should be answered, presented so grave an iniputMlon upon the lc/al acuTucu and common sense or the fruuicrs of the constitution that he had been led to un examination of the whole subject. Ills final judgment was that the constitution did not contain a single word, which right fully considered, justified an affirmative answer. If the national,government was the only one known to us there would lie no difficulty in con sidering the question on purely national principles; but the difficulty arose trom the Influence or the example oi the State judiciaries in declaring uucou - stitutional the acts ol State legislatures. This ex ample had been copied by the lederal judiciary in pushing judgment upon acts of Congress, it seemed difficult or comprehension to some that that which mipht be proper in the decision of State courts as to the laws of tne States might not be proper when applied to the federal courts; but there was a wide dittcrence. That which .was known as judicial power at common law wheu the constitution was framed (1787) was the spine now as then, and was incapable of enlargement or almiuution by act or Congress or by auy paactice since then, however long continued. The constitution of many of the States being comparatively of recent date, the judicial power In any of them might be taken to include an that had beeu accorded to It prior to the adoption of the state constitution, l'rior to 17*7 the practice of passimt judgment upon tne con stitutionality of an act of Congress was unknown in the lederal courts. If this claim of the federal judiciary was established then a veto power more potent than that of the President?a power to veto not a bill, but a law?was created. This power would virtually far exceed mat of Congress in point of supremacy in the government, but its existence must be warranted by the constitution, and, if not granted there, its exercise can only be regarded as an usurpation which no sincerity of judicial con viction in its ravor could uphold, and wnich could derive no rigntlul loroe be cause or long continued silence on the part of consress. If the exercise of this power had been tolerated because of a misinter pretation of tue constitution or a want of consideration of the subject, and consequently had beeu exerelised lor year*, It was no less tue duly of Congress to apply the remedy than it would be If the assertion of the power had Just been broached lor the Urst time. Sixty-six years ago the Supreme Court of the United States, under head of Chief Jus tice Marshall, wuhout having heard any arguments on the question, asserted it right to hold an act of Congress unconstitutional, and rroui that day to tins had passed into a professional dogma mat such a right existed, which dogma had been accepted without Investigation or question. The legal fraternity had not qnestidned it, nor had it beeu questioned in the hah* ot Con 1 gress until the Speaker denied its truth in February, 'lhe error was one which urgently needed attention, because of late years the supreme Court had beeu beset by parties to declare null and void important acts or congress, among others those In which Con gress had exercised the power of declarihg a tax on cotton grown in this country, or taxing staie banks, or disposing of military lands and of declaring mili tary governments over snbjected rebels. If this claim of the judiciary was acceded to wiieM would it end? Kacu succqpsful effort to overthrow Con gressional action would lead to others, until the judiciary would loom up as the great central power of the government. It was the purpose ot the ulil to reach the root 01 this threatened evil, to place Con gress where the constitution placed tt, above and uut neiow the judiciary. It was not the object to lake from the court any constitutional right, for that was beyond the power or Congress; but to pre vent it from pausing the limits of its rightful autho rity under the constitution. It was not iutended to assail the court, but to shield the representatives of tue people in their legislation from unauthorized judicial interference. The power of Congress to press this bill was beyond dispute. It applied. DM, to courts created by acta of Congress, aud secondly, to the Supreme Court m the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. The only question was wtietner tt ought to be passed, and this brought up the ques tion of the right or the judiciary to declare an act of Congress void. If that right was gtven by tho con Htitutlon it could not be dlsturbed; but if nol posses sed under that instrument, It should not be exercised. The Spcakkk argued that the question wasone whicu closely touctie<l the national sovereignty. In a government like our own tho people could not wield tais sovereignty directly, but exercised it through delegated powers. Hence our three depart ments of government. Atuoug rhese itiree there mu-a in the nature of thing* be one superior in law and in fact to the other?one haviug power to give law to the other* and not accountable to them. Therefore we might characterize the Congress as the place wherein that arbitrating power, which in at republics inuat reside somewhere, is entrusted with limitations to be sure, but within the bouuds of that limitation a power as absolute as that of tho Mritish Parliament, u henjt'ongress. as the mouth piece of the sovereignty of tint American people enacts a law. Is their voice to bo silenced by a court winch was established br the sovereignty iiseur By reference to article a of the constitution of the United .Stales, it will be seen that there was no express au thorlty coulerred upon the judicial power to declare an act or Congress unconstitutional, but the right to arrest the legislative will was heid by the Supremo Court to tie conferred incidentally and bv implica tion in the original yrant of judlcia power, hj the term judicial power was meaut tnnt power at com mon law which was known at the time of the formation or the constitution. In 1787. when the constitution was formed, the people of tho 1'nlted N tales km w nothing of any right In the judiciary at common law to anuul any act of Congress, nor Was the exercise of any such power known in the Stato courts. Tne conception of any such right in tho federal Judiciary was subsequent to the formation oi the constitution, lno* uationai'lconatitmion. lu the judgment of the speaker, contained no word giving authority to the judiciary to declaro any act of emigre<h null or void tor any purpose; but if this claim ot the Judiciary was valid Uieu tho Judicial would virtually include the legislative power, for it waa aft unie.lt a legisla tive power to uumtUte a taw as to make it. Neces sarily the repealing power exclusively belonged to the cuacttug power, and no other than ltseii could effectively repeal its action, llut the recognition which this judicial claim had received rested upon the interpretation of its own power by the Judiciary, coupled with the noobjccttug silence of the legisla tive power. It was in lact. an assertion of suprem acy of that court over tliu national legislature. Va rious instances were cited njr tne speaker on which the Supreme Court had hold, ainoug other things, the right to declare unconstitutional an acr 01 Congress which the judges might de ducu argument i vely to bo unconstitutional. No power could bo derived br any department of the government, by reason of a supposed violation of the constitution by another department. This supposed violation afforded no premises from which to draw a conclusion for or against auf power In tno other which did uot previously exist, consequently the elaitu of the judicial power was alike untenable in this view, li mo kfiieuiioa of Coagrem ?u to be arraigned before the Supreme Court of nine judges, then, notwithstanding that an act might be passed try the two bouses, alter careful debate, and perhaps again pawed by a vote of two-thlrds over the President's veto, the law was to be rendered Inoperative and of no effect bj the simple judgment of live of the Judges of the Supreme court. Four might be one war and four the other., and the ninth mau. perhaps the weakest of them all, alts as an 1 ntnpfre over the sovereignty of tne nation. The J Judiciary once Ormlf established in thin power i might reason itself into declaring any act uncousu- j tutional. Hut it might be urge J (bat the Judicial 1 power was charged by the people with their protec ttoB from the unconstitutional acts of their own 1 lepregentatlves; but what name could and ought to be given to any direct palpable violation of the constitution by one Bworu to support and maintain ) ttr It could be called by no other name tlinn 1 "revolution." for its design and probable effect | would be an overthrow of the constitution. How ' could the Judiciary stay a revolution f The ! very ease with which the Judges might be j deposed shows that the constitution does not look to I the Judiciary aa its protecting power against arevo- i lutlonary outbreak in the halts of congress, ibe representatives of the people in Congress were the 1 Judges of the constitutionality of any measure pre sented for their ottlclai sanction. The passage ot a bill, therefore, was a solemn Judgment by a tribunal competent to decide that the legislation was consti tutional. This judgment was flnal, and from It thero was no appeal to any other authority tnau the people. It might be asaed, would the passage ol an act palpably repugnant to the constitution include such a judgement t The answer was mat it mani festly would not, for the reason that no such act could be passed without Congress knowing its unconsti tutionality and revolutionary character; therefore the intention of the body to subvert the constitution would be as ptalu as though the words were written in the act, "this ia an unconstitutional and revolu tionary act." Congress would not expect to be obeyed m an? such legislation. The speaker further 111 usi rated the propriety of entrusting to Congress authority to decide questions of constitutionality affecting the legislation of trie body, lis hold mat tiie title of the Judiciary to its assumed ancndaucy over the legislation of tne nation rested solely upon an implication ot power conferred, which the Ju diciary Itself had asserted but which had never been recognized by Congress. An act of Congress pal pably in violation of tne constitution would impart no Judgment of Congress upon its constitu tionality, bat Judgment of an opposite charac ter to be sustained only by a revolutionary lorce. It might be urged that to Klve Congress a right to Judge of the constitutionality oi its acts made it in effect omnipotent. But this objection had no lorce, inasmuch as it was based upon t'ie Hy pothesis that, a majority of Congress would be equally regardless of their oaths ol office, their fealty to the constitution and their duly to the peo ple. Congress was empowered to make lta judg ment effectual against that or the executive, and thu nation must submit until It changes that judg ment at the ballot box. And yet Lhe judiciary claimed the right to reverie that Judgment by the mere force ol its opinion. If there was to be om nipotence anywhere in the government it had better be in the representatives of the people than in the judges. Congress was vested with legislative sov ereignty of me nation; the judges were not. The principle that the power of the people Is to be periodicalljT returned to them was embodied In the legislative and executive departments, both of which were continually remlned of their accounta bility; but In the judiciary department the Judges were appointed aud held office for life, and conse quently there was not the same sense or accounta bility which existed in tne other departmcilQ. The argument that ir Congress could not be restrained by the judiciary, then private rights had no protec tion. was one to be used, 1/ anywhere, In the court*, but not in Congress. It assumed a violation of private rights by Congress?an assumption which should share the fate of all the other dis carded suppositions of Congressional wrong doings. 1'rlvate rights hail* over had as zealous advocates In the two houses of Congress as anywhere cise. qlBSTlON OK

SYMPATHY WITH CUbA.
