Mr. Roosevelt Abroad. Our South American friends continue their enthusiastic acclaim of Mr. Roose velt. Wherever he goes officialdom re ceives him with great ceremony, and whenever he speaks a great crowd listens. All the honors due to a man so many sided and so widely known for participa tion in big- affairs arc ungrudgingly paid. . Nothing of this would probably have heco lacking if the visitor had presented himself as a man who had had his fling in office, and was now. and to remain, in private life as an observer and a student of affairs. He would, even in that after noon aspect, have been an attragtive man in the eyes of his present hosts. Hut they see him In a different aspect. They do not regard him as on the re tired list, but as still eager for -action and likely to be placed in commission again. In an editorial welcoming Mr. Roose vi It to Argentina, and reciting his achieve ments and the things for which he now stands, the Prensa of Buenos Aires, the h ading newspaper of South America and a very influential journal, says: " If later in the varying course of po litieal. events in the United States, where bis.name has such great weight, he should a-ain b<* culled to rule over its destinies, we should have in him a decided and ?rithusiastio promoter of this policy of international solidarity, insisted upon by h'in with the fervor of his convictions w hich marks all his campaigns." We need not inspect this language too . cl-> el>. A President of the United States Is not "called to rule over the destinies" of the country. He has a good deal of power, and Mr. Roosevelt while in that office exercised all in reach. Likewise is Mi. Wilson giving us a new idea of leadership under the New Freedom. Still, a President does not "rule." There are checks on his authority. Mr. Roosevelt [?.it them, and in time Mr. Wilson will also. The l*rcnsa may be excused its ap praisement of Mr. Roosevelt's future, on two grounds. It is not a near neighbor, and It is just now under the spell of Mr. Roosevelt's presence. There are men at home here who think Mr. Roosevelt will fcgain be "called to rule over the des tinies" of the United States, and hope that If ho does return to the White House he will "rule" indeed. But the situation - ioes not warrant the calculation. Our southern neighbors, however, will not fail of appreciation for all the prog ress they have made, and all that lies Nearly before them, no matter who occu pies the White House. The country gen erally Is advised of their power and ieserts, rejoices in them, and favors pol cies toward them which will draw them, n trade as in sentiment and governmental deals, the nearer to us. Christmas Giving. . What is a "spug"? Is he or she neces -arily a "tightwad," grudging the giving >f any token of affection at Christmas, ime? Or is he merely one who believes hat Christmas giving is to be measured n terms of the spirit rather than the <*t? These questions call for no answer o those who have followed the develop lent of the "spug" movement, but there ?re many who do not understand it, who :i nk that these "spugs" are taking ad antage of the effort to check the giving >f useless presents to protect their own .o-kets. The true "spug" is animated by . high ideal of Christmas and its signifl ?:tnce and not by any nordld pecuniary notive. It is possible to maintain the istom of Christmas giving without mak :.g It ridiculous by wasting immense urns of money on mere trinkets that are ?f no earthly value or use, toys that are iestroyed in a few hours, trash of all sorts that glitters for a short time and riien finds its way to the waste pile. Tlie original name of this organization ? us the ' Society for the Prevention of 1 seless Giving." It has now been hanged, without disturbing the initials, to the "Society for the Promotion of Use ful Giving." The shops are full of useful titings. articles of wear and daily need, that make far better Christmas presents than most of the rubbish that at one time constitute, the bulk of holiday pres ents. A few years ago the habit of giv ing articles of luxury and show went to such an extreme that it was by many people regarded as an affront to receive a really useful thing at Christmas time. The giving of presents of the impractical sort is calculated to stimulate a spirit of greed and expectancy, far removed from the real Christmas Idea. To be a "spug" is actually to be an advocate of the best there is in the custom of Christmas liv ing, to encourage the exchange of pres ents at that time that does not impose a burden or a responsibility. Christinas giving should be spontaneous, inspired by love. The Influence of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Giving is calcu lated to check the commercialism that1 threatens to destroy the best aspects of the holiday season. I Chicago's mayor disapproves of dancing in restaurants He should remember that 4 tango costs less than an omelet. Time flies at a rate which causes sur prise at noting how soon it becomes too late to shop early Bosses. There is nothing persuasive in the ?torv that the President and Chairman Mci'ombs are planning a general raid on democratic bosses, and that Thomas Taggart and Roger Sullivan and others are soon to join Charles F. Murphy on the administration's black list. W hy should those men be bracketed with Mr. Murphy at the White House? Bosses they are, of course. But there are oosses and bosses, and one boss may differ from another bfess, not only in bossism. but in his recent record. Mr. Murphy's bossism is doubly ob jectionable. For added to the fact that lie Is a boss is the fact that at the Balti more convention last year he was an anti-Wilson boss. True, he turned in later and carried New York for the Balti more ticket, but nothing else remained for ?y.m to do. There was the ticket. and there his duty, and he merely did his duty. Mr. Taggart did not go to Baltimore a Wilson man. But that was because In diana had a candidate of her own for the presidential nomination, and he very properly stood by his own. But when the break came he supported Mr. Wilson, and managed to supply him with a run ning-mate. Moreover. Mr. Tagvart has just visited Washington, called at the White House, and expressed there and elsewhere the most cordial approval of the administration to date. Why black list Mr. Taggart? Mr. Sullivan 'at Baltimore- found the j right band wagon in the end, and upon j returning home' worked hard for the ! ticket. At present he is toying.with a | suggestion to run for the Senate. If he runs and is elected, will not the Wilson forces in tbat body be augmented by one? Sure! Then why blacklist Mr. Sullivan? Mr. Smith and Mr. Nugent in New Jer- 1 sey seem to need no further immediate attention at the President's hand- He has whipped them three times running in as many years, and that should suffice for the present. With the exception of Mr. Murphy, none of the big bosses fared badly at the recent elections. Mr. Taggart carried Indianapolis for his city ticket: the cry of Coxism did not defeat the republican ticket in Cincinnati, nor that of Pen ruseism the republican ticket in Phila delphia. As a matter of fact, there are open and closed seasons for hunting bosses, and, except in New York, this was a closed season. Next year, when a new Congress is to be elected, may be another, and 191G, when a President is to be elected, is certain to be another. Gunning for bosses at a time when they are neces sary in one's business is not regarded as wise sport. A South Carolina Campaign. Tn his campaign for the Senate Gov. Blease charges inefficiency on His oppo nent. Senator Smith, he says, has done nothing in office but draw his salary. How often that charge is made by men seeking office, and particularly office in this town! The stumps ring with it. Hear a candidate for a seat in the Senate or the House, with but little to base his campaign on: "My fellow-citizens. Col. X has done nothing in Washington. You seldom see his name in the dispatcher. You know w hat he promised and we ex pected when we sent him there. Great doings should follow. Have they? An swer the question yourselves. The colonel is a good fellow and all that, but lias succumbed to the local atmosphere. Loaf ing on the job is a Washington practice. Send me there, and I'll not only with stand the atmosphere, but do something worth while. I'll not disappoint you. Give me a trial." In this way Col. Z carries the elec tion. comes to Washington, and starts in to make things over. He chokes the hopper with bills. He takes the floor as often as he can beg in or slip In to a debate. He nags members of committees to which his bills have been referred for action on them. If he cannot do so other wise, he breaks into the newspapers by some particularly foolish or reckless as sertion or action". But what does he make by it all? Only himself ridiculous as an individual, and powerless as a legislator. He becomes a bore; and that in Congress means death. The member straining to reach and to hold the limelight rarely succeeds even In that small purpose. But if he achieves It he achieves no more, and that alone is not worth having. The man who comes to Congress with the idea that everything there is wrong, and with the broad and flamboyant pur pose to pick things to pieces and put them together after a fashion of his own, soon finds, if be is able to appraise mat ters intelligently, that he is not equal to the order; that it is much too large for him, or for any man; that to be useful he must be in a great measure conven tional, and work according to long es tablished and well established rules. Mere hurry and flurry and personal ad vertisement lead to nothing of value In Congress. If South Carolina wants Gov. Blease tamed; wants the fire extracted from his vocabulary and the starch from his-swag ger; wants to develop anything of value that may be in his composition, either the Senate or the House would serve her purpose. In neither chamber do wild men last long. They either drop out, or drop Into sane and safe courses and methods. Both chambers have records of that kind. Bed Cross Seals.. Do not fall to buy a supply of Red Cross seals at the first opportunity, or to use them conspicuously on all mall matter. It is not enough merely to buy these tokens of the valuable health charity work that is being conducted by the Red Cross, for a large part of their function is to proclaim broadcast the fact that efforts are being made to eradicate tuberculosis, and that every penny helps in the maintenance of camps and sanitaria for the overcoming of this scourge. The post office authorities do not per mit the putting of the Red Cross seal upon the face of an envelope, for It it. a confusion to postal clerks, and is furthermore by some postal users mis taken as a sufficient stamp for carriage. I The proper place for these tokens is on the back of the letter, serving as a true seal against Improper opening. It may also be put on the back of a pack age. though not In a way to prevent open ing for official examination. Washington should buy enough of these stamps to give It a high place'in the list of cities contributing to the Red Cross tuberculosis fund. It is the national headquarters, and it has al ways taken a keen Interest in Red Cross matters. If every letter that goes out of Washington between now and the first of January bears a Red Cross seal a fund will be raised sufficient to care for dependent tuberculous patients throughout this area Therefore, get the seals now and use them system | atically on all pieces of mail matter. The number of New York boys who start west to fight Indians is compensated for to some extent by the number of out of-town men who go to New York to flght Tammanjv. The price listB which followed the dissolution of the Standard OH trust might suggest the desirability of re quiring it to get together again. The fact that this country offers many opportunities to vote did not tempt Mrs. Pankhurst to consider the idea of becom ing a resident. Sidewalk Spitting. The chief of police has issued an order to the force directing a more rigid enforcement of the law against sidewalk spitting. This is a most com mendable reminder that a prohibition based upon the laws of health and de signed to prevent the spread of dis ease is being continually violated with impunity. Any rule of this kind is sup posed to be universally understood, but there is reason to believe that large numbers of people in this city are not aware of its existence and many who may know of it probably regard it as ia fad^nd unworthy of respect. The I only way to bring to the attention of (all the people the prohibition of side ? walk spitting is to enforce the law in !a few cases, with the fullest publicity. ?Just as in the case of street car spit ting, to which The 8tar called atten tion the other day, neglect of a rule ? of this character leada to its virtual | abrogation. The prohibition of sidewalk spitting (should be construed by the public as j simply a warning that the practice Is ? dangerous. There is no thought, in its promulgation, of imposing a needless ! restriction. The ipsplration of its is suance is* that of protecting the pub lic from disease,' and the man who vio lates the rule ip contributing not only to the danger to others, but by his example is inviting threats against his own health. Thus this is a matter of mutual self-interest, and hard though it will be to overcome the habit of promiscuous expectoration, continual I efforts should be made by the police j authorities to enforce the rule as a means of inculcating cleaner habits j and thereby raising the health stand- i ard of the city. In this work the police can be efficient by warning persons in a reasonable and kindly manner that they are violating a rule that la de signed for the prevention of disease spread. If after a few warnings of this character the rule is repeatedly violated prosecutions must follow. . A Philippine Inquiry. Before Congress acts with respect to Philippine independence, why not an in quiry as to what has been done In the ! Islands under American rule, what con ditions exist today, and what the story suggests in the matter of future policy? ! Hearings' Srotn sources with important information were granted on the tariff question, and they helped In the shaping of the Underwood law. Many features of the first draft for revision were rejected, and many obtained from practical busi ness quarters were adopted. The new law is much the better for what went into It as the result of Information sup plied by men of large business experi ence. The hearings granted bankers and cap italists have borne good fruit in the movement for currency reform. While the question is far from settled, and may not be settled for a month or two ( yet, it Is In far better shape than when the House acted. The Senate debate, which has Just opened, will proceed on! the basis of much Information and many suggestions supplied by those familiar with' the subject. Presently the trusts will be called to the bar, and we shall see them respond with views and suggestions which should be received and considered. Congress will legislate the better for knowing the trust point of view stated by the trusts themselves. Why not, then, a hearing as to the Philippines? Before changing procedure In the islands in any vital particulars, why not give those opposed to a change an opportunity to state their views at length and under cross-examination? The question may not grade with the tariff, the currency or the trusts in popular interest in this country, but it does not lack for Importance. A misstep now might produce unhappy consequences In both our domestic and our foreign af fairs. There are men capable of discussing this subject with Congress with profit to that body. Former President Taft is one. He had great success as governor gen eral of the Philippines. Former Gov. Gen. Forbes is another. He has Just re turned home, and Jias very definite opin ions about what should and should not be done in the islands for the good .of the natives. Dean C. Worcester Is an other such man. His experience as an official in the islands taught him much, and he is very positive in his convic tions about American duty there. What Congress wants is light, and all it can get. Let both sides be heard. lie deeming a campaign pledge, conceived In sentiment and urged in partisan heat and extravagance, is not to be weighed against the discharge of a duty imposed by the fortunes of war and interpreted by men who have facts before them. The question of mileage is not so im portant, after all. as that of collecting an income tax from congressional salaries. Huerta will never be a contestant for any peace prizes. Spelling reformers will never be able to unite on the question of whether "Xmas" is allowable. Rivers and harbors experts can outline enough work to keep CoL Goethals busy for a lifetime. ' I 1 11 A quiet divorce Is more to be desired than a quiet wedding, although some of the unhappily Wedded insist on the con trary view. Overworked members of Congress may yet be tempted to unionize.

WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING "In what line of work does a man run the greatest risk of losing his life?" The popular interest in Dangerous his question is in Occupations dlcated by the fre" p t quent inquiries which come into the offices of the chiefs of the United States bureau of the census, the bureau of mines, several bureaus of the new Department of Labor and other branches of the government requesting Information on the relative hazard of oc cupation as shown by the latest mortal ity statistics. The information usually furnished is compiled /rom the statistics of the bu reau of the census, and the tables show percentages of deaths from accidents which in many cases are truly startling. The statistics gathered by the bureau of the census indicates that in many lines of occupation there is an urgent need for rapid spread of the "safety first" move ment. Steam railroad employes stand at the head of the list in the percentage of deaths from accidents in the total num ber of deaths from all causes in the va rious occupations, according to the latest census figures. Of the total number of deaths among steam railroad employes, who are in active service, 53 4-10 per cent are due to accidents. This does not mean, of course, that more than half of the men who have been employed on railroads die from accidents. The figures merely apply to the number of deaths caused while the men are actively occu pied in the operation of steam railroads, and does not apply to deaths from va rious causes after the men h^ve left the roads or have been superannuated. Next to Bteam railroad employes the worst death hazard is found among min ers and quarrymen, and of the number of deaths among these men, while in active service, 38 8-10 per cent are caused by accidents. More men are killed on the street railways of the country than the average person would suspect, and of the total number of deaths from all causes among men operating transit sys tems of cities, 25 5-10 are due to acci dents. Electricians come next with an accident death list amounting to 23 5-10 per cent. Boatmen and sailors a'nd iron and steel workers are engaged in what most people think are two of the most dangerous oc cupations, yet the accident death list in these two groups 's very small in com parison, the percentage among boatmen and sailors being 17 9-10 of the total num ber of deaths from al' causes, and among iron and steel workers 16 2-10. Ot the number of men engaged as dray men and hackmen and teamsters who die each year, 13 7-10 per cent of the mortal ity is due to accidents. Engineers and firemen not engaged In steam railroad work lose by accident 11 5-10 per cent of the total number of men in this occupa tion who die each year from all causes. Tinplate and tinware workers come next with 10 4-10 per cent; laborers, 9 2-10 per cent, and watchmen, policemen and fire men, 01-10 per cent. Agricultural pur suits offer the lowest death hazard among the twelve occupations which are listed, and of the number of deaths from all causes among men who till the soil each year only 7 4-10 per cent are caused by accidents. * * * Members of Congress were startled somewhat this past week when they re ceived a report show Wasting of ing that in a single oil i field in Oklahoma $75, Hatural Gas. ^ worth of natUrai gas is wasted each day while the oper ators are obtaining an output of less than 20,000 barrels of oil, valued at ap proximately $20,000. This means a yearly waste of natural gas valued at approxi mately $25,000,000 in one oil producing section. This waste of $3.75 worth of nat ural resources for' every one dollar's worth taken from the ground did no! strike the congressmen who read the re port as good business practice, and it is probable that further petroleum and nat ural gas investigations by the bureau of mines will be authorized, with a view of encouraging the more economical devel opment and use of the oil fields of the entire country. Secretary Lane of the Department of the Interior, in illustrating the need for further natural gas and petroleum In vestigations, has called attention of con gressmen to the following recent report received by the bureau of mines regard ing the Cushing field of Oklahoma: "The maximum yield * of oil from the Cushing field for a long period has been considerably less than 20,000 barrels per day. The average value of oil at the highest market quotation probably lies below $20,000 per day. During this time there has been wasting from drilling wells not less than 100,000,000 cubic feet of gas, while the waste from flowing wells Is per haps in excess of 200,000,000 cubic feet, making a total dally waste of 300,000,000, which at the domestic rate of 25 cents per thousand, would be $75,000 per day in fuel or a matter of perhaps $20,000 a day to the oil producer. "It Is not only possible to conserve this gas but it also is possible In many cases to manage the wells so that they can furnish oil without allowing the gas to escape. The main purpose or the oil pro ducer Is to get the oil and let the gas escape. There are other fields in the United States where enormous daily waste of gas occurs." . Government mine experts have already shown the oil operators In a number of fields how they can obtain oil without wasting the natural gas, and It Is ex pected that Secretary Lane will recom mend the extension of these investiga tions In a line of practical conservation wherein many millions of dollars' worth of the purest fuel and lighting resource may be saved and made available for fu ture use. * * The co-operative laundry in farming communities, operated along much the same lines as the co-op Co-Operative erative creameries, is an W lr innovation which gov rarm woric. ernment agricultural ex perts believe will mark the passing of the family washtub and the emancipation of the farmer's wife from a large part of the drudgery which is sapping her strength and energy and hastening the movement of the younger generation to the cities. Two of the departments of the government?Agriculture and Interior are vying with each other In plans for : lightening the tasks of the farm woman. The reclamation service of the Interior Department and a number of the bu reaus of the Department of Agriculture have already begun to put practical sug gestions into effect. The washtub must go and -the co-oper ative laundry take its place. This is the idea upon which the reclamation service has just begun the encouragement of the labor-saving invention which is ex pected to go a long way toward relieving the farm home of one of its heaviest bur dens. The covernroent's men on the irri gation projects say that the washtub as an Instrument of torture, which has filled the days of the farmer's wife with de spair and her nights with troubled dreams, is doomed. The "back to the land" movement gets much of Its impe tus from the fact that better things now obtain in the farm home than ever before, but it is likely that no message more po tent for Joy and comfort has ever been borne to the rural regions than the offl cial promise of encouragement of the co operative laundry idea. The practicality of the idea has been demonstrated beyond a doubt in the lit tle town of Chatfleld, Minn., where the plan originated. A co-operative creamery on much the same lines as the creameries on a num ber of the government irrigation projects throughout thte west was in successful operation, and the superintendent divined the idea of utilizing the same power to run a washing machine. An old churn, operated by a belt from the shaft which runs the creamery machinery, did the trick. The more progressive men in the company quickly seized upon the idea of extending the work to include the laundry for the patrons of the plant, and up-to-date ma chinery was installed at a cost of about $4,500. The gross receipts for the first ten months were $4,800. The farmers bring their laundry when they come with the cream, and on their next trip to the creamery they carry home, ready for use the week's wash. ' The laundry bill is charged to the cream account and taken out of the cream check at the end of the month. Five cents per pound is charged for wash ing. All flat work is ironed In the mangle and no extra charge is made. The rough dry is ironed by hand, and is charged ac cording to the time it takes a girl to iron it. at 15 cents per hour. The Minnesota plant, at the end of the year, with 160 patrons, was able to pay back to each 10 per cent of the wash bill for the year, and the average cost per family was $4 01 per month, which included the laundering and ironing of their shirts and colJars While this laundry does not add to the farmers income as the creamery does, it f; ^directly, a productive enterprise, lifting the heavy burden from the farm ers' wives, saving them strength for other duties, and increasing the efficiency and comfort of the farm home many times more than enough to recompense for the outlay of $4.61 for eight days of back breaking work. Co-operative creameries have already oeen established on several of the govern ment irrigation projects and it is hoped that the time is not far distant when be. run ln connection with ,?f these plants. The same power which runs the machinery for the cream nnH fHn bVuti,li2ed for the laundry work, ana there is always an abundance of hot ater and steam. In many sections cheap p?weJ from the government plant it> available for such industries nnH'if ynans aKO the scythe, the cradle and the flail were relegated to the junk Today the farmer with gasoline or electric power to drive his machinery and perform the heavier tasks, with patent milkers, riding plows and other ^ F devices, has eliminated much wL.?? hack-breaking work on the farm. ?,?? farSler 8 wife invention has done ??l ? S.? one of her chief abomina :!, J ? JS ?**!! da.y' and th0 task of keep ing the family clothes clean undoubtedly has been the rock upon which more than one household has split. Summer and win -1*. VLe Monday session at the washtub and that of Tuesday at the ironing table hav.? taken their toll of her strength and health. The monotony of farm life its never-ending round of household duties and the lack of opportunity for mental or physical relaxation have all had their elect on the country woman, and through her have reached down to the children. It is believed that the conservation of the strength and health of the farm woman will do much toward checking the undesirable efflux of population from the country to the city, which is now gener ally recognized by farm economists as largely due to the conditions which ob tain In the farm home. ? * ? That the action of summer heat as a direct cause of infant mortality has been greatly underesti Summer Heat and mated in the last Infant Mortality ^ cnty-five years that activities in future baby-saving campaigns must be concentrated on better housing and prop er \ entilation. as well as on careful feed-' ing and handling of the infant, are the principal points brought out by Dr J W Sehereschewsky. surgeon of "the United States public health service, who has made a thorough-going study of the di rect relation of heat and infant mortal ity. The conclusions of Dr. Schereschew sky are based not only on the information gathered in the study which he has made in the United States, but also on the re ports of eminent foreign physicians who have carried on similar investigations. "Forty years ago,-' says Dr. Schere schewsky, "no doubt existed, in this coun try at least, as to the direct effect of heat in causing increased infant mortality in summer. The discoveries and develop ments In bacteriology and the study of In fectious diseases, however, gradually dis placed heat into the background as a di rect factor in the deaths of infants dur ing the summer time. Until a few years ago the general opinion has prevailed that while summer heat stood in casual relation to summer deaths, this relation was by no means immediate. Heat was regarded as an agent calling other dele terious influences into action." The public health expert points out that recent observations, however, particularly In Germany, have reopened the question and that the consensus of opinion among scientists in all countries now is that there is a most important relation between the rise of temperature in the summer ami the rise of rates in infant mortality. Stagnant air in poorly designed or poorly located houses is a direct cause of the increase of the number of deaths among infants in summer, according to the report, which cites the results of extensive investigations carried on in the countries of Kurope. Infant mortality rates rise or decrease as the conditions in individual homes and in a section of a city are unfavorable or favorable for the circulation of air. Statistics show that in very few cases do infants die of pre ventable summer diseases in a house which is exposed on all sides to the wind but that the death rate is high in those dwellings which because of their low lying situation, their location in the rear of other buildings or their shut-in style of architecture were denied the access of cooling breezes, or from the poor location of the windows that thorough ventilation was impossible. The report says that in some cities 80 per cent of the dwellings do not present conditions favorable to the eirculation of air in summer. "The means for remedying conditions are plain," continues Dr. Schereschewsky. "They consist, hand-in-hand, with an improvement in housing conditions and the development of residential suburbs in a greater emphasis upon the care of infants in their homes in the summer months. When housing conditions are bad they can be partly neutralized by the proper care of babies in summer Mothers must be informed of the fact that excessive heat is deleterious to in fants. and when hot weather is present special efforts must be made to prevent overheating and relative overfeeding of babies by the use of frequent tepid baths, light clothing, fresh air, increase in the amount of water given, lengthen ing of feeding periods and reduction in the amounts of food. The advantages of breast feeding are only emphasized by all which has been brought out in the in vestigation. Here nature automatically modifies the composition of the food in accordance with the heat in a way to which artificial feeding can never com pare." 

RAYMOND W. PULLMAN. THE SUFFRAGISTS. From the Newark Evening News. Suffragists should not he disturbed be cause President Wilson did not say any thing about the cause In his message. Si lence means consent, some fair optimists point out. From the Grmnd Rapids Press. Although Mr. Wilson did not mention suffrage in his message, this will not pre vent the suffragists from mentioning Mr. Wilson freely. From the Buffalo Commercial. Was It an oversight or Just a deliberate snub that President Wilson failed to in clude a paragraph on woman suffrage in his address to Congress?

FIFTY MRS AGO III THE STIR On the 2d of December, 1863, a cere mony took place in the city which served to distract attention somewhat Statue Of from th? war issues and at _ , the same time arouse the Freedom, patriotism of the people. This was the crowning of the statue of Freedom on the top of the Capitol dome. In The Star of that date is the follow ing description of the affair: ?Today, as the hour of noon approached, large crowds of persons wended their way toward the Capitoli anxious to get a suitable place whence to view the crowning of the statue of Freedom, which ceremony, it was announced, would take place at about that hour. The crowd which gathered numbered several thou sand, and we noticed that a large num ber of opera glasses were brought into play, while many of the windows of the dwellings around the square were filled with ladies, glasses in hand, viewing the motions of the workmen on the scaffold ing as they placed the head on the figure. About 11:30 a.m. the upper portion or the figure, which had been placed in a large box near the central entrance to the Capitol, was attached to the hoisting apparatus and was speedily raised to the roof of the building. Here it was at tached to a rope lading from the beam which lias been used in raising the iron pieces of the dome, and was soon at the summit of the dome and at the foot of the tholuB. Here the hoisting apparatus on the platform on top of the huge cage of scaffold work was brought into play, four men working the crank soon hav ing the head of the statue at the proper height and it was swung to its place, where it was secured and the work was completed. Immediately that the head was adjusted the hoisting of a flag sig naled to all below that tho statue was complete, and cheer after cheer filled the air from the throats of the large con course present. The prisoners in the old Capitol and Carroll prisons also gave sev eral cheers, but some think that they were intended to be, as Artemus styles it, 'sarcastuc.' At the same time a battery of artillery from Camp Barry, stationed on the grounds east of the Capitol, fired a salute of thirty-five guns (one for each state), which was replied to by siml'ar salutes from the forts around the city." * * * After the battle of Lookout mountain It was appreciated by the north that the Union troops had In that Thrilling engagement accomplished ? . . a most stupendous feat bpeCt&Cle. in the successful Storming of Missionary Ridge. As the details of this battle were received the daring as sault upon what was supposed to be an impregnable position thrilled the north ern states as had few other happenings In r.lic war. In The Star of December 2. 1863. is the following extract from the report to the War Department of a Union officer: "The storming of the ridge by our troops was one of the greatest miracles in mili tary history. No man who climbs the ascent by any of the roads that wind along its front can believe that 18,000 men were moved upon iti broken and crum bling face, unless It was his fortune to witness the deed. It seems as awful as a visible interposition of God. Neither Gen. Grant nor Thomas intended it. Their or ders were to carry the rifle pits along the base of the ridge and cut off their occu pants, but when this was accomplished the unaccountable spirit of the troops bore them bodily ui? the impracticable steeps, over the bristling rifle pits on the crest and the thirty cannon enfilading every gully. The order to storm appears to have been given simultaneously by Gens. Sheridan and Wood because the men were not to be held back, hopeless as the attempt appeared to military pru dence* besides, the generals caught the Inspiration of the men and were ready themselves to undertake impossibilities." * ? * The presence of a fleet of Russian warships In American waters at this time fifty years ago was regarded Russian as a. material factor in main _ , taining the international bal rleet. ance tb prevent the recogni tion of the Confederancy by European powers. This fleet came to Washington, its arrival being thus described in The Star of December 3, 1863: "Four vessels of the Russian fleet. Admiral Lisovski. yesterday afternoon arrived in the river and anchored be tween this city and Alexandria, off the Half-Way Tree. The vessels are fine, stanch-looking ones, the largest carry ing thirty gun3. two of sixteen guns each and the fourth a pivot gun. As they passed the guard boat Adolph Huga, Acting Master NIckerson. off Alexandria, they were saluted, each vessel returning the same, the crews of the vessels cheer ing the while. They will, it is thought, lie at their anchorage, it being deemed unadvlsable on account of the depth of water they draw and the crowded condi tion of the channel and along the river front and at the navy yard for any ex cepting the lightest, which draws seven teen and one-half feet, to come up farther. Salutes, we believe, are to be exchanged between the fleet and the navy yard this afternoon. It is possible that the smallest vessel, with the admiral and suite, who will be received with all the honors to which his * rank entitles him, may also come up this afternoon." ? * * The public was in a chronic state of discontent regarding the performances of the Army of Army of the Potomac the Potomac m j during the Sharply Censured. greater part of the civil war. There were intervals when it aroused national enthusiasm by brilliant performances, as at Gettysburg, but the long delays between actions and the occasional reverses suf fered caused a disposition continually to criticise Its commanders. In The Star of December 4, 1863, is the following: "It is by no means wonderful that the (New York and other papers loudly de plore the fiasco that has resulted in the return of the Army of the Potomac to their former quarters near the south bank of the Rappahannock, which so for cibly and painfully reminds the public of the similar fiasco in permitting Lee to escape at Williamsport; and again, in ordering a retreat at double-quick time out of Culpeper back to Manassas before the advance of Lee with scarcely more than a third as many men as Gen. Meade commanded. So long as our army in this quarter continues to be guided by its present councils in the field. It is now clear it will fail to command public con fidence, a requisite of success almost as necessary as that those councils should command the confidence of the army it self, which is now by no means the case, as was clearly demonstrated by the bit ter and outspoken scoffing with which the order for this last retrograde move ment was received by the pank and file. We apprehend that though the forw'ard movement amounted to but a reconnois ance in force its purpose was certainly to give Lee battle wherever found. We know further that the season for active operations under active commanders in this section has not closed. So, if Lee. relying upon a continuance of the chronic hesitancy that has afflicted the councils of Gen. Meade, ventures to reinforce Longstreet considerably from his own army, it Is to be presumed that the gov ernment will promptly seek to make him pay dearly for his temerity, as our Army of the Potomac Itself is as ready at this moment to move against him again as it was when undertaken to do so a few days since. It is not for us to venture to suggest the name of a commander to be relied on not to be afflicted with this disinclination to risk a collision with Lee's army, num >ering, as that does, scarcely more than a third or at most half as many men as our own. Nor can we with greater propriety suggest the names of other councilors for that gen eral, whoever he may be. In place of tnose who 'saw snakes' that did not ex ist at Williamsport and Culpeper and again probably at Mine run.'' THE 

CABINET CRISIS IN FRANCE. 9 The dispatches from Paris of the 2d instant . announced that the Barthou cabinet waa defeated. 21>0 to Ministry 2?. In the Chamber of depu _ ties on the question of BCfttCll. whether the new loan of (260.000,000 should be taxed or be im mune as the existing rentes. The Barthou cabinet was marked from birth, "cannot last long." It has lasted eight months and ten days, which is more than was'given It. It was born on thp 30th of March, and on June 20 the premier had occasion to say, referring to the anti-patriotism and insurrection of the C. G. T., or the general labor confederation, then questions of discussion: **A permanent plot against national security had been denounced since fifteen years. It was necessary now to choose between abdication and action, to act or to die." And It should be noted that this virile declaration was applaud ed and then indorsed by a vote in the ' chamber of 385 against 165. It should be remarked also that this j same chamber has voted the law of the three years' military service and the law of proportional representation, both of which have provoked much discussion. Nor is there a doubt in France or else where but that these laws are command ed by the necessities of the hour and by patriotism and sanity. Is France to be treated once more to the insane regime of Jaurez and Combes, who have in reality overthrown the cab inet? Under the rule the president of the republic should send for Ja.ures. Combes or Callaux and conttde to one or the other of these the formation of a new cabinet in place of the Barthou cabinet. But an exception may apply in the case of each of these, for they voted against the three years mili tary service, as well as the proportional representations which have recently been voted and passed despite the opposition of Juarez, Combes, Callaux and partisans, and each, therefore, is dis qualified. * * * The president will doubtless make haste slowly, and the senate, perhaps, may re verse the action of the Possible chamber and thus offer a parliamentary exit out of Solution, the Impasse. It was already apparent that a mys terious group was being secretly formed by M. Caillaux with the object of over turning the Barthou cabinet, and it was already known that the point of attack would be concentrated on the proposi tion to tax government rentes heretofore immune. Premier Barthou and M. Du mont, minister of finance, eloquently ap pealed to the chamber (on the 2d instant) to respect the traditional 'm munlty accorded rentes. Not to do so would deal a deadly blow to the financial prestige of France. As we have seen, the appeals were unheeded, and wnen the vote was announced and the government placed in a minority wild cheers went up from the coalition, which is now booked to become a new party. The gravity of the situation may not be ignored. The lirst result will be to postpone indefinitely the emission of the loan, and the military necessities must suffer, all of which is a menace to tW national credit. Perhaps this situation may provoke a toU"l*5 action, and the "upsetters in Pay ment, confronted by an aroused public sentiment, may be only too reconsider. In such case the Presi dent's task would be simplified b> re questing M. Barthou to reorganise his cabinet. The lesson might serve as a salutary one to the chambers and teach them the value of being more constant in their convictions. h? The government rentes, it should De said, have always been guaranteedI im munity from taxation. To undertake to change a traditional policy at such a moment above all would be considered by the public as an act of spoliation, and, more, an act of very bad^ even dangerous, policy. The. for the French rentes are legion, and for tha most part comprise the conservative masses, whether rich or poor, and the "upsetters" in the chambers cannot be numbered as holders to anygreatev tent A rapid decline of the rentes which Is liable to follow may not only provoke violent demonstrations, hut en danger the existence of the republic itself. * * The question is not new. Those who have Inspired the coup have doubtless for months studied in KT Thiers' silence the past. In 1833 M. Thiers defended in Position, parliament Immunity of French rentes from taxation. He said: "A law expressly prohibits a tax on rentes: but even if that law did not exist, do you think that you would gain anything by taxing the rentes? I will prove to you that you cannot gain. "What do you mean by taxing the rentes? It means the subtraction of a part. Well, tax the rentes a certain proportion and you will see the fall of the rentes in proportion to that sub tracted. If in according an interest or 5 per cent you retain one for the tax it is as if you gave only 4, and when you Wish to negotiate you only what you have paid; in P^c? ?f suinir at 100, you issue at *or ex~ ample. What you gain in one way you ^Aside flwn'thls natural result depicted by M. Thiers (which the coalition in the chamber has counted upon escaping public attention), the operation is certain to cause a general depreciation of t*e rentes which may create a whirlwind the effect of which may not be entirely to the liking of the coalition. On the evening of the 2utli of November the republican committee of commerce, industry and agriculture gave its an nual banquet under the presidency of M. Louis Barthou. prime minister M. Mascuraud, in opening the after dinner speeches, said in brief : You and I Mr. President of the council, devo ted for a long time to po itlcal conflict*, do not share either the disdain affected fes,n...*^5 ejbssses ms: jsarsi 'mcadMs instrument tor prop sszstsr r/rXc.rdanc. render sftassffivwi sure that liberty is absent.

In the Interval of the 20th of Novem ber and the 1st of December, a mys terious group was formed in the chamber, a new group which added to the rad.cal socialist left constituted the new Party.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. From the Concord Monitor. We see by the President's message that the same master is teaching this term of the congressional school at Washington From the Toledo Blade. We were unable to find anything in the Present's message concerning the price of eggs. From the Columbia State. Imagine Theodore Roosevelt's opinion of a puny little 3,000-word message! from tbe Indianapolis News. Another peculiarity of the President is that he can understand that it is a good deal easier and more effective to put three or four thousand words across in person than it is to put twenty or thirty thousand words across by proxy. From tba Columbus Ohio State Journal. Every time Col. Roosevelt sees by the paper that President Wilson has ap peared before Congress in person again and been cheered to the echo, he must go Badly forth' with a sigh for bis own lost opportunities and ?hoot an unneces sary number of warthogs. or whatever corresponds to warthogs in the South American wilds. From the Charleston News and Courier. The President's message seems to con firm the statement of a recent m riter that Mr. Wilson prefers short btories to novels. From tbe Norfolk Ledser-Diapatcb. The President Is one man who never speaks In Congress until he has some thing to say. From the Springfield Union. "Social Justice," says President Wilson In his message to Congress, "coines first." What! Stealing progressive thunder? Tut. tut! From the Milwaukee Journal A 3,000-word message compared to the usual thousand reams of presidential effervescence Is enough of a democratic reform to warrant grateful mention by the reading public and our toll-worn edi tors. #
