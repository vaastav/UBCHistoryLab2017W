NUMBER 64 PULITZER MEMBER OE ANANIAS CLUB PRESIDENT SAYS Threatens Libel Suit Against Editor of Post-Dispatch and World in a Special Message to Congress. DEMANDS AN INVESTIGATION OF PANAMA CANAL CHARGES Denies That Brother-in-Law Or Charles Talt Are Implicated. HISTORY OF PANAMA CANAL CONTROVERSY The Indianapolis News, of which Delavan Smith is chief owner, charged during the recent campaign that the United States paid 40, 000,000 for property which should have .cost .?l-,(MH),00O, and asked who got the rest of the money. In reply. I'rtsidcnt Roosevelt bit terly assailed .Mr. Smith, who proved lie had nothing to do with the pub lication. The News announced edi torially that it got its information from the New York World. President Roosevelt then assailed the World, which announced its willingness to prove all it had charged, and demanded an investi gation of what it called "Panama corruption." It intimated that the s28,lH)0,0(K) balance of the Panama canal money went to J. P. Morgan & Co., and through them to Doug lass Robinson, brother-in-law of the President, and Charles P. Taft, brother of President-elect W. H. Taft. By United Tress. 

WASHINGTON. Dec. 15 President Roosevelt today sent a special message to Congress regarding the Panama Ca nal scandal charges. The lanmiaire is tin strongest eicr Used in a presiden tial message. Joseph Pulitzer, owner of the New York World and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. is particularly ar raigned in the message as a "villilicr of the American people." The President brands as "scurrilous, libelous and false"' the charges that Charles P. Taft. brother of the President-elect, and Douglass Robinson, brother-in-law of the President, partici pated in the ?40,0IX),00tl canal purchase funds. Defends Taft and Robinson. He denied ositiveIy that cither Taft or Robinson had anything to do with the funds. The President says Mr. Pulitzer who owns and edit, the World is directly rcsKn-ilile for the charges and accuses him of criminal offense against the in dividuals libelled. The real injury, however, the President asserts, is to the American people, whose name he says has liet 11 "blackened" by the charges. The President asserts that the prose cution of Mr. Pulitzer cannot lie left to individuals and that the Attorney General is now considering what form of prosecution shall lie instituted. Knox Makes Statement. The message includes the statements of Senator Knox of Pennsylvania, who as Attorney-General conducted tne ca nal negotiations, and of William Nel son Cromwell, a New York lawyer and agent of the canal company, who was largely instrumental in consummating the sale. The document is the result of nearly a weeks incessant worK ny me 1 resi dent and his advisers. The final con ference was held Sunday, when the President summoned the White House attaches, from Secretary Loeb down, and alo invited Secretary Root and Senator Lodge to meet him. All caller were informed that the offices were closed and that no one would be ad mitted. The President and Secretary Loeb denied themselves to all callers. World Editorial.
