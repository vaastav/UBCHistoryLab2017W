FLEISHMAN HEADING FOR VERA CRUZ Fleeing Cashier Probably Speeding Through Mexico. It Is Believed He Intends Boarding a Steamer for South America. Bank Attach.es Property of Fugitive Greater in Value Than the Amount of His Defal cation. Special Dispatch to Tbe Call. LOS ANGELES. Dec. 10.— The search for Henry J. Fleishman, the absco'nding cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, has thus xar been unsuccessful. The only clew discovered by the police officials, after running down every rumor that came to their ears, is the fact that Fleishman departed from the Arcade depot of the Southern Pacific Company be tween 8 and 9 o'clock last Saturday morning. Some time between these hours Fleishman appeared at the station, wear ing an overcoat and carrying a light-col ored hand satchel about fifteen inches long. One of the railroad employes who knows Fleishman spoke to him and In quired as to his destination. The de taulting cashier replied that he was go ing over to Pasadena on some business. The depot employe says he did not see Fleishman again— In lact, paid no fur ther attention to him — and does not know whether or not he purchased a ticket or took the train. • A policeman at the Southern Pacific de pot, however, supplies the Information that the railroad employe could not give. He knows Fleishman well and could i\pt be mistaken in the man, and he declares positively that he saw the fugitive at the depot between 8 and 9 o'clock on Satur day, and that Fleishman boarded the train for Pasadena. Fleishman entered one of tbe coaches and had not emerged when the train pulled out. Buys Ticket in Pasadena. The ticket to Boston which the cashier purchased was bought in Pasadena on Saturday, and not In this city. He board ed a Southern Pacific overland train in that city and started for the East. How far he traveled on the Boston ticket Is not yet known, but the authorities will soon be able to land this information by trac ing the ticket through coupons In the hands of conductors along the line. It is certain that the Boston ticket was bought as a ruse and that the cashier did not travel far on it. It is believed that he left the train somewhere in Arizona, New Mexico or Texas, to connect with sOme branch road that would carry him across the border of Mexico. The theory Is that he is now speeding toward Vera Cruz, with the in tention of boarding a steamer in that port for some point in South America. The authorities are working on that supposi tion. Fleishman, had he remained on the over land, would have reached El Paso Sunday morning at 7:05 o'clock and a Mexican Cen tral train departs three hours later. Had the absconder planned otherwise, by using the Sunset limited, be might have left the train at Benson, A. T., stopping there until Sunday night, when he could have taken a train for Guaymas. That port is crowded with tramp steamers plying be tween the ports of Central and South America. If the fugitive continued his journey to El Paso he is presumed to have halt ed before reaching Mexico City, where he is known. There is an extradition treaty with the southern republic, a fact of which he doubtless was aware. At Vera Crux he could board a steamer for Central American and South American ports, whose ainhorities do not sur render fugitives. It is accepted as a fact that Fleishman did not flee to Lower California, where his ample funds would prove an attrac tion to freebooters, who would not scru ple to relieve him of his money. How the Money Was Stolen. Some interesting details in connection with the flight of Fleishman came to light during the Investigations conducted to-day. It was not until last Friday that his plans were perfected and the money I: Friedman' s Furniture I OPEN EVENINGS NOW. /| Yes, I love pil^rplrt 7 You may hear that or | a similar expression from most any lady if there's I a hint that she might have one for Christmas. | Cohsnial designs in weathered and Flemish oak.

VENEZUELA MAY FIGHT BUT CAN HAVE NO AID Uncle Sam Will Not Engage in That Cqun tty's Controversy With Germany. Special Dispatch, to The Call. f* ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W v WASH & INGTON, Dec. 10. — President Castro will not have the support of the United States in his defi ance of Germany. " His declaration to the American who visited him that he would -resist by 1 force the collection of the German claim, though he was disposed to pacify Ger many by, permitting the establishment of a German colony on Venezuelan soil, attracted considerable attention in ad ministration circles. President Castro can engage in war with Germany if he wishes, but he certainly will not be al lowed to cede territory to Germany for colonization pur poses, nor is it probable that Germany would accept such a concession. . _;. "The Monroe doctrine," said President Roosevelt in his annual message, "is a declaration that there must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any . non- American power at the expense of any American power .on American soil. We do not guarantee any American state against punishment if it misconducts itself, provided 'that the punishment cloes not take the .form of acquisition of territory by a non- American power." Before Germany orders her fleet to seize Venezuelan it is expected she will acquaint the United States with her intentions at the German embassy. In an swer to a question of Germany's attitude toward Venezuela reference is made to a statement made by Baron von Hol leben, the German Embassador, immediately after his re turn from Berlin, that Germany has no thought-bf extend ing her sovereignty over any portion of the -Western hem isphere. that he took with him was obtained after the bank had closed that after noon. How he obtained these funds is described by the assistant cashier. When the money was being stored in the vault after the closing hour, Fleishman and the assistant cashier deposited $60,000 in currency in a small box which was its customary over night receptacle. While the assistant turned around to get more money to place in the vault, Fleishman must have slipped the big bundle of bills out of the box and secreted them in his clothing. The assistant cashier was ab sent but a moment, and Fleishman had no time to lose. When the cash was counted after the cashier's disappearance the box that usually held the currency was empty. This $60,000 was all the cash that Fleish man took with him in his flight. The bal ance of his shortage represents money that he .had taken from time to time previous to his departure. After ho had obtained tbe bundle of pa per money by stealth, there was still one chance open to the cashier to avoid- ex posure, and he waited for this before starting on his journey that may termi nate in the penitentiary. It was that some change in Wall street conditions might come to his rescue and enable him to make good the money he had previ ously stolen from the bank. With this faint hope he delayed his departure until the following day. Early in the morning, long -before the first, stock quotations were ticked over the wires from ' New York, he was in Creary's bucket-shop to learn the opening quotation on Amal gamated Copper. He could not conceal his nervousness or the feverish anxiety with which he scanned the figures when they were posted. He had lost. Amalgamated Copper had touched $61 50, its low water mark. Fleishman went straight from the bucket shop to the Arcade depot and his flight had begun. There Is no longer any doubt that it was his losses In this copper stock that led to the cashier's downfall. He Invested heav ily in the stock when it was seling at $20 above par, and when the bottom fell out of Amalgamated and he had used up his ready cash to "cover" he drew upon the funds of his .employers, believing that there must come a turn In the downward tide that would enable him to repay the money without detection and save that of his own that had disappeared In the slump. His last hope went when the re turns of Saturday morning showed that Amalgamated, Instead of rallying, had es tablished a new low- water mark. Bank Is More Than Secured. Fleishman has left behind a fortune greater In value than that of which he robbed the Farmers' and -Merchants' Bank. In addition to the $30,000 bond sup plied by a surety company and his real estate, valued at $50,000, he held convert iblo stocks in different corporations, to the value of $75,000. These, together with the real estate, have been attached by the bank. The institution has $155,000 with which to offset its loss, the highest esti mate of which places it much below thts figure. These stocks were left by Fleishman In the hands of a friend in this city, whosa name the bank officials refuse to reveal. When this friend learned of Fleishman's heavy defalcation he went to the bank and informed it that he was the custodian of the stocks. They were at once at tached and will go fax toward "squaring" the fugitive's account with his employers. The directors of the bank met to-day and set an expert at overhauling all of Fleishman's accounts. Nothing further than the statement given out yesterday as to the amount missing, it was said at the bank, had developed. State Bank Commissioner Barrett made an examina tion of the books to-day, and found Lhe institution in a splendid condition. The directors have authorized an offer of $2500 reward for the apprehension of Fleishman and an additional $2500 for the return of the missing . money. >;. I Judge Shaw granted the writ of attach ment on the property of Fleishman," upon the request of Graves, O'Melveny& Co., attorneys for the Farmers' and Mer chants' Bank. 

WOMAN WITH FLEISHMAN'. Constant Companion of Cashier Whllo He Was in Bakersfield. BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 10.— Henry J. Fleishman, the absconding cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Los Angeles, was In this city on November 8 last, having been brought here as a wit ness In the A. L. Forsythe forgery case on a bench warrant issued from the Su perior Court. At that time he testified that Forsythe had no account with the bank of which he was cashier and on which the arrested man had forged checks and cashed them. Fleishman was in this city but one day and evening. While here he was In com pany with a woman. Fleishman was reg istered at the Southern Hotel, but there is no record of the woman on the hotel register. Whether she came with Fleish man or met him after his arrival is not known. Fleishman has many friends in this city, and, while he was seen by some of them In company with the woman, they profess ignorance as to her identity or the city of her Vesidence. She was a decided- brunette of striking appearance and was attired in a dress of rich, dark material. It Is known, however, that the unknown woman was not a resident of Los Angeles or Bakersfield. This much is vouched for by Fleishman's friends, who refuse to talk much concerning the case, as they do not wish to gain pub licity thrtiugh the predicament in which Fleishman finds himself. - The cashier while in Baker sfleld lived quietly. He kept constant company with his, female companion, but evidently he and she were careful to avoid attracting undue attention. On the evening of the day on which Fleishman arrived In this city : he and some of his friends attended the floral fair which ■ was given at that time. by the Woman's Club. The friends who saw Fleishman with his companion and who profess ignorance as to her identity give as an excuse for their lack of attention to detail so far as the woman was concerned that they paid no particu lar attention to her or her dress, as It was not dreamed that Fleishman would ever be In trouble. There was no reason why they should' observe her. closely. Those who know Fleishman best In this city are" evidently aware of the name and place of abode of the woman! but they refuse absolutely .to say anything con cerning her further than to deny that she Is a resident of this city or Los Angeles.
