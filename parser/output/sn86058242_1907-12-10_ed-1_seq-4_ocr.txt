Archbald, vice presi dent of the Standard Oil company, is worthy of the attention of every Ameri can who is interested in the economic problems that have been raised as a result of the centralization of capital. Since the recent financial flurry, which is partly due to the persistent agitation against corporations, the opinion is more generally prevalent that there are good corporations and that while there are also bad ones, even those bad ones have their good points. Mr. Archibald's article brings out this fact most forcibly. The Standard Oil company has for many years been looked upon as one of the predatory concerns that are a menace to the welfare of the people of the whole country. But in spite of the charges of stifling competition, of accepting rebates to crush the small dealer, it is apparent that even this giant of octopi has had troubles of its own. Mr. Archbald points to the fact that unlike many of the other large corporations the Standard Oil company has not inflated its stock to enormous proportions in order that its dividends may appear nominal. On a small capitalization it has been paying the yellow press and their readers have gasped, been four times as large and the dividend had been Unthinking public would not have been amazed at 40 per cent, interest If tills capitalization made but 10 per cent.. the earnings. and had the On the other hand if the capitalization had been four times as large the company would have been accused of an equally great crime, of watering its Btock and foisting it upon this same unthinking public. So it appears that the big corporation of today is between two fires. If by conservative management and the utilization of numerous by-products a manufacturing concern Is enabled to make a handsome profit, the public seems unwilling that they should enjoy the fruits of its own industry and intelligence. j. it is true that there nave been a great many pernicious practices on the part or certain concerns that have laid them open to criticism, but it is also true that much or this criticism has been unjust and has worked an inesti mable damage to organized capital throughout the country. une recent nurry win prooamy p.ave the effect of sobering up the muck rakers who have been so lavish In the use of their pens, and there will re suit a house cleaning all over the country that will be appreciated. WITH THE EDITORS cers and It Is Impossible to secure enough enlisted m-;n." Interest is quickened. "What shall be done to bring the army up to its proper complement? The rate of offi cers' pay, says the president, should be "greatly increased," and there should be a "relatively even greater in crease In the pay for the enlisted men." Vborefore the enactment of the Diek Capran service pay bill is recommend ed. Under that bill the pay of officers is to be increased from ten per cent, in the highest grades to twenty-five per cent, in thr- lower commissioned grades, and the president is authorized to fix the pay of unlisted men. If there should be " a relatively even greater increase" in the case of the private soldiers and the non-commissioned officers, they may expect a lib eral raise from the president. As Mr. Roosevelt points out, there are other things wrong with the army besides Inadequate pay. Evidently his attention has been drawn to stric tures on the service which have ap peared in the newspapers, often anony mously from a fear of exile to the Philippines. Twice the president rec ommends the creation of a "special corps" to cio the manual, m?nial and unmilitary labor which is now imposed upon the enlisted man vastly to his dis gust and discontent. What visitor to a post but has seen him in soiled clothes doing hated chores that de tract from the dignity and smartness of the soldier? When it comes to "prac tice marches" Mr. Roosevelt has no patience witli those who say that therf is too much "hiking" in the hot sun -0r the physical welfare of the enlisted men. Let the marches be continued and entended, urges the president. In making the same recommendation with regard to field nienoeures lie is on irer ground there can hardly be too much training. Mr. Roosevelt is not satisfied with the horsmanship of the army. He wants "a far more rigid and thoroughgoing test" for all field onicers. Apparently the riding school at West Point is at fault in its meth ods, or the officers soon lose their seats r.d shun the back of a horse. We are inclined to think that the president by implication falls to do justice to the equestrianism of field officers. There may be some marines among them, but as a class they ride as well as he does, or better. Mr. Roosevelt is extremely vague when he proposes for the encourage ment of the private soldier a rank in the army corresponding to that of war rant officer in the navy. How could it be managed outside of the Coast Artil lery; which requires the services of skilled mechanics? A chief boatswain. a chief gunner, a chief carpenter, a hief sailmaker or a warrant machin ist in the navy is one or tne mose use ful and intelligent men in the service, tncl often he receives more pay than a second lieutenant in the army, some times, but too seldom to excite the envy or his shipmates, he wins promo tion to the rank of Ensign. In the army commissions are to be o'otained with less difficulty by enlisted men, and as there is now a dearth of sub alterns the sober, obedient and edu cated soldier need not envy the war rant officer of the navy. The organ ization and needs of the army are so different from those of the other ser vice that there seems to be few places in the army which a "warrant officer" could fill. It is a pity that the presi dent, Instead of discussing reforms diffusely, did not confine himself to the Dick-Capron .pay bill and urge congress to pass it promptly. New York Sun. GONLOtnPH1

SPRINTS OF LITTLE MIL Crowds Cheer Each Attempt to Gain, Bat Men Are Too Evenly Matched. THE PASSING OF THE PANIC AND OF THE OCCASION OF IT. Matters are much improved. The conditions of money are steadily ap proaching the normal. A subdued activity is seen In general business and It is possible to take account of stock and determine the extent of the dam age Incurred. The spectocle is impres sive. No precening panic ever ap proached It for the impartiality and extent with which the ruin was dis tributed. Since Mr. Roosevelt came into the presidency he has conducted an ex traordinary campaign againr-t wealth, and In particular against the railroads. His hatred of the last named has taken the form of an intellectual ob session or lesion. It began with his rublic declaration that the accepted definition of property must be changed, and it proceeded cumultaively ever since until it culminated in the rresent commercial convulsion. Of Mr. Roosevelt's proficiency in the arts of the politician, in tho worst significance of that word, he has left us no room for doubt. A more canscienceless of more reckless dema gogue never afflicted this country. By slow and insidious degrees he has upset tho public confidence, arrayed class against class, and fomented mis trust and hatred. No one ever ap proached him in creating a hopeless disaffection and unrest in the ranks of labor. He joined a labor union un der conditions of intense publicity; he has constituted himself the champion of every known extremity of labor agitation; he has associated upon terms of close personal intimacy with the worst and most sinister figures among- those professional disturbers of whom Orchard. Mover, Fottibone and lluywood are the familiar expression, and lie has welcomed them as the guests of the president of the United States in the White House in Wash ington. All tills lias been accom panied by the steady denunciation and sophistical vituperation of capital in vested in railroads and therefore in most intimate contact with the peo ple by steady abuse of what he called swollen fortunes and by fix ing public attention on abuses in corporate management in ways as subtle a? irresponsible, but excellently devised to arouse and inflame the pub lic mind. Any vulgar and unscrupulous dema gogue could have done the same thing with no particular harm to the great body politic; but when the role of agitator and of sower of evil seed is taken up by the president of the United States and he goes up and down the land engendering discontent, jeal ousy and hatred in the hearts of the people it is a Tery different and a very serious thing. Even in time of over flowing national prosperity, even in "o of & prosperity more evenly dis tributed and shared than .ever before m the history of this or any other country, it was possible for Mr. Rooso velt to achieve a disaster that ordi narily could ensue only in time of great public depression, disappoint ment and common misfortune. TT 1 .... .. .. jie jiad nor tne sngntest apprehen sion of what he was doing. No ray or husiness Intelligence ever entered his brain or ever can enter his brain He cannot even now understand that when tho president of the United Mates, year niter year, unremitting ly assails the stability of fourteen bil lions of money invested in a sing American Industry, to wit our rail roads, ne is hound by virtue of the weight and tradition of his office, to bring about a crash. What did he care for a Wall Street panic? A mere disturbance among gamblers and stockjobbers? After pulling down the house he wonders what made it fall: Well, matters are relatively better, much better. When confidence Is re stored once more wo shall speedily be ourselves again. But it will take a long, long time to repair the breaches that have been made, while for count less thousands things can never be the same. For many it is too late In life to begin all over again, and for yet many others the damage is mite irre parable and beyond the reach of hope. That is inexorable; but happily to peo All credits must be reestablished or else recreated. 'mat Is in exorable; but happily to people of our temperament it will come easily enough, and already the whole country is addressing itself to the task with a degree of fortitude that noth ing can abate. The national sense of recuperation is founded in the conviction that Mr. Roosevelt has accomplished his self imposed mission and that he is functus officio. His message, filled with warmed over aspirations and shop worn alarums, has been received with indifference and contempt and dis missed as the lucubrations of a mind unhinged. His homilies and his ful minations are no longer of concern, and neither his recent pretension to fu ture orfiee nor the sublime and dra matic renunciation that he ponders excites any emotion New York Sun. 

VOICE OF THE PEOPLE. Toleston, Ind. Dec. 9, 1907. Editor Lake County Times: I noticed in a recent issue of the Lake County Times, where a lady of Hegewisch lost some money in a fire, and naturally considered it a complete lost. Mv own experience may be of value to iier anil others who might have this experience in the future, to recover such losses. Severn 1 years ago I lived in Windsor Park, and by some mistake my wife threw her pocket book with some paper into the fire and the pocket book and money ($1-) were apparently a total loss, as it was burned to a crisp. The two fives and a two dollar paper could not be distinguished from one another. I was careful not to crash nor disturb the burnt crisp, except to remove it from the frame of the pocket book. I showed it to Mr. McGrath, then Cashier of the Calumet National bank. South Chicago, who advised me to throw it awav, but nevertheless I called at the office of the United States sub-treasury in Chicago and followed their instructions, towit: I made an affidavit to the fact that I was a citizen of the United States and had lost the money in a fire, and that it was my property. I also had the notary attach a statement that he know me personally for several years past, that I was a law abiding citizen, and that ho had every reason to be lieve that my statement was true, and with these papers I sent the ashes to the third assistant to the treasury of United States, Washington. D. C. In a few days to my surprise I re ceived by mail two fives and a two dollar green back, crisp and new as though they had just been issued the day before. Yours Repectfully, J. Q. JAMES. There will be no Coulon-Murphy fight at Dolton, 111., tonight, nor will there be a boxing show of any kind in that burg, which has recentlv gained cn- tlle siderable prominence through the ad vertising of tho bantam-weight light in mention. Sheriff Christopher Strassheim last night announced that as Dolton was situated in Cook county he would pre vent the entertainment being held. This lie did at the request of Fred Webber and John S. Harter, two num bers of the board of trustees of the town of Dolton. When told by Webber and Harter that a prize fight had b-en extensively advertised to take place at Delmar's hall in Dolton the sheriff readily agreed to stop it. Instructs Deputy Sheriff. Forthwith Deputy Sheriff Thomas Morrison was instructed to inform Joe Choynski, physical director of the Illinois Athletic club, who was engaged to referee the contest between Coulon and Murphy, that the battle Would not be allowed. He was also notified to bear similar instructions to Manaeer Joe Levy and other officers of the Twin City Athletic club, under the auspices of which the bouts were to be held. None of the officials of the Dolton club could be found last night, but it goes without saying that in view of the sheriff's orders no attempt will be made to stage the show, and if Coulon and Murphy are to settle their grudge they will have to seek other battle grounds at some future time. Extensive preparations had been made for the show, with an arrange ment to seat 1,200 persons, and tickets were to have been sold at $3 each They would have all been sold, too, as interest in the bout, which was virtually a championship ailalr, was intense. A special train had been en gaged to carry the fans to the ring side, and besides the main contest two other good bouts were to have been fought, making the show in all one of excellent class. Great is the disap pointment thereof. Promoter Slow to Ltjirn, This is only one of several shows that have . been attemptel by en terprising but not far-seeing pro motors within the Cook county bound ary line only to be stopped by the authorities at the eleventh hour, and it seems they will never learn. ' Coulon and Murphy were trained to the hour, and fit for the fight of their lives, but their hard work was all for naught unless one of the outside clubs at Milwaukee, Peoria, or even New York or Phildelphia, take advantage of the chance to grab one of the best matches between little fellows that could possibly be arranged. BOOK REVENUES TO BE USED FOR ATHLETICS New York, Dec. 9. Striving tonight to gain a lap on one another, thirteen of the sixteen teams' that started in six day bicycle race in Madison j Square garden kept up their dizzy j whirl with every muscle and sinew In their trained bodies taut. ' Sprints followed one another, but r.o riuer could shake oif the others. Kaeli attempt to gain brought forth tumultuous shouts from the crowd, that was as large as at the opening. So many of the riders being evenly matched makes the outcome of the race very uncertain and keeps the inter est on edge. Hugh Mel.es n, in an interview, after summing up the work or the riders m detail, says that the best team in the race is the German-Holland combina tion, composed of Walter Rutt of Ger many and Johann Stol of Holland. Iaj- Without Incident. The race sturted at 1 o'clock this morning, and the riders experienced an eventful day. Before the race had been running six hours there was a bad snill. in which four of the riders were. so shaken up as to be compelled to re tire temporarily from the track, and one team, composed or narry iteynoicis of Ireland and James Benyon of Lon don, had to withdraw from the race altogether. Nat Butler of the Downing-Butlcr team withdrew from the race at 1:30 p. m. it was announced mat nis part ner, Harly Downing, would pair with Matt E. Downey, Walthour s partner. During a terrific sprint in the sixth hour o'f the International six day bi cycle race Harry Reynolds and James Benson, the lrish-F.ngl'.sh team, in re lieving each other, collided, and both were so painfully injured that they were unable to continue. Reynolds suffered from a severe con tusion of the left forearm, and Benyon was bruised about the body and lower limbs. The sprint was started by Bre ton, closely pressed by Fogler, and af ter a wild burst of speed Dupree, Ben yon and Reynolds fell, the result be ing that Wilcox, Lawson, Galvin, and Jacouelin each lost one lap and Llm berg two laps.

Tho board of directors of tho Athletic association of the University of Wisconsin today adopted resolutions declaring that the money received from the sale of its new membership books, which were placed on sale today, will be used in hiring ceaches for the baseball and football teams and supporting generally the other athletic teams, especially the crew. The board expects to get about $4,000 from the sale of these member- snip books. In view of the fact that the board of regents of the university, which will meet a week from tomorrow, is cramp ed for funds and might riot feel dis posed to appropriate money for coaches the action of the athletic board is ex pected to remove any objection the regents might have toward authorizing the employment of athletic instructors.

In dealing with army matters In his message President Roosevelt wm vol- i uminous but vague. He argued that a i cheap army is poor economy, which nobody would deny. He undertook to show by citing the casualties of Indus try that the outcry in America against militarism, a system under which com paratively few persons are killed any where, is absurd. The logic is bewil dering, and it was superfluous because Mr. Roosevelt had dealt with the topic sufficiently when he said that there were foolish people "who denounce any care of the army or navy as mill tarims" but that "these people are not numerous."
