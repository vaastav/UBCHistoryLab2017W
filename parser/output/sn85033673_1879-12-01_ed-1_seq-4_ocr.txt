The sparkling Lotta will have a brilliant and an enthusiastic reception at the theatre to night. She is to play Musette, in which William A. Bokus plays a loading part. Those able to give are urged to be prepared for tho visits of collectors in the interests of the poor. There is much suffering among the destitute, and a great deal more is feared. The theatre will bo brilliantly illu minated to night, tho side or bracket lights having arrived. Tho decora tions of the theatre are complete, and it is a pretty place to look at. The receipts of cotton here arc un paralleled in the history of the city and never since Memphis became a town has there been so great a dumand lor the staple by owners of Eastern cotton mills. In view of the near approach of the time when privy voults are to be filled up, people have begun to practice on the system of emptying urinals and wash slops by pitching them out of front and rear windows in the streets. A street car and mule stable is in course of erection at the corner of Linden tndMain streets.

"Cotton goods continue active, and prices are very strong. Many makes of brown, bleached and colored cot tons are largely sold ahead, and in many cases agents refuse orders for goodj except 'at value, on dav of delivery." So says a . recent letter from the cast. The committee of fifteen, appointed at the sanitary meeting on the bluff some time ago, are to meet promptly to-night at 7 o'clock in the rooms over tho cotton exchange. They arc making earnest efforts to arrive at a conclu sion as to what eught to be done in a sanitary direction. We stopped in the Assignee's sale of watches, jewelry and silverware of C. A. Bossac, at Loyd and Fritz's old stand this morning, and found the handsome auctioneer. Mr. John French selling goods at one-third of their original cost.
