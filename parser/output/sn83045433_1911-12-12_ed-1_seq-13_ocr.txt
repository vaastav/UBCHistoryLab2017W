SS!W THE WASHINGTON EDERAUD. -TUESDAY. DECEMBER 12. 1911. 13 B --v3T'TR?r!ip5?e-CT! L Cheering Information from All Quarters Causes General Uplift in Prices Market Strong All Day. Or THOMAS C. SHOTWELL. New York, Dec 1L From all quarters cheering Information came to the stock market to-day and the result was a gen eral uplift in prices that left the mar ket materially higher at the close of the day. The urgent character of the buy ing was the best proof that most of the purchases were for the account of shorts but there was considerable investment buying, too, for the developments were of a most substantial cha'acter. Looking at the market from a strictly technical point of view, however, it seemed as though It should be sold on this rally because most of the developments had been expecfJd or had been actually in Possession of Wall street for a week or more. The greatest importance was attached by the street to the Hadley report on railway securities that President Taft submitted to Congress, to the approval by the Supreme Court of the Tobacco plan, and to the advance of $1 a ton In the price of wire. These three things were really not news at all, for all had been known in advance. The Had ley report was In Wall street two -weeks ago ana had been thoroughly digested by the leaders. The essential features of the report are the recommendation that the government attempt nothing more than complete publicity In connection with security Issues; that it permit the railroads to make more money and pay liberal dividends and thus put themselves In position to furnish the facilities which the country is badly In need. Federal supervision of Issues Is deemed unwise because It would conflict with so many btate laws. After President Taft's message to Congress nobody certainly had serious expectations of anything else than a confirmation by the Supreme Court of the Tobacco plan, which the President ap proved in superlatives. The importance of the tobacco settlement is that the courts have proved once more their de termination to protect property rights in America. The advance In Steel prices was an nounced in these dispatches nearly three weeks ago and came somewhat later than expected. Wire is put up $1 a ton for February delivery, but for de liveries later than that still higher prices are to be expected. It may be worth while to call attention to the fact that the surprising increase of more than 400, 000 tons in the unfinished business on the books of the steel trust at the end of this month includes one order; of 125,000 tons of pig iron sold at the end of No vember, Thus, the three great pieces of news in Wall street for the day were not news at all and had been discounted by the big people. Nobody bought any stock on account of these three things who had not had ample opportunity to do so any time In the last two weeks save perhaps that small percentage of the public that Is compelled to wait for official announce ment The making permanent by the Commerce Court of the temporary In junction against a reduction of the In termountaln rates by the Interstate Com merce Commission was a matter of for mality that was also known to be com ing. Rumors were heard of an investigation of the New Haven railroad by the De partment of Justice at Washington to see whether It had not violated the law In buing practically all transportation lines, steam and trolley.

Selling, for the most part, was In fractional lots, with little change In price levels. There was slight demand for bonds, two of Washington Railway and Electric selling for 86 and a Potomac Electric going for 109. Small lots of Capital Traction stock sold at 127, and ten shares of Oas hugged the price of 87& showing no tendency to resume Its rise of last week. Mergenthaler con tinued around 221U. May Affect Gas Stock. The election of Joseph Loiter as tem porary president of the Washington Gas light Company yesterday to succeed John R. McLean, resigned, will probably have a beneficial effect on Washington Gas stock during the present week. Wash ington Gas took an upward turn shortly after Mr. McLean's resignation, but for days It has assumed the general tone of the Washington stock market, and hung stationary around the level of 87, with fractional advances and losses. Howard S. Reeslde, member of the board of directors and vice president of the company, was prominently mentioned as the next president of the corporation when the annual stockholders' meeting is held next February. Mr. Reeslde denied rumors to this effect after the meeting of the board yesterday. "There 1b simply nothing to It," he said. Finance Plan Pending;. Little headway has been made by the Chamber of Commerce In adopting the plan of B. V. Cummins to finance the George Washington Memorial Hall through a method of ground purchase, subdivision, and sale of lots, to embrace a profit of 12 per cent to the organiza tion. Thp plan was broached at a meet ing of the directors last week, and the Chamber was so favorably Impressed tilth the Idea that a special meeting ot the board was called yesterday afternoon. Two hours were spent In consideration of the plan by eleven of the thirty mem bers of the board. At the end. they raised the point of no quorum, and agreed to bring the matter to the attention of the whole Chamber at the meeting to night. Mr. Cummins told the directors that a street railway company of Wash ington had asked that he present the plan to them for consideration, which he agreed to do by December 20. Substantially, the plan revolves about the purchase of 100 acres of ground In the suburbs of Washington, under the direction of a committee appointed by the Chamber. The accommodation notes of members will be taken in exchange for the face value of stock In the holding company, and the ground subdivided and sold In building lots at a cost to carry the original purchase price, the subdivi sion and improvement cost, and li' per cent profit to the Chamber. It is planned to sell the land to retired farmers living In the Middle West, who are desirous of making Washington their home. In addition to a lucrative finan cial proposition, Mr. Cummins explains his idea as a populating system for Washington, by bringing to this city men with money to spend, and not those who will be dependent upon the resources of the city. Occnpy Weiv Quarters. The United States Trust Company oc cupied its new offices In the banking room of the Southern Building yester day. President Jordan was In his office the greater part of the day. receiving friends who dropped in to look over the new offices. Everywhere were piled floral congratulations from friends of the In stitution. The new quarters of the "United States Trust Company are among the handsomest banking offices in the city. Lewis Johnson Co., for more than fifty years bankers and brokers of Washing ton, yesterday moed to their new quar ters In the Arlington Building, 1505 Penn syhanla avenue, adjoining the Riggs Na tional Bank. Rumors of Ticvr Hotel. Rumors were heard yesterday of the recently acquired control of the Shore ham Hotel by Interests which also con trol the Willard and Raleigh hotels, and who will also exercise an option they are said to be possess. In purchasing the Shoreham property for Jl.000,000 before the expiration of the ten-year lease now held by J. Maury Dove. Basis for these reports is given In the rapidly maturing plans for the New Ar lington. Realizing the need of a competl tl e hostelry in that section, the Pennsyl vania avenue hotel people are said to be tentatively planning a new Shoreham similar in plan to the Raleigh. No verifi cation of such rumors can be obtained. Park Boundary In Donbt. A dispute which has arisen over the boundary line of Montrose Park In Georgetown and Oak Hill Cemetery, has resulted In the War Department refusing to accept Jurisdiction over the land un til the question of title Is settled. Mon trose Park was purchased by the District government at a cost of $110,000, and the dispute has arisen over a strip of ground, eighteen feet wide, between the cemetery fence and the boundary of the park as determined by District Surveyor Hazen. ' The strip is occupied by graves and should the District acquire control, the bodies burled there would necessarily re quire disinterment. District Surveyor Hazen does not believe the District has any claim to the ground, which is dis puted by Capt. Mark Brooke, Assistant Engineer Commissioner of the District. The matter has been sent to Corporation Counsel E. H. Thomas for a ruling. Directors Declare Dividend. At a meeting of the board of directors held December 6, the United States Sav ings Bank declared the eighth semi-annual dldlvend of 3 per cent, payable Jan uary L 1912. Railroad Sale Postponed.'' The sale of the East Washington Heights Traction Company sat for yes terday at the District Building was again postponed. The sale was ordered because of the failure of the company to pay a bill of $3,556.49, the railway company's share of the annual expense of mainte nance and repair of the Pennsylvania avenue bridge. There were no bidders present at the purposed sale.

Bibbs & Co., mem bers of the New York Stock Exchange, Hlbbs BuOdlr. New York. Dec 1L Heary sealing of contracts ce the cotton exchange in the last hour of the session to-day followed announcement by the gorernment of It. MM.! nf fhf v.mn'i ffm and netr lmr records for the year were established. Selling pres- euro continued up to the close, nnai puces being the lowest, and showing losses of from 7 to 11 points. The Department of Agriculture at Washington an nounced that it estimated the production of cotton in the United States for the season of 191113 at 14SS5.O0O bales of 500 pounds gross weight, not in cluding linters. This is the largest estimate) erer issued by the United States goTcmment, and exceeds that of 1906. the season of the pisiious bumper crop, by nearly 2.000 000 bales. As the gorernment usually underestimates crops, the trade took the figures to mean a probable final crop of 15.500,000 bales. Dealing in contracts up to the Issuance of the goremment's estimate of the crop were quiet, and price fluctuations were tery narrow, but following the receipt of the gorernment figures the market scathed with actlrity. At first, commission houses, spot interests, snd ring traders interpreted the re port as what was expected, and corering of out standing short commitments followed, on the theory that the bears had played their trump card. Prices which had been ranging about 3 to 5 points under Saturday's dosing immediately rose ahora Saturday's final ficum. and snot houses supplied contracts freely to the shorts on the rally. Second considera tion of the gorernment s ngures, noweTer, construed them as bearish, and heaTy selling ensued; December declining to &2; January. 8.54; March. 8.63; May. 8.72, and July, 8.82. The market dosed in the midst of the downward morement at the lowest of the ses sion.
