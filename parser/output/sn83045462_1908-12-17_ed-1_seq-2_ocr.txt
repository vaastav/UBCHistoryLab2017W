'.'It Is clear." he said, "that this model Is out of all proportion and gives a false Impression to the Jury. I would suggest that you obtain a photograph to show Us correctness, and then It may be used." Counsel for the defense noted an exaeptlon. The state called Dr. Johnson Maol^eod to the siand. His home is tn Flushing. He said he went to the Baysida Yacht Club on August 15 and found Annls lying on the float. "Dr. Houghton was there and there were several club members walking about. There w*?re several gunshot wounds in Annls' body which I discovered on superficial examination. I directed the removal of Annis to the hospital. I did not see Annis afterward." Dr. Jones Has Disappeared. "Did you see Dr.' Jones, the house physician in the hospital?" "Yes." "Have you seen him since?" "Xo." On cross-examination th<? witness sa.d he thought Dr. Jones was now in Syracuse. Dr. I.eo Sehmock, hotise surgeon of Flushing Hospital, testified that Dr. Jones brought Annis to the hospital, and that the wounded man was accompanied by Mr*. Annls.- Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell, and other friends. The witness told of numerous wounds found In Annls' body. Ann s, he said, died from shock and hemorrhage brougtht on by some of the wounds described. Twenty Gunshot Holes in Annis. Dr. Joseph Bloodgood of Flushing testified that he attended Annls at the hospital. He related the treatment given to the wounded man and told of the examination he had made. Annls was etherized, the physician said. Examination was made, which disclosed about twenty gunshot holes from entrances and exits of bullets. Annis died from shock and hemorrhage. Dr. Bloodgood said. One bullet made six wounds, the witness declared. Cross-questioned, Dr. Bloodgood said Annis was in the hospital about twenty minutes before he was etherized. "Did you see Annis die?" "I did not." Mr. Mclntyre asked that, in view of the fact that the witness did not see Annis I in death, the testimony be stricken out. Justice Crane reserved decision until other testimony could be heard. Hp Waltor Frov of Twiner Islflntl fit V. I . ?T ??? *. v * V J v* * B *- "*? ? the coroner's physician, the next witness, described the autopsy. He discovered twenty external wounds, and then in de- [ tail described what he had done iiwtracing the course of the bullets. Dr. Frey was given a scorching cross-examination. Mrs. Annis Not Quizzed. Then the prosecutor called Mrs. William . E. Anr.is to the stand. She said: I " I am the wife of William E. Annis. My name is Ellen Annis. I was present at his death. Dr. Schmock was there." j "Did you see your husband die?" "Yes." "That is all." said the district attorney. Mr. Mclntyre said that, the district attorney should exhaust the witness upon all her knowledge of the case. Justice ( Oa?e said it was not necessary at this time. "Then I have no questions." said Mr. Mclntyre. ' Justice Crane drew from Mrsifknnis that her husband died about 7 o'clock August la. Mrs. Annis then left the stand. Birchfield Is Witness. Charles A. Birchfield, a member of the Bayside Yacht Club, testified tliat at the club the afternoon of August 15 he saw s two men and a waiter talking. One of the men was the defendant, Thornton J. Halns, who. when the witness came up. engaged him In conversation about real estate. While they were talking Thornton Halns' companion came up and called the defendant aside. The witness said he next saw the defendant and the other man walking down toward the dock. Later the pair stood near the strlngpiece. "There was quite a little gathering on the dock." Mr. Birchfiekl testified. "There were Mrs. Annis. Mrs. Rockwell and Mrs. Nesblt on the dock. I think Mr. Funke was on the dock. "I went down to the dock and talked with the defendant. He told me that he had made no deal with Mr. Storm"?a real estate dealer who had been mentioned. Thornton Asked About Annis. > "He asked me about the boats around there, and I said they were the one-design class. He asked me if Annis had a onedesign boat. I said he had one, and he warned to Know wnicn one it was. "I pointed out Annis' boat coming: down the bay. Annis' boat had >fo. 7 on the ] sail. He asked me if Annis had to come ' In before the race, and I said that he 1 did."' , Mr. Birchfield described the shoot- | ing, after which he said: "The defendant pointed his gun at ( me and said: *Stand back; he knows ' what he is doing.' 1 "I moved a little forward and the ( defendant said: 'Don't interfere; you ' will get the same thing.'" * * The witness said he heard three dis- ' tinct and separate shots and several others that came together. , "The firing ceased after, the gun was " pointed at me." said Mr. Birchfield. ( "Annis then came from around the . mast. Whether he touched the float I don't know, but he fell into the water and two men pulled him out." Mrs. Annis Screamed Out. ^ Mr. Birchfield said that Mrs. Annis came down the runway screaming. At the bottom of the runway the defendant said something to Mrs. Annis and ] pointed his revolver at her. She turned and ran back tip the runway, still crying out. Birchfield said that lie saw John Tunning. the boatman, run up and seize t'apt. Haines by the arm. Witness said be could not tell the exact moment the episode happened, but thought it was . just after the shooting. 1 "The defendant rushed over to Tonnfng. I don't know what was said or 1 done, but I saw Tonnlng release the ' captain. Tliey pulled Annis out of the i water, and I went to call a physician." With the ending of Mr. Rlrehfleld's direct testimony an adjournment was ' 4 ~ ~ ~ laivcii iui i ci C3?. Yesterday's Proceedings. Under cross-examination by Mr. Mc- ' lntyre, Edwin Andrews yesterday after- . non testified that at the time of the j shooting he engendered a deep feeling against the defendant and had compared note wltn other members. "Did you know of the relations of ! Mr. Anni? and Claudia Hains?" "I object." said the prosecutor. The objection was sustained. Mr. Andrews denied that there had been in his presence a rehearsal on the clubhouse float, with club members taking the parts of the principals of the tragedy. , Tim only shots fired, the witness said, were by Capt. Maine They were not In rapid succession. Mr. Andrews replied in the negative to the question if he knew that all the shots in the automatic revolver could be fired in 1 5-8 seconds? "Didn't Thornton Mains say to you: "He's my brother; I'll arrest him; I'll take charge of him?" "I did not hear him." "Did Thornton Hains shout at the top of his voice: 'Get an officer; I will hold him.' " "I did not hear him." "Did you notice when Thornton Hains sat on the upturned boat that he had his hands on the captain's wrist?" "Only momentarily. He was feeling the captain's pulse." Battleships for Argentina.

JABLE TO STATE DEPARTMENT i Washington Officials Surprised at Outbreak in Caracas Against President Castro. Vice President Gomez's declaration of lome days ago. declaring Venezuela to be n "a state of defense." evidently has been onstrued in some circles as meaning a itate of war. That inference is apparent- j y justified by a dispatch which came to ] :he State Department today from Paxton Ffibben, secretary of the United States egation at Bogota, in the United States >f Colombia, transmitting a telegram re- i reived by the minister of foreign affairs l 3f that country from Caracas dated the L4th instant. That telegram says: "In view of the blockade established uid the capture by the blockade of a Venezuelan vessel, the head of the govMmment of Venezuela, after assuming exraordinary powers for the defense of the :ountry. has declared a state of war." The statement of Gomez followed the news in Caracas of the oapture of the :oast-guard ship Alexis, w;.lch, he said, was considered a true invasion of Venesuelan territory and an aggression against ;he Venezuelan government. Surprise to Officials Here. The stirring events in .Caracas are somewhat of a surprise to officials in Washing:on, where it had been generally expected hat any manifestation of hostile acts by i foreign power against Venezuela would nave the result of solidifying ail elements ; >f the people and make them rally vigor- j jusly to President Castro and his govern-' Trent.

CASTRO. ington that had the United States takei any forceful steps against Venezuela ii the effort to have its claims against tha country arbitrated Castro would have be come a veritable hero in the eyes of th people there. It is possible even that, anticlpatlnj such an attitude, the administration ha been indifferent to pushing a demand fo settlement. Now that Castro has let the country, the strong influence he ex crted over his people, in the minds of th' officials, appears to be waning. Disposition to Ignore Castro. Some interest is manifested at the Stat' Department in the unofficial press re ports that Castro might seek alliano with Germany. The report lacks any sub stantiation, so far as any State Depart ment advices go. The department has felt that the situ ation in Venezuela would gradually wori itself out. For this reason there ha; been a persistent determination to Ignon President Castro and look with equanlm ity on the doings of foreign government; in their efforts to get satisfaction fron him for alleged wrongs s? long as then is no interference with American inter ests and no violation of the Monroe doc trine. 

CASTRO REFUSES TO TALK. Doubts Correctness of Outbreak Against Him in Venezuela. typeoial Cablegram to The Star. BERLIN, December 17.?Presiden Castro of Venezuela, when interviewee this morning, refused to talk about th< recent riots against him at Caracas, re> marking that he had received no infor maiion concerning them. He also re fused to discuss the seizures of tin ^Venezuelan coast guard vessels by tin Dutch warships, but authorized thi Venezuelan charge die affaires to speal for him. The charge de affaires ex pressed doubts oft the correctness o the dispatches to the newspapers con cerning events taking place in Venezu ela despite tlie fact that they were officially confirmed at The Hague. Tin charge, still holding his doubts con cerning the reports, said that if tin seizures had taken place they wen sheer acts of piracy, as no deciaratioi of war or any blockade had been pro claimed. These measures on the par of the Netherlands, he added, were un worthy of any enlightened or civilize* country and would jeopardize the ne gotiations which Venezuela was carry ing on with the Netherlands througl confidential agents. These measures, tiie charge furthei added, might result in rendering tin Venezuela government helpless to con tinue her indemnity payments, thus prejudicing her interests with tin other powers. In view of this aspec of the case the Venezuelan governmen had communicated these facts to tin diplomatic corps at Caracas and wai awaiting a reply before taking any fur ther steps.

PUCE FOR THE BAll House District Committee Favors Pension Building. ACTION NOT YET TAKEN i Recommendations as to Inaugural Festivities Expected Tomorrow, COST OF THE GOVERNMENT Commissioner Warner Says That Employes Will Be Idle for 20 Days, Salaries f95,474. The joint resolution authorizing the use of the pension office for the inaugural ball of 1909 and providing for other matters in connection with those ceremonies was considered for a couple of hours by the House District committee today. No conclusion was reached and the committee will meet at half-past 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and formally recommend to tne House that the resolution be adopted. Aldis B. Browne. B. H. Warner, Gen. George H. Harries and Hopewell Darneille made statements, the former exday, but only Messrs. Browne and Darneile made statements, the former explaining why It was essential that the use of the pension office be granted and the latter telling the reasons for the increase asked in the special fund for protection of the inaugural crowds and policing of the city, etc., from $18,000 to $23,000. Chairman Smith Posts Himself. Chairman Smith of the House District committee spent some time with Pension jj Commissioner Warner this morning, got ing over the big building and obtaining - information as to what changes and reare rangements would be necessary in order to make the pension office ready for the % hig quadrennial event. Consequently he s was primed to tell his colleagues on the r committee all about the subject, and as t there is little or no opposition In the com mlttee to the use of the pension office for e the purpose in question, it was not considered necessary to hear all the gentlemen who had appeared to urge favorable action on the resolution. e Immediately after the House met. how. ever, and the report of the Perkins special committee had been acted upon. Representative Sims of Tennessee, senior - democratic member of the committee, - arose and moved that the Joint resolution be taken out of the hands of the District committee and referred to the ap~ propriations committee, on the ground s that it authorized a direct appropriation, e and therefore should be considered and acted upon by the latter body. The ~ Speaker ruled that such a motion was ^ not In orcfer at this time. Chairman g Tawnev of the appropriations committee appeared relieved. . Payment 4ft Pensions. During the committee meeting today Chairman Smith read a letter from the Secretary of the Interior inclosing a comE munication from the commissioner of pensions, both being in reply to a request by Mr. Smith for an opinion upon the joint inaugural resolution, t In his letter Secretary Garfield said: 1 "Neither Commissioner Warner nor l desire to raise any unnecessary question regarding this proposal, as we both ap* " predate the difficulty the inaugural eom mittee has in obtaining a suitable build ing, but before Congress directs such use 9 the conditions should be thoroughly una derstood. "If the committee determines that the 8 pension office sha 1 be used. I call particc ular attention to the need of providing - for the use of the portion of the building f occupied by the pension agency, so that . pensions can be promptly paid." - Cost of Using Building. 9 In his communication Commissioner . Warner throws cold water on the pros posal. He says: 8 "While the resolution contemplates the ] exclusive use of the building by the comt mittee for the purpose indicated, it does . not specify for what length of time, and 1 in making this report I assume the oc. cupancy and treatment of the building . and the disposition of its present contents 1 by the committee will be substantially that of similar committees on like ocear sions in the past. b "While the committee may not have - exclusive possession of the building ,or s more than ten days, its possession of the 2 building in removing desks, file cases, t records and furniture from the room# and t in arranging decorations, platforms, 2 stands, electric light wires, fixtures, etc., s and in attempting to restore the building - and it's contents to the condition in which the committee found them, will, so far as carrying on the business of the pension - bureau is concerned, amount In effect to the exclusive use of the building by the committee for twenty days, and during ? that time the business of the pension bureau and the agency for the payment of pension, therein would be practically r entirely suspended. "There are at present 1,248 employes in the pension bureau building the total of their daily salaries being $4,7715.70, and the sum total of their salaries for the twenty days will be $0.">,474, which will be paid 1 them as they will be in enforced idleness during that time. "If the resolution passes at it now reads the substantial effect will be the cost in money to the government of $!>.">,474. "If the resolution is amended so as to stop the payment of the employes in the 1 pension building during their enforced idleness it will substantially compel the j emp'oyes to donate to the committee that amount, and if the purpose of the resolu3 tion is to enable the committee to reim burse itself or to provide means to pay - the expenses of the unofficial inaugural '. ceremonies it would be much better for the government to appropriate and give ' the committee that amount outright, Inv stead of turning over to the committee the > pension bureau during that time. j Would Delay Pension Payments. ^ "Since the last inaugural ceremonies' there has been located in the huildine an ? W agency for the payment of pensions. The agency pays between 53,000 and 54 000 pensioners and the next payment by that agency commences on the 4th day of r March. UHlft. If the building is surreni dered to the committee, as contemplated . by the resolution, the payments due ? March 4 will be delayed at least two ? weeks, and it is not necessary to suggest ? what such a delay will mean to those who confidently expect that their penb sions will be paid promptly when due, as i they have been in the pas!. P 'There are in the building 1,433 desks, i. 1 r?4 tables, 570 file cases, with their contents, each one weighing when full f 1,?>nn pounds, and when empty 503 ( pounds, and many other articles of office furniture and books of record, and e> these would have to be removed before i the ceremonies and afterward replaced. The files contain cases, and are not sup plied with locks. i "It would be necessary to remove all t the above to some place not now prok vlded and have them carefully guarded, e at some expense at least, until returned e to their proper places in the pension i building. "Heretofore, the building has been f greatly disfigured and damaged by the - installation of an additional electric plant for lighting and by having nailed and at. tached to its walls and columns the decorations provided by the committee. "In addition, heretofore on such occas sions. many papers that could not be " duplicated have been stolen or destroyed, t and on such previous like occasions tires t have occurred in the building on account f of the carelessness of its temporary occupants, and in moving from and returning " to the building the desks, tables, file 1 cases, etc., have been greatly damaged. r "We cannot exp?ct any less damage to ? the building and its contents bv the con- ( t templated occupancy, than the building , ) and its contents sustained by the like ocj cupancy in the past, and the damages, in ' ) every way, by the proposed occupancy. < cannot be estimated," i HIS 

WORK IS CUT OUT Kellogg Not Likely to Be Next Attorney General. OIL TRUST HIS AFFAIR Calls at White Honse Today to See Mr. Eoosevelt. BROWNE TALKS TO PRESIDENT Explains About Brownsville?July Fourth at Coming Danish Exposition. One of the men most prominently mentioned for Attorney General in the Taft cabinet was a visitor at the White House today. He was Frank B. Kellogg, the special foe of the Standard Oil trust, for which he is said to draw f'Jo.oOO a year, from the Department of Justice. It is authoritatively known that Mr. Kellogg has not received any offer of the portfolio of Attorney General In the Taft cabinet, and there Is doubt that he will be. because of the desire of the present and the incoming administrations thai he personally conduct the prosecution again^ the Standard Oil without the Interruption that would come with assumption of other duties as head of the Department of Justice. 1 The great preliminary fight against the Standard Oil takes place in the United States court at St. Louis, beg'nning March 23. Appeals will quickly take the case to the United States Supreme Court. Up to this time the government has simnlv hee'n encncpri in talfinir tpstlmnnv against the great octopus, finding out and tabulating its sins for presentation to the courts. Mr. Kellogg will be relied on to handle the case .from bottom to top. At the St. Louis hearing the government will lay before the court its testimony, formally move for an injunction to restrain the Standard Oil from continuing to operate under its present form of incorporation, alleging that it is a trust, violates the Sherman anti-trust law and should be dissolved. Kellogg Would Retire. Close friends of Mr. Kellogg understand that he desires to leave official life, and that he will tender his resignation upon the conclusion of his work against the Standard Oil. He wishes to take up his private law practice, which at one time was most profitable, representing, as he did, many of the biggest corporations in the northwest. That Mr. Bonaparte will not remain in the cabinet is admitted by the Maryland man. He, too, has found official llfg expensive and unprofitable. He has not been offered a term under Mr. Taft and is believed to have allowed the next President to learn that he does not want to continue in public life. There have been only four or five men mentioned for the important legal post. Mr. Kellogg was one. Wade Ellis, assistant to the Attorney General, ranking next to him, is another. William Nelson Cromwell, ho of Panama canal fame, is a third. The fourth is Henry M. Hoyt, solicitor general. Hoyt May Save Good Chance. Mr. Hoyt entered the Department of Justice about fifteen years ago, beO m o acclctont ? u ? ..? I v?iu\ aooiovaiii aiiui ucj crucial auuuL eleven years ago and has been solicitor general sine* tho appointment of J K. Richards as circuit judge in Ohio. Many people believe tljat Mr. Hoyt has the best chance of any man mentioned. William Nelson Cromwell is regarded as an Impossibility. He has for so many years been associated with Wall street and the trust interests of New York that it is doubtful if the Senate would confirm him even if he should be named. One new name is mentioned in connection with the office. It is that of Charles E. Magoon, provisional governor of Cuba. Mr. Magoon was solicitor of the bureau of insular affairs of the War Department when picked for the higher places to which he has gone. Mr. Magoon is also talked of for Secretary of War upon the retirement of Secretary Wright. Mr. Wright is looked upon as good for several years in the Taft cabinet, which would leave Mr. Magoon unattached. Browne Talks With President. Herbert Janvrln Browne, whose work for the administration in the Brownsville case is soon to be investigated by the Senate, was with President Roosevelt today, accompanied by a negro who Is said to have assisted him. The negro withheld his name from all inquirers. Mr. Browne has had several audiences with the President since the special message was sent to Congress. The President also conferred with Secretary Wright of the War Department. The cor/erence is thought to have related to the #*oraker resolution of inquiry. The Foraker resolution has not yet reached the War Department. Steps to be taken there will not be made public until it is officially in hand. A Danish Celebration. Max Ilenius of Chicago and M. C. Hadsen of New York, president and vice president, respectively, of the DanishAmerican Society of this country, saw the President today to ask his aid for an exposition to be given at Aarhus, Denmark, celebrating the 700th anniversary of the foundation of the town. On the Fourth of July next year the day will be given over to an American celebration at which Americans and DanishAmericans will speak. The President told his callers that they would have to see Mr. Taft, as he would not then be in office. pq t a lv ?i1ft n f Aloclru Viots -???* ?. v* 4nurnii iiao I

IMPROVE THE METHODS I RECOMMENDATIONS OF JOINT POSTAL COMMISSION. I i Director of Posts Urged, and Seven Assistants?Postal Notes Not Exceeding $5 Favored. Important recommendations for changes In the organization of the postal service are made by the joint commission on tie business methods of the Post Office De| partment and the postal service, which to day laid before Congress the results of its t deliberation during the past two years. The commission favors a permanent ad, ministration head for the department, to be known as director of posts. This ofli( eer, it is suggested, should be. given the ; general management of the posta' service. while the Postmaster General remains 1 he administrator of the postal finances. It is proposed to abolish the offices of the four assistant postmasters general ; and to rearrango the work under seven . separate bureaus. It is proposed to divide the country into postal districts upon administrative and not geographical considerations for the - management of the postal service. Fourth5 class post offices are recommended to be placed on a salary basis and postal notes or money orders without advices are sug gested for sums not exceeding ; TO ESTABLISH 'A POLO FIELD 1 COL. BROMWELL WILL PREPARE PART OF POTOMAC PARK. President of United States Approves the Proposition?Gossip Regarding Formation of Teams. It has been practically decided to establish a field for polo playing in Potomac Park near the inlet to the tidal basin, but it will hardly be ready for actual use before next spring. About fifteen or twenty well known gentlemen are actively interested in the movement, including several cavalry officers on duty at Fort Myer. Although President Roosevelt has never engaged in a polo game, he Is an enthusiastic admirer of the sport. While at Oyster Bay last summer lie traveled a considerable distance to witness matches in which friends of his participated. When approached 011 the subject of having a portion of Potomac Park set aside for the purpose he gave the proposition his hearty approval and instructed Col. Bromwell, the engineer nfTir-i'i- in eharce of mihlic hiit 1 < 1 intrs and ' | grounds, to make the necessary hi11 rangPinonts. The latter sai?J the grounds selected, owing to weather [\ conditions, could not be put in proper condition for polo playing before next 1 spring. He expressed his personal ap1 proval of the plan and said that polo games could be regulated just as nr? - the base ball games played on the White Lot. It would be necessary, however, to restrict the permits to reputable clubs or organizations and ! see that the privileges are respected. In view of this action on the part of the authorities it Is probable that { teams will be organized by the Chevy Chase and other clubs whose mem! bers indulge in equestrian exercises and a team of expert horsemen will un doubtedly be provided by the cavalry contingent at Kort Myer.
