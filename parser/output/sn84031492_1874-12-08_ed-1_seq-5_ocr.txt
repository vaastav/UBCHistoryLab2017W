OPENING OF CONGRESS. 1H THE UOEBE. Special Die patch to The Chicago Tribune, ■Washington, D. 0.. Dec. 7.— The House wan (ho scouo of unwonted activity for the opening day of a second cession. Long before midday the galleries were packed dense and black with crowds of curious spectators, and tho approaches to tbo couth wing of tho Capitol Building were blocked with vieitom unable to pain admission. Even tho diplomatic gallery was filled with mem bers of tho different legations, who bad assem bled to bear tbo passage of tbo President's Message upon Spain, something of tho nature of which had become known early in tbo day. Tho floor was the econo of bust ling confusion. Tho members, with what grace and dignity they might, filed into tho places which do many of thorn must soon vacate. Those who came to see bad humor wont away disappointed. Each member had Ms stout or ms own defeat, • but there were no apparent indications of tbo pai’siomi and prejudices of tho last political cam paign. Tho Representatives seemed rather like & lot cf boon-companions mot to toll tbo story of some social rout. Tho rancor of tho cam paign bad loft its mark upon few faces, and was not apparent in tho few words that were spoken tn donate. When the minute-hand had reached tbo hour of noon, Speaker Blaine tapped his gavel, and, with tbo usual Parliamentary formality, an nounced that the second session of the Forty third Congress bad begun. the rzusT business wag to arccrtaiu tho presence of a quorum, com municate in tho usual way with tho Benato, aud delegate ft committee to wait upon tho Presi dent and ii form him that Congress was in ses sion and awaited any communication ho might havo to malic.

SIO,OOO a year. TUE QAO-LAW Tho now members sworn in, tho first attempt was made at legislation, aud tho attempt failed. It has boon tho custom, out of respect to tho Chief Executive, not to transact any busmens until tho message has been presented, but young William Walter Phelps, either ignorant of this custom, or ovcrzoalous to redeem pledges ho had made, presented a bill repealing iho Poland gag-law. Ho asked tho immediate consideration of the bill. Ho failed to obtain it.at first by reason of tho necessity of observing the traditional courtesy to tho President, and ho failed again later because one objection could carry tbo bill over. That objection was made by R. 8. Halo, of Now York. An attempt was made to object by Benjamin Butler, bat Butler, as usual, blundered with his parliamentary points, And was out off without a hearing. 

BOILER REVENGED HIMSELF, however, by stating to those about him that ho would vote for a repeal of tho law if tho pre vision should bo added permitting Congressmen to shoot any editor for libel, and added that tho Poland gag-law, after all, is nothing new; that it was in tho General Judiciary act un til tho reorganization of tho Judiciary of this District, in 1b72, whou, by some oversight, it was omitted. Phelps' bill consisted of an amendment pro viding for tho - repeal of tho second section of tho Poland gag-law. This section is ono which has special reference to newspapers. Phelps proposed to amend ic by adding this: “ That tho provision of tho ihlrtv-tbird section of tho Ju diciary act of 1760 uhall apply In all eases, except in eases for libel and dander.iu courts created by act of Congress in tbo Diotrioc of Columbia. Phelps gave notice that on Monday next ho should ask to suspend the rules and pass this bill. OPINIONS ON THE MESSAGE. THE FINANCIAL PORTION TlllSllßOf.

Iho apparatus above mentioned, together with that used iu tlio central ofiico, is tho best known for fire-alarm purposes, aud no city surpasses oina in this respect. Tlio number of boxes in service is too few, but this defect will bo romo died when tlio 200 lately authorized by the Coun cil ahull havo bouu received and placed in the proper localities. Tlio chief want of this Department in now linos and a different system of building them. Much of tlio wire iu old and nearly worn out, ami must of it is laid over house-tops. The lines, it is nusottud by those in charge of them, should bo entirely rebuilt and placed on tall and sub stantial polos. Built in this wav, It is claimed by the operators that they will last longer, cost less to inaintuiu, amt their operation bo every way oafer and more satisfactory. In this connection I think it but a simple act of Justice to the Hoard of Commissioners to slntti that Qcn. SUnlor, who has been invited to this city upon the recommendation of the gen tlemen composing the Citizens 1 Association, in which tlio Commissioners Joined, lias simply recommended improvements which the Commis sioners themselves hud previously most earnest ly urged upon the City Cloveimnent, Indeed, Con. Minder wont much further, so far as expen ditures for now apparatus uro concerned, than tlio Hoard ever ventured to do. Bo that 1 can only sou that the views of Oom Slmlor and his action thus far are a complete and perfect vindi cation, not only of the previous viows of the Board of Commliidcmors, but of their repeated ly-urged recommendations to this Council. Tlio only reason for the refusal on the part of the Finance Committee and the Council to comply with the recommendation of the Commissioners was tire groat and prowiug urgency at that time, on tho part of tho people, that tho burden of taxation should bo reduced. rOT.ICR PKFAIIT3IBST, Tbo report of tlio Commissioners of Pollen, which Is mibmdtnd, gives Ha cxpcnsca from Doe, 1, 1871), lo Doc. 1,1874. at $087,915.05. Of lids $43,169.(11 wan expended on buildings, SGBG.- 720,88 formiiarlus, $67,080.10 for miscellaneous expenses. Tbo number of persons arrested during tbo year was 20,2122; tlio amount of fines, $89,871; prisoners bold on criminal charges, 921); sentenced to tlio Honuo of Correction, 1,804. Tim charges ngalimt persona arrested wore: Larceny. 2,84:1; robbery, 118; and burglary, 305. Of Uioho penman, 15,170 wore fined in the various police courts. Tbo value of property reported as lout or utolon was $19,1,814. ■tbo value of such property recovered won 8190,911, . In tho months of March. April, July, and August last, upward of $20,000 worth of prop erly was recovered, which had been stolen sev eral mouths previously, and Dio loss of which bad novor been reported. Tills, with tho fact that tho onllro amount of property stolon within the last year is but Httlo upward of ouo-holf of that of tlio previous year, fs sufficient explana tion of tbo amount of property recovered, which ciOßOly approximates to tho amount stolen. Comparing tho abovo returns with those of tbo year previous, I find Iho following result: Number of arrools for 1878, 22.217; no accurate report of linos returned: no report made of pris oners hold on criminal charges, nor of tho num ber sent to tbo House of Correction; arrested for larceny, 2,100s for robbery, 181; burglary, 258; no report made of tbo number of persona fined in tlio J’ollco Courts. Amount of properly reported lost or stolon, $359,091.74; amount of property as abovo recovered, $172,940.77. HEALTH OF TUB CITV. I am happy to bo able to Inform you that tho health of tlio city has probably never boon bettor than during the past year. From tho ablo and interesting report of Dr. Bon O. Jllller, I find that tho population per actual census of Oct. V, 3874, was 395,490: tho total number of deaths for twelve mouths, 8,109; Ibo death rnto por 1.900 of population in 1874, 20.5; and nor 1,000 of population in 1873, 24. From tho date of the groat flro up to December, 1873, small-pox was very prevalent in tho city. A system of visita tions, vaccinations, and othor remedial and pro ven tivo.measures, had, however, reduced ttio number of infected houses from tbiity to forty each week to live up to tho Ist of April, uo that by August last tho city was almost altogether freo from tho disease. Binco then tho eases ocouring havo bean brought to this city from other oiticH or towns. Thu system of visitation anil inspection is, nevertheless, still persisted in, and so far with the best results. Much attention has been given to disinfecting packing houses by destroying gases issuing from rendering tanks by machinery, not patented, but suggested by the Board of Health. In fact, tho city is troubled loss now than over before with those unpleasant odors which had heretofore aflliclccl it. A thorough system of meat inspection Ims also been adopted. Tho doatha for tho year past have been 8,109. Tho report of Dr. John Bold, Health Officer, gives tho number of nuisances reported and abated during tho year at 2i,487, which will give a practical Idea of tho extent of tho work per formed. This does not, however, Include 5,1119 notices to connect with sowers, of which 4,812 connections wore made, besides immense quan tities of provisions of all kinds, Including meats and vegetables, condemned, 25,445 carcasses of animals and 23,161 loads of garbage removed beyond tho city-limits. For violations of tho Health ordinances, 443 suits havo been brought, and $3,103 collected in flues. Tho en tire expenditures of the Health Department for tho year ending Dec. 1, 1874, havo boon 094,675.66. house or cotcrecuoh. From tho report of tlio Superintendent of the Houso of Correction, Charles 13. Felton, Esq., which is herewith submitted, I find that during tho past year 5,623 peruana wore received into that institution. Of these 4,087 wore males and 1,435 females. There remained over in the in stitution from tho previous year 441) persons, of whom 324 were males and 125 females. During tho past year 5,083 persons were discharged, of whom 4,103 wore males and 1,477 females. This loft in cQUlincmont on Dec. 1,1874, hut SSB per sons, of whom 305 are males and 83 females. Tho total number imprisoned during the year ending Doc, 31, 1873, wau 3,445. Of lho*dm clmrgcd persons 3,072 left upon expiration of sentences. 7 died, and G escaped and wore not recaptured. During the past year, tho pvinonors have boon employed in the construction of a wall to in close tho main structure, in making roadways, breaking stone, manufacturing hrick. caning chairs, and other industries. During tho past year tho institution manufactured 4,533,003 brick, of which 3,300,000 remain on hand, Tho cash receipts of tho institution during tho period from Jan. 1, 1874, to Dec. 1,1874, from all sources, have boon $21,401.35. The general ex penses for tho same time have been 852,287.83. This makes tho yearly cost of tho House of Cor , reciiou to tho city hut $30,823.18. Considering thu class of persons conlinod therein, and tho fact that a largo number of them when received are physically iucauucltatod by dissipation and poor living from oven the ruder branches of In dustry, tho oxncnscs of our institution, which furnishes food, clothimr, mid shelter for from 6,000 to 3,000 persons during a considerable por tion of tho year, are remarkably moderate. CITY PHYSICIAN, Tho duties of this ofllco, now acceptably ful filled by Dr. William P. Dunuo, «ro mostly In connection with llio inmates of llio Bridowoll, vanouii polled stations, and Small-Pox Hospital. Some 2,0(10 prescriptions hnvo been made to va rious patients.

OAS-LtOUTB. From tho report or John E. Siohel, Esq,. Gaa- Inancctor, herewith submitted, it will bo found that tho number of strcot-lampa has boon in crcußcd during tho year by l,t*7G, This makes tho total number of public lamps of nil descrip tions in tho city 9,0.12. Tina additional nuiubur of lamps necoHsnuly increases tho expense of lighting tbo city, including that incurred by tbo orockioa of posts and connections: neverthe less, tbo additional cost will bo found, in a grout measure, to bo reimbursed to tho oomtmunty in enhancing tho safety of lifo and limb, and also in virtually increasing tho security to property. Ah n police measure alone, tho proper lighting of tho city should lo looked upon as a veiy necessary und oircctrve source of good municipal government. Tho Htrcot-lnmps arc distributed ns follows: In North Division, l.blifj 5 South Division, 2,701; West Division, Thcj cost of necessary re pairs in enhanced bv the large extent of terri tory, mid the wllfulnoHs of 1103*6, who break a largo quantity of glass in the course of tho j’oar. At my request tho Inspector has given Ida views with rospeot to gns-burnora for public nud private uso. ills conclusion is that tho moat Kimply-coustrnctcd burner is tire best, und that all attachments and globular appendages which give a strange and globular appearance aro no more than ornamental. As the quantity of gas consumed depends upon tho burner, great cure should bo used in their selection, both for public and private use. Tho supposed incorrectness of publwnud private metero is in most cases tbo result of imperfect burners. Tho Inspector’s views on tho subject of gas-ROvernors will also bo found useful. In publio buildings tho In spector looks upon carefulness and watchfulness in tho use of gus as fully as oifoutivo as tho best description of govornoiH. The Inspector's views ns resprets the utility of changing the present time-table so that it may accord more closely with tho rising and eotiiug of tho sun, aro that tho diU'crouco gained is so small as not to justify any alteration In tho present system. Dutit is tho opinion of tho Comptroller and myself that there should bo a largo reduc tion in the amount of gas consumed. This may ho accomplished, firstly, by postponing tho lime of lighting, which, wo think, oould bo done some thirty or forty minutes without serious incon venience; secondly, by changing the humor, using a four instead of a live-foot burner; thirdly, by adopting uomo moans to regulate tho pressure and prevent tho waste of gas; and fourthly, lu case of absolute necessity, by leav ing off tho uso of a poition of tho lumps.' When I inform vou that tho yearly cost of lighting tho city lu$(10t),DOl), you will at once soothe necessity of a strict economy, no far as it can ho exorcised without detriment to the public, in tho uso of gas. Tno quality of the gas depends, according to tho Inspector, to a groat extent upon tho temperature, ns in cold weather the luminous constituents of tho gas aro condensed in passing through the pipe. ,$ -10,100.1C , 207,669.20 216.fi01.01 .$550,171.60 iO a 

HOARD OP F.DUOATim I am indebted to the Hon. .loim 0. Biohhorg, President of the Hoard of Education, for some facts and statistical htuiomcnts respecting Urn comliion of our city school fund, which 1 loci it to ho my solemn duty to lay before you. If there iu any one branch of our city administra tion which should ho carefully ami honmitlv conducted, and tho regulations of which thnuhl bo religiously enforced, it iu tho disposition of tho funds raised fur educational purposes. In modern times intellectual Ims, to a grout extent, talcen tho place of religious instruction. Con sequently, it is my solemn conviction that the man who, in these times, would filch from tho patrimony which enables our children to souuro ibo menus of obtaining a livelihood, would not refrain from filching from them tho moane of Boenring their eternal salvation. from tho nblo, ami, to every citizen of Chi* engo, personally interesting roport, of Us Prosl tlouf, i Jonrn that, in accordance with tho ruloa of tho Board, tho annual oleotlou of ofilcorfl thereof took place on tho second Tuesday of September hat, ami tho Standing Committees wore appointed by tho President on (lio last Tuesday of tho oamo month. At thin timo tho new organization found a largo amount of very valuable property belonging to tho School Fund unproductive, and conmdorablo property which had boon doviaod for tho benefit of Raid School Fund in nucli a condition that it had novor come into tho possession of tho Board, and thus no income was derived thorofrom. Tho lessees of Holiool-Fund property owed for rent over £250,000, ami are Btill owing. All this will appear m detail by reference to tho report of James Goggln, Esq., Clmirmnn of tho Committee on School Fund Property. Said Committee, I loam, havo been unremitting in their olTorfß to realize that which ia duo to tho school fund. Tho X,aw Department of tho city havo given all tho timo they could possibly Rpflioi to tho name object. Several injunctions have boon obtained restraining tho city from col lecting tbo ronln duo from certain of the Ichhoch named. Tlioho Injunctions are still ponding. Icß-'icea Jmvo not paid rent, raanv of them not for four years Inst past. Judging from tho past, probably they will never pay until they aro compelled to do bo! In view of all which I am decidedly of tho opinion that until Homo dcciulvo legal menu aro taken, hut little can ho realized upon debts that nro partly duo tho school fund. Homo of tho original Jossoea have Hold thoir leases at a bomia of 010,(1(10, Those loason include lota having lohh than 00 foot frontage in Block M2,H. S. Addition, Homo of those lots cannot ho bought for that amount. Yot UicHO parties pay no rent, Ihetoforo forcing au income of tuxen to umbo up iiio deficiency, and thus compelling tho people to pav “ tribute money ”to private parties. If tho properly could bo managed ns private indi vidual* UHUuIJy manage their properly, I havo no hesitation in Baying that an income would bo derived therefrom sufficient, with tbo annual “State dividend," to pay tho nalarioa of to tbo amount of $530,000. Thoueh this ia unattain able, yot tho Fame amount could ho realized by selling all of this properly for tho inlorcHt on tho proceeds. Tho amount which would thou ho realized on (ho property in tho ulmpo of city taxon, and tho yearly “ State dividend," would annually amount to #550.000 ; in any ovout to not much lens. Efforts havo recently been made by tho Board to 801 l ouch property aa ia not under lease, but no purchasois havo yot been found who would offer what tho Hoard considered a fairprico for tho property. Since tbo 15th of October Inst, nn income Imn boon derived from tho old Post-Oilloo site, tho lobboos paying $23,600 for three yearn, in month ly installments of $055 each, leaving at leant $15,000 worth of permanent improvements. At thin timo such improvements aro being actually made. From tho foregoing statement of facts I be lieve mifiiciimt inis been shown to prove that un questionably tho best iuiejosts of the Board and city demand that some ouo versed in the lair, and possessing tho necessary qualifications, should bo specially appointed 40 attend to the matters referred to. For some time to como tliiu duty will take his entire time. I fool con vinced that tho benefits derived from such an appointment under tbo control of tho Board of Education would ho largely iu excess of tho ex pense incurred. By of January tho Jones, and tbo school being erected on tho corner of Twonty eovonth and Garibaldi streets, will ho com pleted. Tho latter will have a seating capacity lor seven hundred and fifty (750) pupils.* This class of buildings), with furniture and healing apparatus complete, cost 4.‘10,000. They are biick, throe stories iu height, plain and sub stantial. Tho number of children now enrolled in tho public schools is U3,1M2. Tho average number attending is 35,975. Of these sojno 10,000 only attend a half-day of each school-day, for want of room. This is occasioned for want of funds. Woro it not for tho parochial private schools in soiuo districts, thousands of children would be entirely unprovided for. The High School has nu enrollment of 767; tho nvorngo number attending being 750. At the timo tho High School was established its location wan pood. Iu other respects it answered tho necessities of the period; hut if it bo sound policy, or deemed advisable, to continue this class of scbools, thou there should ho ono estab lished, if not at once, at least as early as possi ble, in each division of tbo city. If not, inter mediate schools iu each division should ho erected. Tho present High School should then bo removed, also the Scntnmou School, tho loca tions being unsuitable for school purposes. Suit able sites could then bo purchased olsowboro at oac-fourth tho value of tho property on which those schools aro now located. I herewith submit the lint of persona and the amount in which they are delinquent to the city of Chicago for (iiiouND hunt or rnorer.Tv ziblokoixo to the fionooii ru:n>.
