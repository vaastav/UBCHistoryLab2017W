The president can growl, but congress can sit there in staid and majestic silence and wait for him to go out of office. The Brownsville incident is still before congress. President Roose velt sent a special message to con gress enclosing a special report of the secretary of war and which was se cured for the department by two special Investigators. The president says the report enables the depart ment to fix definitely the identity of some of the leading spirits who took part in shooting private citizens dur ing the trouble in 1906, and that the oolored soldiers were clearly to blame. Senator Foraker enters the limelight of the Brownsville affair by Introducing an amendment in the senate concerning the re-enlistment of the discharged negroes, which places this question in the hands of a tribunal and leaves the president •high and dry from having anything to do with the proposition as to their being taken back into the army. Abraham Ruef, the San Francis co grafter and extortionist, has been found guilty after a sensational trial lasting 106 days, during the latter part of which the prosecuting attorney was nearly killed. Ruef was for many years the political boss of San Francisco and he had his hand on about everything that could be forced to give down the money, the sums secured amounting into the thousands, all just because he stood at the head of the department that could protect them. Ruef be came avaricious for greater gain, and Anally fell out with Mayor Schmitz and then the war began. Ruef thought his position impregnable, but his wall of defense was battered down when two convicts were par doned from the penitentiary to give their testimony against him. It has been a great expense to the county and city, but the conviction of Abe Ruef will have a very good and last to* effect on the grafting proposi tion In. that city In the future. The New York World and the In dianapolis News have been kicking up quite a fuss in the past week re lative to the charges made by the former newspaper concerning the payment of the money on the Panama canal to the French government. Both papers thought they had run the president to a corner and that any body else connected with the propo sition. would be silent. However, some replies have been made to these newspapers which characterizes their statements as absolute' false hoods, and the gentlemen seem to have the backing by which they can substantiate their denials. President both entered strong denials that there Roosevelt and Mr. Cromwell have was any collusion whereby the Americans in connection with the Panama canal enterprise succeeded in making any rakeoft on the sale of the property. It may become a sub­|the ject for investigation by congress, but we have no doubt but what the president and his friends will come off victorious. The atmosphere is clearing con siderably on the tariff proposition at the extra session of congress. Re ports from Washington are to the effect that President-elect Taft and Speaker Cannon are not at logger heads over this question, and that the speaker has declared to Mr. Taft that he is in favor of an honest and thorough revision of the tariff. These two gentlemen have held a conference in the situation and there does not seem to be any differ ences existing between them on the proposition. That a tariff revision la absolute necessary has been '•hown through the meetings that have been neld In Washington where the tariff was up for an investlga tton. The'facta presented there in dicate that many of the industries -which supply the needs of the peo pie of thb country, and those es pecially of the middle walk of life, can hive the duty removed. from certain articles which will bring labQut a great slaving. That tMs will be accomplished when the exra ses %f£aldn of congress convenes there is fet'-BO room to doubt. 5 V,
