Ottawa. III., Saturday, Drftmter 10 The Water Power Improvement. " This subject is again brought into notice by a proposition submitted in the City Council on TuesJiy evening. Alderman Lynch of fered the following preamble and resolution : WJ,eni.-, on the 20th da of July, 1869, the eitizons of Ottawa did by rote authorize the Mavor to issue bonds of the city to the amount t $60,001), to be paid to the party who ihonld a.ret to accomplish fully the improvement of the w.itir rwir utOttiorn; And xclu rem W. II. W. Cushman, for and in consideration of th said $00,000, did on the 2d day of August lSOi), covenant and agree with the city oi Ottawa to improve the iaid water pewer without unreasonable or unnecessary de- lay ; And irtu-roi marly hoveuteen. mouths have elapsed pir.ee the city so contracted with W. H. W, Cuhhmun, and yet work on the improvement has not been commenced although circumstances in tho interim has been most favorable to the execution of the work ; And Yfierean the West interests of the city re quire that the improvutnent be undo as soon as possiblo, and other responsible parties atand reedy to undertake tho work and agree to oom plete the sume durins? the year 1871, in case the city will place tho $00,000 bonds in their hands : JlmXced, That u committee of three be appoint ed who shll wait upon Mr. Cushman and re quest that he assitrn and transfer the bonds of tho city for $00,000 in his hands to a person to be dominated by the committee, said bonds to be held by such party designated until be shall, by order of the council, be directed to pay them over to the pnrty or putties with whom theeity may contract for the improvement of the water power at Ottawa. There is no question, had this resolution been put to veto, that it would have been adopted. On the suggestion, however, that in a matter of such importance it would be better to make hnste slowly, and that th wishes of tip; people of Ottawa in tho premis es had better he consulted, final action on the resolution was deferred tor a week or two, with the unclcrstandivg that, in the meantime, the Mayor should call a public meeting of the citizens of Ottawa, to whom tho proposed action of the council should be made known. And now, beturc such meeting is held, it would be exceedingly pleasant to us could wc Jay before our people the oxact situation of this water power business and give them some tangible object towards which their deliber ations and action in the proposed public meeting should be directed. On that head, Juewevcr, we are sorry to sty, we have no valuable information to impart that would be new to them. The city, Borne 17 months ago, cntercTTiiito a contract wittrMrT Cushman lor "the construction of this water power. That tjontrac! binds him to do the work without "unreasonable or unnecessary delay." The 3diay in not rommencing the work during 1801) may, on account of the continued high -water that-scuon, have been -'necessary." The "delay'' from making no commencement iuring the season of 1870, which w9 excep tionally favorable in every respect, teas "un reasonable and unnecessary" beyond dispute or controversy. .Mr. Cushman, we understand, now denies tin-, n the ground that when, in August or September last, he concluded te commence t lie work be found unexpected difficulties thrown in his way by the corpor ators of the Ottawa Manufacturing Company, under wliese charter he proposed to do the work, and which charter, lor that purpose, was to be conveyed to him. Tuw is a matter with which, we must beg leave to suggest, the people of Ottawa have no concern. Mr. Cushman was one of the corporators and an important part of the Ottawa Manufacturing Company himself, and before he entered into the contract with the city ought to have known how he could treat with his colleagues an that company. Or, if their demands of him are unreasonable and outrageous, why not tate the fact candidly to the poople of Ottawa, who, in the anxiety to sec their work goon, we have no doubt, would have found means to remove the "hitch." But the corporators, on the other hand, deny point blank that they hate cast any obstacles in his way. On the contrary, they aver that they have nhvuys stood ready not only to transfer to Mr. Cushuian tlicir charter, but to assist him in every otherway in their power, whenever he manifested a disposition to go on with the work in accordance with his con tract with the city. And thus the matter stands. Mr Curiunan ays lie is ready and anxious to go on with the work "in accordance with his contract with the city," whenever the corporators of the Ottawa Manufacturing Company do what is required of them. The corporators say. they re ready to meet all the requirements Mr. C. needs, whenever he will proceed to do the work "in accordance with his contract with the city ; " or, if Mr. Cushman desires to aban don his contract, they are ready to take it off his hands and enter into bonds with the city to do the work themselves within tho year of grace 1S71. Botli parties ready and anx ious to go on with the work both parties protesting their innocence of purpose or desire to cast any o!M;:chs in the way, yet neither party to commence on account of tho imprac ticability or obstinancyof the other! And Ottawa ii going down hill, and the people arc disheart cried and despodent ou account of contemptible shilly-shallying like this I While Mr. and Mrs. I'ierco wore chatting eosily together in their parlor, in Qulaoy, III., the ether night, they found a hugs rattlesnake among the stove wood.

OTTAWA , FREE TRADER : , SATURDAY, i i The Franco-Prussian War, The despatches of the week have been oc cupied with details of tho fierce battles from Tuesday of last week to Monday of the present around Paris and Orleans. The army ct Paris, ander Ducrot and Trochu, 150,000 etronjr, on Tuesday made a formaidblc sortie to the south east of Paris, attacking the Prussian positions trom Choissy Ie Roi to LTIay. The operation involved continous fighting until Thursday morning, during which the French gaine some advantages, and inflicted severe punish meni on the enemy, but failed to break through the Prussian hues. Simultaneous! with this movement, the army of the Loire, en Thursday, made a furious attaek on the Prus sian right, with tho apprent object t form a junction with the French, who at the sume time made another sortie against the Wurtem- bergere on the south-west of Paris,) but this effort also appears to have failed, though the French fought splendidly and the Prussians lost heavily. Then on Monday the Prussian left moved against the French right at Orleans in such forte that Paladines, after an ineffec tual resistence, was obliged to evacuate the city, of which the Prussians once mo re took possession. This is in reality all there there is of the war operations fr the past ten days, in reference to which there have been so many columns ot despatches, the great body of which are mere rumor, guesswork and cliall". The Message. The President's message is given in full on our inner form. It is a document that has been pronounced by some of our radical co temporaries "adroit," chiefly, we suppose, on account of its general flatness and non-com mittalism. Indeed the President seems to be in favor of nothing in particular except the annexation ot San Domingo, and for this he pleads with all the earnestness of a mother for a spoiled child. It is said the President's friends are really confounded by the earnestness with which he urges the project, which is so well understood to be one of the dirtiest jobs ever proposed to congress for its sanction. The recommendation in favor of a general amnesty, which it was promised should form so conspicuous a feature in the message, is un fortunately omitted, and Instead of it we have the hypocritical cant about "loyal" voters being debarred from attending the polls in some of the southern states, in the face of the notorious farce which the radicals have made of the elective franchise in the south for the last six years with a shamelcssness which no anguagecan properly characterise. The flin at "revenue reform," with which the message closes, isan ebullition of petty spiteas impotent and unworthy of Grant's position as he is unfit to occupy it. Congress. Congress assembled at Washington at 12 o'clock on Monday. A quorum wa-i present in both houses, and the day was spent in readingthe President's message. On Tuesday the senate was in session about 30 minutes during which no business wa9 done, except to considersome motions in reference to a revision of the standing committees. In the house, several bills were introduced to repeal the income tax, and a short, sharp struggle took place over a land grant bill passed by the sen ate at the last session but undisposed of by the house. TheaidDronosedistonrailrr. id fmm A. ' ........ w t St. Croix river to Lake Superior, in Minnesota. The whole army of land grabbers were on hand to support the bill, and a test vote show ed a majority off) in its favor. Wednesday's proceedings in the senate were unimportant. In the house sundry bills were introduced, among which the uiest notable was one by Mr. Fornsworth to abolish the franking priv ilege. Senators Shurz and Trumbull, in spite of their fierce assaults on Grant during the elec tion contests last fall and their identification with the third party movement, were gladly admitted to the republican senatorial caucus on Monday at Washington, and immensely eased the minds of their brother radical sena tors by declaring their purpose to stick to the sinking radical ship to the last. Before the election, Grant wrote an insulting letter to Missouri, directing the radicals of that state as to the supreme will and pleasure of his high loftiness. The radicals of that state and the democrats, have answered with a 33,000 majority vote, repudiating his com mands. He will probably send a negro army to Missouri to correct that refractory state, as' to oppose Grant is at once opposing "Tho Government" and open rebellion. Attention is asked to the advertisement of the Chicngo Journal in another column. Aside from its politicis, which arc staunch republican, there is no paper in Chicago that is to be preferred to the Journal lot general news, reliable market reports, and all that varied reading tbnt makes up a first class amily newspaper. Our readers can form some idea of the partiality shown New England by the U. S. Internal Revenue laws by the nimplo fact that Massachusetts, whose-wcalth is double that of Illinois, pays but $1 0,000,000 internal revenue tax, und all New England, whose total wealth is ten times that of Illinois, pays but $10,322, 893.41, while Illinois alone pays 18,364,3G0.CO. Swoajt l.v. Dr. nnr, the new Coroner, appesrea before tho Circuit Court Wednesday, filed his bond, and man duly " cuised" into office. Circuit Court. We left the Longworth trial last week on Friday morning, when Mr. Boyle was address ing the jury. His argument was very clear and coinprthensive, and of great fore. He was fol lowed by Mr. Stipp, who spoke five heure in the masterly manner peculiar to this talented at torney. E. F. Bull followed from 7 till 9 o'clock Friday evening, and continuing next morning till noon, and afterwards till 3 o'clock, Vol T. Lyle Dicker concluding at 5 o'clock. Ail b addresses were characterized by unusual ability and thoroughness. The jury remained out until about 11 o'clock, when they returned into court -Hon. Judge Le- land haying been sent for with the following verdict : We, the jury, find William Long worth, sen ior, guilty of manslaughter, and fix his term in the penitentiary three years; and further find Wm. Longworth, jr., not guilty, in manner and form a charged in the indictment." On Monday morning a motion for a new trial was entered by the defence. The case of the People vs. John Phillips, in ointment for stealing horses, was called. Blan- chard for the prosecution, and Dewey and Rich olon for the prisoner. . The facts seem to be, that on the 19th ot Sept. last, a mare and colt were stolen from Mr. Pen- dergast, at Peru, and a horse from Mr. McMa hon. Chauncey Weatherly, who plead guilty some days ago, and has gone to penitentiary for three years, and the prisoner, as several witness es testified, were neon at Peru on the evening of the theft, and a boy swore he saw Phillips lead ing two of the horses out of Fendergast's pas ture on that evening. The horses were found inJoliet, in possession of "Jockey Stevens," an uncle of the prisoner, who, it seems, claimed to have bought the horses of prisoner. The de fence sot up an alibi, several women having seen him on the evening of the same 19th, but as the women seemed of rather doubtful reputation, the jury concluded to send John np, where he cm enjoy the companionship of his "pal,' Weatherly, under such healthy restrictions as the officers of the state calaboose may deem best. On Wednesday the case of the People vs. Hen ry Bourne, indicted for larceny and embezzle ment, was concluded very abruptly, at the con elusion of Dr. Stouts testimony. Stout had en trusted to tho care of Bourne a horse, which the atter traded off, the Dr. claiming that the de fendant had embezzled the proceeds, Ac, while the defendant alleged that all had been done with the Doctor's knowledge nd consent. The Doc tor's evidence sustaining this view, the prosecu tor abandoned the case, and the jury, under direc tion of the court, returned a verdict of not guilty. On Thursday morning, tho court took up the motion for a new trial in the Longworth case, which was argued, at length, by Mr. Stipp for the prisoner, and Judge Dickey for the people. The court overruled the motion, and the prison er, Wm. Longworth, was sentenced to the peni tentiary for three years, in accordance with the verdict of the jury. The present term of the court closes to-dsy. 

FROM UTICA. The citizens of Utica were favored with a fine vocal concert on Tuesday evening, Nov. 29th, at Tren tick's Flail, by Prof, Lansing and other tal ented gentlemen and lady vocalists from your oity. The evening was pleasant and a large and appreciative audience were in attendance. The Utica Brass Band having been invito J to attend the concert, played a few of their new and choice pieces. The duets by tbe Misses Lansings were very fine, and Miss Ackerman highly delighted the audience. Master James Lansing, jr., was good, and acquitted himself very nicely for one 60 young. And Prof. K. Frank Ford was im mense, especially in his Hallelujah Band. The concert was a decided success, and all wars thoroughly satisfied. Come again Mr. Lansing, with your troupe, and we will give you a nigger house than the last. State Teachers' Association.
