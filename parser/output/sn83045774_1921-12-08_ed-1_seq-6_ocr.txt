That the majority party in Congress ^ intends to take care of the soldiers at this session is a foregone conclusion, providing the ways and means can be found to raise the vast sum needed t for the purpose without seriously crippling industry. Leaders on both sides of Congress (; declare the situation as regards the bonus remains unsettled and undetermined. The course of action on that mooted question has not crystallized to :i point where it is possible to make a public announcement, is the way the loaders sized up the matter. .* The Demociats are making the most ?

For instance, RepreBentative Gallivan (Mass.) declared in the House that the latest plan of the Republicans is to pass the bonus bill V "* In June so that the first payment will be made to the soldiers on the eve of a the Congressional election.

Tt must be admitted that there is con1 derable unrest among some of the Republican members of the House over the ?lelay ever the bonus bill.

To support that view it was pointed ' out that in the last election a deter- j mined fight was made against Repre- 1 sentatlve Walsh (M&sa) for hie oppo-. sition to the bonus bill and he was re- [ turned to Congress by an increased majority. He went before the electorate and openly admitted his opposition to the bonus on the ground that such action then would almost bankrupt the country. Conditions may so shape themselves * in Congress that the Republicans may \ be forced to go before their constituents and defend their failure to provide funds for the soldiers. However, it Is hoped by Republican leaders that some such plan can be evolved out of the funding bill by which a part of the interest on the foreign debt can be diverted to the I relief of the soldiers, so that the flnan- j cial structure of this country would not | feel the strain. Make Retnru to Cancus. In response to the appeal made by j President Harding In his message to the j effect that the party In power should j assume full responsibility for legislation and determine upon n policy of sup- | plement campaign pledges, there is a strong likelihood that the Republican [ leaders In Congress will go back to the I old caucus system, which was discarded I some years ago, following the unhorsing j of Uncle Joe Cannon as Speaker. It will be recalled that In the days i when Cannon reigned supreme In the House caucuses were held frequently, and it was charged that action in the House on imp- f measures was morij or less perfu ry. Considerable opposition to that system developed and It waa made an Issue In political campaigns and reached its height In 1912, when the Progressives succeeded in splitting the Republican party wide open. To placate that opposition the Republican leaders abandoned the caucus and "conferences" were substituted at which were held free and full discussion of pending questions with no votes binding, j In the meantime the Democrats held to the caucus idea and have been able to keep their voters in line. On the other hand the Republicans have been going along of late years, it was pointed out by some of the leaders, like a ship without a rudder, which accounts to a great extent for the failure of the last session to redeem the party pledges and carry out the suggestions made by President Harding in his message calling the extra session. Furthermore, because of the lack of; the party caucus "blocs" have developed in both branches of Congress, which j have Indeed blocked the programme of the leaders and made it Impossible for tl.em to carry out their promises and enact important legislation. While President Harding In his appeal for team work uses the word conference lntsead of caucus, leaders are disposed to believe that he had In mind Ihe functions of the old time caucus and that such a system must be evolved In : Congress to expedite the important pro- ) gramme ahead and carry out the party , pledges. 

HARDING URGES BUREAU OF AIR NAVIGATION Washington, Dec. 7.?President Harding transmitted to Congress to-day the annual report of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics with the recommendation that a bureau for the regulation and development of air navigation be established In the Department of Commerce us proposed by the ci?nmittce. "I think there can be no doubt," the President stated In a message which accompanied the report, "that the development of aviation will become of great Importance for the purposes of commerce as well as national defence. Aviation Is destined to make great strides and X believe that America, its birthplace, can and should be foremost In its development. "I therefore urge upon the Congress the advisability of giving heed to the recommendations of the committee, the first and most important of which Is that a bureau be established in the Department of Commerce for the regulation and development of air navigation." | TfT?**?*?T^****t I r r^\ Lsrer leases e of Wood 21 files to these sturdy tion and accessibility, r 5300 sheets. y way desired.
