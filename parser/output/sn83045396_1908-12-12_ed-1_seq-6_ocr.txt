THE 

"BOOST UTAH" CONVENTION I The convention of delegates rcprc- seutiug commercial and industrial in ' stilutions, clubs, and boards, from tho 1 different portions of this State, which has just closed its first session in this city with eclat, is one that must effect important results for tho good or Utan. it starts on wen, anu wo aro especially pleased to soo the freedom with which the different topics aro dis cussed. There is an independent ex pression, a grasp of timely topics, and a disposition toward furthering the de velopment of the State, that promise well for the career of the Utah De velopment League, as launched. Not only was there an excellent repre sentation of localities in- the two score or more dolegatcs present, but tliore is a worthy representation also in tho variety of interests represented. Tho report of the session says that "every industry and walk of life, aud labor organizations in their vonous depart ments are fully recognized." i Unanimity on the main purpose of tho organization, as manifested in the proceedings of the session, is entirely commendable. But unanimity of opinion in reaching the best results, especially a unanimity that would hamper or crnsh out independence of j thinking and expression, is precisely ' the opposite of what should prevail in such a convention. There must neoc-s-sarilybo in the minds of thinking men differences of views, differences of methods, aud differences as to molhods of approachiug the subjects to be dis cussed or plans to be formulated and carried out. Right there is where di vergence is aiways to bo commended and whero the best results arc io be expected from free discussion. If all were to be cut and dried, if there wore to be no expressions of op posing viows, no criticism, no inde pendence of spirit or mind to bo de veloped, then indeed there would be but small hope of I he best results from such a convention. But tho con vention voiy wisely avoided any dis position to run overj'thing' into any one's particular mould, or in any way to hamper the freedom of those taking part in the proceedings. But discursive political gabble, such as was intruded somewhat in yesterday's proceedings, should be kept out. In this full, free business and eco nomic discussiou is wisdom, and through this will be reached the best possible re sults. When those results are reached it should be the effort and determina tion of all to work unrosorvedly and with the utmost enorgy for tho success of the plans formulated. To that end wo trust that the Development League will from time to time in its acts .reach definite purposes aud declare aims and plans that will give the people of the State at large some 'thing to think about and to work upon. The Loaguc is getting on splendidly, and wc trust that all of its de liberations may be attended with the same" earnest spirit of progress, of in dependence, and of devotion to the interests of Utah as a wholo that has in the main so far characterized the ses- TARIFF REVISION THOROUGH. ' Wc judge from the dispatches that President-elect Taft has reached a common grouud with Speaker Cau "iion as to the scope and ex tent of the proposed tariff re vision. It appears further that there is to be no limit on that scope nor any restriction on the thoroughness with whiph tho tariff schedules will all be gone into. The hearing before the Ways and Means Committee of the House indicate the same thing. There is perfect freedom and a wholesale in vitation to all who have anything to offer to the committee to come for ward and make it kuowu, present facts. figures, market fluctuations, tendencies of trade and transportation, :inrl. in fnftt.. nvivfiliinn i-Vin u . , - .... u 

VIUIU have any real bearing upon the tariff question. Yesterday morning's dispatches gave further reassurance to the coup try that there would be an extra ses sion of Congress called immediately after March" -1th. and that the tariff question would be the business of Cou gross when so assembled- in extra ses sion. The dispatch treating of this indicated that this extra session might last through the summer. While it is true that the tariff question is a very complicated one, and that every detail of thu different schedules requires cau tious and contiderato attention, it would seem that there need uot be such a long session as that in order to reach proper results. The extra session which gave rho Dinglcy tariff law to the country convened on March 15, IS07. and by the 2-itb of July the complete rovifiou of 'the tariff law had been effected. Wo 'should think, taking into consideration tho hearings-of tho Ways aud, Means- Committee and the large discussions that havo been had on tho tariff question, that tho work of present revision could be shortened instead of needing to be enlarged, as compared with the revision of eleven years ago. Still, of course, whatever time is necessary to make a law that will be satisfactory will undoubtedly be taken. And this is to be said about it, that the present Congress will enter upon consideration of this ques tion at its extra session next March, 1 with fuller information and more de tailed presentations of facts to go upon . than any other Congress has ever had at. the beginning of any former tariff, revision. '. ... 'We' take it that the fundamental idea of protection will be kept in mind ' throughout in this tariff revision, but we trust that it will not bo conceded that every manufacturer in this coun try necessarily needs protection in his business. There eurely should bo by this time an illustration of the perfect work of protection in tbo establishment in tho United States of -arious forms of manufacture that would now ueed uo protection at all. Mr. Caruogie showed pretty conclusively, in his re cent Century articlo, that the manu facturers of steel in tho United States ueed uo protection. They can pro duce steel choapor than steel can be produced anj'whcro else in the world, and they arc now producing it in greater quantities and at less cost than has ever bcon dono in any ono country or in any other throe countries " iu the history of the world. It would appear, therefore, that .steel and most of the manufactures of steel need no protection. In tho matter of the products of wood, it would bo a help to tho reforestation proposition to admit woods in the crude form of logs, and perhaps somo forms of lumber, with out any duty. If logs from Canada could be brought into this country free of tariff, tve would immediately begin . iu uuuuuu iuu vjanauian loresis in piacc of our own. And surely no objection able results would follow to Canada through the denudation of .her forests, but rather bene ficial. And still it is quito proper and consistent for the Ropublican party to keep in view in the revision of the . tariff the paramount idea of pro tection; but care should bo taken to see that protection is uceded in fact, and is not a mere holhouso clamor for the retention of something that is no louger needed. And in going through the whole of the schedule with these two ideas in mind, fff retaining pro tection whore it is needed and taking it off where there is no longor need of it, Congress will have a busy lime of it, and its results should bring great relief to the country and should stimu late its manufactures in a wa3- under the new tariff that no provious tariff has ever been ablo to excel. 

CONGRESSIONAL RESENTMENT. It was uot iu the least surprising to rend in the dispatches j-cstorday morn ing that both tho Senate aud tho House of Representatives arc up in resentment against that portion of President Roosevelt's message that deals with the ''Secret Service." The language used 1)3' the President in treating of that subject was decidedly castigating, and did not refrain from casting imputa tions upon both Housos of Congress and upou the motives of tho Congressmen who had passed the measure of which the President makes- complaint. It appears that tho President's ob jection is to an amendment .incorporated Secret Service. This was to the effect that no detail should bo made from the Secret Sorvico and no transfer made therefrom. The President charac terizes this euuetment as of benefit only, and possible of benefit only, to the criminal classes. And he imputes a deliborato intent to this cud by tho friends of tho amendment, lie says, "If deliberately introduced for the pur pose of diminisning Iho effectu-oness of war ;i gainst criniu, it could uot havo been better devised to this end." He urates that thr jiniclico thus forbi-ldcn h?s been followed by tho ciecutivo heads of tho varolii; departments for twcr.t3" yoars, and he claims Ih.'.t: to th custom so followed "wo. owe fho secur ing of the ovvideucc which enable.! us to drive great lotteries out of busi ness' to "discover aomo of tho most outrageous frauds in connection with the theft of Government land and Gov ernment timber 1,3 great corporations and by individuals," and that tho cus tom thus put an eud to "enabled us to get somo of the evidence indispen sable in order to secure tho conviction of iho wealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the Government has to deal." Tho President repeats that the amendment was "of benefit to no ono excepting to these criminals, ' and it scriouslj' hampers the Government in tho detection of crime and the secur ing of justice. And he proceeds to make it lit on-members of Congress by saj-ing thnt the chief argument iu "favor of tho change was that the Congressmen did uot themselves wish to bo investigated b3' Secret Sorvico mou. And ho cites as presumptive evidence of this fear and in apparent implication that such investigation would result in tho cou victiou of a number of the members of Congress, tho fact that "tho work of tho Secret Service .agents was partly responsible for the indictment aud con viction of a Senator and a. CoiiTessmun of land frauds in Orocon. " Thismnhos it tit very closely upon the mombors of Congress. It is a direct charge, first of nil, that Congress has passed au act which was of so much . benefit to tho criminal classes that if dosigned for their protection it could uot havo been more so. And while stating of fensive' tho proposition that the law was passed because the Congressmen did not wish themselves to be investi gated, illustrating tho fact V- the prose cution and conviction of members cf Congress from 'Oregon, tho President mado it as offcusivo as it wall could bo as against the members who voted for that amendment. Apparently the President considers such members undosirnblo Congress men, and possibly ns undesirable citi zens. But if ho had deliberate- and designedly hatched up somo means whereby the repeal of that (to him) i obuoxious ainondment, could be made impossible, he could not havo pursued i that object with, more cortainty of re sult' than" he has done. 4 In thus pro scut ing the case in his message, no Congressman can now vote for tho re peal of that amendment without delib erately confessing that he was lnsh'iO thereto b3r the vituperation of tuc President, and at the samo time con fessing that his vote in passing that amendment last j-car was directly 'n (ho interest of the criminal classes, aud to protect himself from investigation. And so wo do not expect to see that amendment repealed at this session. Probabl there was good reason for adopting it at the timo it was adopted, and that roasou will bo sufficient still, to keep it on tho statute-book. A 

PLAIN CASE. The church organ Inst night con- I tinned its discussion of the " red-light .district" in its usual st3-lc of hardened falsehood and rascality. It misreprc- j cents, evades, and baldly falsifies con- stnutlj-, aud is the most conspicuous j examplo we know of among church organs of willful and deliberate do pravitj'. Wo call- tho attention of the church organ specifically to a conspicuous in stance of its slaudor and lying. On Thursday evening' it statod editorially that, "'the American organ." meaning Tho Tribune, had not adversoly crit icized tho dreadful proposition of Chief of Police Pitt till later, meaning un questionably that we had not promptly condemned that proposition when it appcarod. But wc showed that the Pitt proposition was made public on tho 31st of January last, that wo knew notaing about it till it was made public, and that we promptly, sovercl3 and un qualifiedly condemned it tho same day, our criticism of it being at length and appearing in The Tribune of the morn ing of January 22nd, tho morning after tho Pitt report appeared. Wo called upon tho "Sows to retract its charge; but it refuses to do so. It is therefore, pilloried as an unscru pulous, willful liar, a paper not deserv ing of the least consideration by the public, a character assassin, and an in famous traitor to society, to morals, and to common deconcj. THE "ADAM-GOD" INSANITY- Dispatches from Kansas City, Mis souri, during tho woek havo contained accounts of a sanguine encounter be tween the police there and a man named Johu Sharp, who styled himself the "Adam-God." and who had sur rounded himself with a small number of followers. And in the profession of this fanatic there is material for a lit tlo comparison. The Tribune, of course, does not. know how tho man Sharp got hold of his sillj' doctrine whether ho has bor rowed it or whether it was the product of his disordered mind. But we do know that he is iiot the first to preach the nonsense. Let us make a reference: Now hear it, O Inhabitants' or tno earui, Jew. Gentile, saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came Into It with a celestial body, and brought. Eve, ono of his wives, with him. Uo helped to make and organ ize this world. He Is Michael, the arch angel, the Ancient of Days! about whom holy men have written and spoken he is our Father and our God, and the only God with whom wo have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing- Christians or non-profesBlngs must hear it, and will know It sooner or later. From a sermon by President Brlgham Young In the Salt Lake tabernacle. April 0, 1S52; Journal of Discourses, volume 1, page 50. It appears that Sharp has varied this doctriuc somewhat, in that ho himself claim? to be tlfe "Adam-God," aud that his wife is tho "God-Mothor" Eve. But the essential part of the teaching remains the same that Adam is the God of this world, and really the being whom Christians should wor ship. The effect of the .theory advocalod 1)3' tho fanatical Sharp is identical with tho Mormon doctrine in another respect that thcro aro more gods than ono, sotting aside Biblo teaching iu this re gard. And when we come to cxainiuo the presentations, of Mormon loaders a little moro closely, wo do not kuow that Ihorc exists evon the minor disa greement to which wo have called at tention. While Sharp claims himself to be tho "Adam-God" in persou, the veiled utterances of Mormon pulpiteors have sometimes contained intimations to a similar, effect in behalf of their own leadership. i"or instance: If you find out who Joseph was. you will know as much about God ns you need to at. present; for if Uo said. "I am a God to this people." IIo did not say that He was the only wjzo God. fN'otlee the cnpllul'za tlon of "IIo" as It appears In the original lexU" 'a a 4 S ti If T can pass Brother Joseph, I shall stand good chance for passing Peter, Jesus, tno prophets, Moses, Abraham, and all back to Father Adam, and be pretty sure of receiving his approbation. If I can pass, all this ordeal, Ehall 1 not be pret ty safe? I think I shall. From a sermon by President Brlgham Young, delivered In Great Salt Lake City. March S, 1S5T; Journal of Discourses, volume 4, page 271. In the foregoing matter is a rather nlain fliippnstinn Mint the salvation of tho Mormon people, and tho achieve ment of proper reward in heaven, can como to them onky through the Mor mon prophet. In other words, "In- mo is salvation," and without intercession on the port of tho founder of Mor mouism humanity must take hell and damnation for its portion. The effect of such teaching is to give to the prophet the attribute of a pod one to be worshipped because one through whom all reward mn3' be gained 03' peo ple in this particular dispensation. So 1 it maj' be that Sharp has been a stu- j 1 dent of the doctrines set forth by the Brighamitc branch of the Mormon church, inasmuch as ho aoears to havo ' presented nothing new. If so, the cur- j J rent news of tho day with respect to 1 his notions aud their results would 1 seem to reflect no credit unon tho teach- ! ing bo imitates, nor upon the origi nators of that teaching. Another thing that makes for proof of similarity between Monnonism and Sharpism' is tho fact that this later fanatic imagined it to be nccessar3 to arm himself in order to protect his the ory and its proponent from physical attack by ungodly unbelievers. At tho time tllis "Adam-God" dortrino was first promulgated hero in Utah tho Mormon organization was tho church militant high priests were going about armed to tho tcoth. The prophet him self was never without the dare and tho threat in his mouth ho was always ready to unsheath his bowio and go forth to slay in behalf of tho Almighty. Sharp is but a mcro imitator, oven in this respect, because ho was not onby armed but fought like the fanatic thnt he is, with unfortunate' fatal results to innocent and deluded followers. And hero, again, the historj' of Monnonism is repeated, for it has always been the befooled beliovor that hns been com pelled to suffer anv serious couse quences that l'ollowod the immoral and blasphemous raids made 1)3' the leaders upon Christian soutimcnt. When all the facts aro taken into con sideration it seoms plain thnt the Utah Mormon has little reason to laugh aB otherwise- derido this man Sharp. yvr' sides, an honest comparison bctTrf s;y their own attitude and his should- flf.'
