GEIND AGAIN BEGINS. CONGRESS AGAIN GETS TO GETHER. Indications that tlio Session Will Be a • Business One The Regular ltoutlno of Oponlne Both Houses Important Measures Itrndy for Action and to Comu Up Karly. Assembling ? of Concrrrss. WASHINGTON , Dec. G. The reg ular or long session of congress , as It is called , because there is no constitu tional limitation upon the period of its duration , opens at noon today. The leaders and , a large majority of the members of both houses are here to participate in the opening ceremonies , , and President McKinley has made the journey to Washington from the bedside of his dying mother that his absence might not delay the national legislature at its assembling. The extra session robs opening of regular session of the excitement and interest which usually attach to it. On the eve'of a regular session , ordinarily , Washington thrills with excitement. The hotel lobbies surge with place hunters for the places of speaker , doorkeeper , clerk , etc. , members strug gling for committee places and the air is full of rumors of plots and counterplots. But as the house was completely organized at the extra ses sion and all the committee assign ments were made then , beyond the natural stimulus produced by the re turning statesmen , the regular hang ers-on of legislation and the outlining of schemes by members of the "third house" or lobby , Washington tonight is tranauil. The program of the house today is very simple , and beyond the spectac ular show which it offers to the curi ous has in itself little attraction. The house will be called to order by the speaker , who , after the chaplain's in vocation , will direct the clerk to call • the roll. This having been accom plished and the presence of a quorum demonstrated , the clerk will be di rected to notify the senate that the house is ready for business and a committee will be appointed to wait on the president. After that there will be a recess to await the arrival of the president's annual message , which will be read on its reception and be followed by an adjournment until Tuesday. This is the routine and un less something unforseen occurs will not be departed from. It is the intention of the house lead ers to proceed with the business of the session as rapidly as possible. The committees will all begin their labors this week and as all of them have more or less bills on hand which were introduced at the extra session there will be no lack of material for the house to operate on. The ap propriations committee has been at work for ten days and Chairman Can non expects to pass at least two of the regular budgets before the holidays the legislative , executive and judicial and the pensions appropriation bills. One or two other of these bilis. it is expected , will be reported by Wednes day , and the end of the week promises - , ises to see the house down to busi- | ness. I Among the early general measures | to receive consideration will be the bankruptcy bill. Whether it will be I the Nelson bill , which passed the senate - | ate at the last session , or a modification - | . tion of the Torrey bill , depends on the temper of the judiciary committee , , which will submit the measure to the [ house. Beyond doubt there will be several resolutions of inquiry during the first week , which may be more or less sen sational , and some of the more radical pro-Cuba members will attempt to get consideration for a Cuban resolution before the foreign affairs committee can act. Congressman Livingston of Georgia is one of these. But. owing to the nature of the house rules , all of these hasty efforts will prove abor tive and they probably will take their course. There will be nothing except indis position on the partof members to pre vent the senate's entering promptly upon its work upon convening tomor row , as there is a calendar already made for it with about 300 bills re ported from committees during the special session. In Memory of Henry forge. . CjtxICAGO , Nov. 6. Exercises in the memory of the late Henry George were held in the Auditorium this afternoon under the auspices of the Chicago Sin gle Tax Club.

RALEIGH , N. C , Dec. G. rThe dem ocratic state committee in session here today issued an address to the voters of the state , declaring that the democratic party is the party of the people , reaffirming the Chicago and state paltforms of last year , declaring that William Jennings Bryan is the great leader of the party , denouncing republican misrule and inviting all populists to unite with the democrats in regaining control of the state. The sentiment that the democrats must make a straight fight and that there must be no fusion was overwhelming. AS TO CUBA. Independence to Co mo In the Course of KvmitH. WASHNGTON. Dec. 6. Mr. Berk ! eley Balch , secretary of the Cuban league , appeared today before Presi dent McKinley and presented a long argument in behalf of the Cuban in surgents , in which he submits the fol lowing propositions for the president's consideration , who promised to give it his careful attention : The three wars In Cuba within this century are proof of a genuine move ment for the extension of democratic principles and the attainment of lib erty from a tyrannical , corrupt and alien government. Autonomy is.a foolish dream. It is evident that neither side understands it , wishes it , or can administer It. Spain clearly offers It to amuse this government and to gain time. A majority of the people of this country desire to see a free and inde pendent Cuban republic. An opposing factor of greatforceis the money pow er. It Is a fair conclusion to urge that a majority of our people believe that the assistance of our government till now has been given to Spain and withheld from the republic on ac count of the influence that emanated from great financial interests , usually afraid of patriotic aggressive move ments. Our people have hoped for favor able action for Cuba from the present administration and have patiently waited to give the administration time for consideration of the wise road to this end. That patience is now exhausted. Very few Cubans and still fewer people in this country desire immed iate annexation , but independence is clearly due to Cuba valor and sacri fices. The friendship of the republic of Cuba is worth vastly more to us than that of Spain , for reasons of business and defense. It is our duty and self- interest to recognize the belligerency , and logically follow this , the inde pendence of the republic , and to con clude with a defensive and offensive alliance. If this is not compatible .with a continued friendship with Spain , so much the worse for Spain. If Spain attacks us we can take care of our own. .Mrs. McKinley Still Alive. 

CANTON , O. , Dec. 6 Mother Mc Kinley passed the fourth day of her illness and entered upon the fourth night with the spark of life burning dimly. There has not been a material development in her case today. There is still a possibility that she may survive the night of even longer , but those who have been at the bed side most constantly have the least hope of such a result. The patient has taken no nourish ment since Thursday. It cannot be administered by ordinary methods , and the case is on in which heroic methods of administering food are not regarded as justifiable. They could not restore health , and would be dis tressing and annoying and might hasten the end. WASHINGTON , Dec. G. President McKinley , accompanied by Assistant Secretary Day , arrived in Washington over the Pennsylvania railroad at 7:45 o'clock yesterday morning. He was met at the station by Secretary Alger , Secretary Bliss and Secretary Porter , and driven to the White house. Arrangements have been made for fhp roturp trip in Canfon ihis evening.

WASHINGTON , D. C. Dec. G. From the best obtainable information it ap pears that no change is to be made in the composition of the cabinet during the remainder of the current year. There are two eood deasens for this. Attorney General McKenna has charg ed himself with the prosecution of the Pacific railroad cases , and it is not to be sumiosed that he will relinquish his present office until the Kansas Pacific sale has pnssert into history. It is generally understood that Gov ernor Griggs of New Jersey has been offered the place in the cabinet to be vacated by Attorney General McKenna. but it will not be possible for him to take the office before the bezinninz of next year. pf.nl < Jp < J < ! ion Illinois T.esl latnr . .
