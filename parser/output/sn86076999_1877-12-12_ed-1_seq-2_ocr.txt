MORNING APPEAL. WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 12. 1877 THE GREAT RUSSIAN VICTORY. In yesterday's dispatches we find the fol lowing : Bucharest, Dec. 10. After a severe enage nient yesterday before Plevna, Osman Pasha, who was wounded, surrendered uncondition ally. The Turks in Plevna were dying of hunger and cold. There is great joy here. Bucharest is covered with flags. Plevna is now in the hands of the Russo-Roumanian armies. The Agence-Russe makes the follow ing announcement : "Osman Pasha attempted to break through in the direction of Widin. He was attacked in front and rear and was compelled to lay down his arms after a glori ous struggle, in which lie was seriously wounded. All with one voice praise his conduct. This cumes toward the realization of the long, long dream of the Muscovite. He seems near his inheritance. Inheritance? In the long night which has brooded over the Greek Church since the City of Constantine fell into the hands of the Saracen, have not the custo dians of the Christian faith longed for the res toration ? The Turk is to Europe what the American savage is at the United States, His occupancy of Constantinople is as incon gruous a tiling as would be the occupancy of Xew York by the Sioux or the Nez Perces. Think of Red Cloud at the mouth of the Hud . son, or Joseph a recognized ruler at Xew Or leans '. One is reminded of the old French war and the other wars which lay along our bor der with a wily European foe to furnish , a ,. ... ... arms ana information to tne rea skins. H.111;- land, in some bitter day3, did this office. The murdering and scalping of settlers, the blaze of burning cabins and the shrieks of ravished women and brain-battered children told only too well what were the qualities of Saxon cun ning and greed and cruelty. Somebody with a warning voice wrote, a few years since, a story called 'The Battle of Dorking." It was at once a prophecy and a check. It was a wise supplement to the Crimean War. Brit ain had winked at Louis Napoleon's bloody boulevards ; but Kinglake, like another seer dealing with a new Loehiel or a later proph etess upon the blasted heath, told but too truly the story of that butchery. Since then England has seen her unnatural ally once her subject and once her dictator crushed by the iron hand of that power which stalks through the nightmare of the aforesaid Battle of Dorking, and the Uhlan shakes his hand across the German Ocean in direful threaten ing. There is some hearty recollection in the Court of Berlin of the stout days when Peter the stalwart, the amorous, the rude, was ad mired of the Potsdam Giants and their Com mander. Indeed, since the days of Alarick and Attila the Teutons have had an alarming weakness for Trans-alpine raids. They have sought the Southern sea ; they have hun gered for that dominion which seems the heir of strength and courage. Russia is the com ing power. Prussia cannot afford to be the false friend of this tremendous giant. The "tiwht little isle'' finds itself in a dilemma which is all the worse for the inconsistencies of its professions. To be sure the Greek Church is even farther away from the Angli can establishment than the Mother herself ; but Christianity is, or ought to be, the em bodiment of better stuff to-day than it was when Richard smote the Infidel. The Turk murders and ravishes and sells into slavery and all in the name of the False? Prophet. He flies the flag of Mohammed and flaunts it in the face of the orifiamme of Oriental Chris tianiiy. Say what Mr. Disraeli will, the . watchword on his side of this fight is Allah, il Allah! Our Parent Country has not been either consistent or humane, in all his deal ings. His attitude toward the Union was but feebly atoned for by her fifteen millions of dollars. The Trent and Maximillian, Louis Napoleon and the hard hearted House of Hapsbunr, these are to be reckoned in the j count. The Morxixg Appeal hopes that the stalwart Northern will mow his way to the Mediteranean and sweep out of existence the foul blot, which, with bowstring and basti nado, with dogs and vermin, with lechery and murder, obstructs the march of civilization aud "snarleth in the gentle eyes of Teace." THE FALL OF PLEVNA. OSMAN PASHA AND HIS ARMY PRISONERS. Bozot, Dec. 11. At 9:30 Sunday morning Osman Pasha's entire army attacked the Russian granadier corps holding the line of investment on the left bank of the river Vid endeavoring to force a passage. The attack was made with desperate energy, and a por tion 01 tne x urmsn troops aid m tact pene trate the line of entrenchments and batteries, but all attempts to break through the position grenadiers was inaffectual. After five hours' severe fighting the Turks were defeated. osman irasna, surrounuea on all sides, was compelled to surrender with his whole army, Up to the presnt time it is impossible to esti mate the number of Turkish prisoners or the quantity of war material taken. We only know that everything in Plevna has fallen into our hands. The Russian leases are in considerable compared with the result ob tained. Bucharest, Dec. 10. After a severe engage meiit before Plevna yesterday, Osman Pasha, who was woundod, surrendered uncondition aliy. Ihe Turks in Plevna are dying 0f hunger and cold. There is great joy here. Bucharest is covered with flags. Plevna is now in the hands of the Russo-Roumanian armies. The Agence-Russe makes the following an nonncement: "Osman Pasha attempted to break through in the direction of Widin. He was attacked front and rear and was com pelled to lay down his arms after a glorious struggle, in which he was seriously wounded. " A'l wiih one voice praise his conduct. St. Petersburg, Dec. 11. The news of the fall of Plevna occasions great rejoicing here. The theaters are celebrating the victory by additions to the usual programmes. Enthusi astic popular demonstration in honor of the Imperial family and the army are made in the streets and public p'aces, where great crowds are assembled cheering and singing the na tiona1 anthem. The city is partially illumin- aeii. London, December 11. This day will wit ness scenes of the wildest excitement in Lon don. All the morning papers print a dis patch from Bucharest, dated at 9 o'clock last night, declaring that Osman Pasha surren dered Plevna on Sunday, and that all the Turkish fortifications are in possession of the Russians and Roumanian armies. All the pent up anxiety and hope of the friends of Turkey in England will come to an end to day. A cruel and crushing blow has been dealt to blatant paneg3-rist who have for month past been telling of the prowess of the Turkish troops. Osman w ill cease to be a hero, although the reports from official Rus sian sources speak of his courage in the hour of defeat. Still he has failed, and the Tmk -philes of England will never forgive him. The following strange item in relation to the examination of the murderer, Pierce, i.-. from the Silver State of Saturday: The preliminary examination of W. II. Pierce for the murder of M. B. Hayes w as concluded last Thursday, and the case was taken under advisement by the grave Justice, who will decide whether or not he should be Jield. Thk Rei Foxes at Washjxc.tox. On the 2d of December, in Washington, Secretary Schurz was disagreeably surprised by the un announced apparition of a delegation of Fox Indians a tribe never very welcome at the Interior Department, which is sufficiently human not to patiently brook the presence of people it has in times past grievously injured Mr. Schurz was sufficiently curious to ask these Foxes why they had come to Washing ton, and was immediately snubbed by being told that they had nothing to say to him about it, but would inform the Great Father. The Secretary sharply responded that they must pay their own expenses, to which the red men rejoined that they had paid their railroad fare from the reservation, and felt able to settle their hotel bills. The story of the Sacs and Foxes, says the N. Y. Sun, car ries us back about half a century to the days of Black Hawk, and the bloody war he fought with the whites. After this famous warrior had been subdued, and shown around as a captive in Eastern cities, he was succeeded in authority by Keokuk, who was followed by another chief of the same name, quite famous for his faithful and friendly disposition during more than twenty years. The united tribes of the Sacs and Foxes were moved further and further West, with the advances of civil ization, first being placed just beyond the Mississippi, and then far out in Kansas. The invested proceeds of the sales of their easterly lands netted the two tribes an annual income of about 850,000, which, of course, proved an enormous attraction to the Government agents and traders, who so managed that for a long time a great portion of it went into their own pockets. As the constant "civili zation of these Indians m reservation lite and the healthfuj arts of agriculture, in addi tion to war and pestilence, had reduced their numbers greatly, so that from numbering over ten thousand before contact with the whites thev became fewer than a thousand, the annual income gave each quite a sum to ex pend, and as we have seen makes their chiefs very self-sustaining in the matter of hotel bills. Precisely what grievance has brought them to Washingtoiais not yet clear; but, despite the unaccountable failure of Mr. Schurz to inspire them with instant confidence on showing them his face, it has been learned that these Foxes complain of wrongs done them since the sale of their Kansas lands and the retaining of the proceeds. If any doubt exists as to the fate deserved by the Old Doctor Jacob Townsend of the Sazerackers the following will dispel it: A lady was pushing a baby perampulator along the sidewalk on Main street this morning, when one of the wheels struck a piece of four thousand dollar ruby ore, which some care less person had dropped on the walk, and the vehicle was instantly upset and its infantile contents unceremoniously dumped out on the sidewalk. A gentleman standing by observed the disaster, and with the true gallantry of his sex, rushed to the rescue, and as he right ed the carriage and felt the baby to see how many of its bones were broken, he said to the lady: "Madame, why is this catastrophe like one of the important towns involved in the present bloody and disastrous war now being waged by the Russian Bear against the Sick Man of the East ?" She said she gave it up, and wondered if the baby was hurt much. "Because," said he, "it is a Tirnova." In her own mind the lady found excuse tor him on the ground that he must have been drinking- In New York, as well as in our own city, the selection of Mi-. Welsh for he English mission is highly approved on all grounds. Journal of Commerce. Especially on the ground of Mr. Welsh's extraordinary wisdom and his miraculous ability to conduct diplomatic affairs, as illus trated in his semi-idiotic speech in Philadel phia, and the general kissing scene which pre ceded his departure. A less unanimous reason for admiration over his appointment is found in the fact that at one time Mr. Welsh was a joint owner of the Purlo sugar estaLe in Cuba with 138 slaves; so that he is either a slaveholder now, or, if he has disposed of his estate, as has been claimed, he is a slave seller. This is not regarded by everybody as consti tuting so clear a title to be Minister to Eng land as the fact that he is afflicted with the en;tremest silliness of egotism and vanity, and has not sense enough to conceal it. N. Y. Sua. Pres-pent Hayes in Favor ok Woman's St ffkaoe. On the 3d of the present month, as we learn from a dispatch in the N. Y. Sun, Mrs. J. Spencer and Mrs. Sargent, fe of the Senator, had an interview with the President. They asked him to recom mend in his annual message legislation by which women should be recognized in for eign as well as domestic appointments. Also, that he recommend an amendment to the constitution to secure women's sufferage in the States. The President replied that at a future time he might state, in writing, his views on the subject, but would now say that if Congress should recommend for adoption by the States such amendment to the Consti tution it would meet with his approval.
