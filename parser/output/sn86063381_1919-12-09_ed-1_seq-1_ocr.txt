Croon Sends Regards. Alderman Croon was reported ser oiisly ill at his home, and Mayor Johnson reported the fact, stating -that the Fourth ward representative askede him to his wishes th councilconvey and that hwell regretted he was unable to meet with them in the new city building. The council voted to have the mayor purchase a large boquet in recognition of the greeting sent from the sick bed of their collegue^ Queen Esther Tree. The proposition of holding the cus tomary Christmas tree by the Queen Esthers also came up in the council, and it was decided that, the annual -custom should be observed again this year. A resolution was ordered drawn that the city would pay the expense incurred as it has done here tofore. George H. Nettleton, state fire mar -shal in a communication, asked that iFire Chief Dailey be recommended for a deputy state fire marshal, and as "he desired to appoint him to that position. This will be done. Miss Mae McGregor, Red Cross county nurse, asked the council per -mission to have a desk in the rest room of the city building, and the request was gladly granted. Mitrht Work Here. Chief alley, of the fire depart ment, made a report of the number of of fires during* the past cold month, and there were only four. "Three were chimney fires and one was of unknown origin. It was then recalled that in other cities, when householders neglect to clean the soot from their chimneys in the fall, and they ignite, it costs the city taxpayers the expense of the call of the fire department and the -neglectful offender has to- stand the -expense. It was suggested that would be a good thing for Bemidji. A brief water report contained the delinquent sum of $151.40 on the part of consumers, for 1919. Resignation Recalled. The council was greatlj gratified when it was informed that City En gineer Bourgeois had withdrawn his resignation from the city's employ, but there was a proviso, that he need ed help, which, if forthcoming, he would remain in the capacity of city engineer. iMr. Bourgeois is one of the best constructing engineers in this part of the state and when he was engaged, Bemidji breathed easier, in view of the large amount of engineering planned by the city. But when the burden of also being the superintend ent of the water works, with its de tail and attendant additional duties, he was unable to take proper care oT tov BEMIDJI CLARK & SON PURCHASE DURAND STORE.

Since his release from Leaven- U. U. District Attorney Comments On Release "I have always thought there must have been some mistake to bring about Broms' release," said United States District Attorney Alfred Jaques, in commenting on the case. "Broms was one of the most flagrant offenders we had to deal with during the war and when he finally was sentenced to Leavenworth for refusal to obey orders, we were glad to see the case disposed of. ..his office was never consulted in regard to Broms' release and would not have favored it." worth Broms has returned to his home in fat. Paul, has been elected state secretary of the Communist party and has redoubled his efforts against the government. He has been the object of attacks by former serv ice men who objected to his soap box oratory. Secretary Baker has given no ex planation of his attitude except that he has repeatedly halted attempts to have Broms serve out the remainder of *his sentence by issuing directions that no further action be taken as "the prisoner is in legal possession of i discharge certificate and has been Broms, before his confinement in the Leavenworth prison for preaching Bolshevism, was a frequenter in sec tions of Beltrami county. He preached his disloyalty to the govern ment continuously, and when it was learned he had been put where he could no longer fling broadcast his nefarious doctrines, there was gen eral satisfaction on the part of the patriots in this vicinity. But Baker pulled a "bone head" stunt, just like many others have done for the ad ministration, and turned the red lose in Minnesota to attack the gov ernment of which Baker is. secretary of war, STA LABOR OFFICIAL SPEAKER AT LUNCHEON A feature of the luncheon of the Bemidji association tomorrow noon at the association quarters will be. the presence of George W.

HEARINGS ARE CONTINUED. By J. L. O'Sullivan. (United Press Correspondent.) Indianapolis, Dec. 9.Hearing on the charges of contempt of court against leaders of the United Mine Workers was con- tinued today until next Tuesday in view of the prospective ending of the coaj strike. The federal grand jury's investigation of information charging violation of the Lever act by mine workers and oper- ators, postponed yesterday, was continued until December 17. the confident expectation of many mine worker leaders. Although only the highest officials were acquainted with the tArmB of President Wilson's proposal, thfe min ers took the position that "what's good) enough for Lewis and Green is good enough for us." Contents of the proposal were carefully guarded and kept secret un til the conference opened at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Unofficial intima tions here, however, led to the belief that the proposal provides for the miners to return to work at once on a wage increase of 14 per cent, and the appointment of a commission to investigate the entire coal indiustry and report within the specified time, regarding wages", hours of work and conditions of miners, and also to in vestigate reported huge profits of the mine operators. Charges of contempt of court against ninety-seven officials of the mine workers, scheduled' to be heard today, were postponed.

LEADERS HOLDMEETING TOMORROW AT WASHINGTON Committeemen to Gather and 3elet City for National Convention i ST. LOUIS, AND ALSO CHICAGO SEEK MEETING San Francisco Considered Too Far From Center Gophers Favor Chicago 4 (By United Press.) Washington, Dec. 9.Members of the executive committee of the re publican national committee began arriving here today in preparation for the meeting tomorrow to pick a city in which to hold the 1920 repub lican national convention, where a candidate for president of .the United States will be chosen. Chariman Will H. Hayes was among the first to arrive. Many con ferences were being arranged for tonight and early tomorrow. In ad dition to the committeemen, there were already on the ground a dozen or more delegations here to urge the selection of their city as the conven tion .meeting place. Prominent among them were civic and political leaders from Chicago and St. Louis, where Charles E. Hughes and Presi dent Wilson were respectively named in 1916. There was considerable talk among politicians of selecting Chicago as the permanent convention city for the republican party. Mid-western headquarters have recently been op ened in that city, it was pointed out, and many have for years urged that the city be chosen as regular battle ground for candidates for nomina tion, and for the additional reason of its central location. Chicago Again Favored. Chicago has had the convention every four years with on exception, since 1896, and it would seem the balance of favor is in that direction. Chicago claims to be about the moat centrally located city, whose audi torium is known to be large enough, for the party, and claims that it is the railroad center of the nation. The point of accessability by rail road is one of the prime factors, com mitteemen say. Asbury Park, a new factor in the competition, lands the desirability of its "cooling breezes to sooth the fev ered brows of heated arguefiers." Asbury has a fair sized auditorium, and claims that her hotel accommoda tions are of the best. However, committeemen declare geographical location is one of the prime necessities, and any coast city is at a great disadvantage. St. Louis Boosting. St. Louisans headed by Paul V. Bunn, secretary of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, however, in sists that the Mound City be select- continued on Page Bight) "fill &fe .-f^.-oN
