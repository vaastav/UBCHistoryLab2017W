The State Journal !s a member of the Associated Press and receives the full day telegraph report of that great news or ganisation for the exclusive afternoon publication tn Topeka. The news Is received In The Btate Jour nal building over wires for th' sole pur pose. Natural gas would be a grand thing In a climate that la an titter stranger to wintry b tests. ' The Milwaukee Sentinel wants to know If the joy ride can be classed as race suicide. Sure. It la possible to say what you please these days un less you talk like Mr. Qompera. King Leopold of Belgium has re cently suffered some severe paralytic strokes. Perhaps this Is a little of the retributive Justice due him for some of the Congo atrocities for . which he has been responsible. Kate Barnard, the Oklahoma chari ties official, who tried to prove that the Inmates in the Kansas penitentiary were being cruelly treated, must be credited with being on the right track for once. She declares that wife de sertion Is the "meanest of crimes." Butte. Montana, has a reputation for being a wild sort of a place, but its public officials there are blessed with more sense than are those In some of the alleged "safe and sane" communi ties of the land. They stopped a "Mara thon dance" there before any of the contestants had a chance to drop dead. Mrs. Carrie A. Nation smashed $50 worth of bottle whisky the other day in the bar at the Union station, Wash ington, D. C. She was arrested, of course, and will probably soon find out that the capital of the nation la a lit tle different from Kansas In Its treat ment of folks who run amuck In that fashion. ' An association of Kansas creamery men propose to raise the standard of butter which is "made In this' state. The poor, old consumers will be sus picious that this will mean a further increase In tho price of this product. If it doesn't the butter makers In question will prove themselves to be great men. Having been In session for a few flays and done nothing congress Is now preparing to take a two weeks' vacation for- the holiday period. Why lan't the date ' of convening congress advanced to a time after the holidays o that when the congressmen do gather at Washington they can remain and get o work without a two weeks' tatewujAlonT Governor S'.ubba and Attorney Gen eral Jackson want the Kansas Natural Oaa company to furnish gas to Its pat rons In Kansas before it furnishes gas to the people of Missouri, ' notes the Kansas City Star and then it adds: "There la reason to believe that Gov ernor Stubbs and the attorney general have been misinformed as to what the Kansas Natural Gas company Is doing to the people of Missouri." Many persons in and out of public life are referring to President Taft's annual message to congress as being oonsplcuous for what is missing from It. The criticism does not appear to be a fair one because Mr. Taft . has given notice that he Intends to discuss enroll Important questions as are In volved in the needed amendments to the anti-trust. Interstate commerce and conservation laws in special messages of the near future. And now the "hired men" In the Mc-Neal-Anthony controversy have taken tip the cudgels for their champions. Probably their dogs will get busy next. Then will come a contest between the fleas on their respective dogs, and so on down to the mites that bite the fleas and stir the latter up to taking revenge. The prospect well, it is not very encouraging particularly at this season of the year when peace on earth and good will toward men is sup posed to reign. Discussing the proposed demands of the railroad men throughout the coun try for increased wages. President Brown of the New Tork Central sys tem states emphatically that if there is any increase in wages, no matter how large or small. It will be Impossible without a commensurate increase in railroad rates. He adds that there is not a railroad In the country that can afford to pay its employes mere now without getting better rates. This may be true but the plain, ordinary com mon people who have been asking for lower railroad rates "will stand at at tention in Missouri's eood, old " Show me" attitude. At last the African in the woodpile that was responsible for Poet Wat son'g effusion which has been labelled "The woman with the serpent's tongue," has been exposed to view. It appears that Mr - Watson thought his trices as a poet should be reeog- nized by the British government, in the form it a large annual literary pension and alsi a. knighthood. He didn't get either and was small enough to blame the failure on the daughter and -wife - of England's premier, . Mr. I Asquith. Then he tried to get square with them by penning the vitriolic lines which have been given so much notoriety;. A nice man is Mr. Watson, Isn't he? '' f "' . A 

SATURDAY SERMON. Whatsoever the hand findeth to do, do It with thy might. .Ecclesiastes IX : 10. These words disclose the secret of whatever success la to be, or has been achieved In life by any and every in dividual.. They are taken from that book in the Bible about the author ship of which there is considerable mystery, or, rather, controversy. The word Ecclesiastes has been translated from the Hebrew as meaning one who speaks to the ecclesla or assembly, hence It is often more freely referred to as The Preacher. The book has been ascribed by tradition to Solomon, but It does not expressely mention his name. Many Biblical scholars, though, are of the opinion that it belongs to the latest scriptures of the Old Testa ment. Some place It as having been written between 320 and 217 B. C, which is a much later date than when Solomon lived. Regardless of the identity of Its author, or the lack of one. It is one of the most appealing of the works to be found In the scriptures. It is com posed of two e'ements, the author's theoretical and practical philosophy. The theoretical philosophy has been denned briefly by an authority as: All Is vanity there Is no gain or result in human life; It Is without result, like the whole order of things, which goes on in an eternal round, accomplishing nothing. All the events of human life are in the hand of God; man has no more power ovei them than he has over the wind. The practical philosophy has been analyzed as following from this: Nothing Is left to man but to rejoice In hia -works, for that is his portion. Even over this man has no power; it is also in the determination of God. Power to enjoy what good there Is in life is the gift of God. The Preacher is, of course, no sensualist. The "good"' enjoyment of which he recommends, consists of the simple pleasures of , life. He is essentially a God-fearing man, as can be observed from the beginning and the ending of his preaching. It is not nectssary, of course, for every one to agree entirely with the theoretical and practical philosophy of life as it is expounded in Ecclesiates, to appreciate the force and profundity of a great portion of this philosophy. None of It Is more certainly true than that conveyed in the words used for a text. Many a man falls into the slough of despond because he does not take the best advantage of such opportuni ties as are presented to him. He skims over his task merely to fill out the time he is paid to labor each day. He is of little or ho value to his em-; ployer, who finds it out ..sooner or later, and tnen the fellow blames his discharge on "hard luck." - On the other hand, his co-worker' has been tackling his day's Job with an energy and vim that has brought forth excel lent results. He does even a little more than his allotted task. As a general, thing his reward comes. quickly In the way of a promotion or Increased pay. He has the satisfaction, too, and it Is a great one, of going home at night with the knowledge that his day's labor has been well done and that he has accomplished something. This is true of every calling in life, whether It be the laborer who toils In a ditch, the worker at the bench, or the practition er of any profession. There is actual ly no greater pleasure in the world than that to be derived from activity In work or business, and the only way to obtain a full measure of it Is by doing whatsoever the hand findeth to do with all thy might. THE ILL WIND'S GOOD. An old, well-worn theory to which more or teas attention is paid runs along to the effect that It's an Ill-wind which does not blow some good. At first thought there does not appear to be any possible way to apply it to the chronic habit of the natural gas in this neck of the woods In failing to resipond with an adequate supply when it is most needed. A second, or third thought, however, stretches the imagi nation far enough to realize that the gas failure when the winds of winter blow cold is not without its redeeming features. If It continues for any lengthy per iod, won't It make of the people here abouts a hardy race, a race of men and women and children who will dismiss with a shrug of the shoulders and a smile what used to be terrors to them when the thermometer hovered arounu the zero mark? Surely so. There can be no other result. Habits and en vironments make men what they are and develop their customs. The Es qulmos get along just fine with a mini mum of fuel for heating, lighting and cooking purposes. So could any other race If it had to. In fact, the folks in these parts have already made quite a stride in that direction during the past week. Most of them had been accustomed in wintry weather to sitting down at noon and In the evening in comfortably warm ed houses to piping hot meals. They seemed to need them for the health and comfort of their bodies. Look at the change that" has taken place among them in the past few days. Lukewarm tea and coffee, half -cooked potatoes that get cold before they reach the mouth, and meat that is nearly raw because It has been impossible to cook more than the outside o.f It, have been their rations. Then to bed In frigid rooms and the same thing or a little bit worse over again 'on the next day. With the passing of the first shivers no one- has appeared to . mind it very much. The death rate hasn't jumped. All the neople seem to be in th.'ir usual good health and pursuing their accus tomed avocations. Indeed, they appear to be stepping a little livelier, and as suredly that helps some. Things might be worse, too. As a matter of fact. It is tly a step from present conditions to pemmican sandwiches with their us ual filling of rich, old tallow, and to those - cut but uncomfortable . looking igloos. Cook and Peary, however, were able to hike to the North Pole on such sustenance,, and there is no particular reason why. their' many compatriots should not thrive and grow fat on a similar diet, especially as their pursuits are less rigorous. So what's the use of complaining? There doesn't seem to be much of a chance that it will do any good. It will only tend to spoil our dispositions and they are not very good at their best. 

JOURNAL ENTRIES It may be better to be bom lucky than rloh but most people probably don't think so. Some "girls" have the audacity to re fer to the furrows in their faces mark ed by age as laughing wrinkles . .- . . If -opportunity knocked only once at each man's door there would be more utter failures In the world. Evidently the more curiously and queerly a woman's hat is shaped these days, the more stylish it is thought to be. - If marriages are " generally failures, why is it that most married women are so ardent in making matches for their younger relatives and friends? J A YHA WKER JOTS The Onaga Republican delivers the excellent opinion that bad ioads are an extravagance no farming community can afford. A baboon belonging to the Barnum & Bailey show is being wintered In Man hattan, and society there Is All Agog, says the Emporia Gazette. "It must be remembered," remarks the Abilene Reflector, in reference to the recent statement that Kansas is against Taft, "that Henry Allen Is a humorist." An impertinent question from the Atchison Champion: Right on the square, would you pay any taxes at all, without regard to how much property you own, if you could get around It? A Peabody man made a protest re cently because cemetery lots cost three times as much as they did ten years ago and the Florence Bulletin Inquires to know why he didn't die ten years ago If he Is so anxious to save money. A prospective candidate asked County Treasurer Joe Eddy what he thought of his chances. "Your chances," said Eddy, "remind me of the likelihood of a tallow dog catching an asbestos cat in the in fernal regions." Lawrence Journal. There seems to be a great musical awakening at Plains, notes the Salina Journal. A singing school will be or ganized if a suitable teacher can be ob tained and a band will be started if the question whether each member shall own his own Instruments or whether the instruments shall be owned in com mon can be settled. "Brother Philander," said I to our head deacon the other day, "you have belonged to our church a long time. Did you ever know a member who gave one-tenth of all he made to the Lord?" "Yes," replied Philander with consid erable stress, "she earned her money over the wash tub, and she sang all day long and now wears tho brightest crown of all our members who have gone before." Bert Walker in the Os borne Farmer. "We print the following story," says the Atchison Globe "in the hope that this true little tale may carry Its warn ing to erring wives, mothers and daughters who are seized annually at this time of the year with a mania for wrapping things in tissue paper and at taching Christmas cards: An Atchison man -who is known to carry consider able money was held, up at the corner of Tenth and Parallel streets last even ing by two young women. While one pointed a gun at his head the other went through his pockets, securing $30. The man later secured evidence as to the identity of the women, mother and daughter, and went to their home with a policeman. They confessed, but told such a pitiful story that the man, upon receiving his money, decided to make no charge against them. They said they had no money to spend for Christ mas, and had a list of over twenty-five kin to whom they must give presents. After racking their brains day and right for schemes to raise the money, they hit upon the holdup as the easiest worked." GIjORE SIGHTS. From the Atchison Globe. A man Is usually as far from being a devil as a woman is from being an angel. - You have probably, at some time, noted the resemblance of the critic to the crank. A man's friends are something like natural gas: when he needs them most, the supply is apt to run short. "Although I have smoked all my life, I have never been able to find a smok ing tobacco that suited me." Ben Davis. There never was a woman who loved her husband so much that she would not forget him In making arrangements for a party. In trying to gather the news, report ers are greatly annoyed by the Jolly jokers; so many. men want things print ed as "jokes" on others. A boy enjoys cold weather, except when It Is time to get up In the morn ing; a boy doesn't enjoy any kind of weather when it Is time to-get up in the morning. Tell a man a secret, and he tells it to his wife, and when she In turn re peats It, he has a great deal to say about a woman not being able to keep a secret A man lately gave a Globe reporter an item, but the reporter didn't think it very good, -and didn't print it. The man was very angry. "It took me two days " he said, "to think that out." No man wants to kiss a woman who Is not willing for him to kiss her, al though occasionally a man breaks in and acts rough, but under such circum stances he thinks the woman Is acting cey. and wants to be kissed. The nicest thing In the world Is a nice little girl. The next nicest thing in the world Is a nice woman. Last even ing, we "sat around," and listened to ; nice married woman talk. It was a Joy to hear her, because she had so many ideas that we thought were fair to the men. A woman of that kind never lacks appreciation; you never hear of such a woman seeking a divorce, or saying that she is not treated fairly. We'll bet the husband of the woman we have in mind is glad to be attached to her apron strings. In fact, we once heard him say: "You mav think I'm henpecked,, but I'm -,not:t I love my wife." KANSAS COMMENT THE UNWRITTEN LAW. The question of how far the unwrit ten law may be stretched has had an exploitation In the case of Wm, Brown, the colored Rock Island porter, recently tried at Pratt on the charge of murder ing W. F. Powell, a white man. The unwritten law has served to free sev eral men from gallows or the prison cell since its inception. To the original Interpretation of the law that a man Is blameless if he takes the life of the man who ruins his home has been added many phases. Fathers and brothers have given the right to protect the purity of daughters and sis ters and demand a life for a wrong against their chastity. A California Jury this week freed the girl who shot her faithless lover. But in the case of Brown and Powell the defense of the accused hangs on the story of the wife and her companion that they had been Insulted by Powell. No violence was offered -and they admit that they were In no danger. When Brown dashed from the house in -response to the wo men's screams all he saw was a man running a block away. Surely there was no imminent danger of violence. The fact that Powell was shot in tho back is mute evidence that he was not offering affront to the women or re sistance to. Br own. The fact that he was In such a neighborhood and diei maintaining that he did not know who shot him was evidence : that ne was where he had no business to be and wished to shield his wife and baby. One Jury already has struck upon this question of how far the ramifications of the unwritten law . extend and doubt less another will have to wrestle with the same question. Hutchinson Ga zette. BRING ON THE TURKEYS. Instead of experimenting with . Chi nese pheasants and other birds unstat ed to this climate why doesn't the Btate game warden import wild turkeys, and make the whole year a closed season, as was done in the case of the pheasants? The state of Alabama has protected Its wild turkeys for a year or two, and It is always unlawful to kill a female tur key, and it is now said there Is no rea son why every sportsman should not supply his table with a turkey gobbler. So far as we know, there was never any closed season for turkeys in Kansas, no more than there was for buffalo or elk. and the three gave way together beforj guns and civilization. But wild tur keys used to be common In Kansas, from the river to the Colorado iine, wherever there was a timbered stream. There is much more timber In Kansas now than In the early days, but thero are few If any wild turkeys. The addi tional timbered area should facilitate the introduction of the birds to a region In which they were once common, If assisted by a game law. When a hunt er kills a turkey he has enough, and sportsmen should be willing to abide by the game law until the birds get a start. It wasn't the hunters who made the pheasant experiment a failure, but a climate which didn't seem to agree with them. Also why not protect prai rie chickens, which are native, instead of pheasants? Atchison Globe. THE BEST TALKER. It Is . generally said by those who attended the Knights of Pythias ban quet that Ewing Herbert made a bet ter speech than Henry Allen. Mr. Her bert received nothing for his services; Mr. Allen received $50 and expenses. Mr. Herbert can't do It every night, but he did it last night. . Henry Allen is said to be the best talker in the state. Atchison Globe. - MONOPOLY IMPOSSIBLE. The blow struck at the Standard Oil company by the United States circuit court is not so spectacular as the fam ous Landis fine of $29,200,000, which was Imposed only to come to nothing In the end. There are no big figures in the de cision handed down at St. Louis. The enormous wealth of the oil trust is not set vividly before the country and dealt with as a challenge to the federal gov ernment. The popular appeal of a vast amount of money Is lacking. Yet lawyers and statesmen will rate the St. Louis decision far more note worthy than the unprecedented fine Im posed at Chicago. It is a more serious blow to trusts in general. It does more to establish the broad truth that mon opolies, complete and thoroughgoing, are impossible. In trade and production, in this country, except for the limited period covered by the patent laws or in narrow fields of small importance. The ultimate effect of such blows struck by .the United Spates at corpora tions whch have acquired a preponder ating posiMon in the fields of commerce which they have sought to control and monopolize will be tremendous. Trusts which are strong enough and lirge enoueh to do the work expected of them by their promoters are outlawed In court as well as in the statutes. Prece dents give hew force to laws. Both stiffen public sentiment and make the popular opposition to monono'tes mo aggressive and formidable than ever. Cleveland Leader. STRENGTHENING GOLD LEVER. Day by day. year In and year out, one great lever which is lifting the price levels of the world grows longer and stronger. It does not change rap idly. It is too big for- that. It cannot affect all parts of the world's business at the same tim. There are too many forces involved in that vast theater of human. activity. Sometimes the lifting seems cense altogether because the work which the giant lever does Is off set and for the hour more than over come by Influences operating direction. Yet the accumulation of gold espe cially gold available for use as money, goes on steadily and all the while It tends to lift the price level of the civil ized world. It slowly but surely changes the measure of values. Con stantly It operates toward cheaper mnnpv and dearer securities and lands. merchandise and belongings of all kinds. It makes labor worth more In the markets than it would te If gold mines were less productive. Cleveland Leader. LABOR AND LIQUOR. Organized labor never discussed a more vital question than that involved in the recent convention at Toronto, where John Mitchell made a stirring appeal for temperance. It is not mere ly on moral and sentimental grounds that the cause of temperance Is gain ing adherents among the men who must work for their living. The com mercial aspects of the case are be coming more Insistent all the time, with the restrictions, constantly be coming closer, which employers are placing upon the use of liquor by their employes. Some of the lessons that may be learned from over-indulgence In stimulants are being taken to heart or perhaps only to pocketbook by large employers of labor, the net re sult being that the avenues to employ ment and avancement are being closed tq those who use liquor to a harmful extent.

Brainard quitted his corner In . the brilliant uauroom ana began to pace up and down the dimly lighted piazza. His brain was on fire with Jealousy, and his heart almost bursting with agony and wounded pride. Innumerable , times she had passed him, unconscious ! of his very existence, on the arm of the handsome young lieutenant of ; Company B. Unable to endure the sight of their devotion, he had sought ' relief In the open air and for an ln tstant he began to breathe easier. But at an abrupt turn he came upon them -sitting confidentially close in one of : the wide, low window seats. The girl's dark eyes were lifted smilingly to the glowing face bent over her. and as i he talked, his Hps almost grazed tha i fluff -of straw-gold aft her temple. rsrainara smotnerea a fierce Invec tive and wheeled sharply. Just at this Juncture the orchestra began to play a lively two-step and he con sulted his program anxiously. At last: number 14, Miss Everston. He pulled himself together determinedly and turned to re-enter the ball-room. Now that he would have her face to face, he meant to demand an explan ation. She had treated him outrageously; she was his promised wife, and he would not stand for it. The third, seventh and . tenth had always been his by tacit arrangement; but tonight she had eluded him. Now he would know the reason! But with his foot on " the threshold of the door, he paused dazed. Less than tan feet from where he stood, Lieutenant Langford had just encircled Patricia Everston's slender waist with his arm. and a second lat er they floated off. This was the final straw. Hot with rage, Brainard turned on his heel and strode down the corridor to ward the dressing room. He got into his top-coat somehow, and drew on his gloves with shaking fingers. Then he jammed his hat viciously on his head, and hurried out Into the star lit night.. He had been insulted once too often, and he would show her for good and all that he was no fool to be trampled under her feet. As he reached the street he glanced back just once toward tne glittering merry-mad ballroom. "At that instant he Lbeheld Lieutenant Langford stooping from his six feet one to whisper some thing In Patricia's ear that caused the warm color to surge over her face. Brainard shut his lips hard over the savage utterance, that sprang to them, and quickened his footsteps down the white, deserted avenue. The day after. Miss Everston sat a long time before her bird-eye writ ing desk, and wrote steadily for an hour: But at the end of that time less than a dozen lines had been res cued, whole, from the wreckage The rest went Into the trash-basket. ."My dear Mr. Brainard." she had written formally, "It Is Impossible for me to attempt to convey to you the ,3 A,a, nf mniflpntinn And re sentment I experience when I recall tne indignity to wnicn you suojecieu me last night.

She had loved him so. How was she to endure this blow to her pride? Under the searching, callous light of day bitter anger held the scepter; but by evening things had assumed a somewliat softened aspect anri her love rose masterfully In his defense. Why had -she been so hasty, so un compromising? Perhaps he was 111? Perhaps oh. what had she done! The future, with its endless nights and sleepless days, rose black before her. She sought her pillow distractedly and sobbed the night through. In the morning's mail came a little 'word of explanation or entreatj. By ; the same post she received a gush ing ten-page episue irom tuttzie nui lister. begging her to come to Wash ington. - All the wrath of the previous morn ing had returned two-fold, an.1 here tViA verif phnnw she wanted to show him how reallv little she did care.

A lieutenant, writing In a London newspaper and treating of the status of officers, says that the explanation of the shortage of officers and tht fall ing off of applications for admission to Sandhurst is found in the fact that the army as a profession "does not pay," bluntly speaking. It is not. to quote a British authority, "a prosper ous profession," If the pay Is com pared with the Investment. The writ er asks in what other profession would he, a well educated man of 32. after an expenditure of $10,000 capital and twelve years' service or experience, be expected to be contented with a "sal ary" of $2 a day. Answer Is not easy, and apparently none is attempted be yond the vague assurance of a min ister that the government hopes at some time to give the whole subject of officers' pay consideration. The reference by this British sub altern to the expenditure of capital is enlightening as to the difference existing between the method of . offi cering the army In his country and in ours. Not only do we pay officers a wage calculated with some refer ence to the expenses which the serv ice entails, but we pay young men to go through the four years' course at west Point.
