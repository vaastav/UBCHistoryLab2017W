LARGE INCREASE With two exceptions all our affil iated national unions report a large increase of local unions and in mem bership There is an increase of about 34000 members in the organizations af filiated I has been the constant aim to or ganize our fpllowvorkers engaged in unskilled labor With the invention of new machinery and the applications of new force to the division and subdi vision of labor many worker who have been employed at skilled trades find themselves with their occupation gone to which they have devoted long terms ot years to acquire Thus ve see the citizen of yesterday the un j skilled laborer of today I is a source of gratification to re po t that within the past year a very large number o federal labor unions for unskilled workers have been organ zed and from them a much larger number of trade unions There have been quite a number of strikes within the past year but the change in the causes which have pro I duced them are worthy of note The strikes of this year with few exceptions have been for higher wages I shorter hours and of recognition un ions Our organizations report with gratifying unanimity the very large number of successes secured the ad vantages gained and the growth and extension of the power of organiza tion enjoyed HOURS OF LABOR The movement to reduce the hours of labor is always one which commands the first attention of organized labor We hold that no condition is satisfac 5atsfac tory nor solution complete which fails to f minate the curse and the degrad II ing mfiuence of nonemployment and so long as this evil shall be with us our best efforts will be concentrated to the reduction of the hours of labor of all until the desired end is attained U ARBITRATION It is submitted whether it would rot h iett r to modify our position in so far as to impose no objection to the passage of a law providing for com pLtecry arbitration in disputes of or gai ized employees of railroads and railroad companies and of giving aAard by such lawful arbitrators but ve should hesitate to give our endorse ment to any legislation state or na tional empowering the compulsory en lorcement of award and the enforce ment of a contract to labor There should be no equivocation as to our position on any question much jrss of such importance importnce as immigration BOYCOTT Recently one of the branches of the federal courts decided by a majority vote that the boycott is illegal The suggestion is made that upon any let ter or circular issued upon such a mat ter of this character after stating the name of the unfair firm and the griev ances complained of the words we have been enjoined by the courts from boycotting this firm should be added TRIAL BY JURY We not only demand the right of trial by jury for any offense charged Mr Gompers sags but also that we as workers and citizens shall not be restrained in the exercise of our law ful and natural rights Courts do not and cannot issue injunctions restrain ing persons from committing crimes or misdemeanors and should not while there is another compete remedy at law I is but just that the workers insist upon being regarded as equals before the law and that in their activ ity to prevent infringement upon their rights and their hopes and struggles to maintain their manhood extra ju dicial prcceedings should not lie against them as is now the case by the use or more properly stated abuse of the powers of the courts in the issuance of writs of injunction LATIMER MASSACRE Of the Latiiner massacre Sir Gom pers says This crime against our laws this brutality against inoffensive men the vail of widows and orphans the wounded pride of American citizenship and common humanity cry out not only that justice shall be meted out to these mode hyenas but that never again hal Ki great a wrong be inflicted upon any of our people EIGHTHOUR WORKDAY The steps that have been taken to ward securing an eighthour workday arc reviewed and the address continues Nothing remains now but for the final decision of this convention a to the ways and means by which the project shall be carried into effect or whether the judgment of the conven tion is that the time stated is in view of industrial conditions a practical one or whether it would be advisable to await the full flood tide of an indus trial revival for Its general and simul i taneous enforcement This question 4 must of necessity receive your careful consideration Nothing perhaps would be more hurtful than an unwise de cision I the judgment of this con vention is that May 1 1898 is the one rpon which the bugle call for labor shall be sounded none will enter i ith greater enthusiasm and undaunt ed spirit than we Yet if the deliber ate conclusion of this convention is that the simultaneous effort should be deferred until a more opportune time say the postponement of i for one 1 year then that should prevail WON AND LOST The report of the secretary shows that 1 during the year 27C strikes had been offi cially noticed involving 165407 workers or the e ISO were won 31 were compro mised and S3 lost lie Hour Workday I i New York Dec 2All the union bobk and job printers of the United I States and Canada are watching the IY struggle of No 6 for a ninehour work day I the New York printers win < their brethren elsewhere will probably i insist on the new time schedule to the ht Tor vkich they arc already com L r mUted by the action of the interna tional union President Samuel B Donnelly of the Typographical Union No 6 at a meet ing of the union held in this city to night announced that 65 of the 102 publishers had gran tedthe request of the union for a ninehour day About 20 book machine offices also I consented to an eighthour day Pres ident Donnelly said that the other of fices would undoubtedly come into the compact and that the impending strike would probably be averted 

BRITISH ENGINEERS Almost Unanimous Against Accept ing Employers Proposals London Dec lThe ballot taken by the unions of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers is almost unanimously against accepting the proposals of em ployers The ballot referred to In the fore going dispatch grew out of the formal conference between the representatives of the striking engineers and their em ployers The general impression when the con ference was adjourned to allow the bal lot was that unless the unions accepted the proposals of the employers there would be a renewal of the deadlock The strike began on July 13 last with a lockout against some of the en gineers followed by the engineers call ing out a large number of men until about a hundred thousand engineers were thrown out of work The os tensible reason for the strike was the question of payment for overtime and incidentally for eight hours per day The engineers have insisted upon eight hours work and that all overtime must count as one and a quarter time for the first two hours and as time and a half after that FIGHT ON ARMOUR Conflict of Labor Unions About Pro I posed Indemnity Kansas City Dec Organized la i bor circles are agog over a demand for 50000 indemnity made on the Armour Packing company by a joint committee representing Anchor Federal union the Firemens union and the unions of beef pork and sheep butchers in submit ting a proposition looking to a settle ment of pending troubles and the withdrawal of the boycott on the Ar I mour products At a later called meeting of the two main unions of the two Kansas Cities the indemnity action was denounced as irregla and a committee was ap pointed to treat with the Armours with a view to adjusting the matter The trouble originated in 1S95 when the Armour firemen struck and issued a boycott against the firm The com pany retaliated by discharging several hundred union men from its other de partments After the strike was final ly declared off the Armours agreeing to employ the old men the unions claimed that all had not been given their places and the boycott was again put into force and has not since been removed Federal Eight Hour Law Washington Dec 13 Senator White of California introduced a bill today to strengthen the eighthour law as ap plicable to government work I has been found impossible to enforce the law owing to the lack of inadequate penalties Mr White proposes a amendment to which a violation of the law is made a misdemeanor subject to a fine not to exceed 1000 or imprison I ment not exceeding six months or I both I I I I DfATH Of A GRfAT

Was Found That Democrats Not Only Favor a Kepeal But Would Op pose Anything Short of It Cap ital News Washington Dec 13The outlook for changing the civil service law is being actively canvassed among the Republican can members of the house as a result of the conference held Saturday night The members of the special committee tee having the mater in charge are trying to so shape a bill that it will command the support of divergent ele ments One of these is the Democratic I minority which combined with the Republicans opposed to the present law would be strong enough to carry a I bill 

WHAT WAS DISCOVERED But in canvassing the situation it has been found that most Democratic members not only favor a complete re peal of the law but would oppose any thing short of a repeal As the Re publican movement is not toward a complete repeal but rather for modifi cation of the law there appears to be caton no basis by which the anticivil service reformers of both parties can unite It is claimed however that a modification cation of the bill will receive the vot c I of twothirds of the Republican mem bers and will have a good chance of passing the senate and receiving the presidents signature 

MODIFICATIONS Mr Pearson of North Carolina who inaugurated the movement and is a member of the special committee says the essential modifications of the law likely to be considered by the com mittee are a follows Excluding from the operations of the law cases in which one government of I ficer is held responsible for the acts of his subordinate as public collectors of revenue examinations of those already covered into the classified service with out examination so as to make them more practical and less theoretical distinct provision against life tenure and for a stated term of service affirmation ar mation of the rights of heads of de partments to remove reduce or pro mote In the interest of the public a limitation of the law to specific depart ments bureaus etc and an exclusion of those not enumerated ENLARGED FUNCTIONS Another point that will materially figure in the discussion of the subject is the al leged rapid and unauthorized enlarge ment of the functions of the civil service commission The opponents of the com mission say that the original law was never intended to apply to tenure of office and removals and that the commission growing from a corns of three commis sioners and several clerks to a large in stitution has arrogated to itself not only the rank of a department but the power of dictating to heads of departments what action they will take and further to em ploy attorneys to make pleadings as in tho case of the Virginia collector of in ternal revenue An attempt will be made mission to define the exact functions of the com APPEALS TO GAIN TIME II Bill to Amend Law Procedure In Supreme Court Washington Dec 13Senator Per kins of California today introduced a bill to amend that paragraph of the re vised statutes relating to the anneal on habeas corpus of criminal cases to the supreme court of the United States I The object is to do away with numer ous appeals by attorneys of prisoners made with the sole view of gaining time Senator Perkins presents the Durrant case as a particularly strong example of this sort In this connec tion he said that when a prisoner had the advantage of a jury trial a re trial if desired and an appeal to the governor of the state it was manifestly I unjust to allow appeals to the supreme court without the certificates of either I the state supreme court or the circuit I court before which the case va tried The measure if passed will not affect I the Durrant case in any way but will considerably shorten the legal process I in all such cases in the future I Letter Carriers Bond Washington Dec Postmaster I General Gary has amended regulations so as to require that after April 1 next the bond supplied by letter carriers for the faithful performance of their duties i shall be that supplied by surety com j panies At the present time about half i the carriers have surety company bonds and the other half private in dividual bonds By the death of bonds i men and for other reasons the indi i vidual bonds are often found to be I worthless and the new system is be lieved to be in accordance with prac tical business methods 1 i New Cabinet Department Chicago Dec 18 Officers of the Chicago I Businass league have received word from Washington that President McKinley will make the proposed department of com I merce and industries the subject of a I special message to congress Immedlats ly

court of New Mexico in tho case of th5 Springer Land association vs Patrick Ford was today sustained in an opinion by the United States supreme court rendered by Chief Justice Fuller The question involved was whether a mschanlcs len upon an irrigation system covered only the ditches and rivers or in addition to these lands the ditch The court held that the lien applied to the lands held under the ditch as well as to the ditch itself In this case 22000 acres were involved This decision was based on an act of the territory and in reading his opinion the chief justice said that adjudication would I depend necessarily on the local statutes of diltcrsnt states and territories and to the variance in their laws judicial de cisions must necessarily conform Too Swift at a Fire St Louis Mo Dec
