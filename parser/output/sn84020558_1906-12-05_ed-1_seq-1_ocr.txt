CLIFTON CATASTROPHE DEVASTATED BY ELOOD The Extent of the Destruction at Present is Only Surmised The Latest Report Says That Eight Lives Were Lost as the Result of the Breaking of a Chase Creek Dam. El Paso. Dec. 4. A special to the Herald from Morenci, Arizona, says: "Eight people are reported to have lost their lives in a great flood at Cllftcn last night. "The Det:oit concentrator dam broke, sending a wall of water umvn Chase creek. Wires are down between Mo renci and Clifton and no definite news can be obtained until messengers re turn to Morenci from Clifton. The central telephone station in Clifton has been abandoned, having been pro nounced unsafe. The news of the Clifton disaster, v. hich Is yet meager, was first learned i:. Phoenix by a message from the of fice of President Epes Randolph in Tucson to Superintendent M. O. Bick nell of the M. & P. railroad. Efforts to secure further details last night by communication with Tucson, Bisbee, Lordsburg- and Globe, were unavailing. The telephone wire between Globe and fJoloinonville was down and nothing but the bare report was known in the other towns. During the evening a private message that got out of Clif ton in some way, addressed to a Phoe nix friend, was received here. All it said was. "Clifton half destroyed: I am all right." When the news was first received it was supposed that the first was in the San Krancisco river, which flows through the town and which in f BUY Buckeye Land AT $30 to $75 Per Acre

From the standpoint of the gallery, today proba bly was the most interesting of the sessions of the constitutional conven tion. By far the most salient feature was the resolution presented by a cit izens' delegation railing on the con vention to draft a law maintaining the individuality of the church and state. The original resolution was a practical embodiment of a similar memorial ' from the Seven Day Adventists. The j latter is signed by rout volois and : the constitution to any day to be set aside for public worship. Thse res olutions were referred to committees. Forty new planks were proposed duiiiiR the day.

AEIZONA' BEPUBLICAN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, Suggested to tho Council as THE STATE OP THE REPUBLIC President Roosevelt Transmits His Last Regular Message to the Fifty-Ninth Congress, Washington, December 4. President Roosevelt today transmitted to the Fifty-ninth congress the following recommendations: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: "As a nation we still continue to en joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is possible that only reck less speculation and disregaid of legit imate business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. "No Congress In our time has done more good work of importance than the present Congress. There were sev eral matteis left unfinished at your last session, however, which 1 most earn estly hope you will complete before your adjournment. "1 again recommend a law prohibit ing all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one House of Congress. Let individuals eontri- ute as they deshe; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any pol itical purpose, directly or indirectly. 

GOVERNMENTS RIGHT OK APPEAL. "Another bill which has just past one House of the Congress and which it Is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon th'j Government the right of appeal in criminal questions of law. This tight exists In many of the States; it exists In the District of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is of course not pro posed that in an case a verdict for tho defendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the Government had indicted certain persons for conspiracy In connection with rebates, the court sustained the defendants demurrer while In an other jurisdiction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions ob tained under it. and two defendants sentenced to imprisonment. The two cases refer; ed to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is un fortunate that'thcre should even be an apparent conflict.

WEDNESDAY MORNING, an effect arrangement tor in muddy weather. no way by which the Government can cause such a conflict, when It occurs to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill In question. A failure to pass it will result In serious ly hampering the Government in Its efTort to obtain Justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corpo rations who do wrong; and may also prevent the Government from obtain ing Justice for wageworkers who are , not themselves able effectively to con test a case where the judgement of an inferior court has been against thein. I have specifically in view a recent de cision by a district jmlg leaving rail way employes without remedy for vio lation of a rwtam osUul I iUr stat ute. It seems n absurdity to permit a single district Judge, against what may be the Judgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by I the Congress to be "unconstitutional." and then to deny to the Government the right to have the Supreme Court definitely decide the question. "It Is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often depends not upon the passage of acts as to which there is great public excitement, but upon the passage acts of this nature as to which there Is not much public excitement, because there Is little pub lic understanding of their importance, while the Interested parties are keenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of enacting Into law the particular bill in question is further increased by the fact that the Government has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal LIQUIDATION SALE WE NEED Have you examined our goods and asked our prices?

At first, as was proper, every effort was made to enforce these laws by clvii proceedings: but It has become In creasingly evident that the action of the Government in finally deciding. In certain cases, to undertake criminal proceedings was justifiable; and though there have been some conspicuous fail ures In these cases, we have had many successes, which have undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon evil doers. whether the penalty inflicted was In the shape of a fine or Imprisonment and icnalties of both kinds have al ready been infiieted by the courts.

"In conneeion with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part from habit of setting aside the Judgments of In ferior courts on technicalities absolu tely unconnected with the merits of the case, and where there is no attempt to show that there has b-en any fai'.uie of substantial justice.

Washington. Dec. 4, President Roosevelt's annual message to congress occupied the attention of the senate for two and one half hours today, to the exclusion of nearly all other business. The exception to this was the Introduc tion of a resolution on the Japanese situation by Senator Rayner of Mary land and the adoption of appropriate resolutions regarding those members of the house of representatives who have died since the last session. As a mark of further respect to their mem ories, adjournment was taken at 2:45 p. m. THE 

HOUSE. Washington. Dec. 4. The reading of the President's message consumed two hours and twenty-five minutes in the house today, and was followed closely by a large number of members, while the crowded galleries gave close consid eration. Here and there the reading of the document was punctuated by ap plause, and hearty handclapping from democrats as well as republicans fol lowing its conclusion. During the major portion of the time of the reading of the message. Repre sentative Lacey acted as speaker pro tern, being the first of the defeated "stand patters" to be recognized by Speaker Cannon. While the house waited upon the sec retary to the president to appear with the message. Speaker Cannon appoint ed Robert G. Cousins of Iowa chairman of the committee an foreign affairs to succeed the late Robert Hitt of Illi nois. He also appointed Representa tive Frank O. Louden to a place on the me committee.

CUBAN SENTIMENT. The Message Was About What The Islanders Expected. Havana. Dec. 4. The message of President Roosevelt to the American congress was published in the local press, but no editorial comment on it was made. Liberal and moderate lead ers are chary of expressing an opinion of the president's declaration regarding a Cuban policy, but the general view is that it does not differ materially from the statements made in the letter to Senor Quesada, Cuban minister, last September, and that the final determi nation of the policy of the United States rests in the hands of Congress. The Diario De La Harina tomorrow will say: "While President Roosevelt's declarations relative to Cuba are in fact a paraphrase of his letter to Senor Quesada. the message contains the ad ditional statement that If Cuba ac quires the revolutionary habit it Is Im possible that the Island's independence can be maintained, for since the Unit ed States is standing in the position of a guarantor of life and property it would then be compelled to Intervene anew. Although this statement al ready has been expressed by Senator Ueveridge and Secretary Root, its re- Let This Be a Practical Christmas.
