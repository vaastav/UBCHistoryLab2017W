Rolfs, McQuarrie and Spencer each took up their subjects and held a splendid institute lasteing one hour and thirty minutes. Hon. P. K.

Mr. Lister, agricultural agent of the trie- train since it was taicen over Dy the iL. & N. He has taken a keen In terest in its welfare and management and considers it a most successful un dertaking. Mr. E. O. Saltmarsh and Mr. J. W. Lurton, while on account of urgent office duties were unable to ac company the train but for a short time, have expressed themselves In a very favorable manner. The university officials desire to ex press their appreciation of the liberal support given by the L. & N. officials and the citizens of Florida. The trip has been a very satisfac tory one from every standpoint and West Florida has responded liberally at every call. The University of Florida officials also appreciate the liberal space given by the press of Pensacola and the state of Florida. Are you planning on hav ing a Xmas tree for the kid dies?
