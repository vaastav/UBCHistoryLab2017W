NUMBER 24 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO S0N6RESS. Tlie Sixty-Sixth Congress as sembled in Washington for the long session Monday. Dec. 1st, at noon. The two houses had already been organized at the special called session held during the summer and fall- The President, unable to appear in person as had been his custom, sent in his annual message on Tuesday, which was read in both houses. lie did not. as was expect ed. discuss the failure oT the Sena ate to ratify the peace treaty which that body had under consideration at the special session which ad journed about the middle of No vember. Following are the leading ques tions considered in the message: "Simplification of income and profits taxes has become an imme diate necessity. "The tariff controversy * * must be subordinated to the public in terest "The productivity of the country must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries. If we want to sell, we must buy. "This is the liour of test and trial for the United States. "America is the greatest capital ist in the world "We must recognize and relieve our returned soldiers. "America will not be daunted by threats from any class. "The chemical and dyestufTs in dustry must be protected "The causes of the widespread unrest are superficial, rather than deep-seated. They are connected with failure speedily to reach a just and permanent peace, with heartless profiteering, with the transfusion of radical theories from European centers, and with the machinations of malevolent agita tors." "Congress should arm the Fed eral government with power to deal in its criminal courts with persons who by violent measures would ab rogate our timp-tested institutions. "There can be no settled condi tions if capital and labor are to be antagonists instead of partners. "Governments must recognize the right of men collectively to bar gain for humane objects. ' | "Labor not only is entitled to re ceive an adequate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its investments. "The right to strike is inviolate, but the Government has a funda mental right to protect all of its people against the challenge of any class." 

DECLINES TO RELEASE JENKINS. Mexico has replied with an ar gumentative diplomatic refusal to the American government's demand for the immediate release of Win. 0. Jenkins, the consular agent im prisoned at Pu?blo The ofhcial n.'le was delivered at Washington on Nov. 27th, but not made public. There is no reason to doubt that it agrees with the copy given out by the Mexican consul general at lil Paso. No comment was forthcoming to indicate how the State Hepartment regards the answer to what was considered one of the sharpest warnings yet sent to Mexico and neither was there any indication <?f what the government's next step would be. The Mexican reply, which ac cording to its text, was prepared at the direction of President Carranza argues in the main that the Mexi can government cannot order the release of a prisoner while his cast is under adjudiction in the civil courts of its states and contends that the American government de mand for the consular agent's re lease had no foundation or pre cedent in international law. To this note the government has made reply, the tenor of which is not yet made known. WE ABE

American manufacturers have a large output of these goods, all of which were imported before the war, and most of the domestic trade is being satisfied through home pro duction.

Smaller newspapers, bet let* news- 1 papers and higher-priced newspa- ! pers is the best prediction of the I week's market. There is not enough news print paper to go around- So the aver age newspaper must be made smal ler in size. To atone for this re- ; duction the quality is to be bettered by more careful editing. The price %>r newspaper must be increased be cause the pennies paid by the sub scriber today actually do not cover the cost of the white paper in many instances. Advertising rates must be increased not only because ad vertising has been sold at a ridicu lously low price in relation to the , service rendered, but for the fur ther reason that, as stated by F. P. (jlass, president of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association. "The cost of newspaper produc tion has increased 1(M) per cent in the past year." Newspapers are like people. Gen eralization do not fit each individu al. It may be that not every paper in the United Stales and Canada will increase its subscription price, decrease its size, and add to its ad vertising rates. But the prediction will stand as applied to American newspapers as a whole because of the change in conditions as a re sult of the war. Already the most important organizations of news paper publishers have adopted | resolutions to this effect. The situa tion being what it is. they had no option. The shortage of print paper is compelling the reduction in size of the average newspaper. According to the investigation made by the A. N. I?. A. this shortage will amount lo 200.001) tons this year. \ erily the lot of the averayc coun try newspaper for muni/ months past has been a tryiny one. With doubt as to inhere the next sujtjfly was to come from and what would be the increased / trice the publish er has been kept in constant anxiety and always on a strain . To sum up: The independent has on hand this week one ton of paper (a supply sufficient to last about ten weeks), Athe wholesaler, from whom we have been buying for a number of years, will promise us nothiny. The one ton we have on hand cost us SI 50.00. VVV have, in the past bought the same paper for $28 to *30. 

PRESBYTERY ACTS IN HINTON CASE. A special meeting of Presbytery was held in Hinton Tuesday for the purpose of considering the con troversy that had arisen in the Hin ton church relative to the purchase of a lot for church uses. This meet ing was well attended by the mem bers, and after witnesses were pub licly examined touching a few of the most vital matters, the Presby j tcry went into executive session, I and made he following orders: That the congregational meeting ordering the purchase of the (Jar j nett property was irregular and il legal. That the action of the Session in j refusing the congregational meeting | on the petition presented be sus tained.

Striking com I miners in Illinois arc conspiring against Ihe welfare of (lie nation, according to Judge Jett, in the circuit court, at Hills- 1 horo, Illinois, on Nov. 27th. He declared so in denying twenty foreigners, all coal miners, natural ization papers, "(rood citizens." | Judge .1 e 1 1 said, "would not con spire against the welfare of the na tion" . I GAS IN BRAXTON. The Central Fuel Co. luis drilled in a gas well on the Singleton farm, j in Salt Lick district of Hraxlon county, which -is reported to he good for :it least 3,000.000 feet of gas. The company has a large acre age in leases in that section, on which there are several other good wells GOVERNMENT TO AVOID COAL FAMINE. ....War-lime restrictions on the use of coal more stringent even than those applied during the war, were ordered into ell'ect Monday to stave oil" a coal famine. Moved by reports of diminishing coal storks and growing danger of distress in numerous sections, the tioverument sought tp compromise with striking mine. workers whose walkout forced the emergency, hut asked for national determination to endure privation and discomfort until coal mining was resumed on its terms. Fuel Administrator (iarlield. act ing in conjunction with the railroad administration, gave notice that hereafter only the essential con sumers included in the lirsl live classes' of the war priorities list would be supplied with coal, and asked the help of all State and municipal authorities to make ra tioning eH'ective. The order, which made national those restrictions al ready put into local eft'eet by re gional coal committees where the pinch of fuel shortage has been felt, cuts oil' supplies from all but agen cies. which includes inland and coast-wise shipping as well as rail roads; federal and local govern ment institutions and establish ments including concerns working on government contracts; public utilities, including newspapers, and retail dealers. Railroad adminis tration -oilicials conceded that it means wide-spread cessation oT in dustrial operations, only justified by the gravity of the situation. It is necessary that coal shallvbe used only for essential purposes. | Dr. Ciartield said in giving public notification of the step. "Public utilities consuming coal should dis continue to furnish power, heat or light to non-essential industries and should consume only sufficient coal to furnish enough light, power or heat to meet the actual urgent needs of the people." METIOR FALLS INTO LAKE. This, of Nov. 2'Jth, comes from Detroit: That a meteor of tremend ous size plunged into Lake Michi gan last night, causing earth trem ors felt in a dozen Southern Michi gan cities and sending a pillar of flame hundreds of feet into the air, which was visible for a radius of more than 50 miles, was the theory generally accepted early yesterday in explanation of the earth shock which at first was believed to have been caused by a terrific explosion al some industrial plant From reports from various Michi gan, Indiana and Illinois cities, where the blinding flare was visible it appeared the center of disturb ance was near the lower end of Lake Michigan, Coast guards at (iraud Ilaven were firm in their as sertions that they had witnessed the decent of the heavenly body and credence was given their story by the absence nearly twelve hours later of reports of any industrial disaster. Residents of Battle Creek, Kala mazoo, South Bend, tlrand Haven, and other Western Michigan cities fled from their homes in panic, fearing an earthquake. The rum blings were heard as far as South Bend and Laportc, Ind.. while the flash of light was said fo have been visible at Chicago. 

SUGAR HOPE OF BELIEF, Thirty-thousand Ions oT Ameri-i can beet sugar from the central ? slalcs is now moving into the At- 1 lantic roiisl states to relievo in pari j I he acute sugar famine in the east ern zone. This supply, the sugar] equalization board announced, on Dee. 1st, will serve lo mitigate the shortage this month, hut adequate relief must wait until C.uban sugar, the natural source of supply for the Atlantic seaboard, commences lo move in volume, which may he ex pected in January. The American heel sugar crop is being marketed in the central west in quantities lo justify the "loan" of the 30,000 tons lo the east, it was said. LARGE FRUIT SHIPMENTS, During the peach and apply sea son now ended for this year a total of 2,450 cars of fruit were handled over the Cumberland division of the It & O. railroad, practically all grown in .leU'erson, Berkeley. Mor gan, Hampshire and Hardy counties and Frederick county (Va ). There were 2 IS cars of apples and 07 of peaches shipped from Hie sta tions on the South Branch between (ilebe and Vance's, which stations are (llebe, Pancake, West Homney. Honmey, Covoll and Vance's. In ad dition lo 111 esc carload lots there were a number of smaller .ship ments FAILURE TO SETTLE COAL STRIKE. An ;il>rii|>t end came late on Nov. 2Kth to all attempts to settle Hit' na tion-wide eoal strike by peaceful i agreement. Miners and operators spent a bleak Thanksgiving aTlcr- ! noon in embittered debate over tin* ' Government proposal for a 1 1 per : cent wage increase made the night ; before by Fuel Administrator Gar- j Held, rejected il and every other J proposal that was forthcoming and , then dissolved, sine die- I Since that time the (iovcrninent, ! on the 2i>th served bint notices on ! soft coal miners and operators that I interference with coal production I would not be tolerated. Warning that legal prosecution would be em ployed to thwart conspiracies by either side and troops sent wher ever necessary to protect miners willing to work came from the De partment of Justice after members of the Cabinet had considered every phase of the fuel situation, admit tedly critical, in view of the abrupt breaking oil' of nc'otiatons. It is not the intention of the (iovcrninent to let the mines remain idle, with half of the country in the grip of cold weather and the coal slocks rapidly diminishing. The Administration, it was said by those in a position to know, had fully expected the miners to reject the 11 per cent wage increase of fered by Fuel Administrator Gar Held- Anticipating this, plans had been considered for augmenting the present output of bituminous mines, ollicially figured at better than 10 per cent of normal.

BOND-HOLDERS WARNED. Indications that large numbers of Liberty Bond holders are trading their government securities for stock in fraudulent ventures has prompted Secretary Glass to renew liis recent warning to bond-holders against being persuaded into such exchanges. In a formal statement | Mr- Glass asserted that the high I rate of return upon some of these stocks was in itself sullicient to I arouse suspicion "Where Liberty Bond holders are urged to give up their securi ties for slocks of speculative char acter." lie said, "good sense sug gests the presumption that the oiler is made because the liberty bonds are worth decidedly more than lin stock. Kxperienee in a great num ber of cases show that the stock is worthless and the bond owners who make the exchange is simpl> an other victim to the army of sharpers who find easy booty in these days of reckless speculation."

The United States government, on Dee. 3rd, again invoked the pow ers of the Federal courts in an ef- j fort to end the strike oT 4(10,000 1 bituminous eoal miners of the ! country.
