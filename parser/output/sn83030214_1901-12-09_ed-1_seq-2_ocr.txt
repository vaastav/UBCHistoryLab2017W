n 2 810 <FEX<T,' IN BKOOKI.VX. THE MOT NT VERXON GIRL BURGLAR DISCLOSES THE TLACE WHERE HER STOLEN PLUNDER IS TAKEN. Throes* confessions obtained by a ruse of Chief Foley c? the Mount Vernon police from Mary Elizabeth Thompson, a seventeen-year-old girl burglar, who Is locked up in that city, a. "fence." 1 representing J5.«» worth of plunder, was unearthed yesterday in Brooklyn, and two men believed to be confederates of the female burglar, were arrested The plunder includes booty from a dozen burglaries in Mount Vcrnon. New-Rochelle and Tonkers. It was found in a flathouse at No. MM Fulton • Ft.. Brooklyn, by Detective. William Lynch, of .Mount Vemon. and two of Captain White's men . from the Sixty-fifth Precinct. To-day a party of •wealthy suburbanites whose houses have been robbed will go to Brook'yn to look over the loot, which consists of a score of -ilk dresses, men's •ver.inir suit?, opera cloaks, silk hcts, furs, over coats, silver and jewelry. It is believed by the po lice that some of the plunder may belong to Clara Morris, the actress, whose home, the Fines, at Yorkers, was robbed several weeks ago. The Thompson girl, who is a Creole, was arrested Friday night on a Mount Vernon trolley car while making off with a sealskin sack and a silk dress •Me* she had stolen from the home of Mrs. Samuel Hettlnger. of New-Rochelle. She entered the Het tlnger house in broad daylight by the way of the ■basement, and, finding the family out. smashed In the door leading to the kitchen and ransacked the house. The girl when arrested declared that she ■was Innocent, and the police could get no informa tion from her. Chief Foley finally resorted to the -old ruse of putting a decoy In the cell with her. He employed a smart colored girl, who was landed •In the cell with great exertion on the part of two .policemen. After the decoy was locked up she gave vent to her feelings by abusing the police. This 'Yon the confidence of the other girl, who, it is «l!eg<=>d. told her of the "fence" in Brooklyn. According to the story of the decoy, the Thomp eon girl said that the "fence" was at No. Vim Fulton-st.. and that it was conduct by her nus "band. I>ouis Prior, and his brother. Robert Prior. *oth colored. The prisoner, it is averred, said that she and several other young women were sent •to the suburbs to rob houses. They usually ■»■ 'lected places wher* the owners were not at home, and entered them in the manner that she orn r>ioy^d in getting into the house in New-Kochelle- All" this Information was communicated to enter Foley. who sent Detective Lynch, as soon as pos sible, to Brooklyn. The police arrived just in time to capture the occupants and get plunder. ■Prior had evidently suspected his wife's arrest, for f he had the goods packed and was getting ready to move when the police appeared. The plunder was in trunks and big drygoods ■•boxe*. and the police say there is enough of it to «i! two furniture vans. Fourteen pawn tickets •were found on Prior and his brother, who were locked dp. while one of Captain White's men was left to guard the house until the arrival of the identification party from the suburbs to-day. Another young colored woman has been arrested In this city in connection with the robbery on a technical charge. The poli •*■ will not disclose her Jiame. The girl burglar who is in Mount \ernon 1- alleged to have told the <i-coy that Friday was her day for operating in Westchester County but •he now believes that it proved her "hoodoo, as «h« was captured and locked up on that day. GOVERNOR ODELL APPEALED TO. DISTRICT ATTORNEY WWII I DENIES THAT IMPROPER EVIDENCE WAS USED IN CONVICTING DIVEKEEPER. District Attorney John B. Merrill of Queens County, when seen last night, said that on Friday he received a letter from Governor Odeil inform <nr him that there had been filer! with th» Execu th» a. petition and affidavits asking the Governor to t=et aside the sentence of Patrick McCarthy on the ground that the District Attorney had used improper means to obtain the conviction of the man. To these Mr. Merrill was asked by the Gov ernor to respond. In answer, Mr. Merrill wrote to th« Governor, asking that he do nothin? in the c«f c until time had elapsed for him to file a definite and detailed reply- A similar notice was sent to County Judge Harrison K. Moore, who was the trial judge who sentenced McCarthy, originally. Mr. M^rri'l. in speaking of the case, said: - In McCarthy's case I do not see that any illegal means were employed. McCarthy was fairly tried and convicted, and justly sentenced. The case has be*n carried up by Abraham Levy. McCarthy s count*!, and without any tjreat effort on the part of the People the verdict and sentence have been sustained. " There was apparently not a single loophole for escape, for had there been the coun sel for McCarthy would have seen to It that his client obtained the benefit of it. I have heard that McCarthy knows nothing of th« new step in the case. My personal opinion is that hi? friends have been overzealoue. Some of them. I understand, also regret the measure taken, and wish to with draw it. If they want clemency and a pardon they had better have gone about it differently. As soon a.- I received the notice from the Governor I di rected that McCarthy's bondsman surrender him. and this was done He is now in jail. I shall move that the sentence imposed, a year In the Kings County penitentiary, be carried out. I will give McCarthy credit for one thing. Since his con viction the character of his place has changed, and, despite statements that I have seen in print, reports by my detectives se-m to show that there has been no" serious violation of the law there. Still, good conduct bow does not atone for trans treFEions in the past. McCarthy, when seen, said be knew nothing ■ bout the steps taken by his friends in bringing his case, before Governor Odell. Patrick McCarthy kept a hotel in Borflen-ave., "Lone Island City. Mr. Merrill In person, with a fsree of private detectives, made a. raid on his ylace. In doing this the District Attorney went over the heads of the police. A few days later there was a shakeup of detectives, including the man then assigned to Mr Merrill's office. Mr. Mer rill ascribed this to a desire to punish them for not knowing what wa« going to happen. In con nection with this there was a long-range wordy rattle between District Attorney Merrill and Dep uty Commissioner Dcvery, at ttet time Chief of ro"liee.

As the result of numerous conferences with leading citizens and of studying into the quali fications of men who have been brought to his attention as available candidates for office. Mayor-elect Low has decided on almost all of his appointments. But he does not wish to make his slate public until the latter part of this month, so that he may be able to substitute an other man In any place in case he finds that the one whom he first selected has marked disqual ifications. For instance, in the course of the last two or three days two men who' had been slated for certain offices have been dropped because Mr. Low learned of facts concerning them which proved in his opinion that they ought not to have the appointments. The Tribune is ahl** to say on pood authority that Mr. Low is now considering the following slate, in which, of course, changes may be made later: Police Commissioner— Colonel JOHN' N.

That the office of City Chamberlain will be offered to Dr. K. R. 1.,. Gould is looked upon as almost certain by members of the Citizens Union, and it is said that Dr. Gould is being supported by the Citizens Union as an organiza tion. From sources that may be relied on it was learned that James R. Sheffield will ac cept the office of Fire Cimmissioner. which was offered to him soon after the election, as told in The Tribune at the time. George Sears Greene is being: backed for the office of Dock Commissioner by influential friends who say that Mr. Greene is fitted for the place by his previous experience in the Pock Department as an engineer. Dr. Wood bury, who is now most prominently mentioned for Street Clean ing: Commissioner, is a physician and a profes sor in the Cornell University Medical College. He was employed to clean the streets of Ponce, Porto Rico, and thus has the training: from practical work in the sanitation and cleaning of streets. William Berri was president of the board of trustees which had supervision of the Brooklyn Bride? before the present charter went into effect. Dr. Ernst J. Lederle has been urged for the office of Health Commissioner by many physicians and other citizens of the East Side. A delegation of rabbis who called upon Mr Low in his behalf said that he had a thor ough understanding of the sanitary condition of the East Side tenement houses. Dr. I.ederle is the chemical expert in the Halrh Dpartrr.ent. The story that Thomas A. Fulton, secretary of th* Citizens Union, was to be appointed Water Commissioner, which was published yesterday, did not meet much credence among members of the Citizens Union. It was said that Mr. Fulton had been mentioned for another office, but that the executive committee did not wish its salaried officers to become candidates for municipal places. DR. 

GOULD FOR CHA MBERLALX THE CITIZENS UNION* URGING MAYOR ELECT LOW TO AFrOIKT HIM. Dr. E. R. L. Gould, treasurer of the Citizens Union and president *>f the City and Suburban Homes Company, may be the next City Cham berlain. Dr. Gould will receive th" solid support of the Citizens Union organization, and If selected will be Its chief representative in the new administration. It was learned yesterday that the strongest in fluence was being exerted to secure Dr. Gould's appointment. In the last week there have been several sessions of the executive committee of the Citizens Union, of which F. C. Hnntinpton is chairman, and Dr. Gould's candidacy for City Chamberlain has been th» chief matter under consideration at these meetings. As a result of these conferences. Dr. Gould's name has been presented to Mayor-elect Low, and It la gen erally believed that Mr. Low regards the matter favorably. A prominent member of the Citizens Union v.ho is in close touch with the situation said to a Tribune reporter last night: "The Citizens Union people feel that they should have a representative in the new admin istration, and so far they haven't one. James B. Reynolds was not appointed as a Citizens Union man. He was appointed secretary solely through Mr. Low's personal friendship for him. "Dr. Gould has been an. untiring worker. As treasurer he has given both his time and his best effort to the success of the Citizens Union, and has the support of the entire organization from Mr. Cutting down. He is regarded as a man eminently fitted for the office. His study of social and economic problems, as well as his practical experience as president of the- City and Suburban Homes Company, will make him a highly efficient public official." Dr. Gould is a native of Canada. He received his degree at Johns Hopkins University, and was a professor in the University of Chicago. In 1 *<r>4 he made a study of social conditions abroad for the United States Government. In IBf*(i he became president of the City and Suburban Homes Company, which has for its object the providing of suitable homes for wage earners, and has erected a number of model tenement houses in this city.

C. U. CITY COMMITTEE ELECTION. The city committee of the Citizens Union will hold its annual meeting for the election of officers this evening. There has been no announcement as to the probable selections that have been made for officers, but the fact that the present vice chairman. Ludwic Nissen. is no longer a member of the city committee will make if impossible Ear this officer to succeed himself. There have been several men proposed for his successor, but it is likely that the office will so to a representative irntn the Brooklyn delegation. The newly elected chairman will appoint an executive committee, who will practically be in charge of the union and its policies.

At five minutes after midnight the seventh six day International bicycle team race, held at Mad icon Square Garden, under the auspices of the American Cycle Racing Association, was started. The starting bignal-a pistol «hot-was given by "Young Corbett," the conqueror of Terry 31c- Govern. About an hour prior to starting on their long Journey the members of the teams who took part 'in the opening ■of the struggle tor th « honors of the contest were asleep in the little tents built to house them, and their trainers throughout the week near the Fourth-aye entrance to the Garden. Alcoholic baths were quickly given to most of them, and after the baths they took liquid or solid foods that were not likely to cause them Indigestion. Then they donned their vari colored racing costumes and appeared on the track. Good reports about the condition of all those who were expected to be contestants were heard. Near every trainer felt confident that his team would make a fine showing, and told interesting tales of the wondrous prowess of these under their care. These tales are not uncommon at the beginning of a six day team race. But by to-morrow night lamentations from some of the men on the track or from those whom they have asked to help keep them in condition and to give them advice and en couragement will probably be heard. The prises this year will be as follows: First team $1,500; 'second team. $1,000: third team, $.00. fourth u-am. $500; fifth team. $3oO; sixth team. J2oo, and seventh tram, $159.

Magee pathological department of Mercy Hos pital, has discovered what has every indication of being a successful s«rum treatment for te tanus, or lockjaw. After a year of patient ex perimenting on lower animals, the doctor within the last three weeks had the opportunity of testing his theory on human subjects— a middle aged man. a middle aged woman and a boy ten years of age. According to the phy sician's statement, when these patients were fiist given the Injections of the serum they -were violent, being in spasm* and convulsions.

ANTI-ANARCHT LEGISLATION PLANNED BY THE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION. The fact that the assassination of President McKmley took place in the State of New-York has been the cause of a movement for legislation at the State Capitol this winter which will not only mak>' the crime of an attempt on the life of tht President punishable v.ith an unusual pen alty, but will also practically drive anarchists out of this State. This movement has now crys tallized t<> such ar extent that Colonel George W. Dunn, chairman of the Republican State Committee, announced yesterday that the Re publican organization would put through some such meafure. "Anarchy must be stamped out," said Colonel Dunn. "The lives of the officers of our country must be protected. Some measure will be passed which will punish anarchistic at tempts on the lives of our officials and which will m-> discourage anarchist'e. meetings that the 'reds' will find it too hot to stay here."
