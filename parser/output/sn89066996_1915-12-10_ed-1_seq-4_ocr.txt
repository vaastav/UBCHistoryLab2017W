MARION A. RHODES, PreHident. Entered as second class matter at the Post Office at Farmington, Missouri. $1.00 PER YEAR PAYABLE IN ADVANCE The President's message to I of our state has never been loot- Congress is clear, vigorous, pa triotic and statesmanlike. Our readers will find it in this issue of The Times. Read and study. The country is prosperous. Keep that fact in mind, though our standpat. Republicans are wishing that it wasn't, and they are trying to make themselves think it isn't. You may know who is hit by the President's condemnation of a certain sentiment of disloyal ty in the country by the fellows who are howling at him for dar ing to treat of it in his message. President Wilson and Mrs Norman Gait of Washington City are tobe united in marriage on the 18th inst. Thev have re ceived many invitations, mostly from the South, to visit various localities on their honeymoon. We take off our hat and con gratulate St. Louis. She gets the National Democratic Con vention, by the decision of the National Democratic Committee, which met in Washington City last Tuesday. The date set for the convention is June 14 ,1916. There will be Democratic and Republican State Conventions in March or April to elect delegates to the National Conventions of the two parties, as these con ventions do not come within the requirements of the State pri mary. But the several parties may elect their delegates to these State conventions by pri mary if they so elect. In the opinion of both of the living former Presidents, form er Ambassadors, Governors, presidents of leading universi ties and colleges, and men of big business, to say nothing of the great influential common people, are of one opinion, that the question of national prepared ness is one that rises above par ty. While a dominant adminis tration measure, it will be fought out outside of party lines. I about July, 1913, contracted to sell the output of their mines ed but once and that was away back yonder in the '60s under the old Republican Draconian re gimi3 so far back in the history of the State that it has almost been forgotten. You are hardly old enough to have taken cog nizance of the transaction and have perhaps never read about it. "Comparisons are Odorous.' So remarked Shakespeare's pedantic constable, Dogberry, and comparisons do oftener than otherwise give out an odor that reminds one that the other side of the question may have a sweeter smell. Our esteemed neighbor, The News, following the practice of Republican pa pers in general, has fallen upon a comparison that strikes us as not altogether germane. In speaking of the St. Joseph Lead Company's notice that it would pay off its outstanding bonds not due until January 1, 1918, on the first of next Janu ary, it says : "We are glad to see the St. Joseph Company and in fact all the local lead companies prospering, even if it did take the greatest war in history to boost the price of lead up to about its normal price under a Republican administration." The inference to be drawn from this observation is that under Republican administra tions that is under a high pro tective tariff the normal price of lead was $5.25 per hundred, the present price of lead on the East St. Louis market. This can hardly be admitted as a fact. Ever since the Republican panic of 1907 the price of lead has been fluctuating between $3.00 and $4.00. That was the nor-; mal price under Republican ad ministrations, not the present price, which we are free to ad mit is due in some measure to! the demand created by the Eu ropean war. It is said on good authority that the St. Joseph and the Doe Run Lead Companies, which are practically one company, along were prior to the beginning of the European war for during the last three months of the year Mr. Crane tells us that tho mills were operated at only 75 per cent of their capacity. We are now told that the com pany will redeem on January 1, 1916, the entire issue of its 6 per cent gold notes, not due un til January 1, 1918, and amount ing to $1,982,000 or only $434, 724.67 more than their net in come for practically the first nine months of 1914, under a Democratic administration, when the European war was a matter of mere speculation. If with lead at $74 a ton, which Mr. Crane says was the price of lead in 1914, a net income of one and a half million dollars was realized, what a bonanza the lead companies are now having with lead at about $105 a ton, and what a stupendous net pro fit they must be coining" out of the horrors of the European war! Yes, like our neighbor, The News, we are glad to see our lo cal lead companies prospering, but our concern for them is not greater than it is for the large mass of humanity who are not able to pay off the notes and mortgages contracted during Republican prosperity two or three years in advance of the date they fall due. The clear analysis of the ship purchasing bill, which will be an important measure before the for the following six months at about $3.35, while the Republi can Payne-Aldrich tariff was present Congress, to be found onfetill in force. That, also, is the another page, will prove an inter-; year we believe of the last strike eating and instructive article to i for better wages, which while the readers of The Times.

The St. Joseph Lead Company, says a New York paper with ap parent official authority, will re deem on January 1, 1916, the entire issue of its 6 per cent gold notes, due January 1, 1918 now outstanding, and amount ing to $1,982,000. The notes will become due and payable at the office of Bankers Trust Com pany to 101 per cent of the prin cipal amount and accrued inter est to January 1, after which in terest will cease. We also learn on the best of authority that the Doe Run Lead Company, which is an affiliated company of the St. Joseph, paid on November 15 of this year a dividend of $2.00 on each share of its stock and will pay another dividend of $6.00 on each share on the 15th of this month. in 191.5 tne amliated com panies contracted the output of their mines for six months ahead at $3.35 per hundred. That year, in the settlement of a strike, they agreed upon a scale of wages advancing their em ployes' wages 25 cents a shift. With lead now selling at S5.25 on the East St. Louis market, and the decided prosperity which the foregoing statements show, how much of an increase in wag es ought the miners of these companies now be receiving, and how much of an advance are they receiving? 

SOUTHEAST NEWS Ste. Genevieve's oldest inhabi tant was 93 years old last Mon day. Mr. Frank Papin is en joy ing excellent health and gets around in a surprisingly lively manner without the aid of a cane. He smokes his pipe as of yore, takes his "dram" regular ly, and saws and splits wood. He is an honorary member of the Guiannee since its organization and most heartily enjoys mak ing the rounds with "the boys" yearly, all of whom hope that he may be spared to them for many years to come, a connecting link between past and present.
