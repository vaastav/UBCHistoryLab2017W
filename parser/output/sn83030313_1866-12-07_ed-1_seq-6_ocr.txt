Tbe action was basod upon letters patent for an Improvement in tbe manufacture of cannon te restrain tbe defoodant from aa iufrtngement of the same. The terms of the patent to tlie plaintiff are set forth, and tbo mode of construct ing cannon on tbe specification of the reissued patent Tbe invention claimed is then detailed at length, as well as rbo principles which led to Then follows a review of the several improvements in the art of making im proved cannon, Judge Nelson closing bis decision as fol lows:?"The improvement of tbe cast iron gun, with wrought iron hoops or rings, claimed by the complain ant will be found on tbe fourth patent, and upon this ground a decreo must be entered for tbe defendant dis missing the bill."

Kennord et aL vs. Ben Halli day otal. was yesterday submitted to the Jury, who, after a short absence, came into court with a verdict for the plaintiffs In the full amount, $10,000, with Interest from January, I860. Tbe defendant is principal agent of the Overland Stage Company, to whom a parcel of money? the $10,000 referred to in tbe action?was consigned for delivery by tbe Untied States Express Company. Tho transfer of tbe parcel containing the money was proved, and its possession traced to the defendants, from whose agent it was taken by the In dians, but afterwards recovered and lost, or at least it never again came into the possession of tho plaintiffs. It was contended that they (defendants) were not carriers of va uabie articles, and also that the package of money was taken from their custody by a band of Indiana, public enemies to the United Statos. Tbe points were fully argued, but the ruling of tbe Court and the decision of tho jury fixes tbe liability of carriers. Mr. Buggies for defendants, Mr. Larecque for plaintiffs. Importune Custom House Case. Before Judge Smalley. Bernkard and Mutton vs. Augustus ScheU.?Thia case, which is brought to recover custom duties paid under protest, was opened by counsel for the plaintiff who proceedod to submit the points of law on which the action is based, but had not concluded at the adjourn ment of the court. The case is an Important one, and tho result will effect many other pending oases of a like character. The District Attorney, Mr. Courtney, assisted by Mr. Ethan Allen, appear for tbe government. UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER'S COURT. Charge of Illegal Distillation?A Witness Com mitted to Prison for Contempt of Court. Before Commissioner Osborn. The United States vs. Mitchell and another.?The defend ants were charged by a man calling himself J. Frank Stewart, alias Goodwin, with having illegally carried on tbe manufacture of whiskey at 159 West Twenty-seventh street. Stewart stated that defendants were proprietors of tho place, and that by their direction he shipped from the plocu at night from nine to twelve barrels of r*ra. In cross-examination by Mr. Charles Donoboe, who appeared for tbe defendants, Stewart said he bad been dealing in faro, tbat he bad been keeping a bar for other people and tbat he had enlisted in the army. He declined to say how often. He first stated he had nothing to do with tho defendants excopt as to this whiskey and in faro arrangements, and then declined to answer whether be had not obtained advances from them as the pledge or articles. Tho Commissioner committed tho witness to prison for conteafpt of coart for twonly-four hours. The witness had been committed to jail for a similar term on Tuesday, for declining to answer questions put to him in cross-examination. SUPREME COURT?CIRCUIT?PART II. Present Mr. Justice Clerke. This conrt convened at the usnol boar yesterday morn ing for the transaction of business, and tbe room was densely crow ded with counsellors and attorneys, anx iously awaiting a bearing for their cause* Mr. Justice Clerke was then informed that tbe printed calendars for tho use of the bench and bar had not been furnished as usual, and tlie court was, consequently, compelled to adjourn until to-day. In about bitlf an hour after the adjournment the calendars came to band. It is a well known fact that tbe Supreme Court is overcrowded with business, and it Is a matter of regret that it sbould be further retarded by such neglect or omission on tbe part of those who. by their monopoly, are enabled to reap such large pecuniary advantages from tho labor which they havo undertaken to perform for the public. 

COURT OF OYER AND ERMINEB. CUftrfp to the (Jrand Jury?Reformation of Onr Municipal Corruption*. Before Justice (). O. Barnard. Id this court the panel of Grand Jurors was called yesterday morning and Mr. James L. Hyatt appointed foreman. Judge Barnard then proceeded to charge the Grand Jury and enumerated the various statutes to whiob their attention would be called, stating that It was not Im probable that many of them had previously served as Gracd Jurors, and those ,who had not had doubtless read charges to Grand Juries, and were therefore familiar with the nature and sub stance of such. He was required, however, to call their attentiou to the statutes for their deliberations. Ho th<n proceeded to inform them that bo liad prepared a charge to be delivered to them, but that upon reflection he had concluded to suppress It. rills Charge nminly related to the <orruptness of our city Corporation and municipal officers, and his motive for withholding it was that it wqs impossible for one singlo man, unaided and alone, to contend successfully against tbe corrupt influences at work In this city. Hereaf ter he would act through the Clilsen*' Association, an organiza tion composed of gentlemen <4 wealth, Intellect and In tegrity. This body was capable of aiding him In effect ing to a great extent a reformation of the glaring abuses to which he referred, and he would avail himself of their services collectively In the furtherance of his object Ho would oppose these abuses by injunction and mandamus, as well as such other means as shall be proper and Justifiable in such cases. He then in a few words Instructed the Jurors to observe discretion in tbe pursuance or their duties, snd suggested to them that it was advisable for them not to mention the object or naturo of tbe business before them outside of their offi cial deliberations. Tbe Grand Jury then retired to undertake the prose cution of their labors, after which the court adjourned until this morning at ten o'clock. COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS. Before Recorder HackelL.

The testimony agsinst Robertson was clesr, for not only were burglars' tools found on his person, but a portion of the stolen property. Donohue war in his company when arrested; but as there wee nothing found on him, and as he proved a good character, the Jury gave him the beneAl of tho doubt end rendered a verdict of not guiltv. John Bcolt, who was indicted for burglary In tbe first degree. In entering the dwelling house of Peter A. H. Jackson on the Ittlh of October, pleaded guilty to tbe third grade of that offence.

Before Judge A. D. Russel. MeViekwr vt. Bang The case of John McVlckar against H. J. Bang has finally been decided by Judge Russel in favor of Mr. Bang. The case arose from the landlord Instituting proceedings to remove the tenant from possession of the premises No. 231 Broadway, which had been partially destroyed by fire in the spring of 1300, on the ground that being thus destroyed the lease under the provisions of the same was terminated. The decision of Judge Kusael in favor of the defendant Bang establishes his rights under the lesso to the con tinued possession of the premises for the term originally provided. Messrs. Sherwood, Nelson and Birdsall appeared for the landlord, and William Follerton and C. A. Arthur fer the tenant. The premises about which the controversy arose are those formerly occupied by Mr. Bang as a res taurant. The above action explains to our citizens the reason for the neglected condition of the building about which there has been so much remark. COURT CALENDAR?THIS DAY. ftcPMMs Court?

For somo time past the authorities of the Post Office Department In this city havo been receiving numerous complaints about missing registered letters, in which wore enclosed, in all instances, various amounts of money. The result was of coarse to Increase the vigi lance of the higher officials, who, after close watching, got reason to suspect a certain young man In the office as the delinquent This young man, whose name, for certain prudential reasons, cannot at present be men tioned, Is most respectably connected, and has for a long time been employed In the newspaper bagging de partment of the Post Office. His duties were to bag the packages of newspapers, bat among those, whon the Da^e are emptied, letters are often found mixed with the newspapers, which are returned to thsipropor department m.V"! JC?r C<? ? cornet on the part of this young man led Mr. Gaylor, special agent of the Post Office De pertinent, to suspect he did not do, but qn the contrary carried tliern to his room, there selected the registered letters, taking out their contents and returning the olh ers of no value lo their proper places. This was of course but a suspicion: a watch was then set upon his action, which resulted in his being seen to secrete a package of let,era and afterwards select VomTwme that were registered. He was about leaving the offlco ^'it wA8 ?"PPed and brought into a private room, where were Mr Ga.vlor and one or two officials, and on being searched a registered letter and a bank book were found in his possession.

ALLEGED DISTILLERY FRAUDS. Contlnuntion of tbe Examination of Wit. nesHOH?The Prosecution (Honed, ?fce. Before Commissioner Newton. Tho examination of the case or the United Stales, vs. Messrs. Angus, Scbwabins, Rowe and Boehm, for alleged manufacture of alcohol under the namb of "burning fluid," was continued yesterday, In Brooklyn, belorj Commissioner Newton. The flret witness called by the prosecution was Dr. Squibb, who testifled substantially as follows ? TFJiTIXOST or PS. t R. HQI'IHR I reside at 110 Colombia street, Brooklyn; am a prac tical chemist ; am casually acquainted w.th burning Hold; burning fluid Is practically made by mixing alcohol and turpentine; I do not know of any floid madu with less per rentage of turpentine than twenty per cent alcohol must be rectified to about nincty-flvo per cent to cut or dlsso re turpentine; burning fluid is a complete solution and not a mixture, at least as a commercial article; tho whole of it will burn without a diminution or illumination: when an excess of turpentin - Is added to a solution tbe turpentine wonld bo consumed In the greatest quantity, the alcohol in tbe next greatest and water in tbe least; there 1s a proportion of the three which Is not inflammable. Mr. Dlttenhoercr hero requested that a portion of common burning fluid should be placed in a lamp, a por tion of the article In dispute in another, both set burn ing and presented to the doctor, to see if he could distin guish between them. This was done, and thfe lamps w?ir P burning on the Commissioner's desk. Witness?The fluid given me by Cochite and Mead was a mixture of water, alcohol and turpentine, with the im purities usually produced in tho distillation of grain consisting of not more than ten per cent and not less tbun four per c nt of spirits of turpentine; the spirit was about seventy-two por cent; the substance was not a burning fluid; tbe turpentine can be very easily sepa rated ; the method adopted was to dilate It with its bult of water and distil It; when it wax distilled no trace of turpentine remained. The witness here gam a detailed account aa to the specific heat of turpentine, alcohol and water, and continued as follows :?A burning fluid can not be produced by a single distillation, because the alcohol does not come over apfflciently rtr.ing to dissolve tbe turpentine; the last part of such distillation would contain tittle if aav turpentine, to make burning flu-d would require a subsequent mixing; to free it ir?m tbe turpentine would simply require exira distillation, the cost of which would be trifling; my judgment is that the fluid presented to me would not all burn in an ordinary lamp; a lamp might be arranged to vaporise tbe water Croas-examlnedI by Mr. Dittenhoefer?I never bought or sold burning fluid as a business; have no personal knowledge of the market ; never beard of making burn ing fluid by distillation before tho law; tbe substance being In lbs lamps wonld not ba taken ss whiskey or hlgbwinee; I could not call it other than an Inflammable liatild. Redirect examination?To pat turpentine In the mash would prevent fermentation and tbe prodnotlon of al cohol; pare alcohol baa vary little illuminating power: in the maab before fermentation there la nothing to dis solve alcohol; the amount of turpentine dissolved la pro iwrtlonate to the amoont of alcohol present; distillation makes no difference in tne solubility of turpentine la alcohol. Mr. Frederick Cochue was the next witness called and teetifled to the leisure of certain barrels of burning fluid In n lighter at the foot of South Eleventh street. Williamsburg, and tbnt from those samples wore taken in bottles and sent to the District Attorney. Dr. Hquibb recalled?I have never b-en n distiller of whiskey; am familiar with redistillations; I state the effect of turpentine on better authority than my own - tbe substance lelt after separating the turpentine from the liquid, In my experiments, tasted like dirty water aod alcohol; that left alter distillation of burning fluid would taste like clesn alcohol and water; oonld not aay what quantity of turpentine would stop formuotntlon. issMKwr its jown Toanrr. Examined by District Attorney for prosecution?1 have been a chemist for thirty years; I had four bottles from you, Mid to be burning fluid; they were mixture* of alcohol, water and apirttn of turpentine, they averaged about eighty per etat of alcohol; I estimated tho por cent of turpentine to be not over Ave per cent; I would not call the specimen shown m* burning fluid; I hare made fluid myself; the elronger tbe alcohol the more turpentine It took up; leas than (an per cent would not make a good light; I found that good fluid gave foflr times the same light that the article brought to me did - the article brought me gave only aliout one flfM> the light of the standard sperm candle; ths ordinary bant ing fluid Is equal to about three-foartbx of s candle tbe sample brought me would not do for ordinary light.' < roes-examined by Mr. Dltienboefer?I should call the light burning a poor light; tbe stair burning in them would not be called wblekey or higbwines; I never l>ongot or sold burning fluid; there la tur|>entiu* in both of the lamps wblch have been burning. Mr. Dittenhoefer here made the admission that the ar ticle tested by Mr. Torrey was the same ss that taken from the barrels seized, and tbe District Attorney rested hie cose. Mr. Dittenhoefer then opened the defence by railing Mr. Monroe, who teetifled subetantislly as follows:? namnoivY or a. m. mosrok. I have bought and sold burn-ng fluid; I should call tbe substance in tboee two small lamps burning fluid 1 should not call whiskey burning fluid; would' buy the article in those lamps for burn ing fluid; should not think that an article would require to be better than that to be sold in tbe market ss burning fluid; It Is not Ihe quantity of tbe component parts of tbe mixture, but the light It glvee; no man would make any diflerenee between an article or burning flnld, If it gave a good light, that con tained ten per cent of turpentine and one that had only flee; whiskey or high wines are not known In tbe mar ket as burning fluid; I have known burning fluid to be made in tbe oTd way with ten per cent of turpentine Thin witness was crom examined at considerable length by tbe District Attorney, but nothing new wno elicited. The case was then adjourned until to-day at half past nine o'clock A. M. THE STEARKHIF SCOTLANO. Report of tho Mario* Nwrvevor. Mr. Samuel Harding, Marino Surveyor at thle port, yesterday surveyed the steamship Scotland, now lying sunk at Band?

The aft end, sky lights, Ac. are entirely washed away. The ship la la all respects a complete wreck and will prove a total lees.
