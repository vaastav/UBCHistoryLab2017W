DIARYMAN: Do You Ever Stop To Think What It Means To You When We Pay You $1.30 Per Hun dred For 3.5 Milk at Your Own Farm Door? Have You Ever Figured Out How Much Bigger Your Milk Check Would Be at Our Price Than It Is at Our Competitor's? We Merely Ask You To Read Over Carefully This Article and To Figure Out For Yourself What There Is In It For You. American OT IKE as Tho Test We not only pay you $1.30 per hundred at your own door for 3.5 milk, but we pay you 3 cents additional tor each one-tenth of one per cent, above 3.5. Look over this table. These are our milk prices at your door. 6.0. 3.C. .3.7. 3.8. 3.9. 4.0. 4.1. 4.2. 4.3. 4.4. 4 5. 4.0. 4.7. 4.8. 4.0. 5. . 5.5. 6. . Compare these with the prices paid you by our com petitor's last week. First, look at your test figure. If it is 3.5 he paid you $1.15, less 10 cents for'collecting. If it is 4. he paid you $1.30, less 10 cents for collecting. If it is 4.5 he paid you $1.45, less 10 cents for collecting. If it is 5. he paid you 81.60, less 10 cents for collecting. You may have some personal contract whereby you get some other price. He has a dozen different prices. But we are taking his regular price. We have one price for all. Now where he pays you $1.05 for 3.5 per cent, milk, we pay you $1.30. Where he pays you $1.20 for 4. per cent, milk, we pay you $1.45. Where he pays you $1.35 for 4.5 per cent, milk, we pay you $1.60. WThere he pays you $1.50 for 5. per cent, milk, we pay you $1.75. Our 3.5 per cent, milk brings more than his 4.3 milk. Our 4. per cent, milk brings more than his 4.8 milk. Our 4.5 per cent, milk brings more than his 5.3 milk. Our 5. per cent, milk brings more than his 5.8 milk. Who pays the most? But he will tell you that our tests do not run above 3.5 per cent. Just read over this partial list of our pat rons. We can furnish you with many more just like them. These men are all living in the immediate vicinity of Owosso. Many of them are your neighbors. Call them up onthe phone. Ask them where ever you meet them. Ask them if these figures are correct. This list is taken from our last week's prices. What lh NAHE. TE5T Milk NAHE. Brought W. Cooper 4.2 S1.51 J. Newell B. Sweetland 3 8 1 39 J, Little J. Waterman 5. 1.75 E Bilhimer J.

NICARAGUAN TROUBLE. Irresponsible nations Not Pro tected by Monroe Doctrine. A DEFICIT OF $73,075,600. Legislation Urged Against In junctions Without Notice. Washington, Dec. 7. In his annual message, read to congress, President Taft said: To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations of the United States 'with all foreign governments have con tinued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Europe. The American rights in the fisheries on the north Atlantic coast under the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference be tween the United States and Great Britain for nearly seventy years. The interests involved are of great impor tance to the American fishing industry. and the final settlement of the contro versy by the permanent court of ar bitration at The llague will remove a source of coustant Irritation and com plaint. This is the first case Involving such great international questions which has boon submitted to the per manent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser vation and protection of the fur seals in the north Pacific are In progress with the governments of "Great Britain, Japan and Russia. The attitude of the governments interested leads me to hope for a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome of the negotiations. The Near East. The quick transition of the govern ment of the Ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a consti tutional government with a parlia ment and with progressive modern policies of reform and public Improve ment Is one of the important phenome na of our times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to have made further advance in Fersla. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon tho near east In that quarter the prestige of the United states has spread widely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There is every reason why we should obtain a greater share of the commerce of the near east since the conditions are more favorable now than ever before. Latin America. One of the happiest events In recent pan-American diplomacy was the pa cific, independent settlement by the governments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between them, which for some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain im bittermenls affecting other republics 'ss directly concerned. Our Citizens Abroad. This administration, through the de partment of state and the foreign serv ice, is. lending all proper support to legitimate and beneficial American en terprises In foreign countries, tho de gree of such support being measured by the national advantages to be ex pected. A citizen himself cannot by contract or otherwise divest himself of tho right, nor can this government cscapo the obligation, of his protec tion In his personal and property rights when these are unjustly In fringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations it Is proper that in considering whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support ed In n particular country tho govern ment should givo full weight tot only to the national as opposed to the Indi vidual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the govern ment of tho country in question U in its administration and In Its diplomacy faithful to the principles of modera tion, equity and Justice upon which alone depends international credit in diplomacy as well as in finance. - , The Monroo Doctrine. The pan-American policy of this government has long been fixed iu Its prin.iples and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable govern "ot and progressive Ideals, the an prehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other doc trine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of irresponsible government, the escape of Just obligations or the insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexican soil served, I hope, to signalize the close and cordial rela tions which so well bind together this republic and the great republic imme diately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of material Interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July 30, 1900, the government of Panama agreed, after considerable ne gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having, indeed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. This government was obliged to In tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nica ragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept. 18, 1000. Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the Interests in the American claim of AIsop & Co. against the government of Chile. The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and hud prom ised this government to settle it. There had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of Jurisdiction. Now, happily, as tho result of the re cent diplomatic negotiation?, the gov crument3 of the United States aud of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes- Edwnrd VII. Tho Nicaraguan trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1007 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another and in turn by all of the five Central Amer ican republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Near ly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant tension or turmoil. The re sponses made to the representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of its relation to the Washington conven tions have been .at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far as possi ble, any semblance of interference, al though it is very apparcut that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American interests in Ceutral America give to the United States a special position in the zone of these republics and the Caribbean sea. I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fully appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests. It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were otli cers in the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks and was in control of about half of the republic, aud as such, ac cording to tne modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war. At the date when this message is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and is intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American in terests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may later be necessary fof me to bring this subject to the attention of the congress In ji fpecial message. In tho Far East. In the far oast this government pre serves unchanged its policy of support lug the principle of equality of oppor-' tunity aud scrupulous respect for .the Integrity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged tho interest ed powers of both east nud west. By the treaty of 1003 China has un dertaken the abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the customs trrlff along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantage to foreign commerce as well as to the interests of China, this government is endeavoring to facili tate these measures and the needful acquiescence of the treaty powers. When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project it was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have a certain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms In question. The administration deem ed American participation to be of great national interest. Happily, when It was as a matter of broad policy ur gent that this opportunity should not be lost, the indispensable instrumental ity presented itself when a group of American bankers of international reputation and great resources agreed at once to share in the loan upon pre cisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway ma terial should be upon an exact equality with that of the other nationals Join ing in the loan in the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. In one of tho Chinese-Japanese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there was a provision which caused consid erable public apprehension in that upon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Muk- den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise, to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough examination of the conven tions and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that no such monop oly was Intended or accomplished. This government mado inquiry of the imperial Chinese and Japanese gov ernments and received from each offi cial assurauco that the provision had no purpose inconsistent with the poli cy of equality of opportunity to which, tho signatories, in common with tho United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with tho Japanese empire continue cordial, as usual. ( The arrangement of 1908 for a co-operative control of the" coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. Tho matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which is terminable in 1012 is already receiving the study of both, countries. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested In the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the v reorganization of the department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly ef ficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug, 5, 1000, I have appointed three officials to assist the ofiicers of the government in collecting information uecessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug. 5, 1000. As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of the treasury department and as to matters of the needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with tho department of commerce and labor in its relation to the domestic aspect of tho subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of tho tariff act of Aug. 5, 1000, It becomes the ' duty of the secretary of state to con duct as diplomatic business all the negotiations neccssary to place him in a position to advise me ns to whether or not a particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. Government Expenditures and Rev enues. Terhaps the most important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June UU. 1010, will exceed the estimated re ceipts by $34,075,020. If to this deficit are added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $38,- 000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be in creased to a total deficit of $73,073,020. Thrs deficit the secretary proposes to . meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this pro posal. (Continued on page 12)
