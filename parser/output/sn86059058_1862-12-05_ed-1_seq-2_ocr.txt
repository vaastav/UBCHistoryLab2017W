A copy of the Appeal of the 25th No vember, now before ns, contains an arti cle on the subject of the contrabands now nt Cairo, which it credits to the In dianapolis Journal. We are confident it never appeared in the Journal, but the editors of the Appeal are sagacious enough to believe that this fraud will in crease the effect of the article on the de luded people of the South. The Granada Appeal is not half as much disposed to obey the behests of Beauregard as the State Sentinel, Cin cinnati Enquirer, Vinceunes Sun and oth er Butternut sheets at the North are. While these latter servilely obey the order to call all loyal men Abolitionists, the Grenada Appeal contents itself with calling the Union men of the North Black Republicans. Southern editors may be traitors, but they are not always sycophants. Correct lox.

The New New Albany Ledger, in speaking of the large number of officers off duty, makes the following pertinent and we'l-timed re marks about the manner in which Major Gen. Lew Wallace has been trifled with. We believe, with the Ledger, that it ;er, that it is due Gen. Wallace and his friends that an explanation should be made in the premises. The Ledger says: Among the high officers of the army who are thus, without any explained cause, detained from active dutv in the field is Major General Lew Wallace of Indiana, ltis true Gen. Wallace is Prcs dent of the Commission now sitting in Cincinnati, to inquire into the merits of Gen. Buell's campaign in Kentuckv. This duty is doubtless an important and honorable one, but one which could be discharged by some officer whose health or wounds will not permit him to take the field. Gen. Wallace was one of the very first to take the field after the commence ment of the war. He was repeatedly promoted, for gallant services, and why he should be detained from active duly at a time when the masses of the army are moving upon the enemy, we can not divine, if there is any good reason whv Gen. Wallace should be thus shelved, he and his friends ought to know what it is. If charges have been clandestinely made against him he and they ought to know wont they are. This is due to him and to the State from which he comes, and we hope our members of Congress will institute the proper inquiry. "The proceedings in Congres ye tcrday were without interest or signifi cance, for this reason and inconsequence of the great length of the President's message, which we publish this morning, we omit the Congressional report.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow- Citizens of thr &ate Attd iitmxe ofMeprcscitUtfires: Since your lift annual assembling, another year -of health and bountiful har vests hsy '""i-.sscd ; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a ; return of peace, we can but press on, ; -guided by the best light He gives us, I trusting that in His own good time and wise ways, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign ; affairs, which has taken place during the i last year, is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, made by the Hoise of Representatives, ; near the close of the last session of Con- i greas. If the condition of our relatious with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainlv more satisfactory than a na- ! tion so unhappily distressed as we are might reasonably have apprehended. In the month ot June last, there were some grounds to expect that the mari- time Powers, which, at the beginning ot our domestic difficulties, so unanimously and nr. necessarily, as wc think, recogniz ed the insurgents as a belligereut, would soon recede from that position, which has proved only less injurious to them selves than to our own country; but the temporary reverses which afterwards be fell the national arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal chil dren abroad, have hitherto delayed the act of simple justice. The civil war, which has so radically changed, for the moment, the occupation and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condi tions and affected very deeply, the pros perity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce, that has been steadily increasing lliroughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same time, excited political ambitious aud ap prehensions, which have produced a pro found agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual ngitation, we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign States, and between parties or factious in such States. We have attempted no propa gniuiism, and acknowledged no revolu tion, lint wc have left to every nation the exclusive management and conduct of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations, with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often ex aggerated effects, and the consequence resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of , l , ' . r.nt'n.iininnt if , 1 wma , I , f would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknow ledge that the execution of it on the part ot Her Majesty's Government has been mai ked by a jealous resrpect for the au thority of the United States and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The Convention with Hanover for the abolition of the Stout dues has been car ried into full effect under the act of Con gress for that purpose. A blockade of llirce thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present with out committing occasional mistakes aud inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations aud their subjects. A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade, un der treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, r.nd possi bly, to produce mutual reclamations be tween nations which have a common in terest in preserving peace and friend ship. In clear cases of these kinds, I have, so far as possible, heard and re dressed COM plaints which have been pre- sented by friendly powers. There is, however, a large an1 angmenting num ber of doubtful cases, upon which the Government is unable to agree with the Governments whose protection is de manded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United Suites or their citizeus suffer w rongs from the naval or military au thorities of foreign nations, which the Governments of these States are not at I once prepared to redress. I have pro ' posed to some of the foreign St-.tes thus l interested, mutual conventions to exain ' ine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to i Great Britain, to France, to Spain and to ; Prussia. In each case it has been kind I ly received, but has not yet been forninl- ly adopted. I deem it my duty to re commend an appropriation in behalf of the owucrs of the Norwegian bark Ad miral P. Fordens Riolo, which vessel ! was. in Mar, 1801, prevented by the I commander of the blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with ! her cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the pa pers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees. Applications have been made to me bv many free Americans of African de scent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was con templated iu recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home aud abroad, some from interested motives, others upon pa triotic considerations, and still others in fluenced bv philanthropic sentiments, have suggested similurjneasures; while, on the other hand, several of the Span ish American Republics have protested atraiust the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. I nder these circumstances, I have declined to move any such colony to any State without and would lighten the burden oi mat first obtaining the consent of its Govern- ' part of the public debt employed as secu moni with nil an-recment on its nart to rities. The public credit, moreover, receive and protect such emigrants in all their rights as freemen, aud I have at the same time offered to the several States situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigra tion of persons of that class to their re spective territories upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go with the cer tainty of being received and adopted as citizens, and 1 regret to say that such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so"viHinr to eniiirate to those countries as" to'some others, nor so will- on f think that ii.toroat lipmiiniU 1 believe, however, the opinion among them in this respect is improving, and ' that ere lonr there will be au augment- I i i "i ii - v. .li eu ana consiaerauie emignmou io uwlu these countries from the L'nited States. The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Tur key has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's con sent, with Liberia, and a similar negotia tion is now pending with the Republic of Havti. A considerable improvement in the national commerce is expected to re sult from these measures. Our relations with great Britian, France, Spain. Portu gal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands. Italy. Rome, and the other European States, remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco. China and Japan. During the last year, there has not only been no change of our previous relatious with the independent States of our own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safetv and prom-ess are so inti- mately connected with ours Ibis state- ment speeiallv applies to Mexico. Costa Rica, Nicaragua, llouduras, Peru and Chili. The Commission under the Con vention with the Republic of New Grnna da closed its sessiou without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it A propo sition is ponding to revive the Conven tion, that it may be able to do more com plete justice. The Commission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connecting the United States with EurojKi by an Atlantic Telegraph, and a similar project to extend the tele graph from San Francisco to connect by a Pacific Telegraph with the wire which is being extended across the Russian Empire. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have re mained undisturbed by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidences of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a con dition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted into the Union. The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be devel oped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Govern ment, and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious con sideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests it self as most likely to be effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral re gions in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries results which can not fail to be auspicious. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenses incident to the milita ry and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hither to been met with a promptitude and cer tainty unusual in similar circuinstauces, and the public credit has been fully main tained. The continuance of the war, how ever, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field, demand your best reflec tions as to the best means of providing the necessary revenues without injury to business, and with the least possible bur dens upon labor. The suspension of specie payment by the banks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large issues of United States Notes unavoidable. In no other way could the pavnieut of the troops and the satisfac tion of other just demands, be so eco nomically aud as well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, secur ing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a ''legal tender" for other debts, has made them universal currency, and has satisfied, partially, nt least, and for the time, the longfelt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving theveby to the people immense sums iu discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with a due regard to all interest? should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain con vertibility into coin. is generally acknowl edged to be the best and surest safe guard against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States Notes, payable in coin, and suffi ciently large for the wants of the people, can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained. Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great advantages of a safe and uni form currency secured? I know of none which promises so cer tain results, and at the same time so un objectionable, as the organization of Banking Associations under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its pro visions. To such Associations, the Gov ernment might furnish circulating notes on the security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury. These notes, i prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, ; and facilitate commerce by cheap and ' safe exchanges. A moderate reservation ; from the interest on the bonds would ; compensate the United States for the 1 preparation and distribution ot tue notes, ', and a general supervision of the system, would be greatly improved, and the ne gotiations of new loans greatly facilitated bv the steady market demand for Gov ernment bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the oportunity offered to existing insti tutions to reorganize under the act, sub stituting only the secured uniform na tional circulation for the local and vari ous circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. The receipts into the Treasury from all so'Jiees, including loans and balance from . the preceding year, for the fiscal pndill" the 30 til of June, 1862, year were $jSo,N3,2-i7 00, of which sum $19,0oG,- 397 62 were derived from customs; $1, 79o,231 7-3 from the d reet tax; ftvui public lands, $152,203 77; from miscel laneous sources. $031,787 "64; from loans in ail farms, $")20,iV.'i40 &'.. There-: mainder, $2,257,HVi was the balance ; from the last year. The disbursements rhrring the same period were: For Con gressional, Executive and Judicial pur- poses, $5,939,009 29; for foreign inter-J course, $1,329,710 35; for miscellaneous ' expenses, including the Mints, Loans, ; Post Office deficiencies, collection of ; revenue and other like charges. 14.129. 771 50; fr expenses under the Interior j Department, $3,11.9X5 5'J: nuder the , War Department. 394.3tW.407 30; under the Navy Department, $42,074,509 09; ! for interest on the public debt, $13,190,- J 324 45. and for the ayment of the pub Ke debt, including re-imbursement of, temporary loans and redemptions, $90, 080.922 09; making an aggregate of; $570,841. 700 25, and leaving a balance in the Treasurv on the 1st dav of Julv, 1802, of $13,043,546 81. It should be observed that the sum of $90,090,922 09, expended for re-imbursements and re demption of the jniblic debt, being in cluded also in the loans made, may be properly deducted both from the receipts and expenditures, leaving the actual re ceipts for the year 9487,788,894 97, and the expenditures, $4 74.744, 788 10. Other information on the subject of the finances will fie found in the Report of the Secre tary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention. The Reports of the Secretaries of the Navy and War are herewith transmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transac tions and operations conducted through these Departments, nor couid I give a summary of them here upon any princi ple which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking your at tention to them. It gives me pleasure to report a de cided improvement in the financial con dition of the I'ost-Oifice Detriment as compared with several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,290 40, which em braced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three-quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of reve nue from the so-called Seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of he loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $S,299,N20 yo, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1801 was $13,000, 759 1 1. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,304 13, showing a decrease of about :?2,481.OO0 in the expenditures, as compared with the previous year, and about $3, 750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1800. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was $4,551,900 98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to 2. 112,814 57. These favorable. reiults are, in part, owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionarv States, and, in part, to a casual review of all expenditures in that Department, iu the interest of economy. I he efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Post master General also opened a correspon dence, through the Department of State, with foreign Governments, proosiiig a Convention of Postal Representatives, for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage, and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this countrv. has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the Governments from whom replies have been received. 1 ask the attention of Congress to the sugges tions of the Postmaster General iu his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service. The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands: "The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st of July. 1801, to the 30th of September, 1802, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were 8437.470 20, a sum much less than the expense of our land system during the same period. The Homestead Lav, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash can not be expected to an extent suffi cient to meet the expenses of the Gener al Land Office, and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market.'' The discrepancy bet ween the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the same derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department, arises, as I under stand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not, really, coincident at the beginning point the Treasury report including a considerable sura now which had previously been re ported from the Interior, sufficiently large to overreach the sum derived from the th.ree months now reported upon by the tnterior, and not by the treasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points hav engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vi cinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States, and en tered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the couutry. The Chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to en ter into treaties with the insurgents, and thatthe United States neglected to furn ish the protection which their treaty stipu lations required. In the month of August last, the Sioux Indiaus, in Minnesota, attacked the set tlements in their vicinity with extreme feroeitv, killing, indiscriminately men, women, and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no meansofdefen.se had been provided. It is estimated that not less than 800 per sons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced i not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be uujust, need not be staled. In formation was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upou the white settlement bv all the tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota has suffered great injurv from this Indian war. A large p' r ion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustainedby the destruction of property. The eople of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the lim its of the State, as a guarantee against further hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details, I submit for your especial considera tion, whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men have been impressed with the belief that this can be profitably done. I submit a statement of the proceed ings of the Commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific Railroad, aud this suggests the earliest completion of the road, and also the fa vorable action of Congress upon the pro jects now pending before them for enlarg ing the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especiaily to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I propose hav ing prepared and laid before you, at an early day, some interesting and valuable statistical information upou this subject The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and improving the Illinois River, is presented in the report of Col. Web ster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask attention to it. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the loth of May last, I have caused the Department of Agricul ture in the United States to be organized. The Commissioner informs me that with in the period of a few months this De partment has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchange, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introduction ot new products and in the collection of the agricultural statis tics of the several States. Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute large ly, seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will iu due time be furnished, em bracing some valuable testts in chemical science now in progress in the labora tory. The creation of this Department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, and become the fruitful source of advan tage to all our people. On the 22d day of September last, a proclamation was issued by the Execu tive, a copy of which is herewith submit ted. Iu accordance with the purpose ex pressed in the second paragraph of that iapcr, I now respectfully recall your at tention to what may be called " Compen sated Emancipation." A nation may be said to cousist of its territory, its people, and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. One generation passcth away and and anoth er generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever. It is of the first impor tance to duly consider and estimate this ever-enduring part The portion of the earth, s surface which is owned and in habited by the people ofthe Uuited States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, aud it is not well adapt ed for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climate and production are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might have been in form er ages. Steam and telegraphs, and intel ligence, have brought these to be an ad vantageous combination for one united people. In my Inaugural Address, I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of dis union as a remedy for the difference be tween the people of the two sections. I did so iu language which 1 cannot im prove, and which, therefore, I beg to re peat: "One section of our country be lieves slavery is right aud ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The Fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for suppression of the Afri can slave-trade are each as well en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry, legal obligations in both cases, and a few break over each. This, 1 think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than be fore. The foreign slave-trade, now im perfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one sec tion, while fugitive slaves, now only par tially surrendered, would not be surren dered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate; we can not remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out ofthe pres ence and bevond the reach of each other, j but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but re j main face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue be ! tween them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advanta 1 geous or more satisfactory after scpara ; tion than before? Can aliens make . treaties easier than friends can make ; laws? Can treaties be more faithfully I enforced between aliens than laws are : among friends? Suppose you go to war, i you cannot fight always; and when, after : much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, yon cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you." There is no line, straight or crooked, I suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through from Kai to West, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of its length are rivers easy to be crossed and popula ted thickly uon both sides, while nearly all its remaining lentgth are merely sur veyors' lines over whkli people may walk back and forth wMTout any consciousness oi" thsir presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parch , meut as a national bouuaarv. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section, the Fu. gitive Slave cliu along with bll other constitutional obligations upon the sec tion speeded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulations would ever be made to take its place. But there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghaniea, north by the British do minions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky. Ohio, Indi ana. Michigan. Wisconsin, Illinois, Mis souri. Kansr.s. Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, has about ten millions of people, and will have, fitly millions within tiftv vears. if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It con tains more than one-third ofthe country owned by the Uuited States, certainly, more than one million of square miles. If half as populous as Massachusetts al ready is, it would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the preat body ot the Re public. The other parts are but mar ginal borders ' to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in unde veloped resources. In the produc tion of provisions, grains, and grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion ofthe region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented: and yet this region has no sea coast, touches no ocean any where. As part of one nation, its peo ple now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, aud to Asia by San Francisco. But sep arate our common country into two na tions, as designed by the present rebel lion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrass ing and onerous trade regulations. And this is true wherever the dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky, or North of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any place north of it. and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a Government, foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of the three ma' be the best, is no proper question. All are better than either, and all of right belong to that people and their, successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world. They, too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of the West, without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary. Our national strife springs not from our permanent part, not from the land we inhabit, not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this, but would moitiplv, and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes, it demands union and abhors separation. In fact, it wouid ere long force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves, to the passing gen erations of men, and it can not, without convulsion, be hushed forever with the passing of one generation. In this view, I recommend the adop tion ofthe following resolution and ar ticles amendatory of the Constitution of the United States: Kesolced, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Leg islatures or Conventions of the several States, as Amendments to the Constitu tion ofthe United States, all of which Articles, when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures or Conventions, to be valid as a part or parts of the said Constitution, viz: Asruatl Every State wherein Slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the first dav of Januarv, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall receive compensation from the United States, as follows, to-wit: The President of the United Slates shall deliver to every such State bonds ofthe United States, bearing interest at the rate of for each slave shown to have been therein by (SM Klglith Cen sus of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such State by install ments, or in one parcel, at the comple tion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such States; and inter est shall begin to run npon uny such bond only from the proper time of its de livery as aforesaid and afterward. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterward introducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United Stales the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all the interest paid thereon. Article All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom, by the chances of the war, at any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolishment of sla very, but in such a way that no slave shall be twice accounted for. Article Congress may appro) 'riate nionev and otherwise provide for colon izing free colored persons, with their own consent, at any place or places without the United States. I be" indulgence to discuss these pro posed articles at same length, j jWithout Slavery, the rebellion could never have existed; without Slavery, it could not continue. Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to Sla very and the African race among us. some would abolish it suddenly, and with out compensation; some would abolish it gradually, aud with compensation; some would remove the freed people lroui us, and some would retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we Taste much strength in struggles among our selves; by mutual concession, we should harmonize and act together. This would be a compromise among the friends and ' not with the enemies ofthe Union. These articles are intended toembodv a plan of . such mutual concessions. If the plan be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States. As to the first article, the main points are: 1. The emancipation. I 2. The length of time for consumma ting (thirty-seven years); and i 3. The compensation, j The emancipation will be unsatisfae I tory to the advocates of perpetual slave j ry, but the lenghth of time should greatly j mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time ' spares both races from the evils of sud I den derangement; in fact, from the necessity of any derangement, while j most of those whose habitual course of j thought will be disturbed by the measure j will have passed away before its consum ' niation. They will never see it. An- other class will hail the prospect of emancipation, bnt will depneate the I l . i r fin lengin oi time. iney will leel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagraut destitution which must largely attend immediate emanci pation in localities where their numbers are very great, and k gives the inspirit ing assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at any immediate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and gener ally the mode of making it This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor per letual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive compensation. Doubt less, some of those who are to pay and not to receive, will object; yet that the measure is both just aud economical is certain. The liberation ofthe slaves is the de struction of property; property acquired by descent or purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having been often said that the people of the South are no more rcsponsi t ie tor the original intro duction of this property than are the peo ple of the North; and when it is remem bered how unhesitatingly we use all of us use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing iu them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South lias been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a comun n charge? And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we cau preserve the benefits of the Luion by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let us con sider it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since com pensated emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some ofthe slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure would save money, and, in thssf view, would be a prudent anil economical measure. Certainly, it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing. But it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one, and it is easi r to pay any sum, when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able. The war requires them at once. The aggre gate sum necessary for compensatec1 emancipation, of course, would be larre, but it would require no ready cash, ' r bonds even, any faster than the cirnci pation progresses. This might nt, and probablv would not. close before !be end of the tliirtv-seveu vears. At tVst time we shall probably ' have 100,(0'.000 of people to share the border, in stead of 31100,000, as now; and uot-ly so, but the increase of our popuistiuu may be expected to continue for long time after the period as rapidly as before, be cause our territory wtllaot have become full. 1 do not state tls inconsiderately. At the same ratio o" increase which we have maintained, m an average, from our first Natiorl Jensus in 1790, until that of I860, wt ihonlct in 1900, have a population of 1.13,208,415, and why may we not continue that ratio far 1 e; ond that period. Our abundant room, our broad national homestead, is our ample re source. Were our territory as limited as the PrilUh Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as Rtated. Instcai of receiving the foreign-born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native-born away ; but such is not our condition. We have 2,93,p'I0 square miles. -Europe has '-!,SOO,000, with a populath n averaging seveni , -three and one-third persons to square mile. Why may not our country at some time average us many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it in ferior to Furope iu any natural advan tage? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present As to when it will, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States are above the average European population of 73 to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157, Rhode Island 133, New York and New Jersey each 80; and two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 03. and the latter 59. ThetStates already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our countty in nateral capacity for sustaining a dense population. Taking the nation in the aggregate, we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decennial periods to beti f allows. i7iKa,!tt!,$2:. t4W-sMKjMI IMA prcnt. ratio "f incrcn?.
