PRESIDENT HARDING'S MF.SS AGE I' v " -> \ Washington. l^ee. H.?The text of i I*resldent Harding's message to Con- | gross follows: Mr. Speaker and members of '.he Con- | gress: It is a very gratifying privt.ege to eome to Congress with the rspuhtU* at peace with all the nations of the world. More. It is equally gratifying to report that our country is not only free from every Impending menace of war. but there are growing assurances of the permanency ?>f the peace which wc so , deeply cherish Kor approximately ten years we have j dwelt amid menaces of wat or as par- I ticlpants in war's actualities and the | inevitable aftermath n th its disordered conditions. !us added t*> the difficulties of got ernmrn!. which adequately cannot 1 be appraised by any except those who j arc in Immediate contact and know the 1 responsibilities. Our tasks would be ; less difficult if we had onlv ourselves to j consider hut so nito h of the world was j involved, the disordered conditions are | so well nigh universal, even among r??- t tions not engaged fn actual warfare. ! that no permanent readjustments cp.n he t effected without consideration of our In- J escapable relationship to world affairs In ' finance and trade. Indeed. w? should be 1 'unworthy of our best traditions if we were unmindful of social, mora! and ' political conditions which are.not of dl- ' rcct concern to us. but hfat do appeal; to the American sympathies and the very becoming interest of a people blest vyith our national good fortune ?merle* Knit Z.ead Her Aid. It Is not my purpose to bring to jou s progr*m of world restoration Jn the i twain such ? prograpi must be worked out by the nations most directly con cerned. Thcv must themselves turn to ? the heroic remedies for the menacing conditions tinder which they are strug gling, then we can help, and we mean t to help. We shall do so unselfishly oe , eause there is compensation, in the co# , 4elousness of assisting: selfishly be- ? '. Htuae the commerce and international ''.jbtchanges In trade, which marked our ?nigh tide of fortune advancement, are possible only when the nations of all ? qontinents are restored to stable order , $nd normal relationship. % In the main the contribution c< this republic to restored normalcy In the ' Icorld must cotne through the lnitiut've i ? the executive branch of the govern fhent. but the best of intentions and j jjiost carefully considered purposes i would fall utterly if the sanction snd ' |he cooperation of Congress were not | cheerfully ?ecorded * Cooperation SeeentiaJ. i lam very sure we shall have no con- ! flirt rtf opinion about constitutional du ties or authority. During the unxlettes j Jf war. when necessity seemed eompoll- j |>K. there were excessive grants of au thority ,.:i?i an extraordinary concentrn- I tlon of powers .n the chief executive. ] The repeal of war time legislation ;>nt . Ihe automatic expirations which attend ! Che peace proclamations have put on end | So these emergency excesses, hut I have ' the wigh to go further than that. I want | Jo join you In restoring in the most j gordial way the spirit of coordination and cooperation, and that mutuality of lonfinence and respect which is neces sary in representative popular go\ern aent. jf Encroachment upon the functions of j {ongress or attempted dictation of its' policy ate not thougat of- much less at tempted. hut there is an insistent call for harmony ..f purpose and concord of action to speed the solution of the dif ficult problems confronting both legisla tive and executive brandies of the gov ernment. ' It is worth while to make .allusion Jjere to the character of our government, pt.ndful as one must that an address pt> you ;s no less a message to a't our people, for whom you epoak most in timately. Ours is a popular government through political parties. tVe divide along political lines, and I would ever lave it so. I do not mean that partisan Preference should hinder any public ser vant ;n the performance of a consoien ious and patriotic official duty. Wo iw partisan lines utterly obliterated when war Imperilled, and cur filth In the republic was riveted anew. We aught not to find these partisan lines ob structing th? expeditious solution of tn# 4r gent problems of peace. W to tha Party in power. * granting that we are fundamentally a representative popular government. with political parties and governing ?|g*m it-s. J believe the political party in no*> r should nssunie reipons hllity. de 1 term.ii(- upon policies in the conference , which supplement- convention and elec , tlon campaigns ami t"?? n strive for i achievement through adherence to the accepted policy. I There :s vastly greater security. Im mensely more of the national viewpoint much larger and prompter accomplish ment where our ?Hvlrdons i ?- n'org pwrty lines. In the broad arid loftier .sense, than to divide geographically ?r according to pursuits, or persona! fol lowing Kor a century and :i third, parties have Ieen charged with respon sibility and held to strlct^ccnuniing. When they fall, they ur? relieved of au thoi.ty, and the system has brought us to a national eminence no less than :i world example. Nevem; r.P . legislation Is a matter of compromise The -full ideal is seldom attained. 1:? thai i?cet ng of minds a?.' esjgtrj to Insure " stilts, there must and will be accommodation* and compro mises. bur in the^eitimate of v'0,>v'?* lions ar.,1 sir., pre purposes, 'fife- siip/qjrtr responsibility to national Interc-t niusr not he ignored.

The previous ruitgriss. deeply . n cemed In behalf of our merchant mtt rlne, in iSSii enacted the existing shu pin* law, designed for the upliu.Mmg of the American merchant mnrine. Anionic other things provided to en courage mi r shipping on the world's seas, the executive was dlre -ted in g.ve notice of the termination of nil exist ing commercial treaties In order 10 admit of lower duties on iui'orts car ried m American bottoms Curing the life of the act rio executive ha* com plied with this order of the i'oMgre-.x. When the present administration etitne into responsibility, it began an early in qulrv Into the failure to execute the ex pressed purpose of the Jones act. Only one conclusion has been possble. Ki'anU ly. rnemhers of House and Setiaie. eu;;er a? I am to join you In ti e making of Vmeric.m merchant marine comm^ti it rate with our commerce, the denounce ment of our commercial treaties would involve us in a chaos of trade relation ships and add Indescribably to the con fusion of the already disordered com mercial world. Our power to do so Is not disputed, hut power and ships, with out comity of relationship will not give us the expanded trade which is insep arably linked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduc tion. of duty, for which the treaty de nouncements were necessary, were cn cotiragod in the carrying of dutiable im ports to our shores, while the tonnage which unfurls the flag on the sea* Is both free and dutiable and the cargoes1 which make a nation eminent in trade are outgoing rntlier than Incoming HO UVMfcktVU JTMNl. H :b not my thought to iay the prob lem ?n detail before you today. It I* de sired only to say to you that t'u? execu tive branch of the government. ttninttu-| enred by the protest of any nation, for none has been made, is well convinced I that your proposal, highly intended and; heartily supported here, i^ so fraught j with difficulties and so marked by ten dencies to discourage trade expansion, that I invite your tolerance 01 non-com- I pliance for a very few weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft upon the public trews- , ury. and which, though yet too crude to j offer It today, gives such promise of ex- ? pending our merchant marine that It will argue lis own approval. It in; enough to sty tod i}' that we r.re no pos- ! sensed of ships, and the Amer enn infn- . tion to establish ft merchant marine Is 8<? unalterable, tuat a plan of reimburse ment. at no other cost than is content- j plated in the existing act. wil: appeal to the pride and encourage the hope of al. the American people * i Urges Xarly Tariff Action. There ;s hefore you the completion et the enactment of what has been termed a "permanent" tariff law. the word "permanent" being used to distinguish It from the emergency act which tl.e Congress expedited early In the extra ordinary session and which la the law today. I cannot too strongly urge an early completion of this necessary leg islation. It Is needed to stabilize our in dustry at home; It Is essential to maue more definite our trudo relations abroad. More. It Is vital to the preservation <<f many i f our own industries, which con irihate so notably to the very ttfe bcod of our nation. Thoro Is now. and there always will be. a storm of conflicting opinion about any tariff revision. We cannot go fur wrong when we buse our tat if fa on ih- policy of preserving the productive io .lvIth m, which enhance employment ..ad i)d>l to our national prosperity. Again 11 me j the reminder thai we must not be unmindful of world condi tions, that peoples arc struggi.ng for industrial rehabilitation and that we m.nnot swell In Industrial and cotnriter vial exclus.on and at the name time do ti e Just thing hi aiding w.,rld recogni tion ? nd readjustment We do not need a selfish aloofness and. we couid no; profit by it. wer? it possible.

Mora Than "Capital and Labor." While this- ,-et of problems .s com monly comprehended under the g-neral phrase "eapltal and labor." It is really vastly hroader. It is n question of so '"iiil timl c-ofiomlc organization. l.abor has become a lurye . oiiii iliiit-.r, through its savings, to the sto.-k of cap-tal: while Ihe people who own the !.'rgest indiv idiial :ui|:i ee.i >s of can!taI .ire them selves otten hard and eiirinst laborers Very often it is extremely difficult to draw the Jim- of demarcation between the two groups; to determine wlietlnr a particular individual ij entitle.I to he si t down as laborer or as capita!.St. In a v.-r.\ large proportion of rases, lit t* both, and when he is both he 's the most us, fnl cftizi'ii. Labor Has Its Hlg.it>. The right of labor I i orga n./e is just as riimltiuieiiial ami lie essniv as is the tight of capita! to organize The right "f labor n? negotlate, to deal with and solve its parilemur problems. in nn organized way. through .is chosen ft gen i s, is just as essential as Is the right of capital to organize, to maintain corpora I huis. to ltn.lt the ilahi'.it .-*s of stn 'khoUlers. Inih?.1 we have conic lo recognize that tin limited liability of the citizen rs a member of a labor or iranization elo.-eiv parallels the llniitn thui of liability of the citizen as a stock holder in a corporation for profit Along this line of reasoning we s.iall make til'- greatest plotless toward Solution of -.iir problem of capital ut:tl labor. In the case of the corporation which ? njoys the prlvllegf of 11 initI liability of st... kholders. partirularly when di git; ed in the puhlle service, it is reoog tilz-d that the outside public lias u con fetti which must he protected nnd so w? provide iegulutionh. restrictions and some casts detailed supervision. J.lke wi-'.t- in the cash of lahor organizations, we m.ght well apply similar and equal ly well defined principles of regulation ami supervision In order to conserve the public's interests as affected by their operations. Just as it is not d .'.limbic that a cor poration should he :illowed lo impose undue? exactions upon tin- public, so it is not desirable tlutt a labor orjpnida tion shall he per.nit ted to exact unfair terms of oniph yinent or subject tlie public in actual distresses In order to enforce its teims. Finn My, just as we aro earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjust and settle politieai differences between nations without re s >rt to wa~ so we may well look about for means to settle the differences be tween organized cnpttal and organized labor withouj resort to tho^e forms of warfare which we recogntzr under the name >>t strikes, lookouts, boycotts and the like.

At we hav* threat bodies of law enre fu'ly regulating the organization and operations of Industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties and compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differences without the necessity of conflict In arms, en we might well have plans of conference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitra tion and judicial determination in con troversies between labor and capital. To Rocompllsh this would In vnjv e t he neces sity to develop a thorough-going code of practice In dealing with such affairs. It might bo well to frankly set forth the superior Interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or the capital group. With rights, privi leges, immunities and models of organi zation thus carefully defined it should bo possible to get up Judicial or quasi judicial tribunals for the consideration atul determination of all disputes which menace the puhlio welfare. Strikes Out of Place In an Industrial society such us ours the strike, tlie lockout, and the boycott are as much out of place und as dis astrous In their results as war ot armed re\olutlon In the dotnulii of p di ttos. The same disposition to reason ableness to cotieibutton, to recognition of the other side's point of view, tho same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes ought to muko It isissible to solve the one set of 'luna tions as easily as the other. I believe the solution is possible. The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the cxcre.se of care, of deliberation in the construction of a code and a charier of elemental rights, dealing with the lel.ithmn of employer and employe. This foundation in tlf law. dealing with the modern condi tions "f social and economic lifo would hasten the building of the temple of pence In Industry in which a rejoic ing nation would acclaim. uecuiinauua x-iujouii After cuili wur. until the last, the goM-rnment has ) frii enabled in ni\o hmi ? - ii> Its mtui tied uoldlers, mill a laryu |?ari of our settlement unit devel opment li.is iiUendeii thin generous pro vision of laud for llui nullon's defen ders.

President llar j ding's suggestion, made in his message' I to congress todny. for n court to decide j wages arid conditions of employment, I was declared to be a "reversal to con I ditlons obtaining more than four hiin I dt'cd years ago" In a statement issued | tonight liy Samuel (lumpers. president 1 of the American Federation of l.abor. j "The president's message is In most ' respects an admirable document." the statement said, "but lie, tike altogether I too many men. falls In his understand I Ing of the relations between workers ?nd employer.", of the aspirations which aro in the hearts und minds of the gte.it mass of our people.? "Indeed, the president's proposal for the establishment of a court with legal powers to decide as to wages and condi tions of employment is nothing more or less titan a reversion back to the conditions obtaining more than four hundred years ago. when the court of quarter sessions determined the wages of the workers and prohibited them from asking tor more or employers from paying tnore than the court's decision, and to condemn men to compulsory sorvitude and slavery if they resented in atti' way the decisions of those courts. In Other Countries. "It is quite < vident the president litis ill mind the establishment of a court or courts to determine the conditions and wages of the working people, and evi dently with the aim that these courts will prevent strikes and lockouts. Surely the experience of such courts In tlie Australasian countries; surely the experience with such a court lit the state of Kansas, should have been a lesson for its. In New Zealand and in other Australasian countries they have gone .through the experience of more titan twenty years, and their utter fail ure has not only been recognized there, but they have been abandoned. In the state of Kansas, where such a court has been in existence for the past two years, there are today more strikes and a larger number of men on strike than at any time in the history of Kansas. "The analogy which the president makes as between internatlonnl affairs nnd Industrial disputes is far-fetched and unwarranted by facts. It is the voluntary agreement, the collective bar gaining, theo rgnnization of,the work ers and the organization of employers to reach voluntary agreements so that strikes lockouts and boycotts, etc.. may be avoided, which must solve our indus trial disputes" Alaska has 25.000 miles of coast line When a modern Zulu sneezes he ealls on his ancestral spirit.
