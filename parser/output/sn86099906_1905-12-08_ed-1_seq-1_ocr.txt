The doctrine of Socialism is con demned, although the term is not employed: Ali are "helped by making conditions such that men of exceptional ability- receive ex ceptional reward. Nevertheless, where there is no governmental restraint, some men of exceptional ability use their energies in ways prejudicial to the common good Federal supervision and regula tion of corporations to prevent restriction of competition from be ing harmful to the public is rec ommended. Corporations engaged in inter state' transportaticn should be dealt with first. The Interstate Com merce Commission, or some other administrative bodv should be clothed with power, when it finds, upon specific complaint, a given rate unreasonable or unjust, to prescribe a maximum reasonable rate. In case a rate has been cut for a favored shipper, the commis sion should have the right to make such cut rate the maximum for the line making it. Rebating in all its forms should be stopped. In might be well to permit the railroad to enter "into agreements subject to sanction of the commission, o "carry out the law." ' ' .Legislation requiring tne in troduction of the block, system on railroads is recommended. Hours of railroad laborers should be limited. Courts should not be deprived of their power to issue injunctions in labor disputes, notice should be given to the adverse party before granting the writs. The class spirit should be discouraged. Capitalist and wage worker should realize that they are properly partners. Congress should consider wheth er the Federal Government should further extend its supervision over ife insurance companies. Congress should consider wheth er changes in the revenue laws are necessary, and whether reciprocity treaties with other .nation should be negotiated. Economy is recommended, not, However, at the expense of the navy or Panama Canal. Elasticity should be given to the currency. Business methods should obtain in the departments. The steps looking toward a new peace conference are" related, and the position of this Nation toward peace and disarmament discussed at length. The popularity of the Monroe Doctrine is increasing. The United States has no miroose of territorial aggression. It simply wants the American republics to be secure and happy. They must, however, -aci right. The army and navy must be improved. Promotions should be made for merit. Appropriations for elaborate maneuvers are asked. ! Army posts should be consolidat ed. The coast artillery force should be increased.

Free trade between the United States and the Philippines is re commended. The rate on sugar and tobacco should be 25 per cent of the present schedule until July 1, 3909, when the tariff should be abolished. Porto Ricans should be admitted to American citizenship. Immediate single statehood for Indian and Oklahoma Territories and for New Mexico and Arizona is urgently recommended. Alaska should be given an elec tive delegate to Congress. The Government should build a railroad from the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon River. The route of the Panama Canal and its feasibility are no longer open to debate. The type is yet to be determined. An appropriation is necessary to continue the work. It is assured that excavation will be resumed by the middle of next year. The consular service should be reorganized. It should be manned by salaried Americans and the fee system abolished. The consuls should have adequate salaries and proper buildiugs; 

OUTFLOW OF SILVER. Mexico Has Exported $4,700,000 At a Seven Per Cent Profit. Mexico City. The total amount of Mexican silver dollars exported by the Exchange and Currency Commission up to the middle of ast week was $4,700,000, all taken rora the reserve fund of $10,000,- O0Q held in charge of-' the'com mission. These dollars or pesos are the prdduct of the last mintage of old coinage which ceased early this year. They have never been held in the vaults of the National Bank of Mexico. The operation as managed by the commission has eft a profit of 7 per cent on the amount of dollars . exported and the gold received in exchange consists of British sovereigns and American ten and twenty dollar pieces, held mostly abroad subj'ect to the order of the Exchange and Currency Commission to be ship ped here when it will be melted down and issued in new Mexican gold money. Thus Mexico" old silver dollar continually fluctuating in value in sympathy with the ups and downs of the silver market is steadily .and surely and much mere rapidly than was anticipated, being supplantea by the new mone tary system which became oper ative in May last.

THING FOR. TEXAS. Inclusion of This State in Redamtioni Benefit Is Suggested. Washington, Dec. 5. One of the most important features of the President's message, so far as local interests in Texas are concerned is the sentence which closes the sec ond paragraph of the section refer ring to the public land laws. The sentence is: "The act should be extended to include the State of Texas." It means that despite the fact that the State of Texas has no Fed eral public lands, the President be lieves the benefits b, the reclama tion act should be extended to- the State. The inclusion of this sen tence may be partly due to the ob servations made by the President during his trip through Texas last spring, but the immediate cause was the indefatigable work of Rep resentative W. R. Smith, whu for some weeks past has been doing: everything in his power to induce Mr. Roosevelt to make the recom mendation in question. When he first went to the White Hon on. the matter the President referred' him to Clifford Piuchot, the Gov ernment Forester, who took it up with Hydrographer Newell and ater with the President h The President had never said positively that he would urge the inclusion of Texas and when the fact that developed today that he had done so it brought much gra.- tification to Mr. Smith and to Messrs. Slater, Burgess and Mar tinez of El Paso, and Holt of Netv Mexico, who are here in connec tion with the Rio Grande ir-icp tion project. The contract affecting- the Tees ville dams has been passed to Sec retary of the Interior Hitchcock by the reclamation service engineers and it is expected that he will act on it, probably favorably, some time tomorrow. Gems From Success Magazines If there is a pitiable sight iu the world, it is that of a man with the executive ability, sagacity, and foresight to make a clean fortune, yet using his energies and abilities in making a dirty one, a fortune which denounces, and condemns him, and is a perpetual disgiaCc to himself and his family. Let the man in youtftanci oat so boldly in every transaction that the deed or task you do, however great,, will look insignificant in compari son. Get what you can and keep your own good name, not a pen ny more. A dollar more than that would make your whole fortune valueless. The highest service-yotr can ever render the world, thegreatest thing; you can ever do, is to make your self the largest, completest, pnrl squarest man possible. There is uo other fame like that no ajuliicve ment like that. Every human being has iftuithitj hit power to keep the foundation under him his manhoou, j"r60 lutely secure under ali circum stances. Nothing can shake that Kilt himself. The citadel car; never be taken until he himself surren ders the keys. Calunin; , detrac tion, slander, or monetarv failure can not touch this sacred th-.ng.
