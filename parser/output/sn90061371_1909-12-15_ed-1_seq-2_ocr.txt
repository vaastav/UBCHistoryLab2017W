The preliminary report of the de partment of agriculture shows that the corn crop this year Is up to a high level and comes near to record-breaking figures. The yield is placed at 2. 767,316,000 bushels, which is nearly hundred million bushels more than that of 1908. The largest , crop of corn ever gathered was that of 1906. which aggregated 2.927,416,000 bush els. At the prevailing prices the corn crop Is estimated to be worth more than f 1.900,000,000. - There Is no doubt that "King Corn" does his part toward creating national wealth.

When the United States names its biggest battleships after the smallest or the least populous, of the states does it indicate an opinion that the battleships may properly be min imized or that the small states need the advertising? c : Tbe power of humor was, perhaps, never more strikingly displayed than in tbe strike, of 1,100 employes of a Schenectady concern who struck be cause a fellow-laborer who bad poured and down their backs and smeared ttteir tools was discharged. FINO FHflZEU tiUDIES VICTIMS PART OF CREW OF MISS ING FERRY, WHICH CARRIED THIRTY-TWO MEN. OTHERS ARE PBIBABLY LOST Fisheries Boat Tows Craft to Erie, Pa, Where . Identifications Are Made Ship Is Believed to Have Founded. Erie, Pa. With her flag at half mast the state fisheries boat Com modore Perry. Capt , Gerry Driscoll commanding, brought to this port the frozen bodies of nine of the crew of the Bessemer and Marquette ferry No. 2, which left Conneaut, Ohio, Tues day morning, carrying thirty-two men and which has probably foundered in the middle of Lake Erie. For forty-eight hours Commodore Perry has been searching the waters of Eastern Lake Erie for traces of the car ferry, but until a tiny ten-man yawl was sighted fifteen miles off this port the men on the little state fish eries craft had almost given up hope of being able to ever tell even a portion of the story of the fate of the big car ferry. As the lookout on the Perry sighted a tiny half-sunken yawl at about noon orders were given to eteam down up on the object. The use of glasses dis covered the boat to be loaded with nine men. Arrived To Late. As the Perry came abreast of the drifting and half water-logged yawl, the men gathered at the side of the fish boat saw that they arrived too late. The nine occupants of the boat, which was marked "Bessemer and Marquette No. 4," were frozen stiff. Taking thes yawl in tow, the Perry made, all steam for this port. Capt. Johnson of the life-saving sta tion of this port, had already sighted the fish boat and tow and making out the contents of the yawl, had notified the Erie chief of police, from Presque Peninsula, who in turn notified the coroner. All police reserves were cal led out and "ambulances lined the wharves as the Perry docked.- News of 'the finding of the bodies had reached the city and thousands of persons swarmed to the wharves. ' As soon as the fish boat made fast a force of men with tackle set to work raising tbe bodies of the men to the dock, where wagons were in wating. Tbe procession of dead passed through the principal streets of the city, with hundreds of people following. Conneaut, Ohio, where most of - the men lived, was notified by telephone of the grewsome find, and a hundred, residents of that city arrived here within two hours. They were taken directly to the coroner's morgue, where identifications were" made. Only One Had Overcoat. The c- "t of the car ferry was the only man to wear an overcoat. The eight other men were dressed in over alls and jumpers, indicating that the departure from the car ferry had been hurried. In the bow end of the boat was found complete clothing for one man. and It is the belief that the yawl orginally Contained ten men, and that one becoming crazed, dis carded his clothing and jumped into the icy waters of Lake Erie.

A REPC3TE0 UKI0H RATFWRnnY 1 1 SAeAINTAKEN UP CUMMINS INTRODUCES MEASURE PRACTICALtY SUPPLANTING INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT. ELK1NS WILL ALSO SUBMIT BlLL Iowa Senator Advocates Uniform Classification for Freight Ship ments Plan for Stock Payment at Par. Washington, D. C. A contro versy over railroad legislation will be precipitated In congress this winter, which, in importance, promises to surpass the legislative conflict over railroad rates four years ago. The first gun waa fired by Senator Cummins of Iowa when he produced a bill proposing radical changes in the interstate commerce act. In a large sense the Cummins measure is a substitute for the present interstate commerce act It is expected that a measure pro posing amendments to the law will be introduced early in January by Sen ator Elkins, which will differ from the Cummins bill In many important de tails. Uniform Classes Provided. In brief, the cummins bill requires the interstate commerce commission to promulgate a uniform classification of freight, and to prepare a plan or the statement of freight rates which shall hereafter be made in a uniform way. The carriers are required to adopt this classification. The commission is authorized to consider rates on its own motion with a view to determine their reason ableness, and is empowered . to fix maximum and minimum rates. In any action instituted in court to set aside an order of the commission respecting the rates, the courts are prevented from inquiring into the rea sonableness or sufficiency of any rate fixed by the commission. The bill provides that chJiges in rates shall not become effective until they are approved by the commission. It prohibits the acquisition of control by any common carrier of any paral lel competing line, or from acquiring the capital stock or bonds of any oth er carrier which is a competitor. By the terms of the bill a carrier is prohibited from Issuing any capital stock without payment in par, either in money or In property and, in effect. the commission shall have supervision of the issues of stocks and bonds by any carrier. Specific directions are given for the disposition of the pro ceeds of any sale of bonds. After January 1, 1911, no carrier do ing interstate business shall be per mitted to engage in any other busi ness than that of a common carrier. Nicaraguan tands in Jail. Washington, D.

CONGRESSIONAL At the White House a conference was held which has an important bearing upon the legislative program for the present session of the pres ent congress. Vice-President Sher man and Speaker Cannon were called in by the president, and they sent more than an hour in consultation. It was learned that before he sent his message to congress President Taft sent a copy to Speaker Cannon and told him that he would like to talk over with him some of the features, especially that in relation to amend ments to the interstate commerce law. The speaker responded, and Mr. Sher man, who presides ' over the senate, was also invited. The political sig nificance of the conference is given as the president's desire to get the factions of the party -to agree upon taking up some one piece of legisla tion and act upon it harmoniously. The amendments to the interstate commerce act are regarded as one subject upon which this can be brought about, and it seems now that that will be the important business of the present session. It is believed that both the "progressives" in the senate and the "insurgents" in the house will agree to that statement and will be willing to act harmoni ously with the regulars of the Repub lican party. Even the Democrats, it is believed, will be glad to take up consideration of this matter. A shocking story of the white slave traffic, its widespread influence, its degredation and its misery, is told in a report submitted by the immlgra ation commission to congress. The commission is composed of three rep resentatives and three senators and has had agents investigating the prob lem in all parts of the country since 1907. A drastic proposition to meet the strike of the switchman on the rail roadi lines entering St. Paul is made in 4. bill, amending the Erdman act, which will be introduced by. Repre sentative Steenerson of Minnesota, providing for receiverships of the roads involved, if necessary. The bill gives United States courts full juris diction. It also amends the Erdman law so as to allow the courts to fix the compensation of members of the arbitration boards in cases of unusual importance. One of the striking features of the the house proceedings was a speech by Representative Kuestermann of Wisconsin, denying the charge that his interest in German shipping was so great as to cause him to antagon ize a bill for the relief of the Ameri can merchant marine. Mr. Kuestei man was in jovial humor and his speech was geperally enjoyed. A bill evidently designed to cover cases of contempt of court similar to that of President Gompers and his as sociates of, the American Federation of Labor and greatly restricting the power of the courts in such cases was introduced in the house by Repre sentative Thomas of Kentucky. Representative Alexander of Mis souri is sponser for a bill introduced in the house which is intended to ex tend the provisions of the federal pension laws to include the enrolled Missouri militia and i""e several other militia organizations "of the state which participated in the civil war. A similar bill to include the militia or ganizations of all the states was also introduced by Mr. Alexander. Slauding cut strikingly was a reso lution by, Senator Raynor authoriz ing the president of the United States to cause President Zelaya to be ap prehended as a common criminal, charged with the murder of two Am ericans, engaged in revolutionary act ivity in Nicaragua, contrary to the code of all civilized nations, which would have granted them a trial. Representative Barthold of St. Louis introduced a bill in the house having for its purpose the relief of the farmers living in Columbia bot toms, affected by a government dam. As a nromise of activity in the in terest of legislation, senators intro duced more than 350 bills and resolu tions, covering a great variety of sub jects, Friday. Many of these meas ures failed of passage during the last congress and 9C ner cent of them will receive re nt consideration. Leaders of the organization in the house have commenced to count noses on ship subsidy, and if. when the count is completed, there seems to be the slightest chance to whip such a measure through, a bill providing for ship subsidy will be Introduced. 

KENTUCKY KIDNAP CASE DEFY POLICE FATHER OF ALMA KELLNER 8AY9 SHE WAS 8T0LEN WHILE LOOKING AT TOYS. HI II BUCK SUSPECTED Child Believed to Have Been Taken for J-ielress Various Clues Traced by Police Fail to Disclose Whereabouts of Girl. Louisville, Ky. Though story after story has been investigated by the Louisville police, the whereabouts of 8-year-old Alma Kellner, who disap peared from her home Wednesday morning, remains a mystery. F. L. Kellner, father of Alma, said that he believed his daughter was looking at toys In the shop windows on Walnut street when, as he expres sed it "somebody nailed her." He said the child made friends with strangers in a quick, responsive way and that after she had attended church, for which purpose she left home, she was wandering among the Christmas dis plays, when she was kidnaped. Meanwhile children resembling Alma Kellner, have been sympatheti cally reported. to have been seen be ing forced into covered carriages by veiled women, roughly dressed, and the like, observed walking up and down street-car aisles, hurried into Tell City, Ind., where an allegedly dis gruntled relative of the Kellners Is supposed to live; while another story is that Alma was mistaken for her 11-year-old aunt, Meta Kellner, an heiress, whom Alma resembles. The city has distributed 500 cir culars offering an unspecified reward for the return of the child and the en tire police force of Louisville and Southern Indiana towns are busy upon the case.- Frank Fahr, millionaire brewer, and uncle of the missing child, said Fri day that F. L. Kellner was not in a position to pay a ransom for Alma, and that while F. L. Kellner Sr. had been a rich man, the Junior's share would not amount to anything con siderable. The family specifically denied a rumor published that a meeting of Mrs. Kellner and the kid napers had been arranged. One of those "mysterious women in black," who usually figure in cases of the Kellner kind, was discovered zy reporters in the vicinity of the home of Mrs. F. L. Keliner Sr., '-and her actions excited suspicion. The police who have searched in vain every vault, empty house and alley in a readius of half a mile of the Kell ner home, devcted their attentions to watching this woman and to running down the story of an aged Russsion peddler, who said he had seen in Southern Indiana a girl who might have been Alma, traveling toward Madison, Ind., and Cincinnati, with a man in a wagon.
