AT KANSAS CITY Two Dead, Two Seriously Wounded and Others injured in Clash With Self-Styled "Adam Gods" andj"Eli I jahs"—Leader of Cranks at Large, Hia Wife in Jail. 7" .V Kansas City, Deo. "I am not go ing to die. I am going to get well and live to kill a few more policemen." That is the assertion of Louis Pratt, the self styled "Adam God," the relig ious fanatic who is lying in the gen eral hospital here, seriously wounded in the battle between his followers and the police last night. As the result of the fight Pratt's 13-year-old daughter, xt,ulu, and Policeman Dalbow are dead and two other policemen are in a crit ical condition. James Sharp, known as "Elijah n." who was the real head p£ the little hand of religious enthusiasts, is still at large. Moved by "Revelations." Mrs. Pratt, with two of her young' daughters, spent last night in the ma tron's room at the police headquarter?, but Mrs. Sharp, who fired two shots that struck Policeman Mullane, was confined in the city jail. "I've been in trouble before." said Mrs. Pratt. "If I can be killed for righteousness* sake I shall be eternally happy. Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, our leaders were known to us as Adam and Eve, and we believed in their teachings. It was rev/ealed to Sharp last summer that our meetings were to be Inter fered with again. We armed ourselves. "If the police attempt to arrest you, shoot,' our leader said. They can not kill me. I'll live forever. The first I heard of trouble yesterday was when Lulu and Mary came running down to the boat and told me shooting was go ing on. Then the officers came and wanted to take us away. I got my Win chester down oft the wall, and fold Lulu to get a gun. We all got into the skiff. I wab not going to, shoot unless I had to, because I had had no chance to a'sk either Adam or Eve what to do. I'm sorry I did not resist. I'm afraid I have lost my eternal life because I think Adam would have advised me to shoot." Mrs. Sharp "Got Religion." Mrs. Melissa Sharp told of the wan derings of the band. "I was born in Mountain Grove, Mo., 37 years ago on 'a farm," said Mrs. Sharp. "I married Sharp, a farmer, twenty years ago. We went to Oklahoma and took up a claim. We had no religion then at all. About six years ago my husband came home one night and said he did not think we were living right. He had had a revel ation of the faith of God. We began to read the Bible. A week later I got a revelation. Then we both repented for two weeks, weeping and mourning, not because we Wanted to, but because we could not help it. The spirit of God caime to us the same that it came to Adam, to David, to Christ. We then sold our farm, gave the money away to people who were poor, and started to preach. Since then we have traveled thru Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illi nois in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. We lived on gifts made toy converts and by small sums offered us by whoever cared to. One man who found the light •old all his property and put $7,000 in. We kept all the money in a common fund." POLICE AND FANATICS BATTLE. Two Killed and Several Fatally Wounded in. Kansas City.

Near that street corner ha came upon Sharp, who, surrounded by hia companions, iwas exhorting a crowd. Wdth Sharp were A. J. Selzer, a wom an and five children. The children ranged Jn age from 14 to 3 years. The officer's' suspicions were aroused by the manner in which the woman at tempted to secure money contributions from tlfe crowd and he decided that ah* aad her mala companions were not ill np proper persons to have the custody of youn£ children. The woman announced that she and "ARdam God"would conduct services at Creighton's or Poornian's mission, ono block north, tonight, whereupon slio and her companions started in the direc tion of the mission. Officer Holt then accosted the woman and inquired as to the identity of the children.

Officer Holt rushed into the police station and warned the officers of Im pending trouble. The police sergeant in charge ordered Patrolmen Charles Dal bow and Harry E. Stege to go out and arrest Sharp and his followers. The re ligionists came up the street and as soon as they saw the officers opened fire.

Des Moines, Dec. 9.—"-Advertise -Iowa and populate the state. That is to be the way we will stop the .movement from,Iowa out to the newer states or keep'up a movement Into the state that will more than offset all the outgo, if the advice of Secretary John Simpson of the state department of agriculture, is followed. In his annual report today to the state farmers' institute he pre sented this thought. It is notorious that Iowa's rural -population has been steadily decreasing. Mr. Simpson would by advertising Iowa resources and op portunities not only attract desirable citizens but prevent immigration to other states. He urged an appropriation for commencing this work and carry ing it on thoroughly and systematic ally. The state institute applauded his proposals. Secretary Simpson also reviewed the year's work and the year in agriculture in Iowa. He recommended that the de partment be authorized to issue bul letins from time to time and'to send them to the people, then to have the Year Book printed biennially. He would also have the department take charge of the collection of all farm statistics. Agricultural education has made great progress in Iowa under the ap propriations made for extension work good many counties of the state. The past year eighty-five counties of the state hell farmers' institutes and $955 was paid'by the state in aid of these institutes. There were eighty_nlne fairs held the state last season aside front the state fair and $68,000 was paid out in premiums. The total value of fair property was $615,000. Thirteen local fairs paid out each over $1,000 in .prem iums. A great many new and novel features were adfied, which indicates that greater interest is being taken in these fair,s.. The report concerning the state fair of 1908 as made by Secretary Simpson, i3 most flattering. It was the greatest of the fairs of Iowa in every respect, with an attendance of practically 208, 000, receipts of $136,764.66, and $38, C78.87 paid premiums. T.he fair has a balance on hand of $25,328.73. There were 1,391 exhibitors and 13,081 entries. The number of entries in the live stock department alone was 4,460. During the year there was expended in permanent improvement a totail of $58,300, which brings the total of ex penditures in seven years to $357,800, of which $159,000 was by direct appro priation and $190,700 came from fair receipts. Secretary Simpson presented to the board for indorsement a formidable lisit of recommendations as to coming improvements. The things actually needed are cataloged in .the following order: Amphitheater of fire-proof construc tion, for 15,000. More land to make larger race track and give more room. Building for farm implements and machinery. Manufacturers and liberal arts build ing to replace old firetrap used for exposition hall. Completion of show pavilion for swine. Dairy and horticultural building. Sewer system. Additional equipment for electric light and power. Sheep barn and completion of horse and cattle barns. Large auditorium for holding meet ings. A part of these improvements can be made in the future, as in the past, from fair receipts, but the larger build ings will have to be appropriated for by the legislature. Iowa has thus far been to little expense in this regard as compared with other states. There is but one other state fair showing larger receipts from ithe fair proper, and that is Minnesota. In Texas and Michigan more money is received but much of it comes from race gambling and the sale of liquors. The Iowa receipts for 1908 showed a gain of 33 'per cent over the previous year. Of the $34,407.91 increase, $24, 350 was from increase of ticket sales, 86,285 from concessions, and $1,762 of entrance fees in the speed depart ment. The net expense of the 1908. Iowa fair was J94,539.21, the net profit $44, 191.45. Mr. Simpson made an Interesting comparison of ithe live stock at the Iowa state fai^ and the international live stock show at Chicago, now in progress. The entries compare as fol lows: Breeding cattle—Iowa., 820 In ternational, C2S sheep—Iowa, 600 in ternational, 626: sheep—Iowa, 600 in ternational. 550 swine—Iowa, 2,275 International, none total—Iowa, 4.460 international, 2,066.
