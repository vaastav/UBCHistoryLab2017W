After the pres.ntazion of that plan the members of the arch fund committee retired and the Canton i ly remained in executive -ion.

O) .- r 11. M1r. Maefarland con tinued, Its promot-rs read in the morning papers that an a sociation had been organ lzod in Ohio to build a memorial in Canton. The second project was at once discussed by the officers of the arch association. There se-.,m-d to be no reason why both shoull not co-operate and work together in perfect harmony, and that has been the attitude of the arch association ever since. On the part of the committee present this m)rning. Mr. Macfarland said, there is the strongest desire to co-operate with the Can ton movement in ev'ry way possible. The arch movement, he continued. con tinued Its labors after October 11 with the most gratifying success. Thc association became national in every sense. Senator Hanna ther came to Washington and In vited the officers of the arch association to suspend operations until funds for the erec tion and maintenance of the Canton monu mn*-n should have been assured. The time proposed by the senator was Indefinite. To aba:d,.n the enterprise for an arch In the nation's capital under such circumstances meant apparently the death of the move m-nt. The arch association had therefore sought a joint meeting with the Canton as sociation by committees where a common plan of action might be adopted and the co-operation of the two bodIes be assured. It was agreed by the executive committee for the arch fund that a fair basis for such co-operation would be the division of the funds collected 4except those obtained in the District of Coumbia and the state of Ohio) two-thirds to the arch fund and one third to the Canton fund. stateinent by Mr. Gage. Mir. Gage followed Mfr. Mfacfarland with a statement of the reasoning on which the division of the fund was based. He had propo'ed the rlan to the arch association. It seemed to him aind to the committee, he s:.id, that the proortion proposed repre -sented the' relative importance and expense of the two monuments. It conformed. mucreover. wiah the two sums asked for by the two asoiations. When MIr. Gage conin*dedl an Informal dits-s.,o followed.

At thi-' afternoon's meeting, which will also be' held in the Arlington, the two committses will meet and take action on the proposal from the arch association. In view of the desire to co-operate which seemed to prevail, the committeemen seemed confint that a basis of com men action, either along the lines indi cated or otherwise, will be agreed upon. Hawaii Propoaes to Contribate. A statement from Secretary Ritchie pre ceded the consIderation of the proposition from the arch association. From Hawaii, said the secretary, had come a communi cation from Gov. Sanford B. Dbole, who had accepted a position as an honorary member et the board of trustees, and! who wrote that he expected a most satisfactory con tribution from Hawaii. as the people of that Island esteemed the late President highly. Gov. Hunt of Porto Rico was equally confident. The secretary was san guine that the thousand. who had gone to Alaska would contribute liberally. The contributions from New England had been generous. The executives of Maine and Massachusetts, Goys. Hill and Crane, re spectively. had written they were press ing the work vigorously and incessantly. In the south the responses had been most encouraging. Gov. Aycock of North Caro lina, Gov. Joe Davis of Arkansas. Gov. JennIngs of Florida ad Governor Heard of Louisiana hod been especially active.

The capital shock of the corporation is $5,000,001, divided into 50,000 shares of $100 each. Of this total certificates to the amount of $70N),00 have been issued, of which amount the sum of $50,00 has been actually paid in.

Hamilton, Michael J Colbert. S. B. Hege, J. F. Legge and John J. Hamilton of this city, G. L. Potter and J. M. Graham of Baltimore and Leo P. Harlow of Alexandria. Organized Under Act of Congress. The Washington Terminal Company is formed to carry Into effect the provision of section 10 of the act of Congress approved February 12, 191, which provided that if, for the purpose of constructing and owning the terminals, viaduct railroads, depots, sta tions and other works, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company shall deem it ex pedient or advisable that a terminal com pany in its interest be created and organ ized in the District of Columbia, the Balti more and Ohio Railroad Company, or some one authorized on its behalf, shall file a certificate of incorporation, organizing a company under some name to be decided on, with a capital stock not to exceed $5,000,000.

"The effect of the formation of this com pany," said one of the attorneys for the railroad. "is to transfer to the Washington Terminal Company the title to all the real estate and viaduct of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in the District, and the formation of the new company has nothing to do with the proposed union sta tion."

In order to expedite the shipment of troops and supplies from the United States to the Philippines the Secretary of War has transferred the transport Kilpatrick from the New York-Manila route to the San Francisco-Manila route, so that the vessel which is now at Manila may assist in car rying troops between the two last named ports. She will sail about the middle of the month. It is estimated at thb War De partment that it takes as long for one trip from New York to Manila as for two from San Francisco to the same point. Another order issued 'was for the freight transport Dix to leave Manila for Seattle, where a large amount of supplies Is awaiting ship ment to the Philippines. Mabnfactures of Alabama.

TWO TERRITORIES FOR ONE STATE Invited to Loyal Legion Banquet in February. AN INDIANA JUDGESHLP President Roosevelt was again over whelmed with visitors foday, so many peo ple being present that many senators and representatives went away without com municating the object of their visits to the chief executive. A rush of this kind is an almost daily one at the White House, and the President gets no time for an extended conference with any one. When both houses of Congress are in session there is a falling off in the rush after 12 o'clock. Consul to Genoa, Italy. Ex-Representative Richmond Pearson of Asheville, N. C., who has been pressed f(,r a foreign mission by. Senator Pritchard, will be offered the consulship at Genoa, Italy. This is one of the most pleasant and desirable consulships in the government service, but it is not known whether Mr. Pearson will accept. Senator Pritchard was at the White House today to introduce his democratic colleague, Senator Simmons. to the Pres ident. Senator Pritchard was informed of the President's intentions as to Mr. Pear son. One State of Twc Territories. W. H. P. Trudgeon of Purcell, Indian ter ritory, was one of the President's callers. Mr. Trudgeon is the advance member of what is known as the Muskogee commis sion that is coming to Washington to press for statehood for Oklahoma and the Indian territory combined. A big convention of rep resentatives from both territories was held on November 14 at Muskogee, and the sen timent was overwhelming in favor of one state being made out of both territories. The delegation coming here will spend the winter in Washington, and will be equipped with facts and figures favoring this action by Congress. Mr. Trudgeon states that the population of.the two territories combined is about 1.000,000 people, Oklahoma furnish ing a little more and Indian territory a little less than half of the total. There will be lively opposition to the plan, but it is said to be growing in favor in both territories. President Roosevelt did not ad vocate statehood for territories in his mes sage for the reason that there was differ ence of opinion as to this plan of combining the two territories. Loyal Legion Banquet. Senator Hawley, General Ellis Spear, com mander, and Major W. P. H-uxford, recorder of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion, called to invite the President to attend the twentieth annual banquet of the command ery, to be given at the National Rifles' Armory on the evening of February 1, proximo. The President said he would con sider the invitation. Trying to Give Cheatham Trouble. Bishops Arnett and Derrick, colored, call ed on the President today, Bishop Arnett being accompanied by his son, H. Y. Ar nett, until recently chief clerk of the office of recorder of deeds in this city.- They did not have opportunity to- talls with the President, but it-is 'the intention of Bishop Arnett to present the case of his son to the President. By reason of differences with Recorder Cheatham the resignation of H. Y. Arnett as chief clerk of the re corder's- office became necessary. This fact is leading up to an attempt of the friends of Arnett to make a fight- on Recorder. Cheatham. The chances are en tirely against this fight being successful, as tie President has heard so -many and such influential commendations of Recorder Cheatham that he has repeatedly an nounced his intention of nominating him for another term of four years. It is stated that young Arnett has several times at tempted to make trouble for Cheatham and that this led up to his resignation. Presi dent McKinley intended to give Recorder Cheatham another term, and President Roosevelt will carry out this intention. No Vacancies in,.This Body. Ex-Senators Carter and Thurston, ex Representative John Allen of Mississippi and Messrs. P. D. Scott and F. A. Betts of the St. Louis fair commission called to pay their respects. "The object of our tall was a most delicate one," said John Allen, whose wit often convulsed the House when he was a member. "We wanted to relieve the President of any anxiety he might have had that there were any vacancies in this commission. The President has the reputa tion of acting Qulickly when making ap pointments, and we thought it better to set him right about the members of our com mission desiring to stay on until the work of the fair is completed." Pot. Office Appointnats. Postmaster General Smith had a confer ence with the President today, at which the last batch of about 5i00 post office cases were decidad upon. The nominations will be sent to the Senate next week. There were practically no contests over any of these, and nearly all will be renominations. Among them will be the renomination of Postmaster Baker at Louisville, Appointnment for a Soldier. Representative Holliday of Indiana and Colonel Russell Harrison of the Spanish War Veterans took up with the President this morning the case of Capt. Geo. W. Biegler of Terre Haute. Captain Blegler has a splendid army record. He wasn wound ed in the Philippines, and was engaged in many hard battles. He failed of appoint ment to the regular army by reason of a low average in one branch of his minming tion. The fact was laid before the Preal-' dent that Captain Biegler's record' as a. soldier ought to overbalance anything else. Signs Hi. Fist Act. President Roosevelt has given his appro val to thefirst act ofCongress. This is a "joint resolution allowing the importation free- of payment of duty, customs fees, or charges, of all articles from foreign coun tries, and the transfer of foreign exhibits from the Pan-American exposition at Buf falo for t~he purpose of exhibition at the South Carolina interstate and West Indian exposition at Charleston, 8. C." The pen with which the President signed his first conemioal act was presented to Chief Clerk Browrning of the 'Rouse, who' also has the pen with whibb Prsidse Mc Kinley signed hi. first approval. Both pens will be sent to the Charleston esposition. Tslkn'er Absat a Jns...w.. Watsn of Inma. bm~a ti agh q of the race. Mr. 1.nis Utn~sqlasood to be for W.

COST OF THE rANAMA KOUTE. Minister Silva Taket, Exceptions to Statement by Canil~ Cmmission. Secretary Hay today received a long com munication from the ministec of Colombia, Dr. Martinez Silva, questioning some fea tures of the report made'by the ithmian ca nal commissioners as to the amount for which the Panama route could be pur chased by the United States, and asking that his cortfmunlcation *be forwarded to Congress. In the.course of his statement, the minister says that the 4lomblan gov ernment feels that its interests are unfa vorably affected by' the misapprehension which has arisen as to the sellifig price of the canal, and that Colombia stands ready to assist this country in the construction of a canal through Colomnbian territory. As to the- amount given by' the commission. $109,41,500, the minister says that that was an estimate of what had already beeh In vested in the work, and-was not, the final selling price. He adds t.hat the foregoing figure is very far from the amount that may be finally fixed as the purchase price of the route.

CONFEREE AT VAR DEPARTIIT Over 4,000 Bills Have Already Been introduced. CURRENT CAPITOL NOTES The republican members of the House committee on ways and means are now en gaged in discussing among themselves whether to report 'a Philippine tariff bill that will serve as a temporary bridge over the difflculties raised by the Supreme Court decision, or whether to go further and pro vide for solving permanently all economic questions which the Insular situation may present. Opinion is divided in the committee. Some members favor a quick action upon a sim ple bill that will extend the Dingley rates to imports into this country from the Phil Ippines, and establish the duties of the.Taft commission upon all imports into the Phil ippInes, whether-from the home country or fortign lands. Others think that sudh a law should have a ltfinite limit upon it, expiring In a given time. anui that meanwhile it should be un dersTpod that a permanent law would be in preparation, t)e result of careful economic ipvestigation, and that It would go into effect at a stated time. It I# gued that trade conditions will be uh; icEas long as there is uncertainty As fW future tariff action, and that such lfcertainty must exist in the absence of Dtter understanding of trade possibilities and the necessities of commerce. If, how ever, there is a time limit on the measure of expediency that is soon to be passed it is claimed that it will enable the cofn mercial interests to adjust themselves to the known situation. The .question w!ll be determined by next Monday or Tuesday, and after that day It, is expected there will be prompt action In The committee and the House on the tariff bill. Assurances have-been received by tie members of the House committee that there Is no disposition on the part of the Senate to attempt to Initiate this tariff legislation and that the bills introduced In the Senate were only tentative. Conference at War separtment. An Important conference was held at the War Department this afternoon in regard to the legislation necessary to meet fiscal conditions in the Philippines as a result of the recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the "Fourteen diamond rings''and the "Dooley" cases.

In the 792se is any indication of legislative en ekgk, the session of Congress just begun is to be a record breakEir. In the three brief sessions of the House which have been held since Monday over one-third the number of bills presented during the whole of the Fifty-sixth Congress have been introduced. The total rumber of bills presented in the House during both sessions of the last Con gress was 14,437. The number presented to the three days of this session ts 4,224. Mon day 1,945 were presented; 1,004 were Intro duced Tuesday, while at the six-minute ses sion yesterday members of the House suc ceeded In getting In 1,275 drafts of their de sires in the legislative line. The work of getting these bills properly entered in the clerks' books, having the announcenent prepared for the Congres sional Record, as well as copy for the gov ernment printer that the bill may be prop erly printed in the legal form without de lay, Is a task which has required the clerks In charge to violate the eight-hour law most flagrantly. The short session yester day caused work for Acting Bill Clerk A. A. Richards an4 Printing Clerk F. D. Mackey until midnight. However, the Rec ord this morning contained a complete list of these measures, while the document room is being flooded with them. Mr. Moody on the Fleming Resolation.

Mr. Moody's resolution asserted that a certain class of voters was disfranchised in Louisiana, thus invalidating the election of Louisiana representatives. Mr. Flem ing's resolution, in part, recites: "Whereas the constitution of the state of Massachu setts, In contravention of the provision of the federal Constitution, Imposes additional qualifications for suffrage by declaring that no person shall have the right to vote who shall not be able to read the Constitution -In the English language and -write his name: "Resolved, flat when the said select committee shall be appointed, it shall De charged with the further duty of inquIring and reporting, by bill or otherwise, whether the representatives from the state of Mas sachusetts are entitled to membership in' thin House, and whether the number of representatives from said state should not be reduced." Str. Moody takes no excepition to Mr. Fleming's resolution. He-is willing to have Massachusetts take the same treatment, i it Is deserved, that is awarded to any other state which disfranchises a portion of the vote.

The board of high ranking army oMcer., headed by Lieut. Gen. Miles, commanding the army, which has been holding daily sessions at the War Department in the consideration of the Important work In trusted to it of reorganizing the present system of army posts, preparing a plan for the location of four permanent camp grounds, and the other matters already out lined, adjourned shortly after 10 o'clock this morning after a -very brief session, and will probably not rvconvene until Jan uary 10, 1902.

There are four heads of mili tary departments on the board-Major Gen eral Brooke, commanding the Department of the East; Major General Otis, command ing the Department of the Lakes and the Department of Dakota; Major General Young, commanding the Department of Cal ifornia, and Brigadier General Randall, commanding the Department of the Colum bia.

The subject of uniforms has been dis cussed informally by the board, General Miles taking advantage of the presence of so many representative officers of the army to obtain theM' iews on that subject, but it Is stated that the board will probably not treat of this subject in its report, confining itself strictly to the work set out in the original order of the Secretary of War.

Mass of Testimony Presented to Show That She is Deranged. The legal offleers of the- State Depart ment are looking Into an application made by the family of Miss Eastwick, the Ameri can girl confined in London after convic tion of having raised a stock certificate. The purpose of the application is to have the department appeal to the British for eign office in Miss Eastwick's behalf. The applicants have presented an over whelming mass of testimony to show that the girl has In the past been subject to fits of derangement, rendering her Irrespon sible, and it Is asserted that she is at present in that condition. The State De partment will transmit these papers to the United States embassy at London, with in structions to do all that can properly be done in behalf of the prisoner. Although it Is said Miss Eastwick was deranged at the time of her trial, and is now, under the British law the court does not allow that fact to affect its decision of the abstract question of the innocence or guilt of the accused, nor even the nature of the sentence. The oply authority com petent to meet the wishes of the friends of Miss Eastwick-that she be turned over to them to be brought to America and placed in a sanitarium-Is the under secretary of state, to whom the appeal will be made.

REGARDING DAiHE II ! Flatly Refused to Answer the Quastions. A NOVEL PROCEEDING There was an interesting and unusual proceeding today in the State Department. when attorneys representing parties to & New York law suit sought to compel the tesUmony of Secretary Hay. The case was an action for libel brought against the New York Journal under the name of the Star Publishing Company, by Carl Fisher Han sen. a Danish banker, resident in New YOrM, and in it is involved Capt. Dirkfeldt Christ mas. These persons were interested, as agents, In the attempt to sell the Danish West Indian Islands to the United States government, and the publication which forms the basis of a libel suit Is said to have renected upon their competency. Some days ago Secretary Hay had notlee that his testimony had been called for by the defense before the New York state court, and this moteing Mr. Clarence J. Shearn, counsel for the Star Publishing Company, appeared at the State Depart ment with United States Commissioner Frank Blackiutone of this city and a ste nographer, Robertson Honey of New York appeared On counsel for Hansen. The par ties were easefted by Secretary Hay in the diplomatic room, the Secretary being ac companied by Judge Penfieid, solicitor of the State Department, as his counsel. The eeretary Refused to Answer. The examinatio*n did not iast long; In fact, there was no examination In sub stance. Counsel for the Star Company at tempted to propound some questions touch lg the negotiations that had occurred be tween Secretary Hay and the Daninh agents in 189-1100. The Secretary flatly refused to answer these, and through Judge Penneld an nounced his reasons for so Oing to be that he had no personal knowebiege of the matters at issue. Whatever knowledge he had had been acquired In his capacity of 1Scretary of State and not as an indi vidual. Moreover, the information sought to be elicited was a privileged communioa tion to the government of the United States and to make this public would be highly prejudicial to the interests of the country. Purpose to Compel Appeasswee. Having formally noted the Secretary's re fusal and the character of his answer the commissioner and counsel withdrew. It In their purpose to state the facts to the aew Tork state court with a view to hay 6e the Secretary of State brought bese tha court on a charge of contempt. It appears that the same parties have ex amined, or sought to examtine, Senator Lodge and Admiral Bradford, chief of the equipment bureau of the Navy Depart ment, who has had much to do with the negotiations looking to the acquisition ot coaling stations by the United States gov ernment. It is gathered that neither of these witnesses gave any testiaony ma terial to the suit, Senator Lodge never hav ing heard of Hansen, and Admiral Brad ford being acquainted with none of the facts sought to be developed by the defense as bearing upon the alleged libel. Secretary uay's Conmeetio With the Cpse. Secretary Hay himself has had very little to do with the parties In this case. He saw Captain Christmas for about nIve minutes on the occasion of the officer's visit to Washington, in the winter of 1900, but Mr. Hansen he does not know. The officials of the State Department feel secure in their position of resistance to the court's order, finding strong precedent for it In a controversy that arose between President Jefferson and Chief Justice Mar shall over a similar application for a man damus many years ago.
