After a spasm of jingoism, which caused shivers of excitement in the fringes of official circles here, the great Japanese war cloud of 1906 stems to have been dissipated and to have left only rum- " bllng of "court case" In California. The cloud Is now considered by officials most concerned to have been part of a tremendous tempest In n tea"' pot. The segregation of some sixty Japanese from graded schools in San m Francisco, two-thirds of whom hap- r| pened to be full grown, Is not now w considered Justification for the war g| talk It created, to say nothing of the t, serious discussion of state's rights by Cl members of Congress. Those who agree with the President's views on . a Japanese mauer h? expreaocu ?u ui? ^ message admit that the President ^ overplayed his position and that ho could have accomplished his purpose of appeasing Japanese wrath by less advanced declaration about enforcing Japanese rights tn California.

ALL FIXED UP EVERYTHING LOVELY AT BLACKSVILLE BETWEEN DOCTOR AND BANK CASHIER. ut Blacksvllle. Monongalia county, seems to have been somewhat exaggerated. A gentleman who was at the home of Dr. I.. L Hall at the time of supposed row. says the affair was i not so serious as reported. C. J. Collins, cashier of the Dunkard Valley bank, was at the honpe of Dr. L. L. Hall when the latter returned from ktnarvanlnwn luct WlflflV aVRnltlff. If i?? reported the doctor had about enough ahead of Morgantown 8|>eakeasy booie to make him feel his keeping a little and he proceeded to create a llltle scene, but with no real cause. Ho admits as much now and everything has been fixed up so that there will be go more trouble. It 5s denied that, there was any shooting or display of guns and that Mrs. Hall went a nay from home. The trouble all seems to have arisen over a stimulated Imagination. Mr. and Mrs. Seals and daughter. Katharine, of Grafton, were recent visitors at the home of Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Watts.
