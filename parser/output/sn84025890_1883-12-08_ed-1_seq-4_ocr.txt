" I am fond of rats, mice, moles, roaches, flies, Hear, moths, ants, scor pions, and like voivnin, hecause I have studied their habits and ways nearly all my life," said a little man "in spectacles to a New York Sun reporter. He sat at his desk in a small shop in a busy street down town, writing busily. At his side was a pen about five feet Ion?, two feet wiac, ana tnree leer. deep. In it wero twenty or thirty ferretd coiled together in nn undulating mass of fur, with here and there a sharp muzzle and a pair of bright little eyes rising above the mass and looking intently at the little man who wrote at. the desk. "There was a time, many years ago," continued the little man, wheeling around in his chair, "when vermin were more or 'less obnoxious to me, but I began to study their habits and natures, and in a short time I became so much interested in them that all dislike disappeared. 3 went into the business of destroying them about 1850, and since that I have had my hands full. I make contracts to rid houses, hotels, and institutions of rats for so much a year. My charges vary considerabty. For a good-sized city residence I remove all rats and keep them awav for a vear for 50." "How do you do it?" "With these little beauties," said the little man, turning affectionately toward thfe pen. As he did so the ferrets wrig- fled out of the cosy tangle in which they ad lain and bounded upward with their fore paws in the air and their heads thrown back, exhibiting joy at every jump. The3T were pretty little creatures, about as large in girth as an average rat, but almost twice the length. Their heads were rat-shaped, their four claws very sharp, and their activity and quick ness nmazing. "I have a thousand of them," said the . 1 - ., ... O' . rat-catcher, "and I wouldn't sell the lot for $20,000. I have trained them all so that they obey me unhesitatingly. When I wish to clear a house of rats I take some of my ferrets five or six or ten and slip them into the rat holes. I leave them there all night, and whistle for them on the following day. They come right to me, and I take them home. No rat can escape a ferret. The rat3 run from fer rets like mad, but it is useless. Where ever a rat goes a ferret can go. The ferret catches a rat and then eat3 him flesh, bones, hair, tail, everything. Ferrets cannot live without rats for any length of time. I feed mine hair, feath ers, and fur regularly twice a week. " Where do you get vour ferrets?" "1 breed them. Different breeds can be crossed as easily as with dogs." He took a bit of raw meat in a big pali vof iron nippers, and held it at a height ol about four feet over the den of ferrets. Every one of tho little creatures bounded fiercely for the meat. He raised it as they jumped, and only half a dozen ol the best jumpers succeeded in fastening their jaws on it. To show how tenacioush the ferrets held their grip, the rat catchei Bwung the meat around his head and slammed the ferrets against the sides oi the pen, but they could not be shaken from their hold. Then he selected one, seized it by the back "of tho neck, and tore it loose from the meat. " This one," he said, holding it aloftj " is a new breed. It is a cross betweei een the American minx and tho Fitch ferret, and can stand the climate better than the uncrossed breed. FcrretstTequire consid erable care, but I avoid any contagious diseases bv a very simple plan." "What" is it?" "As soon as a ferret gets the least bit off I shoot it and throw it away. It is a wise plan, for the rest are never troubled.' Instrnction of Deaf Mutes. Alexander Graham Bell, whose name is known to all who use the telephone, vtakes a deep interest in the instruction oi deaf mutes. In a recent letter on the subject he says: "In 1878 I organized 8 day-school in Greenock, Scotland. At my suggestion an unoccupied room was secured in the Greenock academy, n Bchool containing, I should think, up ward of two hundred hearing children. In this room the deaf children were taught by a special articulation teacher sent from America. They were caused to associate with the hearing children in the academy in every way possible. They .played with them, and joined them for instruction in writing, drawing and sew ing. The success of this school has been so great that the board of education has adopted it as a permanancy, throwing it open to all the deaf children of Green ock and the surrounding towns. The deaf pupils have formed many friend ships among the hearing pupils of the academy, with whom they converse freely by word of mouth." He thon goes on to speak of a similar school which he has recently had opened in Washington, D. C. "We have obtained a room in a 'building occupied by a kindergarten school for hearinjr children. There is a large garden in connection with this building, and the deaf children will play with the hearing children in the play ground, and join them for an hour or so every day in the kindergarten occupa tions. I think that the time has come when some organized effort should be mado to convince the public and the more conservative teachers of the deaf of the practicability of articulation teach ing. The recent census shows us that we have in this country about 34,000 deaf mutes, and that more than half are under twenty-one years of age. New schools must be established, and why should they not be day schools, where the children may learn to speak and understand speech by the eye, and bo kept in constant association with hearing children?" P&per For Unole Sara's Carrenor. The paper on whicli the United StateB currency is printed is manufactured at Dalton, Mass., and the Boston Herald, in a recent issue, gives the following particulars: "Eighteen or twenty treasury girls, who earn $3 a da', count the sheets, examining each one closely, und rejecting all imperfect ones. An automatic register at the end of the ma chine registers every sheet aB it is cnt off and laid down. The register man takes them away in even hundreds, and they are immediately counted in the drying room. In all the various pro cesses of finishing every sheet is counted, and they are again counted on their re ceipt at the treasury department in Wash ington.

The new boundary survey treaty with Mexico, a trademark, con sular and a supplementary treaty of extradi dition with Spain and conventions extending the duration of the Franco American claims commission have also been proclaimed. I suggest that Congress create a, commis sion to consider the general question of our rights in the fisheries and the means of open- conditions, the richly-stock d fishing water j and sealing grounds of British and llutsian i -North America. Correspondence rolatiTe to the Clayton Buhver treaty has been continued and will be laid before Congress. The legislation of France against the im portation of prepared swine products from the United States, has been repealed. Germany still prohibits the introduction of all swine products from America. A friendly invitation was extended that gov ernment to send experts to our pork grow ing localities to examine the subject, which was refused. It is understood that measures for ths rempval of the restrictions, which now bur don our trade with Cuba and Puerta Rico, are under consideration by the Spanish gov ernment The proximity of Cuba to the United States and the peculiar methods of adminis tration which there prevail necessitate con stant discussion and appeal on our part from the proceedings of the insular authori ties. I regret to say that the just protests of this government have not as yet produced satisfactory results. The United States now parMcipating in a reunion of the tariffs of the Ottoman Em pire they have assented to the application of a license tax to foreigners doing business in turkey, but have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering th ports of that country. The government of the Khedive has pro-pos- d that the authority of the mixed judi cial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the United States accused of crime, who are now triable before .con sular courts. This government is not indis posed to accept the change, but believe that its terms should be submitted for criticism to the commissioner to revise the whole sub jeer. At no lime in our national history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with nj neighboring Stato th.'iu now exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country shows by what has already been accomplished. The provisions for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of hostile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The operations of the forces of both governments against these savages have been successful, and several of their most dangerous bands have been captured or dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican soldiers, fighting in a common cause. The boundary from tho Bio Grande to the Pacific, having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconnaisance therein stipu lalcd has been effec ed. It now rests with Congress to make provision for completing the survey and re-locating the boundary monuments. Our geographical proximity to Central America, and onr political and commercial re'ations with the States of that country ju3 ti'y, in my judgment such a material in- I rrQ.-iRfi of onr conpular corns as will Dlnca at each capital a consul-general. In pursuance of the policy declared by our government of extending our intercourse with the Eastern nations legation have, dur ing the pat year, been established in Persia, Siam and Corea. It is probable that perma nent missions of those countries will ore long be maintained in the United states. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither. China, by the payment of a money indem nity, has settled certain of the long pending claims of our citizens, and I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon be ad justed. There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigration of Chinese has boon iola;ed, intentionally or otherwise by officials of China, upon whicli is devolved tliedutyof certifying that the immigrants below to the excepted classes. Mea-ures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed infaction, and it is believed that the government of China will co-operate with the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law. The question of tho general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has been consid ered in an international conference held at Eoldobnt, without definite results. The rich and iopulous v alley of the Congo is being opened to commerce by a Bociety called "The International African Associa tion," of which the KitJg of the Belgians is the president, and a citizen of the United Stnes tho chief executive officer. It may become advisable for us to cooper ate with other commercial powers in pro moting the rights of trade and residence in the Congo valley, free from the interference or political control of any one nation. I have alluded in my previous message to the injurious and vexatious restriction suf fered by our trade in the Spanish West In dies; Brazd, whoe natural outlet for its great national staple, coffee; is in aud through tho United State, imposes a heavy export duty upon that p o.lnct. A lite nar row policy is pursued in other American countries. Our petroleum expo ts are ham pered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by restrictions as storage and by onerous taxation, and the free outward movement of our great food products is in some quar ters clogged wiih like impediments. FortbB&e mi6chiofs adeq Ate relief is not always af fordtd by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now awaitins thn action of the Senate. Is it not advisable to pro vide soma measure of cqniiable retnliation in one rela tion with RuvernraentB which discriminate against oui own? If. for exnmple, the executive were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerfci ltico the same nile3 uf treatment and scale of penalties lor technical faalts which are applied to onr TKBRelB and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that coarse miRht not be barren of RDtd results.

A statute hHssInco been enacted oy which tho annual tax receipts of the government h.ivo been cut a own to the extent of at leaBtflltv or sixty milli ns of dollars, While 1 have no doubt that till further re- dnctins may be wisely made. 1 do not advise the adop- tion at thiB session ot any zneisures for large diminu- t.on ot me nst;onai revonufs. In the interval which taunt elapse before thefiffectG of the act of March 'A, 185, can be definitely a.scertalned, a portion at least of th surplus revenues may be wisely applied to the long-neglected Cnty ot rehabilitatint; our navy and providing coast defenses ior the protection of our liarbor.

How can tho danger bo ob viated ? The most ehectual plan, and one whose adoo tfon at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been indicated.

WW.I.UAI UU UUbOUU&UMW AMJ UUU U1U JLWiU' I feel bound to impress upon the attention of Congress the necessity of continued prog ress in the reconstruction of the Navy. The condition of the public treasury, as 1 havo already intimated, makes the preson an au spicious time for putting this branck of the servico in a state of efficiency. It is no part of our policy to create and maintain a navy able to cope with that of other great powers of tho world. We have no wish for foreign conquest and the peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption. But that our naval strength should be made adequate for the defense of our harbors, the protection of our commercial interests and the maintenance of our national honor, is a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can wiuiaoia ms aEsent. Tho report of the Postmaste-General con tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and prospects of the interesting branch of tho public service committed to his care. It appears that on June 3. 18S3, the whole num ber of postoffices was 47,683, of which 1,032 were established during the previous fiscal year. Admitting that its authority in the premi ses is as ample as has ever been claimed for it, it would not, in my judgment, be a wise use of that authority to purchase or assume the control of existing telegraph lines, or to construt others kith a view of entering into general competition with private enterprise. I avow my belief, however, that the gov ernment should be authorized by law to ex ercise some sort of supervision over inter state telegraphic communication, and I ex press the hope that for attaining that and some measure may be devised which will re ceive your approbation. The Attorney-General criticises in his re port the provisions of existing law fixing the fees of jurors and witnesses in the foUeral courts. It is manifest that such compensation as might, when these laws were enacted, havo been just and reasonable, would, in many in stances, be justly regarded at the present day as inadequate. I concur with the Attorney General in the belief that the statutes should be revised by which these fee3 are regulated. So, too. should the laws which regulate the compensation of District Attorney and Mar shals. They should be paid wholly by sala ries, instead of in part by fee3, as is now the case. It would prevent much of the present expensive litigation which is carried solely to increase fees. I particularly call your attention to his pre sentation of certain phases of the Indian question; to his recommendations for the re peal of the pre-emption and timber culture acts, aud for more strh gent legislation to prevent frauds under the pension laws. The 'i: -.. -. --;-,- - . , -.i vv TV , ironies Trmai presence trie aeimnions ana punishments of cnme3 relating to pensions could doubtless bo made more effective by certain amendments and additions which are pointed out in the Secretary's report. I have previously referred to the alarming state of illiteracy in corti in portions of the country, and again submit for the consider ation of Congress whether some federal aid should be extended to public primary educa tion wherever adequate provision therefor has not already been male. He recommends more stringent laws to J control and disrupt poligamy. The department of agric ilture is accom-p'i-hing much in the direction of the agri cultural development of this country, aud the report of the commissioner giving the results of his investigations and experiments will bo found iuteresting and valuable. I trust that Congress will not fiil at its present session to put Alaska under the pro tection of law. Its people have repeat edly remonstrated against our neglect to afford them tho maintenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of tho treaty whereby that treaty was ceded to the United States. The right of these railway corporations to a fair and profitable return upon their invest ments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must be recognized, but it seems only just that, so far as its constitutional authority will permit, Congress should pro tect the people at large in their inter-Stato traffic against aots of injustice which the State governments are powerles to prevent. Ho recommends the protection of forests from which the country derives its supply of water. Ihe Centennial Exposition to be held next year at New Orleans in commemoration of the centenary of tho first shipment cotton from a port of the United States bids fair to meet with like gratiiying success. Under the act of Congress of the 10th of February, 1SS3, declaring that exposition to be national and international in its character, all foreign governments with whidi the United States maintain relations have been invited to par ticipate. The Civil Servico Act is referred to as im perfect, and asks legislation thereon. j At tho time when the present .txocutive entered upon hiB office his death, rcrnova1, resignation or inability to discharge his du ties would have left tho government without a constitutional head He asks legislation to prevent such a con tingency. Ihe decision of the Supreme Court on the fourteenth amendment is alluded to and he asks that 6ome legislation be devised to placo the colored people in the position said amendment intended. I commt-nd to your attention the verj in teresting and thoughtful suggestions upon this subjeot which appear in the secretary's report. The objection which he urges against the acceptance of any other securities than the obligations of tho government itself as a foundation for National Bank circulation eeemsto me insuperable. For averting the threatened contraction, two courses have been suggested, either of which is probably feasible. One is the assurance of new bonds, having many years to run, bearing a low rate of mlere?t, nnd exchangeable upon specified terms of those now outstanding. The other course, what commends itself to my judgment as the better, is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation, and permitting the banks to issue notes for an amount equal to DO per cent, of the market value, instead of ns now tho face value of their deposited bonds. I agree with the Secretary in the belief that the adoption of this plan would afford the necessary relief. The trade dollar was coined for the pur pose of traffio in countries where silver passed at its value, ascertained by its weight and fineness. It never had a legal trade quality. Large numbers of these coins entered, how ever, into the volume of our currency. By common oonsent their circulation in domes tic trade has now ceased, and they have thus become a distributing element. They should not be longer permitted to embarrass our currency system. 'I recommend that pro vision be made for their reception by the treasury aud 'ho mints as bullion, at a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like fineness. From the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that in only a single instance has there been any disturbance of tho quiet condition of our Indian tribes. A raid irom Mexico into Arizonawas made in March last by a Email party of Indians which was pur sued by General Crook into the mountain regions from which it had come. It is con fidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur, and that the Indian tribes vhich have for so many years disturbed thp West will hereafter remain iu peaceable sub, mis?in. 1 again call your attention to the present condition of our extended seacoast, upon which are so many large cities whose wealth and importance 'o the country would iu time of war invite attack from modern armored ships against which our exi-ting defensivo works conld give no adequate protection. Whose works were built before the introduc tion of modern heavy rifled guns into mari time warfare and if they are not put in an efficient condition we may easily be subject ed to humiliation by a hostile power greatly inferior to ourselves. The Secretary of the Navy reports that under the authority of the Aots of August 5th, 1&S2, and March 3d. 1883, the work of strengthening our Navy by the construction of modern vessels has been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers are in process of con- struction. The Chicago of 4,rC0 tons dis- placement ana me .Boston ana Atlanta, eacn of 2.5L0 tons.

At 3 o'clock the Senate adjourned until noon to-morrow. house. At precisely 12 o'clock Clork McPherson took his stand at the clerk's desk, rappod tho House to order and proceeded to calj the roll of Representatives-elect. The State of Mississippi having been reached, the clerk said that he wished to make a state ment as to his failure to put upon tho roll the name of any Representative-elect from the second district. Tho reason for this was that no paper which could bo considered a certificate of election in the sense of the law had been presented to him. Mr. Chalmer. had filed four exhibits in support of his claim for the seat, but neither individually nor collectively did these exhibits afford the olork of tho House sufficient authority for fcae enrollment of Mr. Chalmers. If the Governor of Mississippi had issued a cer tificate of election to any one it had not been presented to the clerk. In regard tu the first district of North Carolina, the clerk stated that he had not received the certificate of the election of the successor of Walter It. Pool, who died in August last. Tho roll call disclosed the presence of 31G members ELECTION OF BPEAKEB.

Mr. Carlisle was declared elected, and in an address thanked the membors of the House for the honors conferred. The sig nificant points of the address are as follow?: T nm eni.A rranilnmari- flint, nil mnffprs of legislation presented during this Congress will receive from you such careful consider ation as the magnitude and character of tho interests involved require, and that your action upon them will be wise, conservath e and patriotic. Sudden and radical changes in the laws and regulations affecting the commercial and industrial interests of tii-j people ought never be made unless impera tively demanded by some public emergency, and in my opinion, under existing circum stances, such changes would not be favorably received by any considerable number of those who have given serious attention to the subject. Applause. Many reform are undoubtedly necessary, and it will be your duty, aftor a careful examination of the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide how far they should extend, and when and in what manner they should be mado. Ap plause. K there be any who fear that you: action on this or any other subject will actu ally be injurious to any interest or even afford reasouable cause for alarm. I am quire sure that they will be agreeably disap pointed. Applause. What the country has a right to expect is strict economy in tho ad ministration of every department of the government, just and equal taxation for pub lie purposes, a faithful observance of the lim itations of the constitution, and a scrupulon regard for the rights and interests of the great body of the people, in order that they may be protectd.as farasCocgress has power to protect them, against encroachments from every direction. Whatever can be done under the circumstances surrounding ns to meet this expectation ought to be done in my judgment. The other business of tha session was the wearing in of new members -and a partial consideration of the Mississippi contested case of Chalmers, which was referred to the committee on elections. The House ad journed at 3.30 P. M. SENATE. The only business of importance in the Senate was tho reading of the President's Message, after which the following resolu tion was offered by Senatar Wilson, of Iowa, proposing the following amendment to the constitution: "Congress shall have power by appropriate legislation to protect citizens of the United States in the exercise and enjoy ment of their rights, privileges and immuni ties, and to assure to them the equal protec tion of the laws."
