A special to the T'i-t ,rd-H-r;i!l from Washington says: "All Japanese emigration to the United Stati-s is to be stipi-d by the Japanese government. When the Jajanese diet , meets a few weeks hence, Haron Ko inura. minister of foreign affairs will make an official announcement that the government has decided to prohi bit all immigration to the United States after a given date. Thus will disappear the last remain ing possible cause of trouble between the United States and Japan. Though announcement in Tokio may be . '.ide upon the assumption that the Japanese government has voluntarily agreed upon this course, as a matter of fact, the decision was reached through fit? long series of negotiations between Secretary Root and Haron Takahira, the Japanese ambassador to the United States. The order of the Japanese gov ernment will prohibit all immigration, but will leave travel free, so that mer chants, students and tourists may vis it America at will under a passport agreement with the United States gov ernment. When the "understanding" between the United States and Japan as to the Pacific ocean and Chinese empire was made up a week or so ago, and the notes which had been exchanged were given t- xtually to the world, comment was made that if our government had settled these questions and left the im migration issue unsettled, no very great progress toward a permanent peace would have been actually made. It is a fact that the highest officials of the two governments viewed the fu ture with apprehension if the immi gration question were left undisposed of. With neither government desiring war, and each doing all in its power to :tvoid it, both might nevertheless be forced into war. The danger was that there might be anti-Japanese riot in San Francisco or elsewhere on the Pa cific coast. - " . This would sir up popular passion, both in the United States and Japan. In this country it tnight easily be fol lowed by public opinion demanding and securing enactment by congress of a Japanese exclusion bill. This, in turn, would inflame public opinion among the Japanese. For a long time it has been believed by the best informed of 1 ELECTRIC Signs and Ornamental Brass and Iron Work of all kinds. E.

No pre cautions had been taken to prevent the public from crowding the plat forms and as the' train steamed into the depot, the president was greeted with shouts of "Long live Castro," and ihere was a general lifting of hats and much cheering.

TEMPE, ARIZONA TO THE FORE Both Senator Foraker and the President Heard From THE FORMER'S-AMENDMENT Proposing to Take Matter Entirely Out of Executive Hands-Latter's Communi cation Holding That Sub ject Has Been Disposed of. Washington, Dee. 14 Senator Fora ker today introduced an amendment to the biiliiirovliling for the re-enlistment of the negro troops discharged with out honor because of their alleged par ticipation in the affray at Hrowns- ville, and he addressed the senate com mittee concerning the amendment. He proposes In his new measure 10 es tablish a tribunal consisting of retired army officers, before whom the evi dence niav be submitted as to the guilt of the defendants and before whom the defendants themselves might appear to answer the charges. The measure is no drawn as to prac tically take out of the hands of the executive and to give to the tribunal appointed by congress full authority to consider the Brownsville question and by its findings provide for the re enllstment of the discharged negroes. Irr addressing the senate, Mr. Fora ker said that during the summer let ters had been coming' -v. him from these discharged negro .idiers declar ing that detectives were constantly en gaging them in conversation. The sen ator spoke of the activities of detec tives as outlined by his correspondents, saving that in many cases they went so far as to take up their dwelling with the discharged soldiers for the purpose of securing their confidence and spying upon their movements. He approved the ferreting out of facts, but he declared that there was a right wav to do it. Upon the conclusion of Mr. Fora ker's remarks. Jlr. Culberson asked that the president's message on the Brownsville affair be read, and Vice President Fairbanks directed that it be done. All the senntors present re mained in their seats and much inter est was shown in the document. A synopsis of the president's mes sage is as follows: "Xo the Senate: I enclose herewith from the secretary of war, transmit ting a report of the investigation made by Mr. Herbert J. Brown, employed by the department in conjunction with Captain Vt G. Baldwin to investigate as far as possible what happened at Brownsville on the 13th and 14th of August. 19fi. The report and docu ments contains some information of value and some statements that are obviously worthless, but I submit them in their entirety. "This report enables ns to fix with tolerable defnitcness at least some of the criminals who took the lead in the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville. It establishes clearly the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting, but upon this point fur ther record was unnecessary, as the fact that colored soldiers did the shooting had already been established beyond all possibility of doubt. The Investigation has not gone far enough to enable us to determine all the faets and we will proceed with it, but it has gone far enough to determine with sufficient accuracy certain facts of enough importance to make it advis - able that I place the report before you. j "It appears that almost all the mem bers of Company B must have been actively concerned in the shooting, either to the extent of being partici pants or to the extent of virtually en couraging those who were participants. As- to companies C and D, there can be no question that practically every man In them must have had knowl edge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of B troop and, possibly, by one or twp others in one of the other troops.

"Nevertheless, It is to bo said In partial extenuation that they were probably cowed by threats usVle by the more desperate of the men who bad actually been engaged in the shooting, as to what would happen to any one man who failed to protect the wrongdoers. Moreover, there are c ir cumstanees tending to show that these misguided men were encouraged by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment and tlenial. "I feel, therefore, that the guilt of the men who, after the event, thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by refusing to tell the truth about them, though serious, was in part due to the unwise and improper attitude of others, and that sninc measure of allowance should be made for their misconduct. In other words, I believe that we can afford to reinstate any of these men who now truthfully tell what has happened, give all the aid they can to fix the responsibility upon those who are actually guilty, and show that they themselves had no guilty knowledge beforehand and were in no way implicated in the affair, save by having a knowledge of it at terwards and refusing to divulge it. "Under the circumstances, and in view of the length of time they have been out of service and their loss of benefits that would have accrued to them by their continuous long-time service, we can afford to treat the men who meet the requirements given above as having been sufficiently pun ished by the . consequences they brought upon themselves when they rendered necessary the exercise of dis ciplinary power, i recommend that a law be passed allowing the secretary of war, within a fixed period of time. say a year, to reinstate any of these soldiers whom he. after careful exam ination. finds to have been Innocent and whom he finds to have done all in his power to help "bring to justice the guilty. "Meanwhile the investigation will be continued. Results have made it ob vious that only by carrying on the in vestigation as the war department has carried it on, is there the slightest chance of bringing the offenders to justice, or of separating, not the innt cent. for there were doubtless hardly any innocent, but the less guilty from those whose guilt was heinous. 

"THEODORE ROOSEVELT. "White House, December 14th. 1908." Senator Foraker took the floor as soon as the president's message and ac companying reports had been read. He read a letter from Bird Conyers, a dis charged soldier, who is alleged to have made a confession to Detective Law son. In his letter, Conyers speaks of the visit of Lawson to Monroe, Oa, where Conyers had been living. Con yers says he learned that Lawson was there to "pick" him and that he had a "high sheriff arrest - Lawson. As Lawson had not had an opportunity to have a private talk with Conyers ac cording to the tatter's letter, it made him angry and Conyers says Lawson "told lies." to the sheriff about him. Mr. Foraker referred caustically to the colored detective, calling attention to the fact that his "high sounding, smooth, logical report- is signed with his mark," and then adds: "Oh, Mr. President,, when this thing Is gone to the bottom of, all honest men will be ashamed of It." Taking up the second letter from Bird Conyers and before reading it. Senator Foraker said: "This is a little tedious, perhaps, but I think it is due to this soldier, due to the truth, and due to common decency that the story' be told." Mr. Foraker said the presi dent's statement concerning this In vestigation by detectives showed the propriety of adopting such a provision as that embodied in his amendment. "It scorns to me," he said, "That one of the worst features of this whole un fortunate business Is that this man should now be pursued In this way by secret detectives in the manner I have described. Senator Foraker read a letter he had written to Conyers in which he said: "The senate would look after the de tectives who are visiting him." "That promise will be made good," declared Mr. Foraker. "Enough has been shown to make it the imperative duty of the senate to create a tribunal before which these men can go and re ceive a hearing. Is there any thing more atrocious than this case against these men? This is the sixth time they have been put on trial and five times they have been acquitted in my opinion." Mr. Foraker concluded by declaring that the president's statement that the espionage against the soldiers of the 25th regiment vuld be continued, was an additional reason for some prompt action by the senate.
