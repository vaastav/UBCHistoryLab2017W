Towards the latter part of the summer of I s 4o, a lad cd prepossessing appear ance entered the beautiful tuwu of G , - tuated at the foot of ifieueca Lake, New York, near the centre of the State. He Lad traveled from the western part of ihiio, where his father a widower, had died frotu one of those malignant fevers socoumionin newly made countries, while overseeing the cultivation ufa large tract of land, in order to regain a fortuue ]. -t during the disastrous specqlatioas of 1836. Being au only son and left among! ctrtDgers at the death of Lis father, George Went worth resolved to leave Ohio, and remove to the State of New York for the purpose of trying his fortune in any niauuer that chance might offer. He bad passei through several towns and l villages ou his route without meeting with anything to attract his attention, until reaching G . This fine IOWD, with its lovely lake aud fine scenery struck his fancy ; so he determined to obtain employment if possible, and make it bis future home. While walking along the principal •tree: of the shady avenue overlooking the lake ou which were located several £ce churches aud other public buildings, he saw a large crowd of people assembled j around a newly erected liberty pole, in front of one of the priucipal hotels. On approaching the spot, he fuuud it a pub lic meeting, held for tho purpose of raising the pole and making party speeches. Our hero forced his w*v into the crowd ;ust as they were raising the "Stars and Stripes," with the names of Lhcir candi dates to the top of the flag staff. The flag had scarcely reached half way; the enthusiasm being at its height, when the Card twisted aud caught in the little wheel at the top They pulied and tried every way, but were unable to raise or lower the flag a single iuch. The excite ment and cheering ceased and all eyes were turned to the half-masted flag. A portion of the opposition party, who were group r d a little iu the rear of the main body, began to jeer and joke about the apparently bad omen, to the evident dis comfiture of tneir opponents. At leDgth Judge S , editor and publisher of the G Journal , then a candidate for Congress, offered fifty dol lars to the person who would climb the and draw the cord through the wheel. The utmost silence reigued for several minutes, but no one advanced to make the daring trial. "Will uo one volunteer?" shouted the Judge, strougly excited as a peal of laugh ter went up from the rauks of the oppo sition. The chuckle had scarcely died away, however, before George, with his cap and shoes off, stepped before the Judge, and with a confident look exclaimed, "Yes, sir, I'll climb it 1" "You, my lad, are you strong enough?" "Oil, yes, sir; I am used to climb ing." "Then go ahead, my little Spartan," said the Judge, at the same time giving him an encouraging pat upon the shoul der. Steadily, hand over hand, his feet clutching the pole in a manner that proved him to be an expert climber, George made his way to the very top of the staff which was so slender that it swayed to and fro with his weight. Nothing daunted, he wound bib legs right and left around the pole, and with his right hand untwisted ike cord. Shouting fearlessly to those j below f© hoist away, he clung on till the flag fairly reached the top, and then slow ly descended. The cheers that now rent the air were terrific—everybody, opposition and all, joining in with one uuiversal shout. Alter the excitement had semewliat subsided, Judge S looked upon the boy with admiration, and took out his pocket book to pay tLe promised re ward. George noticed the action and exclaim ed— "Keep your money, sir, I want no pay for helping to raise an American | flag/; "Nobly said, my little man ; what is iyour name:" inquired the Judge. "George AYeutworth, sir; I am an or phan, and just arrrived here in search of employment," replied our hero, his bright eyes glistening with a tear. "Well, you shall live with me," ex claimed the Judge: "I'll take care of vou for the future." * $ £ $ £ $ Five years have passed away since George Wcotworth had been a member of bis bene,'actor's family. ID the mean time Judge S had been defeated by his political opponent, and George had been initiated into the mysteries of the "Art of Arts." He had become a great favorite with the citizens, and was looked upon as the adopted son of the Judge.— It was whispered in private circles that he was to be the envied husband of the beautiful and accomplished Ida, the Judge's only daughter, hut this George had not dared to dream of; 'tis true he never felt so happy as when in her pres ence, and it diu make him twitch to see the foppish students from the college swarm around the unacknowledged idol of his heart. Poor youth ! had he known the real state of Ida's feeling the thought would have almost turned his brain ; und could he have interpreted the gleam of joy that flashed from her eye when be uttered a noble sentiment or sally of wit. it would have filled Lis soul with extacy and delight. One tine day in the latter part of June, Ida, her father and George, were enjoy ing a sail on the lake in their trim little yacht, tiie Swan —which WOD the cup at the last regatta, under the management of our hero, who was standing with his hand on the mast gazing at the beautiful scenery on the opposite shore ; the Judge held the tiller and Ida was leaning over the side of the boat trailing her pretty hand through the clear water of the lake, when a sudden gust of wind carreeoed the yacht ao that she lost her balance and fell into the water. George heard the splash made by Ida, and before the Judge eould utter a cry, he had kicked off his light summer shoes and plunged in to her rescue. Being a skillful and vigorous swimmer, he came up with the struggling girl before her cloGies allowed her to siuK, and entwining her waist with his left arm, struck out with his right, and kept her above water till the Judge turned the boat and came to their relief. In a few moments they were safe in the boat again, and Ida soon recovered from the effects of her unexpected bath. The old Judge embraced Gecrge and ex claimed with teqrs starting from his eves : "God bless you, my dear boy, you have saved my daughter's life, how can I ever repay you 7" "By saying nothing about it," replied George. "I owe you now a thousand times more than I cau ever repay, and am too happy in being able to render this slight service." The lovely Ida could say nothing, her heart was overflowing, but she gazed on her preserver with an expression which told volumes. Her father observed her earnest, loving glauce, and began to guess the true state of affairs. lie was not prepared for it, and in silence he turned the boat toward the shore. They reached home with feelings far different from those they had started with. The folio wiug morning, George re ceived a note to meet the Judge in his library. His heart beat wildly—what can it mean ? The Judge had determined to put him to a severe test. As soon as George en tered the library he commenced : "Since becoming an iuuiate of my fam ily, George you have conducted yourself in an honorable and worthy manner per forming every duty cheerfully, and neir leetinjj none. You are now of age, and capable of doing businees for yourself.— I have placed §SOOO in the bank at your disposal, you can use this sum as you think proper, or let it remain on interest, or you can take charge of my office under a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year. In either case you must leave my house for the present. What do you think of my proposal ?" George was completely bewildered and stammered forth a request to be allowed a few hours for consideration. This be ing granted, he repaired tohisrooom and threw himself on the bed iu a paroxysm s>eboted fo li)e of Jhje COUDERSFORT, POTTER COUNTY, PA., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1861. of grief. Could the Judge have guessed what he himself had hardly dared to hope? | What right had he to his benefactor's daughter aud fortune ? None! He would smother his feelings, and earn an honora ble living by his own exertions. A arions was the rumors set afloat by | the scandal mongers of G .as to the cause of young Wentworth's leaving his patron's mansion, but their inuendoes l were uuheeded. His brow wore a more! thoughtful expression, and his cheeks: were paler. The Judge acted toward, him in a straightforward, frank manner,! yet never addressed him ; n the kind,; fatherly tones as had been bis wont be-' fore the incident that occured on the lake, j It lie chanced to meet Ida in 1113 walks, 1 'a friendly nod was all that passed ; still she felt that his looks betraved him, for the warm blood gushed from his lovimr heart and tinted his cheek with the tell' tale blush, and he cherished the pleasing; thoughts that her looks were beaming with love and hope. A little more than a year had passed 1 from the time George had left the home of those he loved. It was the eve of au other election. Excitement rau high, and Judge S was again a candidate for Congress. For several weeks a series of ably written articles had appeared in the Judge's paper. They were addressed. to all classes —farmers, mechanics, and laborers. The orignal and vigorous style, clear convincing arguments, deep and profound reasoning of these articles, inva riably carried conviction to the parties to whom they were addressed. All the newspapers of the party of that Congres sional district copied them, and curiosity was on tiptoe to discover the author, as they were simp'y signed by two little * *. The election pissed off, and Judge was elected by a large majority. Late one uight, while Ida and her fath er were returning from a party given in honor of his election, they observed a light in the priutiug office. As the es tablishment was usually closed at twi light. it appeared strange that it shouid be lit up at that hour, so the Judge de termined to learn the cause. IlequestiLg his daughter to accompany hiui, they . walked up stairs and quietly eutered the office. A sight met their gaze which caused the heart of one of them to leap violently. At the desk, a short distance from the door, sat George, fast asleep, with his head resting on his arm. As Ida's father stepped forward to awaken the sleeper, ho observed a politi cal essay lying open on the desk, and a ! freshly written article with the mysteri-1 ous * * attached. The truth flashed up on the Judge in a moment —he was in-j debted to George for success 1 He beck ioned to Ida, who came trembling to his side. Just then they raw by the flicker ing lamp a smile pass over the slumber er's face, and he uttered the words "dear Ida," in a tender tone. "Ob, father!" exclaimed the loving girl affectionately, throwing her arms around him, "do let George come home again. It is surely no sin for him to love me." Awakened by the sound of Ida's voice, George looked around confused, and as he saw Ida and her father, he endeavored to bide the manuscript. But the Judge stopped him, laughing, saying: "It won't do, young rascal ! you are fairly caught, found cut—talk in your sleep, will you 7 ha! but here, take Ida, aud be happy I know she loves you. — Ila ! ha!" George was bewildered and transported --he had been awakened from a pleasant dream to a "bright reality. Matters were soon explained, and the warm-hearted Judge, after blessicsr them both, promised to see them married be fore he started for Washington.

Slavery has commenced a War upon the American Lnion. A distinguished citizen says: "As God lives and reigns, either this Nation will abolish Slavery, or Slavery will abolish it.". ' j THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. In the midst of unprecedented political trou-1 bles, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our inter course with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which en dures factious domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke for eign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungener ous ambition, although measures adooted un der such influences seldom fall to be unfor tunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States, who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid ana comfort which they have in voked abroad, have received less patronage land encouragement than they probably ex pected. If it were just to suppose, as the in surgents have seem: d to assume, that foreigu j nations in this case, discarding all moral, so cial, and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration uf commerce, including, especially, the acqui sition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruc tion than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that for . eign nations are actuated by no higher prin ciple than this, I am quite sure a second ar ' gument could be made to show them that they con reach their aim more readily and easily bv aiding to crush tiii3 rebellion than by giving encouragement to it. The principal lever relied on by the insurgents lor exciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as al ready intimated, is the embarrassment ofcom i merce. Those nations, however, not improb ably saw lrom the tirst that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domes tic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion pro duces the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation promises more durable peace, ani a more extensive, valuable, .and reliable commerce, than can the same nation broken into ho.-tile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discus sions with foreign States, because, whatever might be the wishes or dispositions, the in tegrity of our country and the stability of our Government mainly depend, not ujon them, but ou the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and in telligence of the American people. The cor respondence itself, with the usual reserva tions, is herewith submitted. 1 venture to hope it will appear that we have practised prudence and liberality toward foreign pow ers. averting causes of irritation, and with firmness, maintaining our own rights and hon ! or. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers nec essarily attend domestic difficulties, I recom mend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defences on every s.de. While under this general re ! commendation, provision for defending our I coast line readily occurs to the mind. I also, • in the same connection, ask the attention of j Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is I believed that some fortifications and depots .if arms and munitions, with harbor and nav igation improvements, at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to ! the National defense and preservation. 1 ask attention to the views of the Secreta- , ry of War, expressed in his Report, upon the same general subjects. I deem :t of importance that the loyal re , gions of East Tennessee and Western North ■ Carolina should be connected with Kentucky I and other faithful parts of the Union by rail ; road ; 1 therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the con struction of such a road a? speedily as possible. Kentucky will, no doubt, co-operate, and through her Legislature, make the most ju : dicious selcctiou of a line. The Northern 1 terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line; , in the direction of Knoxville, or on some still : different line, can easily be determined. Ken tucky and the Genial Government co-ope rating, thework can be completed in a very I short time, and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future. Some treaties, designed chiefly for the in terests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration. Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war. we have removed all obstruc tions from the way of this humane reform, except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britanic Majesty's Minister, accredited to this Govern ment. and the Secretary of State, relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by the United S'ates steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and a; justice requires that we should commit no belligerant act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention. I repeat the recommendation of my prede cessor, in bis annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens! against China, pursuant to the awards of the Commissioners under th*e act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed advi sable to carry that recommendation into effect. I would suggest that authority be given for investigating the principal, over the proceed* of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that, Empire. By the act of the sth of August last, Con gress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to deleud themselves against and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only." For the more effectual pro te ion of our extensive and valuable cum in :ce in the Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to au thorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of the United States vessels and their cargoes, and the Consular Courts established by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recogni tion of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the appro bation of Congress, I submit for your consid eration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Charge d' Affaires near each, of these new States. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them. The operations of the Treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjourn ment have Leon conducted with signal suc cess. The patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the Government the large means demanded by the pnMie exigencies. .Much of the National loan has been taken by citizens of the iudnstrial classes, whose confi dence in their country's faith, and zeal for . their country's deliverance from its present peril, have induced them to contribute to the support of the Government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes pecu liar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action. The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year ending ou the 30th of June. 1861, was $80,835,900 27, and the expenditures for the same period, includ ing payments on accounts of the public debt,; were $84,578,034 47, leaving a balance in the Treasury on the Ist of July of $2,237,066 80 for the first quarter of the financial year end ing on the 30th of September. 1861. The re ceipts from all sources, including the balance of July 1. were $102,512,509 27, and the ex penses $98,239,733 09, leaving a balance on the Ist of October, 1861, of $4,242,776 18. Estimates for the remaining three quarters j of the year, and for the financial year of 1863, ; together with his views of the ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the | Secretary of the Treasury It is gratifying to know that the expenses made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained tin* Government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the land. I respectfully refer to the report of tlie .Sec retary of War for information respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for re commendations having in view an increase of! its efficiency and the well-being of the various j branches of the service entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know tuat the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion, and that the number cf troops tendered great ly exceeds the force which Congress author j ized mc to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of dis cipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary couditioa of the entire x army. The recommendation ot the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uni form basis is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country, and is com mended to the serious attention of Congress. The large addition to the regular army, in j connection with the defection that has so con siderably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommend ation for increa-iug the corps of Cadets to the greatest capacity of the Mil tarv Academy. By mere omission. I presume, Congress has failed to provide Chaplains for the Hospitals occupied by the Volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of ; which, properly addressed, lias been delivered to each of the persons and at the dates re ! named, and stated in a schedule' containing also the form of the letter marked A, and herewith transmitted. These gentle men, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at the times respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as Chaplains >n the army. I further suggest ' that general provision be made for chaplains ; to serve at hospitals as well as with rcg- ; intents. i The Report of the Secretary of the Navy 1 presents iu detail the operations of that branch 1 of the service, the activity and energy which i have characterized its administration, and the 1 results of measures to increase its efficiency i and power. Such have been the additions, i bv construction and purchase, that it may i i almost be said a Navy has been created and < brought into service since oui difficulties < commenced. Besides blockading our extcn- t sive coast, squadrons, larger than ever before i assembled under our flag, have been put i afloat, and performed deeds which have in- t | creased our naval renown. I would invive special attention to the re- ( commendation of the Secretary for the more 1 perfect organization of the Navy, by introdue- ( ing additional grades into the service. The i present organization is defective and unsatis- ' factory, and the suggestions submitted by the j ( Department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to. promote the r harmony and increase the efficiency of the s Navy. i There are three vacancies on the Bench of the Supreme Court, two by the decease of c Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the *' resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so 1 far forborne making nominations to fill the vacancies for reasons which I wiil now state.; c Two of the outgoing Judges resided within " the Statc3 now overrun by revolt, so that if a successors were appointed in the same local- n ities they could not now serve upon their cir- n cuits, .md many of the most competent men there probably would not take the personal b 

TERMS.--SI.OO PER ANNtfM. hazard of accepting to serve even liere upon the Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the ap pointments Northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return of peace, although I may remark that to trans fer to the North one which has heretofore beetl i" the South, would not, with reference to territory and population,be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into an empire alto gether too large for any one Judge to give the Courts therein more than a nominal attend ance, rifing in population from 1,470,018 in 1330, to G.151,4u3 in 18G0. Beside this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, the sys tern requires that all the States shall be ac commodated with Circuit Courts attended by Supreme Judges ; while in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, lowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon, have never had any such Courts. Noi can this well be remedied without a change of the system, because the adding of ( Judgcs to the Supreme Court enough for the accommodation of all parts of tlie country, with Circuit Courts, would create a Court I altogether too numerous for a Judicial body I of any sort, and the evil of it be one that will : increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should ic denied them. Il not useful, no State should have them. Let the in be provided lor all, or abol ished as to all. , Three modifications occur to me, cither of whicli I think would be an improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event. Then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme Judges to serve in a number of tliem, corres ponding to their own number, and indepen dent Cirruit Judges be provided for ail the rest; Or, secondly, let the Supreme Judges be relieved from Circuit duties, and Circuit Judges provided for all the Circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts 1 altogether, leaving the Judical functions whol ly to the District Courts, and an independent Supreme Court. I respectfully recommend to the considera tion of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical ad ministration of them. Since the organisation of the Government, Congress has enacted some live thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered through niauy vol umes. Many of these acts hare been drawn in haste, and without sufficient caution, so r t their provisions are often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other, or a; least so doubtful as to render it very diffi cult for even the best informed persons to as ' certain precisely what the statute law really i. It seerns to me very important thai the statute laws should be made as piain and in i telligible as possible, and be reduced to as smali a compass as may consist with the full ness and precision of the will of the legisla ture and the perspicuity of ts language: This, well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible a id intelli gible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. lam inform ed bv some whose opinions I respect that all the acts ot Congress now in force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be re vised and re-written so as to be embraced in one volume, or at least two volumes of ordi narv and convenient size; and I respectsully recoromend to Congre-s to consider the sub ject, and if my suggestion be approved, to de vise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most propor for the attainment cf the end proposed. One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire supptes sion in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justice by thp officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent States, and as our armies advance upon and take possession of p arts of tfcose States, the prac tical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts, nor officers to whom the citizens of other States irmv apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims. Some have estimated it as high as $200.*09,000, due in large part from insurgents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their pat riotic duty to support the Government Under these circumstances 1 have been Urgently so licited to establish by military power courts to administer summary justice in suen cases, I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed, the collection of the debts, was iust and rigut in itself, but because I have been unwilling to g > beyon i the pressure of necessity in the un usual exercise of power. But f! e powers of C (Ogress, 1 slppoac, ere e ; . id to the anom alous occasion ; and ihr-retoie 1 refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration ot jus tice in all such parts of the insurgent Mutes and Territories as may be under the contr. I of this Government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by the pow er of our arms ; this, however, not to be i permanent institution, but a temporary sub stitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some more convenient mean? should be provided, if possible, fcrf the adjustment of claims against the Government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the buy of Government to render prompt ju?Ji~o against itself in favor of citizens as it is <> ad minister the same between private individuals.- The investigation and adjudication of claims, in their nature, belong to the judicial department; besides, it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more th- * usu ally engaged for seme time to come with yeal national questions. It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to icuiove tL; b;.m. U
