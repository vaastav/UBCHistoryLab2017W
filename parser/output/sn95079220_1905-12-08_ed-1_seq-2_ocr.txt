Jf* f* Mlai*, profesaor of naval archmnture on Lake Michigan, says: "During theearly months of thepresent year 1 was actively engaged in design mg and a/terwarda experimenting with an auto boat on Lake Michigan. The hull was made by a local builder. The was an Oldsmnbile. I had a light hull of timber eonstrueted with a fair o? i. am on the water line, but cut away below, except at the Although ft drew compara tive !itt!e water and might be said when ninning to ix> borne on the water, there were alv.ays a few incheasubmerged at tbe i><.-,-., ;:nd this gave the craftatability of baH, J i . it with a sixty horse pttwer moto*. "Bespite the comrmra low horse power, I managed to gat a speed of more than thirty milea t. I found that eutting down ae of the propeller obtained more speed for a given horae power. The h.pr screw did not have the results I ex pected, I also found it extremely diffi brrI to desiu;n a acrew which, revolving JM rnore than a thouaand revolution.s, would not give any back wash. A pro peller reyolving too fast is useless. Tt luae^many builders of auto boats ?'?> ao. take this point into considoration that better results are not obtained by motors: Kevolvine; too foat, the pro petters simply ehurn the water. A good f experimenting is yet to be done before it can be ascertained at what speed a certain sized acrew saoli be to revolve in order to give the mnximum power." A NEW CONGRESS. First Session of 59th Congress Con vcned Monday. "tlncle Joe" Cannon Rc-eleclcd SpeaKer. At Monday noon a new Congress eame upon the Iwards. J?>;. (!. Cannon, of Illinois. was chosen Stwaker. Jno. Sharp Williams, of Vississippi, was named by the Dernocrats aa the minority leader. The Republicans have nearly 2 t<> 1 in botJB Baaaaa earer the DaBBBeraaa. S.-nator John W. Daniel, of Virginia. the friend of the Memorial B the Jamestown Expoaition bills in tbe Senate. was one of the early arriva'.s at tha Capitol. The Senator has a numbcr of bills tacked aaraj for this Congress that will be of interest. Representative Swanson and Mrs. Swanaon have arrived in Washington and taken a suite at the New Willard. where they will reside until Mr. Swan? son takes the oath of office as Governor of Virginia on the first of February. Mr. Swanson said it was his intention to resign his jiosition as a member of the Ways and Means Ckimrnittee, pro vided he could induce Representative John Sharp Williams, the minority lead er, to appoint some other Virginian to the place. This Mr. Williams refuses to do. For some reason he haa not a particular penchant for the Virginia membera, preferring the Democrats from the far South to those of the Old Dominion. The passing of the old leaders in the Senate was strikingly emphasized in a little incident. Senator Teller met Sena? tor Allison in the corridor and said: "Mr. Allison, twenty-nine years ago to? day I was sworn in as a Senator of the United States. You are the only mem? ber of the body besides myself who was her*? then. I also learned today that there is not a single employe of the Senate who was here at that time. We aregetting old, Senator; we are gctting old." Tears sprang to the eyes of both of these gray-haired veterans, and as Mr. Teller moved away. Senator Allison said to the friend with whom he was talking: "Senator Teller is right; we are getting old. It won'tbe long before there will be other boys here to take our places.' * MANY RILLS. About 4,500 billa were presented the first day. Of these only 631 related to matters of public interest. There will be no tariff revision this time, the President being: satisned to get a railroad rate regulatkm bill throu^h. In this he will have to rcsort to Democratic aid. (>ne of the two Quaker members in troduced a bill to cut out, root and branch. all forms of hazing, and more particularly the so-called code of honor that is enforced ajrainst the lower-elass men at Weat Point and Annapolis. The President'a message was sent in Tuesday. Mr. Roosevelt pleads for the creation of a eommission to regulate railway rates and for federal control of insurance companiea. He reiterates his declaration that the United States, to make the Monroe doctrine cffective, BRRRt iruarantee the good behavior of the Latin republics. He urges the need of new warships to take the place of oki veaaels. Regarding 1'nnima he is optimietic. 

"KIDS" IN THE HOUSE. The eisrhty or more "kid" members of the new House gambolled about on the old rose carpet, most of them look injr very much like the bridogrooms who with their bridos aat in the gallerios. They were waahed and shaven and shorn and all had on their best clothes. They tried to minjrle with the old members, but they were coldly received. and they had little to do except atand around and wonder what it waa all about. One of the kids unwittingly went to the alaughter early in the game. Repre sentative Williams, of Mississippi, the minority leader, was appealing to what he terrned the "kida" to atand by the Democrata in preventing the adoption of two rules of tho late Congress, when RepresenUtive Wharton, of Chtcago, askedifheeouldinterrupt. "Certainly," anawered Mr. Williams, courteoualy. ' "I would like to oak the gentleman from Miaaiasippi a question," Mr, Wharton aaid with a quaver inhis volce] "What doea the gentleman mean and to whom does he refer when he saya The Kids of this House*?" "A glance at my interrogator will anawerthequeation," aaidMr. Williams smilingly. The House roared with lauKhter. Mr, Wharton ?$at down and bepran to blush. "I am sorry that I did not answer the question with that de gree of reverence which the person of my interrogator woulduaturaUy excite," Mr. Williama added, causing more laughter. The new members began gathering at the Capitol almost as soonas the scrub men and laborers. They insisted on getting lost in the maze of corridors. Two Missourians were caught climbing the iron steps to the dome in an effort to flnd out where they were to be sworn in. Both are Republicans, and the policeman who found them refused to give their names for fear they might get him ousted from hia job. Kepreaentative Tyndall, of Miaaouri, refused to ride up in the elevator. H? said he was not accustomed to them at Sparta, Mo., and that, haring tired of them at St. Louia, he wanted no more of them. But all the new members successfully dodged trolley cars and cabs and arrived in safety, and they were groping about when Clerk McDowell ealled the House to order at noon. FISH AND OYSTfcUS. The State Board of Fisheriea met in Richmond Friday. The Board held a aeasion in Norfolk Thursday, and de clined to grant the application of the Hampton Crabbing Company for cer tain grounds for crabbing purposes. The board's annual report to the goyer nor of the operations for the year will ahow Uiat the oygter industry has paid the State between $70,000 and $75,000 while the expenses have been about the same as last year, the net revenues to the State reaching about $50,000. THE CRI8PIELD TROUBLE. Order ia fully rostored in Crisfield af? ter the exciting oyster triaJs of last week. State's Attorney Henry J Waters, of Somerset, says the peace Officera at Oisneld acted with great courage during tbe trial and afterward. The SherifT made oo investjgation and the reault was laid before the grand jury which was empanelled Monday. Mr. James E. Ellegood, counsel for the tonger defendants, says the Tangier Company has taken up oyater-planting grounda contrary to law; that some lota are in the name of "dummy" locators and that the grounds have been en larged by atretching out buoys to ground not "lecated." He says Cria fleld waa not under mob rule. Com mander Howard with a police boat is on the acene and preserving order. RUSSIA'S WOES.

SUH'S A6A1NST STEAMBOAT. Judge Wright adjourned court Friday at Montross to open ogain Wedneaday of this week in argument of case of H. StafTord Murphy vs. Md., Del. an<l Va. Railway Co. Monday Judge Wright beld Spotsylvania court for Judge Moson, who is sick. Next week, after l.nishing Heathsville regularterm.Judge Wricrht will go to War?aw to hear the bttita of I?r. Segar and A. W. Harron M the Steamboet Co. In the Murphy case Mr. Murphy tes nri< d that while en route from Freder i'*ksburjr to Carters wharf on August LBftH last, after |>aying his fare he Btartad down ataira to look after his horses. At the bead of the stairs the BaatOR was standing geard while taa punajr was taking up ticketo in another part of the steamer. After gatting down a few steps, the porter caugbt Mr. Murphy in a rough manncr and told him he could not paas. Mr. Murphy informed him that he had paid his fare. Murphy pulled loose and passed on. Later he thought he would gO back nnd explain to the porter as he didn't wish to get him into troubie. He told the porter that he (Murphy) might have been wrong in passing and that he would explain the matter to the purser as he did not want him (tl e porter) eensured. The negro said that didn't make any difference to him that he had no right to go by, to which he (Murphy) replied that it mattered little with him what he (the porter) thought about it, and turned on his heelsto walk awav, nnd as he did so he heard the n"gro say, *'D-it, if you had been any gentleman, you would not have done it." He (Murphy) then turned and struck him in the face. The porter fell back one or two steps and caught him BatfoH the bani.sters. In delivering the blow he (Murphy) had descended the steps one step, and in attempting to aeccnd, slipped and fell. As soon as he fell the porter rushed up the steps, grabbed him under the right leg, and went overon top of him, and struck him (Murphy) several severe blows. The chambermaid interfered and he (Mur? phy) got on his feet, and turned around to defend himself and found that several persons had hold of the porter. He then went down stairs and got his pistol from his grip. When he came back he xaw Capt. Long and several other oflfi eora of the boat coming down in the saJoon from the pilot house. Captain tnct him nnd eharged him with being drunk and disordorly. When he at tempted to explain to the Captain he (the Captain) said he did not want any explanation from him, and used a good deaj of vile and abusive language, but fir.ally took him in the pilot house to hear his statement of the affair. After he had gotten through the Captain in formed him (Murphy) that he was in fault and pulled out a pair of handcuffs and teld him that he would put the handcuffs on him. Later the Captain BRRiaRRl s;>id he was very sorry iorwhat had occurred and ofTered to discharge the negro if he said so.
