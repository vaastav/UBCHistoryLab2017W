"To preserve the manhood anil worn anhood of the world is now the great task set itself by the Toung Women'! Christian Association," said Miss Helen F. Karnes, special war worker of the national council of the Y. VI. C. A., in and interview yesterday. tThere now a great army of women and girls which is stepping into the ranks left vacant by the army of men In khaki, 1 ne conditions under which these thou sands and tens of thousands of women and girls are working at the big muni tion factories, near the army canton ments and at the allied camps abroad are so deplorable that the association is putting forth every effort to help the recruited girl who la doing her part In the great world war. Many of these gins and women who are doing the worg or men, whole they are In train ing or at me rront, nave nan no pro vision made for their comfort; they do not pave nourismng rood or proper sleeping places and are working at top-i-tch speed. It is this state of affairs that has aroused the Y. W. C. A. to their crying need for help," said Mrs. names. "Soldiers are vralned for their work but who thought of training the girls who were to mi tnelr places? Is it not Just as essential that women be trained, developed and made readv for tnelr work as It is that the soldier should have his months of drill and practice? Of what value will It be to safeguard the soldiers if on their re- turn they find the women weakened In nature? "These women, who, by the vicissi tudes of war have been taken from their natural sphere and placed among unusual environments, are subjected to unaccustomed freedom, loneliness an weariness, but are as much in need of love, development and protection as are the men whose work they are doing. in order that the standard of the na tlon may be upheld, the Young Wom en's Christian association is now ap pealing to the men and women of the country to safeguard Its girls and to preserve the strength of the nation bv conserving the physical nature of wom en, home towns are swamped by the Influx of soldiers and hostess, recrea tion and club houses are means to this end." said Miss Humes, "and therefore I am going about helping raise the $4,000,000 which Is promised for this work by the tenth of December." Miss Karnes has been a national Y. W. C. A. secretary In Australasia for nearly six years, and has seen three years of war. She came to Ardmore direct from St. Louis, where she spoke at the great loyalty meeting of women which was preceded by a big parade In which 1,000 girls took park, marching from the association rooms to the thea ter. There were fifty organizations of St. Louis women in line, the Red Cross first aid graduates first, carrying a large Red Cross banner, 700 girls of the Y. W. C. A. drill corps, and 100 members of the Red Cross Y W. C. A. unit, wearing the regulation veils. The debutantes were In line marching with the organizations wltn which they were affiliated, the Rlce-Stlx Liberty League, St. Louis Loyalty League, and the fa mous Karr girls fife and drum corps discoursing martial music, were also in line. A band and platoon of police headed the procession which was Illum ined by torches and flambeaux. Miss ISarnes addressed a meeting at Convention Hall last night In the in terest of the Y. W. C.

"IS VOICE OF STATESMAN WHOSE VISION COMPRE HENDS THE WORLD," LONDON DAILY NEWS SAYS NO COMFORT TO PACIFISTS IS CHEERING FACT TO THE TIMES. London, Dec. 5. President Wilson's message to congress has the fullest pos sible prominence In the morning news papers, but it reached London too late for much considered comment. The Dally News receives warmly the presi dent's declaration that war alms should be based on generosity and Justice to the exclusion of selfish claims. It adds: "It would be affectation to pretend that this language echoes the declara tions of the Kuropean spokesmen of the alliunce. It is the voice of a statesman whose vision comprehends the world, while theirs comprehends only half a world. What Might Have Been. "If President Wilson could have said earlier what he said yesterday, and if In Great Britain, France and Italy, the responsible leaders, had mode his lan guage their own, Russia might today be driving the enemies from her borders. It may be too late to convince Russia of the identity of aim of herself and the al lied democracies, but It must not be too late for those democracies to learn from their greatest representative how democracies should comport themselves In war and how they should attain peace. In the light of President Wilson's speech, a stateme.it that will mean the wiping off the slate much that should never have been written on it, is im perative. There is no kinship between 

KIDNAPS CAR LEE TRIPP IS ABDUCTED AND FORCED ON MING DRIVE LEFT TIED TO TREE. Drive on! Drive on, and step on her tail, hard, while you are doing it!" With a pistol poking him In the ribs. Lee Tripp had no option but to obey the above commands from a burly stranger seated in the car beside him, and thus, under compulsion, he made a weird midnight drive from Healdton in tne extreme north end of this ' county, Late Monday evening of this week, a stranger approached Lee Tripp In Healdton and asked him to take his Reo car and drive him to Pooleville, nd a bargain finally was mude bv which the stranger was to pay Tripp iz for the trip to Pooleville and return. Advance payment was demanded by Tripp anil the stranger produced a fat roll of bills, from which he peeled the requisite $12. aii went wen until tne car reached ooleville, where the stranger stated the point he wished to reach was Just beyond the village, and they drove on nd on until, reaching a point about three and a half miles north of Poole- llle, where Tripp protested, the stran ger seated beside him. pulled a pistol nd shoved the muzzle into Tripp's hort ribs, saying "Drive on drive on. nd step on her tail, hard, while you re doing it." With this incentive Tripp drove on, until the settlement of Tatums was reached, where again he ttempted to protest, but was forced to urn the car about and head for Homer by the reiterated command to "drive emphasized by a prod from the pistol. At a point about half way be- ween Tatums and Homer the car was stopped and Tripp was ordered to get out, the stranger with the gun follow- ng him and backing tiim against a tree, where he tied the chauffeur and left him, after taking the $12 he had paid him and $4 more, all the money Tripp had. Some time after this, long after mid- Ight. someone came bv on horseback nd released Tripp, who made several ttempts to get Into communication with officers of the law by telephone. but failed to get service on any of the ires ne tried. He wandered on afoot ntil he reached Hennepin, where, tired out. he went to bed. In the morning he secured the services of a deputy sher- in. and tne two went to Davis, where hey learned that the stranger with the Kee car had stopped there to buy gaso- ne and drove on, headed toward Okla homa City. Mr. Tripp then came home, to Ard more, and lodged his complaint with the county officials. Sheriff Garrett promptly got his de partment to work on the case, and this morning announced that the stranger In custody at Oklahoma City and the car and money recovered. The arrested man gave his name to Oklahoma City officials at Cecil Giger. Sheriff Garrett 111 go today after his prisoner. MORE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MIUDERED BY GERMAN U-BOAT London. Dec. 5. The British steamer Anapa, according to the Dally Mail, was nearlng home after a two months' voyage when she was torpedoed with out warning. The lifeboats were man ned immediately, and all would have been rescued, but the submarine fired a second torpedo while the women and children were being lowered Into th boats, causing the ship to sink Imme diately, with eighty passengers and the crew. Another report says- that forty pas sengers and thirty members of the ersw were lost and that the surrlrors were landed on the west coast. - AND the spirit of yesterday' speech and the spirit of post-bellum knockout blows, or economic warfure, or after-the-war boy cotts." London Times Speaks. The Times says there are no half tones In the president's address, ad ding: "There are no ambiguous phrases on which militarists may feed the illus ions of their dupes, no hint of com promise and no suggestion of faltering or debut to raise the spirits of the pa cifists. With this straightforward and logical statement of America's war alma the last of the hope of the paci fists must founder." The Dally Graphic says: "Whether this restatement, so lofty In spirit, so forward-looking in effect, will have any influence on German opin ion is doubtful. Then the only resort Is to Inflict such a military defeat upon Germany as to convince the Germans of the infamousness of their rulers. In this connection, It Is an excellent omen that the eonference In Paris reached such a complete unanimity. America was represented at the conference, and their follows the fact that the war aims of the allies no longer can be described in any sense as imperialistic." War on Austria Desirable. None of the editorials dwell especial ly upon the request for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but brief reference implies that It is regarded as logical and desirable. TO BE

POLICE WILL ROUND I P HORDES IN EASTERN CITIES Task Three Times Greater Than When Germans Were Caged. Washington, Dec. S. In anticipation of a declaration of war on Austria, scores of department of justice agents today were laying plans for the arrest of scores of Austro-Hungarian subjects in the United States suspected of being enemy agents. With the adoption of a war resolution nearly a million Austrian subjects in this country automatically would be come enemy aliens and amenable to President Wilson s order requiring reg istration of all aliens and restricting their activities. The department of justice expects to put alien registration into effect within a few days and apply it at first only to eastern cities where the police will con duct registration. The task will be three times greater than when planned for Germans alone. The department realizes that many ; Austrian subjects, particularly Bfche (mians and the Slavic elements, are (actually pro-ally and careful consldera- 'tion will be shown in administering the The department of Justice began tak ing steps for disposition of the great number of new alien enemies the war declaration will create. Many Are Friends of America. The Job is much more difficult than it was In the case of Germany. There are in the United States many subjects of Austria-Hungary who are opposed to that government and sympathize with the cause of the United States. Many of them are Czechs, Bohemians and oth ers of the races which have been op pressed by the Austrian government. Many of them, to Join the fight for freedom of their countrymen and real ization or national aspirations, have joined the American army, waiving ex emptions they might have claimed as aliens. lit is evident that some sort of ex ception will be made for them, as the government hardly wishes to treat them as enemies and still wishes to protect itself as far as possible. The department of labor, which has custody of alien civilians classed as ene mies, also was making its preparations to care for them, as may be necessary. probably In camps such as those In which German civilians are confined. Other Agencies Ready. The department of commerce, the war trade board and the other agen cies charged with enforcement of the tradlng-with-the-enemy act, faced a new task, but as they already have created the machinery for dealing with such a situation a new war declaration actual ly Involves only extensions of steps al ready taken. Austria-Hungary has had no diplo matic or consular relations with the United States since they were broken off at the time of the diplomatic break with Germany. Austrian Investments In this country are being cared for through the alien property custodian. American use of Austrian war-bound ships is legalized by the declaration of war, although some of them have been used heretofore, and the money for tneir use win te paid later. Officials long have considered Aus trians in the United States as danger ous as Germans, and it is a matter of record that the I.
