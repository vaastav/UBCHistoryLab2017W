Tariff Law Claimed to lie Far From a Burden Upon the People. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. President Harrison's third annual message to con gress was delivered to-day. Congress is informed that the long-pending dispute with England over the Behring sea seal fisheries has been satisfactorily settled on a basis of arbitration proposed by England, and during the year ending May 1 next only 7,500 skins are to be taken in the Behring islands. Congress is urged to provide for a joint demarcation of the frontier line between Canada and the United States, wherever required, and especially for the exact location of the water boundary in the rivers, lakes and straits. The announcement is made that Ger many, Denmark, Italy, Austria and France have opened their ports to in spected American pork and pork products. The recent political disturbances in Brazil were a subject of international discussion, and the latest information is that constitutional government has been re-established in Brazil without blood shed. New Orleans Lynching anil Chilian War. The lynching of eleven Italians in New Orleans is considered by the presi dent a deplorable and discreditable inci dent. Claims for indemnity for the men's families were made by the Italian minister and not allowed. That un happy incident led the president to sug gest to congress that offenses against the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States should be cogniza ble in our federal courts. The civil war in Chili, the seizure of the Chilian war vessel Itata at San Diego, Cal., by United State3 court offi cials for violating our neutrality laws, her escape, and the subsequent chastise ment of her officers by the Chilian pro visional government are reviewed. The United States government was disap pointed in attempts to bring about a peaceful adjustment of the rebellion in Chili but at no time did our govern ment, officially or otherwise, recognize the insurgents, and our naval officers at Santiago and our minister there were enjoined from first to last, against tak ing anything but neutral ground. Assault Upon United States Seamen. The assault upon United States sea men from the steamship Baltimore in Valparaiso harbor, (Jet. 10,' called for prompt and decided action on the part of our government. One officer was killed and eight men seriously injured, one of whom has since died. The as saults were unprovoked. Our men were unarmed. The attention of the Chilian government was at once called to the affair and notice was served that due reparation would be insisted upon if the assault proved to have been wholly unprovoked. The reply of the Chilian provisional government was offiensive. This government is now awaiting the result of an investigation by the criminal courts at Valparaiso, which result is looked for soon. This whole matter will be the subject of a special message to congress if Chili does not vender due and speedy account of licm-lf for that unjust and murderous attack iiixui our seamen. A friendly but firm protest has been "-made to Rn.-sia against the hard meas ures oit'ired against Jews in that country. The Nicaragua canal project receives the hearty endorsement of the presi dent, who urges that government aid be extended, if necessary, to complete the canal speedily, and he hopes that neither party nor sectional lines may act as a drawback to this great project which means much for Americans. Tlie Treasury Department. The president insists that tariff and other legislation of the last congress has been only benefictal to all classes. Dur ing the twelve months from Oct. 1, 1800, to Sept. 30. 1891, the total value of our foreign commerce (imports and ex ports combined) was $1,747,800,400, which was the largest of any year in the history of the United States. During the year ending Sept. 30. 1891, our imports of merchandise amounted to $824,71 ,270, which was an increase of more than eleven million dollars over the value of the imports of the corres ponding months of the preceding year. The value of free imports during the twelve months ending Sept. 30, 1891, was $118,092,887 more than the value of free imports during the corresponding twelve months of the preceding year. The Silver Question. Under the law of July 14, 1890, the secretary of the treasury has purchased since Aug. 13, during the fiscal year 48, 393,113 ounces of silver bullion at an average cost of $1,043 per ounce. The highest price paid during the year was $1,202.'), and the lowest $0.9836. In ex change for this silver bullion there have been issued $50,577,498 of the treasury notes authorized by the act. The surplus on March 1,1889, was $183,827,190.£9. The policy of applying this surplus to the redemption of the interest-bearing securities of the United States was thought to be preferable to that of depositing it without interest in selected national banks. There have been redeemed since the date last men tioned of interest bearing securities $250,079,350, resulting in a reduction of the annual interest charge of $11,084, 57 ir. The result of this policy, of the silver legislation, and of the refunding of the 41 per cent, bonds has been a large in crease in the money in circulation. At the date lust named the circulation was $1,404,203,898, oy $28.08 per capita while on the first day of December, 1891, it had increased to $1,577,862,070, or $24.38 per capita. TI10 Postofflce Department. The revenues of the department show an increase of over five millions of dol lars, while the estimates for tlio year 1893 shows a surplus of receipts over expenditures. Eight thousand miles «f new iostnV service has been established upon railroads. The president recom mends that free mail delivery he ex tended to all towns of.0,000 inhabitants, (hat all country pontoftices he uiaOu money order stations, and that the sy* tem of free mail delivery in couuiry district* be tried.

He believes in bringing Indian chiidren into country schools and thinks the general government should pay from tribal funds, into the state treasury, an amount equal to the school tax upon the property of each Indian father. The Sioux outbreak of one year ago is re viewed, and the president states that General Miles "protected the settlers and subjected the hostiles with the least possible loss." The area of Indian reservations li:\s been reduced 23,000,000 acres since March 4, 1889, by allotting lands to Indians iu severalty and by ceding re maining lands to the United Stales for disposition under the homestead laws. Tito Pension liureuu. A report from the pension commis sioner shows that the total number of pensioners on the roll June i!J, 1NIM, was 070,100. There were allowed dur ing the fiscal year ending at that time 250,555 cases. The appropriation for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1890-91 was $12?,885,998.89 awl the amount expended $118,530,659.25, lead ing an unexpended surplus of '$9,155, 144.05. Subsidized Railroads. The report of the commissioner of railroads shows that the total debt of the the subsidized railroads to the United States Dec. 31, 1800, was $112, 512,613.06. A large part of this debt is now fast approaching maturity with no adequate provision for its payment. In closing his third annual message to congress the president pleads for .ballot reform in all sections and under all cir cumstances urges railroad and other corporations to throw additional safe guards around the lives of their em ployes, and hopes that increased appro priations may be made to carry on the work of the civil service commission.

BALTIMORE, Dec. 8. The annual meeting of the Maryland State Grange began during the evening. The closing session will probably be held Thursday. An officer of the grunge says that in all probability only routine business would be transacted during the meeting.

There are about 1,050 members of the Grange. Archbinop Ireland'* Declaration.
