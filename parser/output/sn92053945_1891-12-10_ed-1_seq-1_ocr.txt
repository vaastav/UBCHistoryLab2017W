SUBJECT OF CIRCULATION. An Irronfom llea About the Volume Thereof National Itank. The imporUiot subject of circulation, the secretary says, has been unusually prominent duringthe past twelve months. The stringency in the money market dur ing the summer and autumn of 1S1U, he says, was relieved by the prompt and ef fective measures of his predecessor and happiiy disappeared without producing the grave consequences which were feared by the public; but its existence, and tin widespread apprehension which it caused induced a tevival of the erroneous idea that the volume of money in circulation was not only inadequate to the needs of the country, but was very much less per capita than during the so-called ilush ttmes which followed the civil war. I'lrnty of Money In the Country. The amount of money in circulation has been vtry largely increased since the close of tiie fiscal year. The amount July 1, 1'.M, was $l,4;-7 43 ..Vi7 and the amount per r ivita was 41. The ret urn of gold to t lit- L'nited States, the operation of the bilver note act. and disbursements by the treasury on account of the 4' 4 per cent, loan, pensions, etc., enlarged tlie volume on Dec. 1 to $1,577 2t,o7 , and the per cap ita amount to $24 3s Indorse I.hccv'h MicgeMion. On the subject of natioual banks the secretary invites favorable attention to the recommendations of the comptroller that the present law be so amended as to provide that no association (-hall hi re quired to maintain a bond deposit of more than $l,0iKl to insure circulation; that, every association may issue circulating notes equal to the par value of the bonds so deposited; that the monthly withdraw al of bonds pledged to secure such notes shall not exceed $3,000,000 in the aggre gate, and that the semi-annual duty ou circulation be so reduced as to equal of one per cent. Effort or the Tariff Law. Of the practical effect of the new tariff law the secretary, after exhibiting the figures relating to foreign commerce used by the president in his message, says it has reduced the price of sugar to the peo ple without conflict with the principle of protection because we cannot raise near all the sugar we need; thaton articles u which we compete with foreigner coun tries it is a tax on the foreign producer, who has to pay the duty if he wants to compete with us in our own country, ami that a comparison of the prices of goods will prove the assertion. Reciprocity, Immigration, Etc Of reciprocity the secretary says it has already enlarged " our trade with Laiiu America several millions, although it has beeu in force but. a few months, lie says it is imperative that some bar should be put up against the immigration into this country of Europeau paupers, con victs and oiner undesirable classes, but that the law is defective, and congress only can make it efficient. New legisla tion is needed also in regard to the Chi nese if they are to bfc kept out of this country. ' Major Overman Oaljr a Little Sliort.1 Washingtox. Dec. lo.

It was lis tened to with close interest, the diplo matic gallery being full of foreign repre sentatives who left as ion as that part of interest to them was completed.

COOPER "HAS IT IN" FOR RAUM. The Indiana Statesman Will Have An other Go at the Commissioner. WASHiNGTON.Dec 10. Cooperof Iudiana stated yesterday that he proposed early in January to offer a resolution in the house providing for a thorough and rigid ex amination of the management of the pen sion office under Commissioner llaum. His reason for delaying the matter is that he is going to Indiana on business, and cannot return to Washington until after the holidays. Will Let Vp If Ha ii in Is Krmovrd. He said also that he would not press the inquiry should General Kium be re moved, and yet he did not like to appear in the attitude of threatening the admin istration; but in view of what has already transpired he would not consider himself true to his constituents and the country if he did not do his utmost to havp Haum's administration of pension office affairs thoroughly investigated. CHILI WILL NOT APOLOGIZE. The President's Message Regarded as Menacing a Hutuie. Valparaiso, Dec 10. The substance of President Harrison's statement of Chil ian affairs was received yesterday and is a subject of universal comment. It is re garded by the Chilians as decidedly menacing a ruptura between the two countries, as it is not believed that the Chilian government will consent either to an apoloey or any material indemnity. The majority in congress is known to be opposed to any concession, and the Chil ian government, although possessed of great influence, would find it diflcult to carry the necessary support .for auy humiliating measures. It is now no secret that the government is proceed ing actively with warlike preparations, and that artillery of the latest manufac ture has been ordered from Germany in anticipation of hostilities, possibly with other powers, and probably with the United States.
