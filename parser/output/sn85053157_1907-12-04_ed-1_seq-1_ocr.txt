Vol. XXVIII. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Congress Is Urged To Assist In the War Against Successful Dishonesty. A Federal License Law For Railroad and Other Corporations Strongly Recommended. Currency Legislation Is a Matter That Should Receive Immediate Attention. Tariff Revision Not Considered Advisable at the Present Session of Congress. Income Tax and Inheritance Tax Laws Regarded As Necessary and Just. Washington , December, 3.— The president's message, which was read in both houses of congress today, refers at length to the necessity for a license or incorporation law that will apply to railroads and other corporations that are engaged in interstate business. The purpose of the proposed law is to prevent over-capitalization, and to correct abuses for which there is now no remedy. The president also discusses the lessons of the recent financial trouble, and urges that currency legislation is necessary to meet such emer gencies. In reference to tariff revision, it is submitted that the matter should be approached from a business standpoint, and that it should not be treated as a political question. The session of congress immediately preceding a presidential election is not regarded as the proper time to give the subject the careful consideration it deserves. The president again expresses the opinion that a tax upon incomes and inheritances is necessary and just, and suggests that laws that will not con llict with the constitution should be enacted by comrress. The substance of the message is given in this summary : No nation has greater resources than ours, and I think it can be truthfully saiil that the citizens of no nation pos sess greater energy and industrial abil ity. In no nation are the fundamental business conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment, and it is foolish when such is the case for peo ple to hoard money instead of keeping It In sound banks, for it is such hoard ing that is the immediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people is con ducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms and fac tories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercial enterprises. In any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or commit their misdeeds with impunity their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business -tien of grea 4 - sagacity and o' temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, an ! where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dis honest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upou them, but upon the innocent whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs, and naturally when It does oc cur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ulti mate causes of the suffering and, as a means to this end, where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental poli cies. but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinch ing perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty. Interstate Commerce. Xo small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self reli ance, of independence in initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its fullest exercise compatible with seeing that liberty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national government should have complete and sole control of interstate commerce There was thou practically no interstate business The River Press. save sucn as was conciucteu uy water, and this the national government at once proceeded to regulate In thorough going and effective fashion. Conditions have now so wholly changed that the Interstate commerce by water Is Insig nificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate commerce. As a result it can be but partially and imperfectly con trolled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states, such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax and in either case ineffective for purposes of justice, Only the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for sucli authority already exists under the constitution in amplest and most far reaching form, but it does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. This is not advocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face and realizing that centralization in business has already come and cannot be avoid ed or undone and that the public a largo can only protect itself from cer tain evil effects of this business cen tralization by providing better methods for the exercise of control through the authority already centralized in the national government by the constitu tion itself. There must bo no halt in the healthy constructive course of ac tion which this nation has elected to pursue and has steadily pursued dur ing the last six years, as shown both in the legislation of the congress and the administration of the law by the department of justice. National License For Railroads. The most vital need is in connection with the railroads. As to these, in my judgment, there should now be either a national incorporation act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in Interstate commerce upou certain conditions. The law should be 60 framed as to give to the interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should be provided to enable the commission whenever in its judgment it is necessary to make a physical valuation of any railroad. As I stated in my message to the congress a year ago, railroads should bo given power to enter into agreements sub ject to these agreements being made public in minute detail and to the con sent of the Interstate commerce com mission being first obtained. Until the national government assumes prop er control of interstate commerce in the exercise of the authority It already possesses It will be Impossible eithel to give to or to get from the railroads full justice. The railroads and all oth er great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must come. The only question is as to what gov emmental body can most wisely exer cise it. The courts will determine the Continue«! 011 Pi Ei_ Fort Benton, Montana, Wednesday, December 4, 1907. 

MONEY SUPPLY INCREASED. Many Applications For New Certifi cates Issued By Government. Washington, Nov . 27.— Owing to the large amount of subscriptions re ceived, the secretary of the treasury late today announced that the sub scription to the three per cent certifi cates of indebtedness of the act of June 13, 1908, invited by the circular of Nov. 18, 1907, is closed, and that no subscriptions received after the close of business November 27 will be con sidered. The decided improvement in business circles makes It possible that the secretary will not make many more allotments. The sum of 820,000,000 for six months would draw interest to the amount of 9375,000, and an additional amount of $20,000,000 for one year would draw 1750,000, making a total of $1,125,000. This would be at the rate of less than one cent and a half per capita for the people of the coun try, and it argued that this would be a cheap means of escape from diffi culty even for the humblest citizen, whose labor might be affected by the continuance of the crisis. It is pos sible that some of the certificates could be called for payment within even a shorter period of six months. Wheel Tax In Illinois. C hicago , Nov. 28.—Eigthy thous and vehicles in Chicago will become liable to pay wheel tax just as soon as Governor Deneen signs the wheel tax law. which was passed yesterday by the general assembly at Spring field. The governor has indicated that he will sign the bill. The tax will amouut to $300,000 a year. All of tlie money thus raised is required to be expended on the re pairs of the streets. The tax concerns every vehicle on wheels that uses the city streets. Automobiles, wagons, drays, trucks, buggies, bicycles and all of the wheel family with the ex ception of baby carriages will come in for a share of the payment. The tax is graduated according to the class of vehicle. Automobiles pay the largest tax, and the other vehicles will trail along in the assessment ac cording to their value and kind. California Wants Roosevelt. S acramento , Nov. 27.—The as sembly passed a resolution today lauding President Roosevelt and requesting him to become a candidate for re-election. Asembly man Smith offered the resolution and applause followed its adoption. The resolutton follows: "Whereas, This nation has enjoyed an unprecedented era of prosperity, and whereas, we believe the confidence reposed in our worthy president has in a large measure been responsible for this prosperity: and whereas, we believe the announcement by Presi dent Roosevelt that he was a can didate for re election would be the means of bringing order out of the pre sent unsettled conditions: be it, there for. "Resolved, That the 37th session of the assembly of the California legisla ture, assembled in extraordinary session, request President Roosevelt to reconsider his decision and become a candidate for re-election, and that a copy of these resolutions be forward ed to the president." Country Needs Rest Cure. N ew Y ork , Nov. 28.— "What this country needs above everything else is the rest cure," said James J. Hill, who arrived in town yesterday, in discussing the financial situation. "We all want to go to sleep for a good long time and wake up with both eyes open. The country has been suf fering from mistrust. While there is an easing in the mercantile situation, the people who have money are hold ing onto it and giving checks instead. "Nobody wants to let the money go. The merchants hale such a situation. It has put us on a paper basis, such as we were on just after the civil war. We need a rest cure to remedy such conditions." Weston Completes Long Walk. Chicago, Nov. 28.—Edward P. Wes ton ended his tramp of 1,234 miles from Portland, Me., at the federal building here at 12:15 p. m. today, lie left Portland October 29 at f> p. m., thus making the time, exclusive of Sundays, 24 days, 19 hours and 1"> minutes. Weston did not walk on Sundays. He broke his record of 40 years ago by one day ■! hours 2•"< minutes. Mr. Weston crossed the state line into Cnicago at 1 :">0 o'clock this morn ing. Three thousands people were at the border of South Chicago to greet him. Captain Charles Dorman, of the South Chicago police station, commanding 25 policemen, kept the crowd from interfering. The big crowd was joyful. "Marching Through Georgia" was sung through* oat the in South Chicago. The old man plodded on, seemingly unmindful of the attetion he was receiving, or, more properly, scornful of it, as put* ting further difficulties and distrae* tions in the way of an already difficult task. Helena Boy In Trouble. Helena, Nov. 27. —It developed to day that Harry G. Kleinschmidt under arrest in San Francisco on the charge of having killed a friend named Bel lows, a successful rival for the love of a Miss Kerfoot, is a Helena boy. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Kleinschmidt and his mother and father are in Helena, having returned from California several months ago. The young man was born in Helena, attended school here and with the family went to Berkeley several years ago to attend the university. During his residence here he bore a good reputation. Tie was known to have a quick temper, but notwithstand ing that was popular with a large circle of friends. B erkeley , Cal., Nov. 27. —If Harry Kleinschmidt, the wealthy young student of the state university and oldest son in the Kleinschmidt frmily of Claremont, murdered his friend and rival in love, Frank Bellows, he is one of the coolest and most matter -of fact young murderers with whom the lucal police have ever had to deal Every possible device and trick of the "third degree" and the "sweat box system" has been brought to bear on the young man to trap him into some inconsistent or contradictory statement, but so far the cleverest work of the officers has not weakened the youug student. Directors Liable For Debt. j S t. P aul, N ov . 29 —The directors j of the New Year Gold Mines company I of Montana, are liable fur the indebt edness of the company tu the Hank of I Fergus county because they failed to 1 file in /ne office of the cltik of Fergus county a statement t f the company's 'capital stock, the proportion thereof - paid in and the amouut of its exisv': g ind btedness, as required by a Mon tana statute. This is the decision of the l uited States circuit court of ap peals in the case of the Bank of Fer gus county against George M. Nelson et al. The opinion, which is written by Judge Adams, affirms the judgment of the circuit court for the district of Minnesota. The New Year Gold Mines company is a West Virginia corporation, hav ing its principal place of business in Fergus county, Mont. < >a Dec. 31, 1903, the mining company was in debted to the bank to the amount of $12,000. The company failed to file within 20 days from December 31, the statement referred to, and this action was brought against the directors to enforce liability for the debts of the company created by such failure. Circulate Burlesque Currency. 

CHICAGO, Nov. 29.— On recommen dation of the Clearing House associa tion, Mayor Busse will take steps to day to suppress a vicious! form of burlesque currency that is being cir culated in imitation of clearing house cheeks. A number of frauds have been perpetrated with the spurious checks and it is the intention of the officials not only to put a stop»to their circulation, but to prosecutejlpersons who have used them fori swindling purposes. The heading of three of the checks collected at random are: /'National Cleaning House Association," "Bank ers' Dream Association," "American Lemon House Association." One style is printed in blue colors closely resembling the true certificates with the square box at thejleft contain ing such phrases as: "Free pass, good at any depot to I watch the trains pull out. " "In God we trnst: in banks we bust." "This check is good for $1,000 in your imagination." He Missed a Fortune. P uescott , Ariz., Nov. 20. —Captain J. W. Boyd, locator of the Verde Copper mine, owned by ex-Senator Clark, died here yesterday, aged 8ü year-. Although at one time owner | of the second richest mine in the l'n.' d States, Boyd died penniless, a [charge on the county. The mine, -iuce Boyd sold it, has paid over ! 000,000 in dividends. Boyd sold it for a trilling amount. PROGRESS ON MILWAUKEE. New Railroad Will Soon Be Ready For Montana Business. Aberdeen , S. D. Nov. 29.—A train schedule between Aberdeen and Miles City, Mont., will be put into force on the Milwaukee's coast extension with in the next ten days. Construction work is completed to that point, and the railroad expects to have trains running as far as Butte next spring. The exceptional weather has helped the contractors in pushing the con struction work rapidly. It is the plan of the road to make Aberdeen the principal division for the present. Trains will be made up here for Miles City, Montana, and intermediate points, to connect with the Twin City trains. While no estimate can be made as to the day when the road will be open for traffic from Chicago to the coast, it is believed that the entire new road with a mileage of approximately 2,000 miles will be open for passenger and freight traffic within the next eighteen months. Were it not for the approach of winter it would be possible to com plete the road from its South Dakota terminus to Butte, it is said, within the next three months. That part of the work has been in course of con struction for about one year. Burbank's Thornless Cactus. Washington, N ov . 29.— The Unit ed States National museum has placed on exhibition a specimen "leaf', of a thornless cactus developed by Luther Burbank in California. The perfect ing of a cactus without thorns means the providing of a valuable forage plant which will grow as well in arid as in moist regions. The flattened stemjof this novel growth, often errone ously ''aliud a "leaf." is in some of the b s'. specimens nearly three feet long, a foot wide ;md three inches thick and its --iirface is very similar to that of a watermelon. Will Protect Gold Shipments. S eattle X uv . 3). -Nearly $90,000 worth of gold was stolen from the mail sacks un .te- b.iats plying ou the Yukon river I hm summer and many devices have deen planned to safe _uard the gold wiiiie it i- being trans port d from one town to another. The latest plan is a cage four feet square it.d eight feet high, placed in the middle of the main passenger deck. The side.-- of the cage in which the gold is kept are made of heavy crimp wire netting, such as is used in mak ing partitions in banks and other places where ir.ouey is handled. It is believed that by placing the gold in plain view of the passengers that no person would be bold enough to ply his trade before admiring aud iences and that he will leave the trea sure alone. The enge is fastened firmly to the lloor of the deck and kept under heavy lock. Will Resume Cash Payments. W ashington, I tec. 1.—The clos of the past week found a confident feeling prevailing in banking circles and at the treasury that the liuaueiti situation of the country would soon resume its normal state. The inter vention of the government two weeks ago, by which it was proposed to issue $100,000,000 in new securities, accom plished the purpose anticipai il by the aimiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiniiiiiHmiinimiiiiimmimiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiLiiniiiiiiHitims d"?priges CREAM BAKING POWDER A Pure, Wholesome, Reliable =/ Cream of Tartar Baking Powder V= a The cream of tartar used in Dr. Price's Baking Powder ■ Ê is derived from grapes in the exact form and composi ——■ tion in which it occurs in that luscious, healthful fruit Improves the Flavor and Adds =\ To the Healthlulness of the Food Its Use et Protection and a. Guarantee Against Alum Food president of the United States and Secretary Cortelyou in demonstrating the ability of the treasury to relieve disturbed conditions. This result having been accomplished, the actual issues of new securities will be only about half of what was proposed. In this respect the present admiaia* tration departed from the policy of that in 1893, when measures of relief were usually adopted only when they became Imperative. It is felt at the treasury that the wisdom of the new policy has been vindicated—that it was better to take resolute and broad measures, even if they went beyond the immediate need of the situation. The issue of the Panama bonds will be for the 950,000,000 which was offered but the issue of one-year certificates will not much exceed 925 ,000,000. 

CANNON ^'S PEAKER. Affairs of Sixtieth Congress Will Be Directed By Illinois Statesman. Washington, Nov. 30.— Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois, was nominated tonight by the republican members of the house of representatives for his third term as speaker, and he will be re-elected to that office on the conven ing of the house at 12 o'clock Monday. The nomination was made in a caucus held in the house of representatives, which was attended by practically all of the 220 republican members. Id his reply, accepting the nomina tion, Speaker Cannon dealt with a number of public questions. He jus* tified the large appropriations of the last session of the Fifty-ninth congress and indicated very plainly his opposi tion to any policy looking toward a too great centralization of the func ! tions of government. Never at the beginning of congress have the congressional leaders of both parties found themselves more at sea concerning legislation than they are on the eve of the convening of the present assemblyjof the national leg islature, which will take place Mon day at noon. Very little except the financial situa tion is engaging the attention of any member of either house, and all the members of both houses, whether lead ers or followers, confess their inabili ty w> forecast what may be done on tha" subject. All of them lament the prt scut situation, but all of them do not believe that the remedy for it is to be found in legislation. Those who believe that such a remedy will prove effective are in the majority, but their opinions vary so widely that all ad mit the great difficulty of getting to gether. Reign of Terror In Los Angeles. l.i s A ngeles , Dec. 1.—Two mur der- ami half a dozen robberies and burglaries within a few hours last night w a- the record established by crooks who have terrified residents of Los Angeles and battled the police for over a month past. The death of Policeman Patrick H. Lyons, who was shot last night while attempting to arrest two masked hold up men, preceded by only a few hours the passing away of S. Gomez, a Mexi can laborer, who was stabbed by an other footpad in the eastern section of the city at early hour ihis morning. An attempt at a jail delivery, the sec ond within a week, was frustrated at midnight by the officials in charge of the overcrowded city prison. No. 7
