SccncTAiir Faircuilo, liko President Cleveland, says tbe authority under which he paid a premium for bonds was a doubtful one. It was not. Ho bad no authority, but merely usurped It. lie did have authority tii)mj, but refused to cxeiclso It, preferring lotlolatelaw that ha might put Si,si,(i,i in tbe bunds of bis bsndboUIng friends lu Wall ttreet.

A freo and full ex change of thought was had, and tbo old courageous spirit ot tbo Republican party tbo spirit which led on from victory to lctory was ncier raoro fully displayed. Tbo committee, tbo Republican members of Congress, and tbo Republican visitors, nil met at tbo reception given by tho Republican National League, and wero royally entertained. Tbo grandest part of the entertainment was tbo old-fashioned Jit-publlcan love east the hearty spirit which over (lowed from every one present, a nil which presages a Hood of Republican enthusiasm that wltl sweep tho Democracy out of power as easily and rapidly as the torrent of tho overflowing: Mlslsslpil sweeps away a potty obstruction, lhcre Is vlctoiy In the air. Tlio Deception of tlio Republican Na tional League, At the grand reception given last nigh by tbo Republican National I.eagtto I fcoror of the National Republican Commit tee, thcro was assembled tho largest gath ultg ot notabtu men ot tho Republic in faith ever collected, except perhaps at a national convention.

When Paul endeavored to teach tho Gas pel ot Christ to tho Idolatrous Epbcstins, the men whose business It was to provide for tbo gods and goddesses ot the Ephcsl in mjtbology raised a mob In tho streets of Epbcsusand shouted, "Ore it Is Dlani of Iho Epheslans." Democratic heelers and bummers shouting "Reform and Retrench ment" to secure possession ot the treasury vaults, aud then Increasing tho expenditures by millions, remind us ot that Ephcslan mob. Against Itrpenlinc the Tobacco Tax. Secretary Falrchlld In his report, pago 15, dltcueslng tbo reduction ot tbe revenue, sojs : "ln( it is not tult cither to aliolish or icduu mternul lacnue taxation." Wilt tbe Democratic members ot Congress from the tobacco-gronlng states pleasa tako iGtlce' Mr. Carlisle, tbo Demscratic Speaker ot the' House, whom tbey helped to elect, rays bo will agreo to abolish tbo tax on tobacco providing a corresponding reduction Is mado in customs duties PreilJent Cleveland said In bis message, speaking ot Internal revenue taxation : Tbero appears to bo no Just complaint ol this taxation by tho consumers of thoso arti cle?, and there teems to bo nothing 83 wcllablo to bear tho burden without hardship to any portion of iho people. And now tho Secretary of tho Troasury ties spoken out. W bit do tbo Virginia anJ North Carolina and Tcunccsco and other tobacco growing Democrat!: fsrmcrs upon w t did the burdees and vexations of this wr Uxailon fall say to tbo utterances ot tltlr those n leaders?

Ile-leiuo Is made up. What do tbe poo pie of tbo tobacco states aj f A Conundrum Answering Itself. Tbu President pretcuds that his whole ob ject Is to reduce taxation and to keep down tbo surplus. Ho assails tbo wool growing Industry, but falls to say a word In favor ot strlklrgdown the burdensome sugar duty, which yields several times moro revenue than Iho wool duties. It bo wants to ro duco the revenue, why this apparent In consistency? The wool-growing dlstrlcta aro crowing stronger lo Republicanism; tho sugar growing dlstrlcta aro required to maintain a solid south. Ibis Is tho application of a business prin ciple to politics. Will It pay ? 

CONDITION OP THK SAV1T Aa Shown by the Iteport of Seoretnry Whitney. Secretary Wbltney starts his report with tbo statement tbat "It Is with much satis faction that tbo department Is able to report upon tho occurrences of tho past year, Many difficulties havo stood In tbe way of tho creation ot a crcdltsblo now navy.

Now all toree manufsctotles aro In process ot construction under contracts with tho department.

Ibo Improvements In armor aod lo tbc range and power of guns may bo said to havo kept pace each with the other. Hut as ( tbo weak point of an Ironclad Is In Its un protected bottom. Invention bos bien directed to torpedoes and torpodo bJati, and theso havo bcon al cost amiotawllh European powers dnrlog tbo last five years. Meanwhile tbo development of the ma chloe gun and tbo Introduction of steel net tings as a protection against tho approach ot tbo torpedo host or the torpedo h ive limited so greatly tbe rango ot usefulness of tbo torpedo boat as to ba o caused a con siderable distrust ot Its availability as a weapon. Tho principal difficulty Is tbit Its range ot torpedo fire Is so short tbat it Is obliged to approach within a fow hundred feet ot tho object of attack, which subjects It to destruction by machine guns. Tho pneumatic dynamlto gun attacks the problem by a new method. Tbe company has demonstrated tbat by tho use of pneu matic power projectiles containing large quantities of nigh explosives can be fired with safety and considerable accu acy a distance of between one and two miles. Whatever destruction a torpedo can do this projectile can do If accurately placed Agaloet Its method of attack neither net nor machlre guns aro of anv conslderabli use. It can bo llred at such a dlstanco as to bo beyond the effectlvo rango of ma cblno guns at d the line nt flight of Its pro jcctllc escapes nets Tbero ore questbn" yet to be settled before Its efficiency for naval purpoeescan be fully determined This Invention, lll.o every other, his Its own peculiar problems to solve, but thp zeal and Intelligence thus far given to thi development promise ultlmato eucccss. Ou tuo question of tbe naval reserve the report earn: "1 he policy of this country ha. always teen opposed to tbe cstabllsbmsm of largo permanont naval and military or gatlzatlons.

"Committees of tbe chambers of commerce of New York and Ban Francisco havo passed resolutions urging tbo organization of sucb a forco as a means ot providing for tbe cosst defence and meeting tbe Increased do msnds of tbe regular naval establishment for men and vessels upon tho outbreak of war.
