Republican Leader of the Mouse Pre­ pares a Measure Fixing Tariff for Philippines. —______ Applies Dingley Law Imports to this Country and the Commission's Schedule on Exports. McLaurin-Tillman Dispute is Disciissed by the Members of the Senate at Session. Washlnigton, Dec. 10.—Chairman Payne of the ways amd means commit­ tee has presented to his Republican colleagues of the committee a reVenne tariff bill for the Philippines, Which he had drawn to meet the conditions of the recent supreme court decision. The Republican members of the com­ mittee met ait 10:30 o'clock to continue the discussion of the general subject. Flie meeting was executive and was preliminary to a meeting of the full committee when the Philippine tariff will be submitted to the Democratic members and be voted upon. The "Payne bill is quite brief, with two main features, viz.: Applying the Dingley law as against Philippine ex­ ports to this country and applying the Philippines commission's tariff sched­ ule to goods entering the Philippine^. A further section grants a rebate of customs tariffs on goods which have paid an internal revenue tax in this country. There is no proviso in the measure that it shall be temporary, so that the rates, if imposed, would be applicable until congress otherwise acted. During the debate it developed that Mr. Russell (Conn.) and some other Republican member® strongly favored the proviso to the biill offered by Mr. Payne by which the tariff rates would be scaled down from 15 to 20 per cent on goods passing between the United States and the Philippines. This was urged on the ground that Great Brit adn now 'had 40 per cent of the trade of the Philippines and Germany and other European countries held a con­ siderable percentage, while the United States haxl only about 5 per cent of the trade. On. this account it was urged by Mr. Russell that the United States should have some concession as against foreign countries to gain a fair share of the trade of the Philippines for American goods. SOUTH CAROLINA ROW. McLaurih-TiUmar Dispute Comes Up in the Senate. Washington, Dee. 10.—After the usual preliminary business in the sen­ ate, which included the presentation of numerous petition®, memorial and joint resolution®, etc., Mr. Gallinger (N. H.) asked for the printing of the documents relating to ecclesiastical holdings in the Philippines. He said there wis a great demand for this doc­ ument. The printing was ordered. Mr. McLaurin (S. C.) made a speech in the senate during the day defining his position, in South Carolina and dis­ cussing the campaign in that state as well as his position regarding federal patronage in South Carolina and his relationship with it. He said the cam­ paign against him has been one of calumny, vituperation and misrepre­ sentation. As to the appointments in the state he sought to have Democrats appointed and where these could ftot be accomplished, he tried to have such Republicans selected as would give satisfaction to the people. He did not want the crime Q? burning a postmas­ ter repeated in his state. Mr. MfTjaurin said the movement against him in the Democratic party was one to keep alive sectionalism. Speaking of his views on the tariff he staid that Samuel J. Randall was a pre tectionist, Hancock said the tariff was a local issue and David B. Hill opposed the income tax, but none had been vead out of the Democratic party. Mr. Jones (Ark.) denied some of the craticpartjv 4 Senator Tillman Reples.

GIGANTIC SKELETONS FOUND. Hunters Discover a Wonderful Cave in Jefferson Canyon, Mon. Butte, Mon., Dec 10.—A new cave ,that gives promise of developing into the most wonderful of its kind in the known world, has been discovered in the mountains about 48 miles east of Butte, in Jefferson canyon. Its extent is as yet unknown, though it has been explored for a distance of 10 miles and to a depth of about 800 feet. The entrance to the cave, which is near the track of the Northern Pacific railway, and about 1,600 feet above the bed of the river, was discovered a few weeks ago by a hunter, and the cavern has just been explored by a party headed by J. W. Gilbert. Several skeletons were found in one of the many rooms, and many articles and utensils of stone and copper weTe lying about, some of which have been brought out. The skeletons are of people of gigan­ tic stature, and the belief of Mr. Gil­ bert is that the cave was the abode of a prehistoric people, and that further exploration will bring to light proof of that fact and more remains of its in­ habitants. A theory is that by a sudden change and disturbance of earth, the entrance to the ancient home was closed and the inhabitants walled up and left to die. A large river with a fail of 100 feet at one place is one of the wonder* of the caVe, and a score of apartments, eome hundreds of feet in extent, are decorated with the wondrous forma­ tions of nature. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. Andrew Carnegie to Donate $10,000,000 to the Cause. Chicago, Dec. 10.—A dispatch to The Record-Herald from Washington says: Andrew Carnegie is to give $10,000, 000 to the cause of university eiten sipn in the United States. Mr. Garner gie was here a few days ago and took luncheon with: President Roosevelt, when details of the plan were fully discussed. Mr. Carnegie has thought best tb create a national board to handle this magnificent benefaction. President Roosevelt will probably nominate such, a 'board, or at least set in motion the machinery which, shall lead to a na­ tional organization. Nicholas Murray Butleir, who has succeeded Setfh Dow at the head of Co­ lumbia college, -has been here_for two days, a gue&t of President Roosevelt a+ t)he White House, and he has aided in perfecting the plans. Mr. Birtler has long been one of the foremost cham­ pions of university extension and it is understood Mr. Carnegie has had fre­ quent consultations with him concern­ ing the enterprise. According to the plans prepared by Mr. Carnegift and his advisers the na­ tional organization is to ha/ve its head­ quarters in Washington, but its oper­ ations are to extend through the Unit­ ed States, the work to be carried on in co-operation with universities every­ where.

Additional Allowance Provided for the Promotion Building of [New Vessels in U. S. Washington, Dec. 10.—Senator Frye has introduced the new ship subsidy bill. It differs in form from the sub­ sidy bill of the past two sessions and is divided into four titles and fifteen sections. The sections under the title, "Ocean Mail Steamship®," are devoted to amendments to the ocean mail act of 1891. The postmaster general is re­ quired to consider the national de­ fense and the maritime interests of the United States as well as postal interests in providing for the transpor­ tation of American ocean mails. The present limit of ocean mail con tracts, 10 years, is increased to 15 years. The Frye bill provides seven distinct classes, with a rate of $6 to 20 knot steamers, increasing from 8,000 to 10,000 the minimum size $3 for 16 knot steamers, provided the size is in­ creased from 5,000 tons, the present minimum, toi8,000 tons. The proposed maximum mail rates per gross ton per 100 nautical miles are Over 10,000 tons, 20 knots, 2.7 cents 19 knots, 2.5 cents. Over 5,000 tons, 18 knots. 2.3 cents 17 knots, 2.1 ceuits 16 knots, 1.9 cents 15 knots, J..7 cents. Over 2,000 ton®, 14 knots, 1.5 cents- Rates for mail steamers to the West Indie®, Central America and Mexico cannot exceed 70 per cent of the max imum rates. The second title, "General Subsidy,' contains the general subsidy for all vessels, steam or sail, which are not under mail contracts. This general subsidy is uniform, 1 cent per gross ton per 100 nautical miles for not ex ceeding 16 entries in one year. To promote the building of new pcean vessels an additional allowance of one-fourth of a cent per gross ton is made for five years. Any vessel to receive the general subsidy must carry mails, if required, and must train in seamanship or en gineering one American youth for eachi 1,000 tons1, the vessel to be at the service of the government if required for defense. Any vessel to receive subsidy must be Class A1 and at least one-fourtih of the crew must be Americans. The bill provides an annual bounty of $2 a ton for deep sea fishing vessels and of $1 a month for American citi­ zens when engaged in deep sea fish­ eries that a vessel shall receive only one form of subsidy and that a vessel which has received subsidy shall not be sold to a foreigner except by con­ sent of the secretary of the treasury. The bill does not provide American registry for foreign ships owned by Americans. 

WHEAT GOING UPWARD. Way Option Touches 83 3-4, a New Crop Record. Chicago, Dec. 10.—Over confident shorts in the wheat market came to grief just before the"close. Many of the usual controlling conditions of the market were bearish and this had in­ duced many traders to sell freely. Prices in all grains broke jaggedly the opening and the early indications were that the anticipated slump was at. band. But the "wise ones" had counted without their host. Twenty minutes before the close wheat had been pressed down to 81% cents fcr May options. Then with a roar that could be heard well down into La Salle street buying which told of an oversold market began. Trade was heavy all day, ijut now it began again with the wildest scenes of disorder. Brokers rushed disheveled into the pit, buying, buying, buying and May wheat sold up to a new crop record price at 83% cents. The rise seemed to be genuine, for it held here well and, under the terrible profit-taking pressure that had been going on all day, May olosed very strong at 83%@ 83% cents. Corn was also' affected but not so materially. May had broke quickly1 at the opening and was down to 67% cents. Wheat strength, however, brought it up to 68% cents. MUST QUIT THE CLUBS.
