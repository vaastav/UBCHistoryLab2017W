What with Quay, Addicks and Tanner, it will be a most lovely place to keep out of. The other nations of Europe may I take the crude old fashioned way of borrowing money, but France does the trick simply by sending Berahart over. Cprtain Republicans are now de claring that the election has settled the ascendancy of the trust in Ameri can beisnees. Of course, we knew this before, but we didn't expect to brta.it admitted so readily. Nevertheless, the traiff rates are t mot to be reduced even on articles o1 'whose import has altogether ceased at -amd whose expot has largely increas- ct red, The only effect of the rates now ol is to enable ; the manufacturers to sr charge higher prices at home than j abroad. s Th.eship yards of the United States t1 rare crowded to their utmost capacity ,and are working overtime, and yet U ;they eannat supply the demand for C usew ships.

Just after war between the States a IST A newspaper was published in New of York City, entitled "'The Imperialist" tr which had for its motto "The Empire ENC is Peace," The people however were Hon not ready for the change, but the said, party of centralization has made ion progress since that time. The recent he] triumph of the Republican party is pay another step in the direction of mon- M -archy. As an indication of the Â®: tendency to abandon the government 0 - of our fatheres, we produced from sixt an Iowa newspaper the following: by "If anything was needed to de- Sar - monstrate the inability of our present the form of government to cope with the 'oo conditions which we have entered in- of i to, it is the disgraceful frauds of the 4 b k Cuban postal department. For a doi long time, thinking people, who have A large commercial interests, have felt of o unsafe, with our present form of mi d government from the fact that we are pu controlled by cheapjohn politicians pa; at and ward-heelers. Now is a good of erto do away with our old obsolete ow constitution and adopt a form of bl, government that will be logical with wl our new expansion ideas and will so a give anpple protection to capital. We re ir- should not be disgraced in the eyes pt es. of civilized nations by such a sightof as the violence and killing that ac- cl company the operation of street cars in St. Louis now, a constitutional fe ,nd monarchytis probably the most desir- m ie able plan we could now adopt. Every- 5 thing is ripe for the change. We Ib lay have a large standing army and it can n, of be increased under almost any pretext ei without causing any alarm to the p masses. This country has been so G prosperous that the voters have lost if the spirit of patriotism and honesty de. that are necessary to the successful tled operation of republics. The strong eri- iron hand of discipline will have to be ew used to bring the masses to a sense of to proper behavior. We take it that the great farming interests of the country will readily adapt themselves to a ari change. The farmer is a great lover els of law and order and under monu ised arachy these results will follow. Our 'ea constitution is largely the expression now of French revolutionary ideas; ideas to suggested by hot-headed theorists. than Jefferson and Paine found American soil suitable for the promulgation of Voltairism and Rousseauism. Now fates the church is strong enough to back the biblical teaching of kingship. It need take but a few years to convince yet our political rulers to make the change for Certainly it must have suggested itself a are to the minds of the statesman in save Washington."
