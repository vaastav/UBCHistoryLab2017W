[Fontanelle Observer.] Letters have recently been received from Miss Mae Frurote, who is one among the enlightening forces o* civili zation in the Philippines. She is sta tioned at Laoag Ilocos Notre, on the is land of Luzon, and began school work the first of October. Its location is not known but she writes that in the event of trouble it would take three days to get word to Manila. She writes: "One of these schools out here is enough to drive a teacher raving distracted. Ev ery child talks or studies at the top of its voice, and the native teachers rave and shout, and that is all there is of it. Some of the native teachers know a lit tle and some don't. My three are pretty good, comparatively. The man at the west side is very good, but he has 140 boys in a crowded room. Nothing but bamboo benches and a howling mob. They are the worst children 'on earth anyway. These people would shock an Indian village speechless. I have a class of large girls at the central school and they are not so bad. The western school, where I have ch'arge of two teachers, is a caution, lliey can speak neither English or Spanish and the teachers do not seem to know much more. The idea that the children seem to have is that they must repeat all the teacher says. I say 'what Is this?' and they say 'vot isii dls?' It Is killing. There is omo small blackboard out it that school and the poor little sinners sit up on high bamboo benches with their feet dangling off. The house is bamboo with woven bamboo partition, the most picturesque place Imaginable, but not particularly conducive to school work. The schools. like everything else under Spanish rule, were in the fifteenth cen tury. We are getting along quite well. I have Just been having a very animat ed conversation with my landlady, who speaks six words In Spanish'and I apeak twelve. She speaks Ilocano fluently. The boys offered me an after-dinner cigar (as all the ladies smoke here) and in declining I explained to them that only the women of the provinces of Missouri and Arkansas smoke In the States. The Island schools are very much In the embryo state as yet. Our schools are In session from 7 to 10 a. m., 3 to 5 p. m., and I teach aagln from 6 to 7 In night school. We have school every day except Thursday afternoon, but I think we will soon change that and have but five days in the week. I fear th'Ase people are not to be trusted yet. They have'too many Spanish no tions and have not the'slightest objec tions to fighting in a revolt Just for the fun of it. That Is speaking of the Taga logs. Ilocanos are much better and quieter. My two teachers In the central schools are the great-granddaughters of a padre. The great-grandmother was an Agcoila, one of the leading families fthe province. She had power enough with the padre to oppress the people so much that they arose and killed her and cut off her legs and arms and nailed them to the church door, starting the first Ilocano revolt.
