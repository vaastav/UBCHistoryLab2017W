President Roosevelt has pointed out to congress what lie conceives to be its plain duty toward Cuba. The reciprocity battle Is likely to be fought to a finish when the Cuban tariff question comes up before con- ress" Senator Burton's turn came at last. H has been given the opportunity to place bis feet under the president's table. It was hardly necessary for Admiral Dewey to deny that Schley had been found guilty on five counts. Nobody beUvved it. Already a large amount of building Is projected for the coming year in To peka. The city's growth promises to excel anything seen here since the boom period. The Isthmian canal commission after pointing the many advantages which the Panama route possesses over the Nicaragua route recommends the latter lor adoption by congress. When President Roosevelt told the visiting Utes what good fighters their brothers were in Cuba he may have been trying to square himself for sug gesting that the Indian go to work.

Real estate men report a lively busi ness in acre property away out beyond Washburn college, in. the vicinity of the new road improvement. Good roads make good prices for real estate. Acres are selling at from $150 to $350 each. A Chicago detective has been accused of being a safe blower. By and by it will be asked, "What is the matter with Chicago?" Then some editor can reply and become famous. Cleveland Leader. Not every editor Is a William Allen .White. The Panama canal people are at the mercy of the United States and must sell out for whatever we are willing to pay or lose what they have expended. If Uncle Sam begins to dig in Nica ragua, not another cent can be obtained for the French enterprise. The French man know this hence their anxiety to ell. A 

BURDEN OF PUBLIC LIFE. Mr. Hearst's young men have finally been discharged from custody and re leased from the charge of contempt of court of which they were adjudged guilty by Judge Hanecy. In granting the writ of habeas corpus and discharging the members of the Chicago American edi torial staff from custody Judge Dunne who was appealed to in the case said that the case hinged on whether the case on which the Chicago American commented had been disposed of by Judge Hanecy or was still pending. Judge Dunne held that the case in Question had been finally disposed of by Judge Hanecy when he gave his de cision from the bench. The fact that the clerk had not entered the order when the comment on the decision was printed and published, therefore does not snow that the case was still pend ing. The act of entering; the order on the record was merely a ministerial act. Judge Dunne said. Judge Dunne admitted that the ar ticles and cartoon which Judge Hanecy bjected to were clearly calculated to intimidate and coerce the court, had the court not already rendered its decision. Judge Dunne admitted that the cartoon In evidence was probably libelous and the articles possibly so. ' "Harsh criticism," Judge Dunne re marked, "is one of the incidents and burdens of public life. I see no reason," he said, "why a judge should be offered a different remedy for attacks in the public prints than a president, or a gov ernor, or a congressman. Criticism of a public official, if just, will do good; if unjust, will do no harm." In concluding the court said: "I am clearly of the opinion that the language used in open court by Judge Hanecy amounted to a final order dis posing of the case under consideration and that being a final order, under the doctrine of 'contempt' as laid down in this state by our supreme court in Storey vs. The People, that the relators had a right to comment and criticise that decision even to the extent of libel ling the honored and respected judge who rendered that opinion without ex posing themselves to prosecution for contempt of court." 

STANDING TJP FOR KANSAS. Congressman Bowersock is standing up for Kansas in a most loyal manner as is evidenced by the following from the Washington Post: "Our commonwealth," said he, "is al ways viewed as reflected In an eccentric WAIT!

"A few weeks ago the financial editor of a New York paper wrote me to ask as to the 'devastation' in Kansas.grow ing out of loss of the corn crop. If we had had three months of simoon. 60 days of cyclone, followed by four weeks of floods, the papers would probably run in big type: "Kansas obliterated from the map.' "My reply was that there was no de vastation in Kansas. We have about one-third corn crop, plenty of rough feed, about 80,000,000 bushels of wheat, (crop of 1901), and more than $80,000,000 on deposit in Kansas banks, an increase of J20.C00.OO0 in five months. A larger acreage of wheat was sown this fall than ever before, and it never was as promising as now. "More we have a million and a half of people who have, during the past five years, paid off the larger part of their indebtedness, who are building and improving, who are hopeful and happy, who know Kansas and her pos sibilities, and who are no longer fright ened by a few weeks' drought which was more severe in neighboring states." GLOBE SIGHT& From the Atchison Globe. Christmas is a good deal like gam bling: only the dealers make a profit. To a woman, it seems easy for a man to make money. To a man. it seems easy for a woman to be amiable. Talk over a telephone as if It cost you so much per word, and you will get credit for having good sense. Some women just naturally boss their husbands, while others arrive at the same result by being clinging vines. Nearly every man thinks he has done a great deal for the town In which ha lives, if he has not actually made it famous. Speaking of total wrecks, ever notice a Thanksgiving dinner table after the guests have had their fill, and pushed back to talk? If a married man dislikes to write letters, he can get out of it so far as his wife Is concerned, by simply en closing a check. One of the rare sights is a woman who will carry her equal suffrage so far that she will not accept street car fare from a man. Don't treat a loafer as well as you treat an industrious man. Never lose an opportunity to discourage a loafer. Drive him to work. An Atchison woman Is willing to support her husband, and does it with out grumbling, but she refuses Xo pay debts he contracted before she mar ried him. A brakeman attended a show at the theater recently, and came out before the performance was half over. "That makes me as tired," he said, "as though I had walked from Omaha." Did you ever long for the constant presence of some one who would keep you from doing fool things? "Who would control you, without your know ing it, and keep you out of trouble? The women are making their own Raglans. As the secret of success is to make them so they will not fit, the women who den't know much about sewing, are making great hits with them. POINTED PARAGRAPHS. From the Chicago News. The less luck a man has the more he despises it. Some smiles look aa though they had been soaked In vinegar. The girl who Is never seen to blush may have been born to blush unseen. Marriage is the greatest lottery of life and lotteries are illegal. Slight no man because of his poverty and esteem no man because of his wealth. Sometimes a man Is judged by his appearance and sometimes by his dis appearance. Respectability may be contagious, but folk can't always catch it when they want it. A widow is always trying to make a man believe she thought he was going to kiss her. A girl likes to think she hurts all her male acquaintances when she an nounces her engagement. An old bachelor says there Is nothing at all remarkable about the fact that only the female mosquitoes annoy us. Bonnets are now made to match gowns, but. strange to say, no one thinks of trying to make them match purses. If a married woman knows which side of her biscuit the jam is on she will never repeat the fool things her hus band said during their courtship. REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR. From the New York Press Because death is quiet we all want excitement. A long story always seems shorter if you are telling it yourself. A woman with a bandage Around her knee acts as ashamed as if you knew it. Usually being bored Is being with E. & W. Collars and Cuffs. Stetson Hats. Silk Underwear. Health Underwear. E. & W. Shirts. Florsheim's Complete Line of Shoes for Men and people who are better than you like to have them. The man who is most likely to suc ceed is the man who puts up the best front when failure threatens him. It's the way things go in this world, but men don't get interested in women who get interested in politics. The people who grumble the most at this world kick the hardest when they get a chance to move on to the next. If a man put in the savings bank for her all the money he spent on theaters, suppers, flowers, candy and such things for a girl she wouldn't look at Aim. QUAKER REFLECTIONS. From the Philadelphia Record. A neglected baby is a crying shame. No. Maude dear; there is no similar ity between a tax assessor and a taxi dermist. Even a good book is talked about behind its back. Sillicus "I don't believe you have any aim in life." Cynicus "Oh, yes I have. My aim is to live near people who live in glass houses." "They tell me," remarked the man with the furrowed brow, "that you bar bers are very proficient in the study of physiognomy." "That's right," replied the barber; "we can generally size up a man by his mug." Some people wed, I have been told. Because of animosity; But more for love, a lot for gold, A few from curiosity. "The world refuses to accept me," said the poet, moodily. "Now to re venge myself upon the world. Aha! I have it! I shall write for poster ity." Which proves that the sins of the fathers may be t sited upon the child ren, even unto the third and fourth generations. To take things as they come, you'll find. May not require much skill; Yet if you don't, pray bear in mind. Some other fellow will. ""What brought you here?" asked the temperance advocate, who was visiting the prison. "I'm a wife-beater," replied Convict 41144 gruffly. "Another case of lick'er." murmured the jailer, who, despite his occupation, was a man of no little humor. If fools and children always tell the truth. There cannot be so many fools, for sooth 1 PRISON BINDING TWINE. Hardware Dealers Wonder If State Is Making a Profit. Wichita, Kan., Dec. 8. At Thursday's session of the Southwest Kansas and Oklahoma Implement and Hardware Dealers' association, a committee was appointed upon motion of D. W. Blaine, to investigate the records of the peni tentiary at Lansing, so as to ascertain the amount of revenue obtained from the sale of binder twine and whether this was manufactured at a loss or gain by the prison. Mr. Blaine stated the re ports of the present warden and those of his predecessor do not tally on this score. An effort will also be made to stop the manufacture of the article at the prison unless the officials will guar antee an amount equal to the consump tion of this commodity. The, officers elected for the ensuing year are: President, Charles Watson, of Pond Creek, Okla.; vice president, John Naumstark, of Hope, Kas.; direct ors, C. H. Smyth, Wichita; Sam Myten, Winfleld; F. M. Spangler, Mulhall. Okla.; D. W. Blaine, Pratt, Kas.; W. J. McLean. Medford, Okla.; W. H. Hub bard, Conway Springs; Henry Noble, Alva, Okla. The other officers will be appointed at the executive session of the board this afternoon, after which the convention will adjourn. 

CENTRAL BRANCH STORY. Rumor of That Denver Extension is Again in Circulation. "A Reliable Source" has again given out the information that the Central Branch of the Missouri Pacific railroad will be extended to Denver next year. This information comes, it is said, from a man who had a conversation with General Manager Russell Harding of the Missouri Pacific while in St. Louis a few days ago. Mr. Harding said that work on the extension would probably be started about March 1 and pushed to comple tion as rapidly as possible. The Central Branch railroad from Atchison to Lenora covers a distance of 293 miles. If the extension can be built straight through to Denver about 250 miles of new track will be necessary to complete the connection with the Rocky Mountain metropolis. Dr. Fish will lecture at the Second IT. P.church, Fillmore and Huntoon streets on Wednesday evening, Dec. 11. Sub ject, "What Made Boetou Great." Tick ets at the door. WAIT I LODGE NEWS.
