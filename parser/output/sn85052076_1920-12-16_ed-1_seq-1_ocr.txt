Berca Col lego in Joyful over tho frreat triumph of tho Fall Tcrrr Our student body has been trans-1 planted, as It were, from tho restless, unsettled and discontented world Into the clyslnn fluids of self-development and Inspiration. Never within tho knowledge of tho oldest of us has n slnglo term Riven to tho students , richer treats along nil lines of Bo-j rca'a school Ilfo than tlin term that has Just closed. The cducntlonnl, tho entertainment, tho nthletlc and tho religious programs have all been of a high quality. j Tho Fall Term was opened with a scries of moving picture entertain- mcnts. The pictures were both en tertaining and Instructive, They, wcro thoroiiRhly enjoyed by tho stu dents, who manifested their npprecla-' tlon by their courtesy and splendid conduct. Tho latter part of October' brought the inauguration of our new President. Few schools in America ran record in their histories n more ' notablo occasion than this inauguara tlon season. Twenty-five universities, colleges nnd Normal schools sent their representatives to participate. Entrance Speeches that will bo remembered for many years wcro made by prominent educators from both North and South Tho Bcrea Pageant, put on by our own Bcrea teachers m students, was an unusual production, portray ing In a vivid manner the historical development of tho mountain region Another great treat for tho student My was tho State Y. M. C. A. Con vention, which was of particular in tircst to tho boys, nnd which also provided n number of fine Inspira tional addresses Hint were equally in tcrcsting to the girls. Tho term closed with tho great oratorio of tho Messiah, rendered by tho Hnrmonla Society and four highly trained so loists from a distance. Besides these feature events, that wcro looked for ward to weeks in advance, there were scattered through tho term inspira tional addresses and sermons, such as thoso given by Mr. Sam Higgin bottom, tho agricultural expert of In dia. Tho story would not bo completo If mention wcro not made of tho ath letic and recreational work of tho Fall Term. Splendid teams in all tho flvo schools wcro developed in soccer and football. Students who had never bcforo played cither game developed sssssssejgjajsjos ''jjJlflpjBBIBBBjB BsWUMfflsBBjMWPflt skill nnd sportsmanship, to the nd miration of tho cntlro student body. Wholesome rivalry, tenm play, and every other nthletlc virtue wcro de voIojmm! to a mnrked degree. Our recreational work, both In mass play and In tho major sports, has made a long step In tho direction of perma nent intramural sports in Bcrca, Much credit for our success in this lino is due to Assistant Professor Ross, the new athletic director. The final evidence of Berea's tri umph this fall was tho physical con dition of our students as attested by tho hospital reports. Tho record for this fall shows that we had fewer peoplo In tho hospital than during the same period for the past four years. God has been Rracious in tha He has Riven us n full mcasuro of Joy, and a minimum of sorrow.

It Is obvious that the remedy can come only from outside. America saved 0,000,000 European children winter before last. Normal recuperation cut the need nearly In half last year, but unusual conditions have resulted In scant shrlnksge of child destitution during the twelvemonth Just put. The response of America must sow decide whether 8,000,000 of these charges.

There would be niFWiedy in history so sweeping e so destructive of those who can deserre no erlL The undersigned organizations, working among every race and creed, many engaged also In other forms of relief, agree unanimously that the plight of these helpless children should have complete priority In overseas charity until the situation Is met This Is an Issue without politics and without religious lines. There can he no danger of pauperization, for the $23,000,000 for child food, and the 110,000,000 for medical service that we seek, will relieve only the critical cases. The medical supplies, of course, mtiM be an unqualified gift, but for every American dollar used In child feeding, the corernments and communities aided furnish two dollars tn the form of transportation, rent, labor, clerical help, cash contributions and such food supplies as are locally obtainable. America has not failed In the past In great beartedness. She has never hnd a more poignant call than this. Contributions should be turned over to the local committees which are now being formed for this national collection, or sent to Franklin K. Lane, Treasurer, Guaranty Trust Co, New York City.

Because Country la Out of League of Nations Pacific Defense Cited as Leading Problem Increased Facil ities Required For Hawaii. l Western Newspaper Union News Service. Washington. Approval qf nnotlier three-yenr iinvnl building program, In volving tho construction of 88 vessel, If the United States doe not enter the liongue of Nations or a similar world , organization, Is given by Secretary DarrlclK In his annual report to Pres- ( Ident Wilson. "If the Uulled States Is ' not to enter Into any agreements with the Other Powers of the earth, which now nrc iHitind together In the Iengui I of Nations," .mya the naval Secretary. "I feel compelled to approve the rec ommendation of the general hoard that Contrrcss authorize another three year program to he begun as soon ns the capital ships under construction nrc launched." The three-year pro gram recommended by the General ' Board to be under way by 1024 In cludes the construtlon of three battle ships, one buttle cruiser, .10 light cruis ers, 8 gunboats, 18 destroyer lenders, VI nilue-lnyliig submarines, (1 cruiser submarines, 4 nlrplano carriers, fl de stroyer tenders nnd 3 submarine ten ders. "If the United States takes Its stand with other countries In an organiza tion to prevent war and promote 1 peace," .Mr. Daniels says, "our present navy, with the addition of some spe cial types, will be adequate for our de fense nnd prevention of aggression." No specific recommendations for ap propriations for new construction dur ing the next fiscal year are Included In the Secretary's report, but his esti mate of tile cost of maintaining the naval establishment for the coming year Is ?079,rl!5,731, exclusive of any sums Congress may add for new build ing. This Is ?2W,000,000 more than , was appropriated for the present fiscal I year, but Mr. Daniels says the sum "Is not really an Increase," but Is "neces sary to carry on the construction of ships ulrendy authorized and the com pletion of shoe establishments already begun by direction of Congress." j The most pressing problem confront ing the nation with regard, to. the, jia i tlonnl defense, tho Naval Secretary continues, Is the tmmedlnte necessity for Increasing the naval shore estab lishment facilities on the Pacific Coast. Agitators Profiteering In Morals, New York. "The Scriptures tell us to remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, but also command that 'thou shalt not bear false witness ngalnst thy neighbor.'" William A. Brady, presi dent of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, so declared In a stinging attack upon the advocates of the return of a "blue-lnw" Sunday , "self-appointed guardian nngels" and self-appointed "saviors of the nation," j he styled them. Mr. Brady was reply ing to nn nttacK on motion pictures, in which warning was given against "tho menace of the movie," which, it was added, was "In the hands of the devil and COO un-Chrlstlan persons." Expulsions Stir Church Members. Passaic, N. J. "A true follower of , God may stray from the straight and I narrow path but with God's help, ho can come buck, as Paul did." This was tho prelude to the expulsion from tho Netherlands Iteformed Church here of Mr. and Mrs. Martinis Ilaunen berg, parents of Miss Trlna Hanncn berg, who disappeared November 12, at the same time tho pastor of the church, Itov. Cornelius Densel, nlso disappeared, ltoth returned recently. Officials Seek Ford. New York. ltepresontatlves of the Federal District Attorney here have started a nation-wide wearcli for Henry Ford, Detroit automobile man ufacturer, who Is sought as u Govern ment witness In the trial of Dr. ICd ward A. Itumely, churged with having concealed the alleged German owner ship of the Now York Evening Mall during part of tho World Wtr. Ef forts to serve a subpoena on Mr. Ford became known when It was said a process tvrvcr hud been attempting to reach him fur u mouth. WorUNews Tho sessions of tho League of Na tions rIvo evidence that tho Rrcat nations of Europe hnvo brought Into this place of Rencral discussion some of their paramount interests. Eng land and Franco especially rivaled each other In seeking to commit tho LeaRue to policies that would lead to the ndvantnRc of ono or the other, and Franco seems to have succeeded best. The mediation of Armenia's cause was advocated by France, whilo Enplnnd desired a Joint expedition to hasten tho settlement because a res toration of order in Asia is to hqr interest. Franco is willing that the process bo longer in order to divert Enplnnd from her plans along the German border. General interest attached to the last message of President Wilson U Congress. It was not delivered In person but read in tho usual form. The message was a strong and final appeal to the United States to take nn Interest in the wel fare of the world. It asked for finan cial aid to Armenia if a mandate was not to be nccepted. Another recom mendation of Importance was the granting of independence to tho Phil ippines. A bill for this purpose has been before Congress but has not yet been passed. A favorable comnfent by Japan on this feature of the meas ure is not likely to help tho cause, especially before a Republican Congress. The South American state of Chile Is seeking to carry throuph an Impor tant electoral reform. The present method of electing a president is In direct and requires a period of five months to accomplish. The proposed plan would allow tho two houses of Parliament sitting together nnd In cluding a group of electors chosen for the purpose, to make the choices. There is some public opinion in favor of direct election by tho neonlo. This reform mcasuro is a good Indication that the South American republics aro ambitious to be un-to-date in their methods. Entrland is firm in malcinc It clenr to Ireland that- no cCjnccsslonSj, may be expected until tho present Methods of revolt are stopped. It is reported that an effort is being made to find out Just what terms might be made with the Sinn-Feiners. That Eng land is not favorable to any outside interferences is shown by her refusal to endorse passports to American travelers desiring to go to Ireland, even though they are issued by tha" American Secretary of State; This is her right by international law, ns our country has sometimes, done the same with English travelers bearing English passports on tho way to Can ada. It is reported that Germans In Hamburg are planning n great Ger man League to includo all Germans wherever they may be. This league will not seek to function along po litical lines, except among thoso who have not been naturalized in other countries. It will, however, seek to enlist their nid in furthering Ger many's commercial Interests. For a country outsido of tho League of Na Hons nnd with heavy burdens to bear for mnny years such a plan may aid In passing through the present emer gency. It is open, however, to seri ous objection on tho part of other countries. The great need for food and cloth ing in tho countries of eastern Eu rope, some of tho Central Powers, and China is awakening interest and sympathy as the Christmas season comes around. Especially sad is tho condition nmong tho children whrro millions are starving, and there is little prospect of change except as help comes from outside. The leader ship of Mr. Hoover in tho relief work is sufficient guarantee that the need is real and that tho help given will reach the oblect for which H t rlven.
