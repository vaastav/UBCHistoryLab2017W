At the request of the Slates of Costa Jlica and Nicaragua a competent engineer has boen authorised to make a survey ef the river San Juan and the port of San J uan. I tjis a source of much satisfaction.that the difficulties which, for a moment, excited some political apprehen sion, and caused a closing of the inter-oceanio transit route, have been amicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospeot that the route will, noon be re opened, with an in crease of capability and . adaption. We would not exaggerate either the commei cial or the political importance of that grtat improvement. It would he doing injustice to an important South Aniorican State not to acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the United States of Colombia have entered into intimate1 re lations with this Government. A olaiui con vention has been constituted to complete tho unfinished work of the one whioh closed its session in 1864.

In view of the insecurity of life in the region adjacent to the Canadian border, by recent assaults and depredations eommhted by inimieal and desperate persons who are harbored there, It has Jbeen thought tire-' p- r to give notioe that after the expira tion ofnix months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arramrpinnaith Great Britain, the United States must bold themselves at liberty to increase their naval at mament upon the Likes, if they shall God that proceeding necessary.

I desiro, bow ever, to be understood while making this statement, that the colonial authorities are net deemed to be intentionally unjust or un friendly toward the United States, but on the contrary, there is every reason to ex pect that with the approval of tho Imperial Government they will take the necessary, measures to prevent new incursions across the border. The sot passed at the last ses sion for the eneoursgement ot immigra tion has, ss fur ss wss possible, heen put into operation. It seems to need amend ment whioh will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, and so as to seeure them here a free choice of avocs tions snd plsces ef settlement. A liberal disposition towards this great national pol icy, is manifested by inset of the European States, snd ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrant effective na tional protrc ion. 1 regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to re pair the ravages of internal War and its wate of national strength sod. health. All that is necessary is lo secure the flow ot that stream in its present fullness, snd to that end the governmeat must iu every way make it manifest that it neitbor needs nor designs to impose involuntary military ser vice upon those whe come from other lands to oast their lot in our country.

For the actual receipts and diabursewents for the first quarter, snd the estimated receipts and dis buisctnents for the thice leiuaining quar ters of the current fiscal year and the gen oral operations of the Treasnry in detail, I refer you to the report of tha Seoretery of the Treasury. I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of the monies required to meet the exponies consequent upon the war, durived from taxation, should be still further increased, snd earnestly invite your attention to this sulject, to the snd that there may be such sdditional leg islation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of' the Secretary. The public debt on tbe tint day of July lsst, as appears by th books of the Treasury, amounted te one billion, seven hundred and forty thous and millions, six hundred and ninety thous and four bundled and eighty-nine dollars snd forty-nine osntsv ' Probably, should tho war continue tor another ear, that amount may be increased by not far from five hun dred millions. Hold as it is for the most part by our own people it hss beoome a substantial branch national though pri vate property. Forsonvloos reasons, ths more easily this property osn be distributed among all the people the better : to favor suoh general distribution greater induce ments to beoome owners uiiiiat perbsps with good effect, and without injury, be presen ted te persons . ot limited means. With this view, 1 suggsst whether it might not no notn expedient and competent for Con gress to provide thst a limited amount ol sums future issue of publio securities might be held by auy bona tide purchaser exemnt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under each restrictions and limitations aa might be neoettssry to guard against abuse ef so important a privilege, This would enable prudent persons to set snide a small annuity against a possible dsy of want, ii Privileges like these won Id render the possession ot suoh securities, te the amount limited, most desirable to every person of small msans who might be able to save enough for the purpoae. , The grest advan tage or oitiaena being creditors ss well as debtors with relation to the publio debt is obvious. - Men readily peroeive that they oannot be muoh oppressed by a debt which they owe te themselves.

It seems quite clear that the treasury cin not be so satisfactorily conducted unless the govoinmeiit can exercise s restraining pow er over th bank note circulation of tbe country. - The report of the Secretary of War snd the necoiupanying documents will dotail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several Adminis trative Bureaus of the Wsr Department daring the last yesr. It will slso specify uie measures deemed essential for tho na tional defence, and to keep up and supply the requisite military force. The report of tho Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that department, snd of the naval service. It is a subjeot of eongrstulstien snd Utidable pride to our countrymen, that a Navy of such vsrt pro portions has been organized ia so brief s period and conducted with so much effici eooyand success. The general exhibit of the navy, inoluding vessels under construc tion on tho 1st of December. 1804, shows s total of 671 veflsels,csrrying 4,610 guas snd 6IO,396tons, beingan actual increase during the year, over and above all losses bv ship wreck or in battle of d vessels, , 167 guns snd 42.427 tons. The totul cumber of men st this time in the nsval servije, inoluding offioers, is about 51,000. There have been captured by the navy, during tbe yesr, 324 vessels, and tbe whole number of naval captures sinee hos tilities commenced is one thousand three hundred, of which 267 are steamers. The gross proceeds arising from ths safe of con demned prize property thus far reported amount to $14,396,250 51. A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported. The total expenditures of the Navy' De partment of every description, including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the 4th of Mareh, 1861, to tbe lstol November, 1864, are $238,647,262 35. t Your favorable consideration is invited to the various rocoioendatioos of the Secretary ef the Navy, especially in regard to a navy yard and a suitable establishment for tbe eonstructioc and repair of iron vessels sod the machinery and armature of our ships to which reference was made in my last annu al message.

The views presented hy the Postmaster General on tho subject of special gi ants by tho Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships, and the policy ho recommends tor the develop ment ef increased commercial intercourse with adjacent snd neighboring countries. should receive the oarefcl consideration of longress.

' I cheetfully commend to your oontinuod patrnnnge the benevolent institutions of the District of Columbia, which have hitherto beeff established or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for information eon eerning them, and in relation to the Wash ington Aqueduct, ths Capitol and oiher matters of local iutsrest to the report of the Seeretsry.

The war has continued Since the last an nual message. All the important lines and positions then occupied by our foroei have bee a maintained and our armies have stesd ily advanced, thus liberating the negroes left in the roar, so thst Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts cf other States, have again produced remarkably fair crops. Tbe most remarkable feature ia ihe military operations of the yesr is General Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through tho insurgent region. It lends to show a greatjincresss of onr relative strength, that our Genera) in Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active foroe of the ennmy and yet to detach a weM appointed large army te move on suoh an expedition. The result not yet being known, conjec ture in regard te it is not here indulged. Important mevemeata have slso occurred during the year to the tffect of moulding society for durability in the Union. Al though short of complete suecass, it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana havo organized loyal State Governments with frpe Constitutions, and aro earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them. The movement in tho smue direction more extensive, though lets definite, in Missouri, Kentucky and Ten nessee, should not be overlooked. Rut Maryland presents tVe example of complete success. Maryland is seeure to libsrtv and Union for all time to come. Tho genius cf rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul t-pirit, being driven out, it msy seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more. . At the lsst cession of Congress, a proposed amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate, but failed for laok of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although the present is tbe samo Congress, snd nearly, the same members, without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in oppo sition, I venture to recommend the recon sideration and passage of the measureat the prosootstwin. Or'course the abstraot.qoes tion is not changed; but an intervening elec tion shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass tbe measure, if this does not, benoe there is only a question of time as to when the proposed smendutent will go to ths States tor their action, nod as it is te so go, at all events, may we not agree that the eooner the better. It is notolaitned that the election has imposed a duty on mem bers to change their "lews or their votes any further than as an additional element to be considered thoir Judgment maybe effected by it. It is the voioe of the people now for the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis like ours, unani itnity of action among those seeking a com mon end is very desirable, almost indispen sable, and yet no approach to such unani mity isjittaioable, unless some deference shall Kfj paid to tho will of the ninirrity, sin-ply because it is the will oft he majority. In this ease ths common end is th.) main tenance of the Union and amoncth means te seeure that end, suoh will, thrmivh the eleotion, is most clearly declared in favor of suoh eo'istirntienal amendment. The mest reliable indication of publio purpose n this country is delivered through, onr popular elec'inii.. Judging b the reoent eunvess and its result, the purpose of the people within the loyal states to maintain the in tegrity of the Union, was never mr-re firm, nor more nearly unanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness snd good order with whieh the millions of voters met,' and minglod at the polls, gave - strong ' as surance of this. ,. ..i , ,, .; Not only sll those who supported the Un ion ticket, so called, but a great majority of the opposing party slso may be fairly oiaimeu to entertain and to be 'actuated by the same purpose. It is ao unanswerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any oflioe, however high or low, has ven tured to seek votes oo the avowsl that he was for giving op the Union. There has beon muoh impugning cf motives, aodmucb heated eentreverey as to the proper means and hest 'mode of advancing the Union causet but on the distinct issue of Union or no Uoioiii the politicians have shown their iriit:?auve : kuowledgc that there is no diversity among the p6p'. - Jn affording to the peopie iLi fair opportunity of show ng one te another, and to tbe V7prid, (his nrmnesa, and unanimity . of. purpose, the election has been ot vast value to the Na tional cause. The eleotion has exhibited another fact not less valuable to he knewn, the foot that we do not approach exhaus tion in the most important branch of Na tional resources, thst of living men. While jt Is melancholy to reflsot that the war has filled so msny graves and earrfsd mourning to so many hearts, it fo some relief to know that com pared with the-surviving, thctatlen have been so few while oerpsand divisions, and brigades and regiments have formed aad fought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service. - The elec tion returns prove this. So manv votera could not else be found.

Te this Is to be added 33,762 east aew ia the aew 8 tales that did aot rote in 1860. thas SWelllnf the Store rata tn A nit 77A, and the net increase during the three years and a half of war, te 145.851.

To this again pooura dc added the number of acl- incneia rroat HMsaohascrts, Rhode Icw atcneyr1 Mlaware, .Iaeiana, i Illinois and California, who, by fhe laws of these Ststes, cannot vote away from their Morose, and whioh number can net. be lose than ninety thousand. .Nor yet is tbis all. Ths number in the organized territories is a trifle now, to what it was font years ago, while thousands white add black join as. ss the national arms pren back the insur gent linos. .... So much is shows affirmatively and nega tively by the election. It is trot material to inquire bow the increase hss beco produced, crio show tlst it would have been greater but for the war, which is probably true. ' l he important fact remains demonstrated; that we have more men now than we and when the war began; that we are not ex hausted, nor in the process of exhaustion, lhat we are gaining strength, snd may if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely. Ihis ss to. men, snd material resources are" now more oomplete and abundant than ever, ihe national resources thon are unexhsust-' cd, snd as we believe, Inexhaustible. Tha publio purpose to establish and maintain the national authority is unchangod, and, ss wo believe, unchangeable. Tbe manner of continuing the effort remains to ohoose. Oncaroful consideration of all the evidence accessible, it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader" could reeult in any good. . He weufd acocpt nothing short of sever-, snce of the Union, precisely whst we wilt not and oanrrot give. Ilia declarations to' this effect are explicit and ott-reueated he' . docs net attempt to dooeive us; he affords' us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He osn1-' not voluntarily re aceept the Union, we can-' not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue isdistinst, siugle and inflexible It is an issue which oan only be tried by, war, and deoided by victory. , If we- yield we are beaten. If tho Southern people fail' him, be is beaten. Either way,, h. Would be the viotory sod defeat following war. r-' What is true, however, of him who heads ' the insurgent cause, is hot necessarily true ' of those who follow. Although ha cannot -reaccept the Uuion, they can. Some of them We know already desire peaoe and re jlnion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace, simply by laying down their arms and submitting' to the National authority. Under the Con- ' strtution, after so much, the Governmeat ' could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would, not sustain or al low it. If questions should remain, we" would adjust them by the peaceful means ' of legislation, conferences, courts, and vc-' ters, operating only .in constitutional and4 lawful channels. Seme oertain and other possible questions ' are and would be bey6ad the executive pow er to adjust, ss, for instance, the admission' of members into Congress and wbateye miht require the appropriation of wBaey; The executive power itself would be great ly diminished by the cesnotion of actual war, Pardons and I emissions of forfeitures, how ever, would still be within the Executive control. In what! spirit and temper this control would be exercised, can be fairly judged of by tbe past. A year ago a gen eral pardon and amnesty, upon specific terms, were offered to all. except eertain de signated classes, and it was at thesame time published that tha excepted cases ware still within contemplation of special clemency. Dnring the year many availed themselves of the general prevision, and many more would, only that tho stigma of bad faith in some led te such precautionary measures ss rennerod the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and ne voluntary ap plication has been devised.- Thus prsoti- ' cally the doer has bceu for a full year open to all except bucIi ss were not in condition to make free choice, that is such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still open to all; but the time may come when publio duty ehall demand that it be closed, and that in lieu, more rigorous measures than heretofore be adopted. - - . I present the abandonment of armed re sistance to the national authority on. the part of the insurgents ss the only indispen sable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, and retract nothing heretofore said as to slavtry. - i repeat (be declaration uiude a year ago, that while I remain in my present position I shut) not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall I re turn to slavery any person who is free by the termeof that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress. . If the people hhouM. hy .whatever made, or means, mako it an Ex nnvive duty te re enclave suH persons, another and Hot T must be tli. ir ins i uimut to perform it. In stating a hi u tin condition ot peaoe, I mem simply to say that the war will ceas, on the part of in y Government whenever it shall have casad ou the part of those who
