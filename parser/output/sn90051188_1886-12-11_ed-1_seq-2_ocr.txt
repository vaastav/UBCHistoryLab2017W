He reviews the questions that arose in the Cutting case, and says we can not admit the Mexican power to deal with American citizens, for their acts while on United Stales soil, hut thinks it is to the interest of both governments to he on the most friend ly terms. He touches lightly the monopolies, not calling them by that name and then advises measures in 'the interest of the laboring man, he does not believe it right to chop the head of monopoly off at one blow, but little at a time, so they will gel use to it by the time the head is gone. He recommends the repeal of the pre-emption and timber culture acts and cites the loss to government of the public domain by the fraud prac ticed in obtaining lands under these acts. He thinks a zealous regard for the w ell-fare of the farmer is a prop er thing, and alter touching up the stock men for not taking down their fences in accordance with his order, he extends the olive branch by ad vising laws that will protect the live stock from diseases.
