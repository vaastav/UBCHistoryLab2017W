President Harrison's Annual Com munication to' Congress. The McKlnley Tariff Act Defended By the Executive. Time Needed to Develop Its Ad vantages and Benefits A Strong Endorsement of the Fed eral Elections Bill, The President Deeply in Earnest on This Point. The Work of the Departments Carefully Summarized. The Preiident's aiesgago. To tTie Senate and Rouse of Jiepresenta- tives: The reports of the several executive departments, which will be laid before the congress in the usual course will ex hibit in detail the operation of the gov ernment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents and results and chiefly such as may be the foundation of recommendations shall I submit in this annual message. The vast and increasing business of the government has been transacted by the several departments during tho year with faithfulness, energy and success. The rev enues amounting to above four hundred and fifty million dollars have been col lected and disbursed, without revealing 'bo far as I can ascertain a "single case of defalcation or embezzlement An earn est effort has been made to stimu late a sense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and employes of every grade and the work done bv them has almost wholly escaped unfavor able criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because the credit of this good work is not mine but is shared by the heads ofthe several departments with the great body of faithful officers and employes who serve under them. The closest scrutiny of congress is invited To aTl the methodB Of administration and to every item pf pxpendjturo, The friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of the east havo heen un disturbed while the ties of goedwiU and common interest that bln U8 t0 the states of the western hemisphere have teen notauly strengthened by the con ference hejd. ip this Capital to consider measures for the general welfare. Tho Pan American Congress. Pursuant to the invitation authorized fay congress, the representatives of every independent state of the American conti nent and of Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 18S9, and contin ued in session until the ISth of last April. This important convocation marks a most interesting and influential epoch in the history of the western hemisphere. It is' noteworthy that Brazil was invited, while under imperial form of government, and Bhared as a republic in the deliberations and results of the conference. Tho rec ommendations of this conference were all transmitted to congress at the last sessiou. The international marine con ference which sat at Washington last year reached a very gratifying result Tho regulations suggested have been brought to the attention of all govern ments represented, and their general adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of congress at the last session is in conformity with the propo sitions of the conference and the procla mation therein provided for will be is sued when tho other powers have given notice of their adhesion. Goneral Foreign Affairs. The conference of Brussels to devise means for suppressing the Blave trade in Africa afford ed an opportunity for a new expres sion of the interest the American peo ple feel in that great work. It boon be came evident that the measure proposed would tax the resources of the Congo basin beyond the revenues avail able under the general act of Berlin of 1884 The United States not being a party to that act, could not share in its revision, but by a separate act the independent state of the Congo was freed from the re striction upon a customs revenue. The demoralization and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest attention of the con ference and the delegates o"f the United States were foremost in advocating meas ures for its repression. An accord was reached, tho influence of which will be very helpful. As soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Nether lands for a time withheld, the general acts will be submitted for ratification by the senate; meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and complete treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation" be tween thi' United States and the indepen dent "state of Congo. THE 

LAST AMERICAN MONARCHY. Toward the end of the past year, the only independent monarchical go'vernment on the western continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist and was succeeded by a re public. Diplomatic relations were at once established with the new govern ment, but it was not completely recog nized until an opDcrtunity had been af forded to ascertain that it had popular approval and support "When the course of events had yielded assurance of this fact, no time was lost in extending the new government a full and cordial wel come into the family of American com monwealths. It is confidently believed that the good relations of the two coun tries will be preserved, and the future j will witness an, increased intimacy of in tercourse, and an expansion of their mu tual relations. The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a revolutionary change in Salva dor which was not recognized by other states and hostilities broko out between Salvador and Guatemala threatening to involve all Cen tral America in conflict and undo the progress wilcli i2ji bsso J toward a union of their interests. The I efforts of this government were promptly ana zealously exercised to compose their differences and through the active efforts of Unrepresentative of the United States a national treaty of peace was signed August 26, whereby the right of the re public of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. General Ezeta, the chief of the provisional government has oiuue ueen conurmeu in iue urcsi- dency by the assembly and diplomatic recognition duly followed. THE KILLING OF GEN. BARRCNDIA, on board the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala, de manded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt to invade Gua temala from Mexican territory, Gen. Bar rundia took passage at Acapulco for Panama. The consent of the representa tives of the United States was sought to effect his seizure, first at Champico. where the steamer touched, and after wards at San Jose. The captain of the steamer refused to give up his passenger without a written order from the United- States minister; the latter furnished the desired letter, stipulating as the condition of his action, that General Barrundia's life should be spared and that he should be tried only for offenses growing out of his insurrectionary movements. This let ter was produced to the captain of the Acapulco by the military commander at San Jose as his warrant to take the pas senger from the steamer. General Bar rundia resisted capture and was killed. It being evident that the minister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his authority in intervening in compliance with the demands of the Guatemalan authorities to authorize and effect, in vio lation of precedent, the seizure of a vessel of the United States of a passenger in transit, charged with political offenses. In order that he might be held for such offenses under what was described as martial law, I was constrain ed to disavow Ir, Mizner's act and recall him from his post OTHER FOREIGN AFFAIRS. The Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens is making most encouraging progress. All the prelum nary predictions and initial operations having been accomplished within the pre scribed time. During the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement of the claims of American citizens against the government of Chili, principally growing out of the late war with Peru. Reports from our minister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and satisfactory adjustment OUR RELATIONS WITH CUD? Ay which have for several years occupied 66 importanfa place in our diplomatic his tory, have called for careful considera tion and have been the subject of much correspondence. The communications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the whole subject of our conven tional relations with his country; and at the same time this government, through its legation at Pekin, has sought to ar range various matters and complaints touching the interests and protection of our citizens in China. In pursuance of the concurrent resolution of Octo ber 1, 1990. 1 have proposed to the govern ments of Mexico and Great Britain to con sider a conventional regulation of Chinese laborers across southern and northern frontiers. On the 22d day of August la6t, Sir Edmund Monson, the ar bitrator selected under the treaty of De cember 6th, 1888, rendered an award to the effect that no compensation was due from the Danish governrrent to the United States on account of what is com monly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim. OUR RELATIONS WTTn THE FRENCH republic continue to be cordial. Our representative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of the re strictions imposed upon our meat pro ducts and it is believed that substantial progress has been made towards a just settlement The Samoan treaty signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the United States, Germany and Great Britain, after due ratification and ex change has begun to produce salutary ef fects. Tho formation of the government agreed upon will soon replace the disor der of the past by a stable administration, alike just to the natives and equitable to the three powers, most interested in trade and intercourse with the Samoan islands. The chief justice has been chosen by the king of Sweden and Norway on the invitation of the three powers and will soon be in stalled. The land commission and the municipal council are in process of or ganization. A rational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation both municipal and upon imports is in operation, Malietoa is respected as king. GREAT BRITAIN. ' The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain after due ratification was proclaimed on the 2oth of last March. Its beneficial working is already appar ent The difference between the two governments touching the fur seal ques tion in the Behring sea is not yet adjusted as will be seen by the correspondence which will soon be laid before congress. The offer to submit the question to arbitration as pro posed by her majesty's government has not been accepted for the reason the form I of submission proposed is not thought to ' be calculated to assure a conclusion satis-' factor to either party. It is sincerely hoped that before the ' opening of another sealing season some ' arrangement may d eaecu u wmen win assure to the L nitea States a propertv rij"ht derived from Russia, which was not disregarded by any nation for more than eighty years preceding the outbreak of existing trouble. In the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii, which I am bound to presume was wholly uninten- ,tional. Duties were levied on certain commodities which wrre included in the reciprocity treaty now existing between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii- Without indicating the neces sary exception in favor of that kingdom I hope congress will repair what migh otherwise seem to be a breach of iaith on the part of this government An award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of Mr, Yan Bokkel against Hayti was rendered on the 4th of December, 1SSS, but owing to j discrds then and afterwards pre- vailing in Hayti the term of pay- ments were not observed. A new agree ment as to the time of payment has been approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the United States for redress of wrongs suffered during the late political contest in Hayti, it is hoped, will speedily yield a friendly treatment THE TREATY WITH ITALY. Propositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between the United States and Italy are now under considera tion. You will be acked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of the Italian government to take part in an approach ing conference to consider the adoption ofa universal prime meridian from which to reckon longitude and time. As this proposal follows in the track of the re form sought to be initiated by the merid ian conference of Washington held on the invitation of this government, the United States should manifest a friendly interest in the initial proposal. In this connection! may refer with ap proval to the suggestion of my predeces sors, that standing provisions be made for accepting, whenever deemed advisable, the frequent invitations of foreign gov ernments to share in conferences looking to the advancement of international re form In regard to science, sanitation com mercial laws and procedure and other matters affecting the intercourse and pro gress of modern communities. In the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatened to inter rupt the cordiality of our relations with the government ot Portugal. That government seized the Delagoa Bay railway, which was constructed un der a concession granted to an American artisan, and at the same time annulled the charter. The concessionary who had embarked his for ne in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, was compelled to invoke the protection of his government Our representations, made coincidentally with those of the British government, whose subjects were also largely interested, happily resulted in the recognition by Portugal of the propriety of submitting tho claim for in- arbitrator This plan of settlement having beeiS agreed upon, the interested powers read ily concurred in the proposal to submil the case to the judgment ol three eminent jurists, to be designated by the president of the Swiss republic; who, upon the joint invitation of the governments of the United States, Great Britain and Portugal, has selected .per sons well qualified for the task before them. Japanese treaty relations. The revision of our treaty relations with the empire of Japan has continued to be the subject of consideration and of correspondence. The questions involved ate both grave and delicate and while it will be niV duty to see that the interests of the United States are not by any changes exposed to undue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfy the legislative expectations of the Japanese government and maintain the present long existing friendly rela tions between Japan and the United States will be effected. 

MEXICO. The friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close neighborhood and strengthened by many considerations of intimate intercourse and reciprocity, have never been more conspicuous than now, nor more hopeful of increased ben efit to both nations. The intercourse of the two countries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. The established line3 and those recently projected add to the intimacy of traffic and open new channelsof access to fresh areas of demand and supply. The importance of the Mexican rail way Bystem will be further enhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a link in the projected inter-continental railway. I recommend that our mission in the City of Mexico be raised to the first class. SPAIN. The cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that by the continuance of methods of friendly nego tiation much may be accomplished in the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and of the increase of trade. The extent and development of our trade with the Island of Cuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with a peculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special ar rangement in regard to commerce based upon the reciprocity provision of the re cent tariff act would operate mo3t ben eficially for both govetnments. This sub ject is now receiving attention. JOHN ERICSSON. The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratifying occasion to honor the great inventor, to "whose genius our country owes so much and to bear witness to the unbroken friendship which has lasted between tho land which bore him and our own, which t claimed him as a citizen. I THE VENEZUELA CLAIMS. On the second of September last the commission appointed to revise the pro ceedings of the commission under the I claim convention between the United States and Venezuela of 1866 brought its labors to a close within the period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late commission were characterized by a spirit of impar- tiality and a high sense of justice and an incident which was for many years the subject of discussion between the two governments has been disposed of in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both parties. Por the settlement of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation com pany, which wa3 the subject of a joint . resolution adopted at the last session of congress, negotiations are still in pro- gress and their early conclusion is antici- , pated. The legislation of the past few years ' has evinced on the 'part of congress a growiuc realization of the ynportance wi u.v. wuuouku ociviuu ill luiieiiiiti viu . commercial relations abroad and in pro- tectin? the domestic mrnnnM. As the oiine consular service in fostering our . scope of operations expands increased provision must be made-to keep up the essential standard of efficiency. The necessitv of some adequate measure of j supervision and inspection ha3 been so j f 0ften presented, that I need only com- mend the Bubject to your attention. financial. The revenues of the government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 1,1890, were $463,963,080.55, and the total expenditures forhe same pe riod were 356,018,58452. Tne surplus for the year, including the amount applied to the "sinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts for 1S90 were $16,060,92&79, and the expenditures $i,-3tf,BU m excess of those of 1889 The custom receipts increased $5,835, 842.88, and the receipts for internal rev enue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of expenditures, that of pensions was $19, 312,075.96 in excess of the preceding year. The treasury statement for the current fiscal year partly actual ana "partly esti mated is as follows: Receipts from all sources $106,000,000; total expenditures $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, not taking the postal receipts into account on eithei side. The loss of revenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25, 000,000, but from this is deducted . gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the first four months of the year. i or the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000, and the estimat ed expenditures $337,So2,20D.42, leaving an estimated surplus of $15,147,690.5S: which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the beginning of the year will give $67,147,790.58 as the sum available for the redemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receipts for the post office department being equal, are not in cluded in this statement on either side. THE SILVER COINAGE ACT. The act "Directing the purchase of silver bullion and tho issue of treasury notes thereon," approved June 14, 1890, has been administered by the secretary of the treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulation at the earliest possible date the full monthly amounts of treasury notes contemplated by its provisions and at the same time to give to the market for silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recent depreciation ! in the price of silver has been observed wiui regrei. The rapid rise in price which anticipa ted and followed the passage of the actr was influenced in some degree specu lation and the recent reaction is in part the result of the same cauBe and in part of the recent monetary disturbances. Some months of further trial -w ill bo necessary to determine the permanent ef fect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but it is gratifying to know that the .increase secured by the act hasjjex erted and will continue to exert a more beneficial influence upon business and upon general values. BI-METALLISMt While it has not Been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of an in ternational conference looking to an agreement touching the full use of silver for coinage at a uniiorm ratio, care uaa been taken to observe closely any change in the situation abroad and no favorable opportunity will be lost to promote a re sult which'it confidently believed would confer very large benefits upon the com merce of the w orlu. The recent monetary disturbances in England are not likely to suggest a re examination of opinions upon this sub ject Our very large supply of gold will, u not depleted by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest of BUver, will give us a portion of advantage in promoting a permanent and safe international agree ment for the free use of silver as a coin metal. INCREASING CIRCTLATION. The efforts of the secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation by keeping down the treasury Burplus tc the lowest practicable limit have beer unremitting and in a very high degree successful. Tables presented by him showing the increase of money in circulation during the last two decades and especially the table showing the increase during the nineteen months he has administered the affairs of the department are inter esting and instructive. The increase of money in circulation during the nineteen months has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1 5C per capita, and of this increase only $7, 100,000 was due to the recent silver legis lation. h That this substantial and needed aid git en to commerce resulted in an enoo mous reduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge is matter of increased satisfaction. There has been purchased and re deemed since March 4, 18S9, 4 and 4J per cent bonds to the amount of $211, 852,450 at a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in the reduction of the annual interest charge of $3,967,609 and a total saving of interest of $51,576,706. I notice with great pleasure the stats ment of the secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year nearly $12,000, 000 and that the cost of collecting thi3 larger revenue was less by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. The percentage of cost of collecting tho customs revenue, was less for the last fiscal year than ever before. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION. The customs administration board pro vided for by the act of June 10, 1890, was selected with great care, and composed in part of men whose previous experience in the administration of the old customs regulations had made them familiar with the evils to be remedied, and in part of men whose legal and judicial acquire ments and experience seemed to fit them for the work of interpreting and applying the new statute. The chief aim of the law is to secure honest valuations of all dutiable mer chandise and to make these valu Sons uniform at all oorts of entry. it ha(i i)een manifest by a congres- si0nal investigation that a system of un- dervaluation has been long" in use by certain classes of importers, resulting not onjj m a great loss of revenue, but in a oniy iq a jrreuu 1U33U1 revenue, uuk uia m0t intolerable discrimination; It is not hnw the. legation can now be re- garfed by the citizens of any country i having commercial dealings with us as l unfriendly. If any duty 13 supposed to " be excessive let the complaint be- lodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well disposed people that a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of quasi-smuggling. The War Department. The report of the secretary of war shows several gratifying results attained during the year by wise and unostenta- tions methods. The percentage of deser tions from the army (for which both con gress and the department have been long seeking a remedy) has been reduced dur ing the past year 24 per cent and for the months of August and September, during which time the favorable effects of the act of June 16, were only 33 per cent as compared with the same months of 18S9. The- results attained by a reorganiza tion and consolidation of the divisions having charge of the hospital and ser vice records of the volunteer soldiers are very remarkable. This change was effected in July. 18S9, and at that time there were 40,654 cases awaiting atten tion, more than half of these being calls from the pension claims. On the 30th of June last, though over three hundred thousand new calls had come in. there was not a single case that had not-been examined and answered. , COAST DEFENSES. I concur in the recommendations of tho .secretary that adequate and regular ap propriations be continued for coast de fense works and ordnance. Plana have been practically agreed upon and there can be no good reason for delaying the execution of them, while the defenseless state of our great sea ports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition. The assistance that has been extended to the militia of the states generally'and most appropriately designated the "Na tional Guard," should be continued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a large sense, the army of the United States, while about five-sixths of the annual cost of their maintenance is defrayed by states. Department of Jostles. The report of the attorney-general is, under the law, submitted directly to congress, but as the department 6f jus tice is only one of the executive depart ments, referen.ee to the work done, is appropriate here. A igorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring to trial and punishment all violators of the law: but at the same time, care has been taken that frivolous and technical offences should not be used to Bwell the fees Of officers or to harass well-dis-posed citi zen. Special attention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution of vio lations of the election laws and of of fenses against United States officers. The number of convictions secured. very many of them upon pleas of guilty, win, it ia uopeu, nave a Eaiutary restrain ing influence. POSTMASTERS PERSECUTED. There have been several cases where postmasters appointed by me have been Bubjeoted to violent interference in the discharge of their duties and to persecu tions and personal violence of the most extreme character. Some of these cases have been dealt with through the department of justice and in some cases the postofflces have been abolished or suspended. I have directed the postmaster general to pursue this course in all cases where all other efforts fail to secure for any postmaster, not himself in fault, an oppor tunity peacefully to exercise the duties of his office. But such action will not supplant the efforts of the department of justice to bring the particular offenders to punish ment NATURALIZATION. The vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of naturalization upon bills of equity filed by the attorney feneral in the circuit court of the United tates is a new application of a familiar equity jurisdictlction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been taken during the year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number of fraudulent certificates of naturalization have been issued and in this connection I beg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so amended as to re quire a more full and searching inquiry into all the facts necessary to naturaliza tion before any certificate is granted. It certainly is not too much to require that an application for American- citizen shall be heard with as much care and recorded with as much formality as are given to cases involving the pettiest property right POOL SELLING. At the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled, "An act to to prohibit book-making and pool selling in the District of Columbia," and stated my objection to be that it did not pro hibit but in fact licensed what it-purported to prohibit An effort will be made under existing laws to suppress this eviL It is not certain that they will be found adequate. Postofflce Department. The report of the postmaster-general shows the most gratifying progress in the important work committed to his direc tion. The business methods have been greatly improved by large economy in expenditure and an increase of four and three-quarter millions in re ceipts have been realized. The de ficiency this year is $5,788,300 as against $6,350,183 last year, notwithstanding the great enlargement of the service. 3Iail routes have been extended and quickened and greater accuracy and dispatch in dis tribution and delivery have been at tained. The report will be found tobe full of interest and suggestion not only to con gress, but to those citizens who may be interested to know what business meth ods can do for that department of public administration which most nearly touches all our people. THE ANTT-LOTTEKYACT. The passage)! the act to amend cer tain sections of the revised .statutes re- is i. j r . t. &Unf J0,"?168' W?1 September lle90r has been received with great fHJopu1iar vor . ,. MmIf??fc?. department and the de partment of justice at once entered upon ine eniorcement of the law with sympa thetic vigor, and already the public mails have been largely freed from the fraudu lent and demoralizing appeal and liters- JFvlII. ture emanating from the lottery compan ies. The Naval Department. The construction and equipment of the new ships for the navy have made very satisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been put in commission, and during this winter four more, including one monitor,- will be added. The constructiop, of the other vessels authorized is being pushed, both in the government and private yards, with en ergy and watched with the most scrupu lous care. The experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resisting power of armor plates, have been so valuable as to attract great attention in Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships that is threatened by unusual delay is the armor .plating and every effort is being made to reduce that to the minimum. It is a source of congratulation that the anticipated influence of these modern ships upon the esprit de corps of the officers and seamen has been fully realized. Confidence and pride in the ship among tho crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Your favorable con sideration is invited to the recommenda tions of the secretary. Department of the Interior. The report of the secretary of the inte rior exhibits with great fullness and clearness the vast work -of that great de partment and the satisfactory results at tained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to the con gress, though they cannot all be given particular mention here. INDIAN RESERVATIONS. The several acts of congress looking to the reduction of the larger Indian reser vations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians as individuals, and the resto ration to public domain of lands in excess of their needs, have been largely carried into effect so far as the work was con fided to the executive. Agreements have been concluded since March 4, 1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,720,000 acres of land. These contracts Ijave, as required by law, been submitted to con gress for ratification and for tho appro priations necessary to carry them Into effect These with the Sisseton and Waupeton Sac and Fox, Iowa, Pottawa tomies and absentee Shawnees and Coeur D' Alene tribes, have not yet received the sanction of congress. Attention la aho called to tho fact that the appropriations made in the case of Sioux Indians have not covered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. If an agreement is confirmed all of its terms should be com plied with without delay and full appro priations should be made. THE PUBLIC DOMAIJf. The policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patenting of lands to settlers upon the public domain, has been carried out in the administra tion of the land office. " No general suspicion nor imputation of fraud has been allowed to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual cases upon their merits. The purpose has been to r -feet the title of honest settlers with sue . prompt ness, that the value, of the entry might not be swallowed up by the expense and extortions to which delay subjected the claimant The average monthly'issue of agricul tural patents ha3 been increased, about six thousand. TENSIONS. The disability pension act which was approved on the 27th of June last, has been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increased clerical force as provided, was selected and assigned to the work and a considerable part of the force engaged in examinations in tho field was recalled and added to the work ing force of the office. The examination. .and adjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more rapid than ever beforp. There is no econoiny to the government in delay while there is much hardship and injustice to the sol dier. The anticpated expenditure while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess of the estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberal en largement of the general law should sug gest a more careful scrutiny of bills not only for special relief but as to the cases where relief is granted and as to the amount allowed. THE MORMONS. The increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population in Utah are observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff, president of the Mormon church, in which he advised his people "to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land" has attracted wide attention and it is hoped that its influence will be highly beneficial in restraining infrac tions of the law of the United States. But the fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine or belief of the church that polygamous marriages are right and supported by divine revelation re mains unchanged. President Woodruff does-not denounce the doctrine, but refrains from touching it and advises against the practice of it because the law is against it Jow,itis quite true that the laws should not at tempt to deal with the faith or belief of any one, but it is quite another thing to deal with the territory of Utah, where those who believe polygamy to be right shall not necessarily have the power to make it lawful.
