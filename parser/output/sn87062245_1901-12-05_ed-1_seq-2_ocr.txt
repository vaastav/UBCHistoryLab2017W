FOOD A 1 a W i Te Memory AVnm Mrn J Grnpc N iit Food that will actually help the mem ory as well as agree perfectly with a deli cate stomach Is worth knowing of A good wife out in Alta loua who did not know which way to turn to get food that would agree with her husband who was left in a weakened condition after a serious illness and could scarcely retain any food in hln stomach was one day in duced to try him on Crape Nuts the fa mous ready cooked breakfast food and from the first he began to Improve rapid ly In three months he had gained thirty pounds She say that his stomach has recover ed so completely that he can now eat any kind of food She mentions the boy of an intimate ac quaintance who was so delicate and thin that his appearance was pitiable and he had no appetite for any ordinary food He was put on tJrape Nuts and liked the crlspnefs and sweetish taste of tho new food and took to it Ills Improvement be gan at once and be is now a healthy plump boy I know that Crape Nuts will do more for weak stomachs than any medicine The claim that It will build up and strengthen the brain has been proven to my certain knowledge Sister who writes for the press and is compelled to memor ize a great deal has been using Crape Nuts and says she Ic surprised at the re sult There is a marked Improvement in her memory and the brain works more perfectly and with better results Please do not publish my name Name can be given by the lostum Cereal Company Ltd Dattle Creek Michigan Lodge to provide the means of raising revenue for the Philippine Islands A I similar bill will be introduced In me House on Friday and it is hoped that there will be no llsposlticn en the part of the Democrats or anybody else to op pose their passage Thche hills were drawn after consulta tion with Scr ctary Root It is thought by the Administration and the Repub licans of the Senate and House that everybody will appreciate the Intolerable conditions existing in the Philippines growing out of Mondays decision of the Supreme Court and will allow the pro poses temporary adjustment of the insu lar taitr to be macted without forcing a general tariff debate At present the Democrats show no dis position to obstruct the passage of this emergency measure by political talk for which there will be ample opportunity when the hill that Is now being framed at the War Department presenting a gen eral scheme of territorial government for the Philippines shall come up for discus sion llritnrtliin In War Inv It 1ms prnctlcally been decided by those who control matters In the Senate and House that ro bill for the reduction of the war revenue taxes shall be brought forward at present The argument In favor of delay is that while it Is easy at this time perhaps to make a fairly accu rate estimate of what the surplus -will be for the next year or two no living man possesses the power to fix the amount of the expenditures It Is reasonably certain that a river and harbor bill of some kind will be passed The chances are that provision will be made for the beginning of the construc tion of the Nicaragua Canal and for tho payment of a ship subsidy If this Is done there will be no surplus to worry about Ihe old heads of tbe Capitol are therefore advising that it would be better to Ilay framing a tax re duction measure until it can be deter mined in a general way at least how much money there is to get rid of Mem bers of the Finance and Wajs and Means Committees say that whatever is done It -111 nAt ha nnlhlA tn wlnf flllt nil Of the taxes recommended for abolition by Sec-
