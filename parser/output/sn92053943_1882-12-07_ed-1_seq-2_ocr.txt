Tfcti'Sia- Decsrabif 7, 1322 The quantity of coal marketed during the year 1881, the latest year for which we have statistics, amounted to 79,805,000 tons, as aerainst -69,200,934 tons during the preceding year. The value of our exports of bread and breadstuff during the year ended June 30, the same being the product of the vear 1881, amounted to $182,670,528. The value of our exports of cotton was $ 199, 812.644. The Western Union, the company which, owns the principal part of the telegraph lines of the United States, increased its miles of wire from 233,534 in 1880 to 374, 294 in 1882. - The wires operated by that company would reach fifteen times around the world. Mr. Joseph Niramo, Jr.. chief of bureau of statistics, says that the corn' crop of this year is 1, 680,000,000 bushels, as against 1,194,016,000 bushels in 1881. The latest estimate of the wheat crop of the season of - of 1882 is 500,000,000 as against 380,280. -000 bushels in 1881. " It is exceedingly sad, and we write it even tearfully, but thus far we. have no re- port, or even telegraphic rumor, that one blessed, single greenbacker has survived the democratic cyclone. All of them, with their great leader, Hon. Wash. Jones, of Texas, were snowed under. A force of hands operated by the United States officers are dredging the Chickahom iny river, and will continue to work during the winter. The proceeding, if industri ously carried out will, it is confidently be lieved, materially assist the unobstructed passage of wood scows, muskrats, catfish, eels, end other similar crafts that usually navigate that classic stream. The population of the United States was in 1870 88 ,558,871, and in 1880 50,155, 883, an increase of 11.597.412. Since the world began there has not been seen in any other country a material development so grandly compliant with the Devine edict. "Be fruitful, and multiply, and re plenish the earth and subdue it." Mrs. Smith says the reason why child ret of this generation are so bad is owing to the wearing of Balmoral beots instead of old-fashioned slippers. Mothers find it too much trouble to pull off their boots to whip children, so they go unpunished; but when she was a child, the way the slipper used to do its duty was a caution to the whole familv. The total receipts of the Garfield fair in Washington were between $20,000 and $25,000, and the expenses fifteen thousand or a little more. The secretary of the board of directors has stated that he is confident the fair netted between $5,000 and $10,000. Mrs. Electa Smith, a news paper correspondent from Chicago, of Sterling, got the decorated mirror and lam brequin which were given by vote to the most popular lady manager. Byron An drews won the $250 gold Elgin watch raf fled for at the Illinois booths. The Philadelphia American insists that it does not follow because we need more gold that gold will flow into this country. Air, but not gold, rushes into each vacuum. But we would modestly ask whether it be not true that those countries having most, get most gold. Guineas gravitate resist lessly toward commercial marts already having most guineas. If fiercer flames than ever blazed in tartarus (before the re vision) omjv. rted all the silver in the United States into immaterial gises, not one additional dollar would gravitate for this reason, in this direction. Therefore there can be no reason for the demonetiza tion of silver on the baseless assumption that gold would flow into financial vacuum. The London Press on the President' Message. London. Dec. 4. The Daily T&egraph says: "President Arthur's message to congress will not rank with the great ef -ferts made on similar occasions by many of his predecessors. If ever a state paper presaged the waning influence and coming downfall of a political pary, it is the mes sage delivered yesterday by a man so blind to the true interest lying ahead of him, and so infirm of purpose as President Ar thur." The Daily Neic says: "It seems Presi dent Arthur has taken to heart the lesson of the late elections. The passage in his message pronouncing in favor of civil service reform must be intended to an offer of reconciliation to the disaffected republicans. "Referring to the flnancia part of the message, the Neu says: "If t he re-reduction of the national debt pro ceeds at last year's rate the protective tariff must fall to the ground,' because there could be no means of expending the enormous surplus when the debt is effaced." The Times says: "Now there is no doubt that President Arthur., after rii of cautious, tactical movements, has placed himself at the head of the stalwart party, and has succeeded in detaching from republican connection the reformers and independent who, if few in numbers, are among the roost eminent for capacity and character." "Have you any nice fresh farmer's eygs?" inquired a precise old lady at a grocery store. "No, ma'am," replied the practical clerk," but we have some very good hen's eggs." She took three to try. A Pennsylvania husband sued a man for alienating his wife's affections, and the jury cave him one dollar damages. When a woman's affections are considered equiva lent to ten pounds of cheap sugar, it's no womier young men are remaining single. Tu ,i tramps stopped at the house of a lone idow in Westchester county, and one went in to beg. Very soon he came out with a bloody nose and a black eye. "Did you get anything, Jack?" "Yes," 'growled the sufferer, "I've got the idow's might.'' MBS. 

LANGTRY'S YOUNG MAN. New York, Dec. 6. A reporter of the World was sent to find Mrs. Labouchere yesterday to ascertain whether there was any foundation of truth for a paragraph yesterday published in a morning paper of this city to the effect that a violent quarrel had taken place between Mrs. Langtry and herself which would prevent her from ac companying Mrs. Langtry to Boston. Mrs. Labouchere. who was found at her rooms at the Albemarle, said that her at tention had been called to the paragraph in question after Mrs. Langtry had left the hotel for Boston, and she was at a loss to understand why anyone should publish a statement so inaccurate and so discourte ous. She had no quarrel of the sort de scribed, it was hardly necessary to say, with Mrs. Langtry. "You are not going to Boston I infer. are Vou, Mrs. Labouchere T" "No; I am not going to Boston " "Did you not -ititend to go to Boston with Mrs. Lam.irv wheD you came to America. Mrs. Juiboucherc?" "Undoubtedly I intended to go to Bos ton, because I csme out to America with Mrs. Langtrv as her friend, and, in fact. may almost say, aa her only friend, and at the suggestion of my husband, who is most interested in her dramatic success and has done most to forward it ever since she first formed the plan of appearing on the stage, just one year ago this month." "Have you - any objection to saying why you do not now go to Boston with herr "Certainly not, since such absurd state ments have been made on the subject, have not quarreled with Mrs. Langtry. have no wish to quarrel with her, but I have had occasion to remonstrate with her in regard to a certain acquaintance formed by her in this city, which seemed to me likely to interfere with her success upon the stage, and certain to interfere with my own comfort as her friend and companion. She did not take these remon strances in eood part, and insisted on keeping up thia acquaintance at Boston I then tol l her plainly that I could not possibly consent to accompany her under these circumstances, and she preferred to go to Boston alone. That is the whole stoiy." The acquaintance to whom Mrs. Labou chere referred is said to have been "Fred- : die" Gebhard, a young man belonging to i the Turf club and Union club. He is 23, very handsome and very rich. It is said that he accompanied Mrs. Langtry to Boston. TOO MUCH EEALISM. Chicago News Letter. This is evidently an aee of stage realism, but if things go on in the way they have been running for the past two seasons there is great danger of the public taste for realism being gratified to an extent which will eventually need repressine. A new drama in Paris, we are told, is about to contain a balloon ascension, and the heroine of the play, after she has reached the flies in her aerial carriage, sud denly loses her balance and falls into a large sheet of water (representing the ocean) from which she is rescued. Of course the fall will be highly interesting to the audience even if it does shake up the innermost lelonging8 of the esteemed leading lady. There are other realistic efforts in pro gress, but the idea of a gentleman in this city probably goes further than anything that has ever preceded it. He has writ ten a play in which a woman is drowned, and the plot of the piece depends upon the identification of the body. Thus one act is set in the morgue, and he proposes lo model the morgue scene after the morgue in Paris that is to say with a number of marble slabs upon which the dead bodies are placed. Upon these slabs he proposes to "lay out" a number of first class specimens-7-men and women made up to represent dead people. A sheet is to cover the body up to the chest, and'.bove the head is a little water spout from which tepid water falls upon the face of the sapposed dead. The general effect of this is assisted by an electric light,' and if the corpses only remain perfectly still, our dramatist predicts the most realistic scene ever witnessed upon any stage. It is safe to say that during the last few years the desire of the public to sec things on the stage as they actunllj' are in life is increasing to ah alarming extent. Until lately it was only necessary to describe in the dialogue of a play that a certain crime had been committed. To-day it is abso lutely necessary to imitate the act itself in order lo satisfy the public. In France stage realism has reached such a pitch that certain acts are done in public which, until recently, the least baseful per son would prefer to consummate in the strict privacy of his chamber. It cannot be said that this unfortunate degeneration of the stage is entirely the fault of the manager. They fiud that is the sort of thing which pays them best, and so they pursue it. It is evident that it suits the public taste, otherwise it would not pay, so that we can only deplore the result while we are powerless to remedy the case. There are many things to he- urged gainst tb drift of public tat for nsa- tional effects that it would be well if mana gers declined to foster the appetite and. even at the risk of sacrificing a temporary gain, absolutely combine to banish the system of portraying-the successful com mission of deep crime on the stage. That this remarkable taste is spread ing with alarming rapidity among all classes, is best illustrated by a com munication which we received on Tues day, from a gentleman in Rock Island, lie saii: "Can you inform me what you can give in the shape of a play some thing that has lots of blood and thunder in it. The play is wanted by our Association, etc." Now the association in questiou , which we will not name, is purely an amateur affair, but looking over the records of its former efforts in the theatrical line we find that in years gone by it has been thor oughly satisfied with such charming com edies as Caste; The School for Scandal, Money and so forth. Now the realistic craze has struck it and nothing will do but apiece in which there are lots of murders and crimes, or in fact a play which is dis tinquished as a blood and thunder affair. It is to be hoped, however.that we are still far distant from that day when the American stage will beeome quite as real istic as it is in France. If the truth must be told, the line of uecency and good taste has already been over-stepped by Ameri can managers. Jeff Davis' Marriage at Galena with the Daugh ter of General Taylor. From the Galena ( HI. ) Gazette. An interesting reminiscence of the past, in which the President of the late South ern Confederacy, John Lorrain, Esq., of this city, Captain Warren, of Bellevue, and Harrison, a Southern duelist, were the central figures, was copied into this paper yesterday from the Bellevue Leader, which revives the following 'additional scrap of history in the life of the first named actor in the drama referred to: Davis frequently visited Galena during his period of duty at Prairie du Chien, and was well acquainted with many of our early settlers. AmoDg the number was the late Keden Bennett, tsq., with whom he was very intimate. When Davis ran away with General Taylor's lovely daughter, he came in a rickety conveyance as far as Burt's mill, in Grant county, Wis., owned by the father of Hon. C. S. Burt, of Dubque. Iowa, and who is now living in the town of Dunleiths this county. Mr. Burt, know ing the young Lieutenant, and strongly sympathizing with bim in his love affair, loaned him a fleet horse and buggy, with which Davis drove to Galena with his sweetheart, and was married in the offiice of the late Justice Cormic, an exhortcr as well as a magistrate. General Taylor was an enemy of Davis for depriving him of his daughter until the gallant charge of his son-in law at Monterey, when he rode up to him nn the fjeld. and taking his hand forgave him and enthusiastically compli mented him for his bravery. The circum stances attending the flight and marriage Of Davis with the daughter of General Taylor, are well remembered by several of our older citizens who came here in early days, and from one of the number we have obtained the story as above detailed. Catching Cold- From the Louisville Medical IN-rahl. When a current of air blows in at the window, all the light and small particles 01 lint nd dirt are carried with the cur rent of air. We breathe the insoluble and irritating matter into the nose, throat and bronchia?; we sneeze, become hoarse, and cough. We go to an evening entertain ment, suffer much the same as discrbed. from the inhalation of an atmosphere tainted with the exhalations of a crowd of persons, some of whom almost certainly suffer from catarrh, pulmonary phthisis, or other form of disease of the passage. All thhese sources of irritation of the respira tory passages are set down as cold. NOT 80 

CRAZY AS SHE THOUGHT Boston Transcript, A young lady of Chelsea, who had been shopping in Boston, visited the office of a prominent physician on Saturday. She was flushed and excited, and said she had a very strange sensation which led her to apprehend serious brain trouble in shoit insanity. The peculiar sensation she described was a feeling running around in a circle on the top of her head. The doctor took off her hat and examined her head, but found nothing, and she remarked that the sensation had left her. She put on her, hat and after sitting a few moments jumjied up with a scream, saying that it had corue jam. Another examination followed, first of the he d, then of the hat, and in the hat a small but active mouse was discovered. After all, pugilism seems to be quite as fashionable as aestheticism. We find a New York" paper daintily recording the movements of a notorious ring "slugger" after this manner: "Mr. Tom Allen, the distinguished English pugilist, took a drive through Central Park yesterday afternoon, and afterward dined with a party of friends in en uotown club-house. His private secretary says that he is in re ceipt of .many iuvitations to dinner parties."
