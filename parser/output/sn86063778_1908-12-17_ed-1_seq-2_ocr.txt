DECEMBER 17, 1908, The Times has noted with fullfledged interest the work of thl)K(> natif>rs -vv1iii?V? rnpontlii Koito j/v.w i> ?**vii < wviitij nuv V/ 4 been preaching prosperity in < South Carolina, and we have i ubout concluded that if some- 1 thing is not soon done to stay < the onrush of this mad wave of good times we will all be bloated 1 bondholders in another fortnight. < Of course we are all prosperous ? ; times were never easier and 1 money more plentiful. And all the talk we heard about depressed conditions some weeks ago ?and still hear from some i pastoral individual who sits down to his dinner table with a spread before him fit for the' | gods but whose disordered imagination pictures a menu of cab- < bage and stale bread ?all that talk, we say, was little short of treason and we would welcome the opportunity to help string up by the thumbs the man who started it. Confidence is the thing?that's what makes the wheels of progress scoot round so fast that you can't count the spokes. In South Carolina these wheels of progress mean to an appreciable extent the wheels of j i .. ... . . - ' me cotton nun machinery, and pf course ?why, of course?they have all been turning so fast for the last year they are now worn out and must be replaced with new ones.. Nor has cotton been selling for 8 cents, either, "omr> few pessimists to the /contrary notwithstanding. But granting that the price was and is 8 cents ?what of that! It coits the farmer less than 2 cents a \ o md to raise it, since the negro farm hands have wel corned the opportunity to work for 7 cents a day for the last year. Hard times! Don't you believe a word of it. It's a fly-specked /eidolon, and prosperity is as thick in South Carolina as the hide on a hippopotamus' back. Truly we have much to thank our Republican benefactors for. They certainly are good to the South. Anent the alleged crooked Pan- 1 uiiio kuuai mm lit which It lij claimed that the Federal governernment was bilked out of many millions by prominent Republican politicians and replying to the :charge of President Roosevelt in u special message to Congress ?hat it had libeled the United , ^States in publishing the charges, i the New York World of yesterday hands that faker and four- i flusher the following warm one po think over: "No other living until ever*) grossly libel oil tho United Status undoes thi.i president, who besmirches .Cougrcn, bulldozes judges, assails tho . integrity of courts, w'nalers private citizens ntul who has shown himself the most ttockloss unscrupulous demagogue v hotu the Ainoricuit i?copleever trusted .with great power uud authority." Well paid and true, but not new, as ^Senator Tillman years ago gave the country an equally correct .estimate of this prince of swash- , bucklers. A few days ago there was -tent out from Mansfield, <)hi??. a news anicro 

CHTTITTTTJ^ wTtTl TTTtJ I Work'of reclaiming the criminals in the Statue nitentiary in that I city. There was much in the 1 article which should be of inter- j 1 est to South Carolinian:--, and hut for the fact that the article is j copyrighted we v ould he pleas-d , to reproduce it in thesec .lurnns. Partlicplariy we imnrcased I with the contrast that obtains j s trnentor' prn-oners in the Ohio institatfon and the South 1 Carolina penitentiaty. There the J huinilfeting prison stri: iven place to neat : and hand-eulfs, whipping-posts and chambers of j torture have bfcen sui the more humane chamber," the offender 1 against the rales bfjitfy institu tion is 9?nt. to think out :.. . t or himself. The sole idea l . ; conduct of the Ohio prison is. to | try to reclai <cr nvict a tisefui member of . l * liety, by sending him out into a the world at the expiration of S( his sentence fitted for the respon- n sibilities of citizenship. At the ** 3ou*h Carolina penitentiary ap- c< parentiy no thought is ever given j tl to reforming the prisoners and in a many cases at the expiration' " of their time they are released j anly to become greater ofFenders 1 against the laws of the land, with ! their hearts filled with bitter j ^ resentment against humanity for , *j the hardships which they ex- ^ perienced as prisoners. Several I n times in the past, in discussing t< the conditions at the penitentiary ! S( in Columbia, we have taken oc- ^ n casion to point out the barbarous I e practice of using the lash on the c bared backs of offending prison- , fi 1 A1 il _ ? 1 1* ? t ' l-? ers, noping tnat ine recital 01 tne ; " facts would move the legislature p to investigate the matter and for- t( ever put an end to the savage : g violation of civilization and the f law of the commonwealth. Cor- a poral punishment of prisoners is ^ not only a violation of statute ;v law in this State, but we belittle n our vaunted civilization in per- e mitting it to be practiced. It * would be much better for our; State if some of the energy and ^ intelligence that is wasted in p chasing the prohibition myth j.1 were directed against this brutal, i: manhood-destroving evil. ; I li With the exception of the cot- <i ton mill industry, the South is yet largely an agricultural sec- . tion, and our people have not i therefore had an opportunity to I view at close range any of the ' good work of organized labor in uplifting the condition of the j working man. Due to the lack of information on the subject, there is much prejudice in the South against organized labor which would be quickly dispelled if our people would inform themselves upon the many beneficent things which it urges for better working and living conditions. One of the most worthy undertitiiinrs r?f nr I:ilinr in 1 recent years is the effort to les- 1 sen the hours of women's work ^ in the great industrial establish- | ments or the North. Nor is , there anything selfish in the the undertaking to better the conditions of the working women, for a very small portion of the ! women belong to organized labor. ' The most encouraging sign we have seen in weeks of returning prosperity is in the fact that the tide of immigration to this country has again set in strongly. : Last year when the Republican I panic struck the country broadside tens of thousands of these immigrants returned to their former homes in the old world. Now they are coming again in j droves, which would seem to (] indicate that normal conditions ' p are returning. Of course there s are already some several millions too many of these aliens in this country, for they are for the I: most part the scum 01 creation, ? but that is another matter. : r, _ v^ili?cus ui mis cuiiimuniiy wno recall the splendid work of the , Fort Mill Academy 20-odd years ago in promoting the educational interests of this section, read with pleasure some days ago of the success with which the old j academy's superintendent, Prof. r A. R. Banks, is meeting in the rejuvenated Hyatt Park school, v near Columbia. There are scores , of men and women in this com- ; munity, and in various other sections of the State, who often refer with pride to the fact that v they were pupils of Professor v Banks. Naturally they all wish I him the success which his ability p as a teacher and director of edit- national affairs deserve. There are a few penny-liners ^ in South Carolina who, when s they run out of anvthingelse to 'r _ 1 . 1 ' write auoui, Degin to make a ;i noise about the heels of Senator | rillman like something in the > neighborhood with canine ancestors. i j Rock Hill Won, But Says the Rock Hill Herald: j "The game of foot hall Wednes- s day afternoon between the Tjirers of this city and the Fort " ivliii team resulted in a score of 3 to 0 in favor of the Tigers. The game"was a good one and <1 was well contested, but Bill Kim- . nail proved too much for the I Fort Mill team. Kimball made _ some daring dashes and with .he support of his teammates | ne made the touchdown in the E list half. Then Brown kicked i goal which netted the Tigers a ;ore of 6. The Fort Mill team layed good ball but it was imossible for them to score." The Fort Mill team puts up the Dmplaint that it received anyling but fair treatment in the bove game and attributes its efeat to this fact. Garrison Not Yet Committed. A dispatch sent to The State [onday from Laurens says that tie report in Sunday's papers hat Mr. J. Henry Garrison ad abandoned his appeal for a ew trial and had already gon? 3 the penitentiary to serve his entence for the killing of Mr. J. .ouis Williamson of the Bethesda eighborhood near Rock Hill is rroneous.

The News and Courier publishes the following: dispatch from Yorkville regarding the corn contest conducted by the York County Union: At a meeting held here about the first of last April, the York County Farmers' Union undertook to stimulate corn raising among the farmers of the county ! by offering three cash prizes to j the three farmers in the county who entered the contest by a; specified time and produced the largest yield on one acre of ground. At the time when the idea was conceived and made public the farmers generally had already prepared their lands for corn and many had finished planting, therefore all felt more or less at a disadvantage, out, notwithstanding: this fact, the following complied with the conditions prescribed by the committee in charge, and entered the contest: C. H. Smith, Norman S. Black, W. E. Land, J. A. Steele, R. N. Whitesides, J. L. Wood. Last Thursday was the date fixed for deciding the contest, and the report of the judges showed that Mr. Smith had raised 88 bushels, Mr. Black 68 bushels and 55 pounds, Mr. Land C6 and 15 pounds, Mr. Steele 65 and 38 pounds, Mr. Whitesides 63 and 13 pounds, Mr. Wood 61 and 34 pounds. |The sum of $272 had been raised | by popular subscription, with the understanding that one-half 1 of the amount was to be awardi ed to the producer of the largest j yield, and the balance to he I divided between the two next Christmas, beginning u bargains in the gooc lire what you need be ;cepers will lind what, ul Christmas presents EAD THESE PRICE (Counterpanes.
