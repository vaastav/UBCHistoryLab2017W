BETTERMENTS Department Has Asked for $212,000 for Improve ments About Island. BY TAV- Washington, Dec. 16. (Special.) Rock Island will probably not only get an appropriation of $60,000 for the re decking of Rock Island bridge between the arsenal and Davenport, but stands an excellent chance of getting $100,000 for arsenal improvements." This was the assurance General Wil liam Crozier, chief of ordnance of the war department, gave Representative McKinney today, who later held alone conference with the ordnance clerk. AhIu for 9212,000. "We ask for $212,000 for artillery storehouse, filtration plant, oil fuel plant, steam heater for barracks, and maintenance and repair of bridge and power and plant at the arsenal," said General Crozier. "Unless congress is suddenly moved by an impulse to econ omize, the war department estimate will go through with little cut out." Expected to Be Liberal. The general impression now Is that congress will be liberal in the army and navy appropriations. Congressman McKinney, accompan ied by Congressman Dawson, will see Crozier together some . time later in the week. " - ! New York, Dec. 16. Under the cap tion "Lese Majeste" the World today prints the following in an editorial on President Roosevelt's Panama mes sage: " Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He can not muzzle the World. While no amount of billingsgate on his part can alter our determination to treat him with judicial impartiality and scrupu lous fairness, we repeat what we have In the nation for president is 1,265,882. His clear majority over all other pres idential contenders is 450,530. The to tal vote cast in the 46 states Nov. 3 was 14,893,046. These figures are the complete re turns as given out by the secretaries of state of the various commonwealths. the vote of New York and Michigan, the last two states to complete the re capitulation of the election figures, having been given out last night. Great interest has been manifest over the complete results of the elec tion, and in the table which Is present ed herewith the comparison between" the vote cast in 1904 and in 190S gives Pinteresting results. Popular Vote Computed. The Associated Press, following- the system of computing the total popular vote by striking an average of the votes cast in each state for the candI- dates for presidential elector, arrive at somewhat different totals, as . fol lows: ' Taft, republican 7.637,676 Bryan, democrat C.393,182 Debs, socialist . . . .'. 447,651 Chafln, prohibition 241,252 HIsgen, Independence 83,186 Watson, populist 33,871 GHhaus, socialist labor.... ...

They were elected in 16 states by an aggrregate democratic strength of 6,410,027. BIk ChHHKe in 1'enuHylrnnin. Pennsylvania, as usual, carries the banner at the head of the republican column. The Taft plurality in the Key stone state stands at 29C.994. Four years ago it was 502,951. Missouri and Maryland had' a close finish for the record of the smallest republican pop ular pliwality. Missouri just did land within the republican ranks with a plurality for Taft of 629, but Maryland was a shade smaller with a republican plurality of 605, giving two of its elec tors to Taft and Sherman and the oth er six to Bryan and Kern. Texan Democratic- Leader. Texas gets the honors in the demo cratic camp, having rolled up a Bryan plurality of 151.636, against 116,893 for Parker and Davis in 1904.' Nevada re turns the"" smallest democratic plurali ty. 441.- The total vote cast in 190S is greater than that of 1904 by 1,353,523. Taft's total vote Is 55,239 greater than that given' to Roosevelt in 1904," while Bry an gains 1,329,520 over Parker in 190. The popular plurality for Taft is far short of Roosevelt's. Roosevelt's "lead over Parker was 2,540,463, ; which Is over Bryan. Taft's percentage of the total vote cast stands at 51.54 per cent. Roose velt's percentage of the total vote in 1904 was 56.28. Bryan's percentage is 43.04, as against. 37.52, which was the Parker percentage four years ago. The socialist party was the only one of the minor parties to show a gain m 1908 over 1904. Eugene V.

MARVEL," FAMOUS AUTHOR, IS NO MORE already said that the congress of the TTnfta4i Cta'aa nt-i-tiiTV malm r V Arnii rVi I investigation of the whole Panama : UGIl. (iTOZICr UlVCS COD1 transaction ttat the full truth may be known to the American people. j Did Not Himself Demand It. It is a most extraordinary circum stance that Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand such an inquiry. All his protestations of outraged virtue, all his torrents of imprecation and denun ciation, end with the amazing asser-: tion that "there is nothing whatever in which this government is interested to investigate about this transaction." The World fully appreciates the com-' pliment paid to it by Mr. Roosevelt in making it the subject of a special mes sage to the congress of the United States. In the whole history of Amer ican government no other president has ever paid such a tribute to the power and influence of a fearless, In dependent newspaper. i Flrwt Action of the Kind. The World likewise appreciates the importance and signiflcanse of Mr. Roosevelt's statement when he de clares to congress that the proprietor of the World "should be prosecuted for libel by the governmental authorities," and that "the attorney general ha un der consideration the form under which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought." This Is the first time a president ever asserted the doctrine of lese majeste or proposed in the absence of specific legislation the criminal prose cution by the government of citizens who criticised the conduct of the gov ernment or the conduct of Individuals who may have had business dealings with the government. Neither the king of Great Britain nor the German emperor would venture to arrogate such power to himself. John Adams' attempt to enforce the sedition law destroyed the Federalist party in America. i"et Mr. Roosevelt in the ab sence of the law officially proposes to use all the power of the greatest gov ernment on earth to cripple the free dom of the press on the pretext that the government itself has been libeled and he is the government. . Lat Straw on Hia Back. We are aware that for many years Mr. Roosevelt has been savagely dis- he.. editorial -conduct of the World. H is true that we nave crltr Icised him sharply and frankly when ever we believed the public interest required, just as we have heartily com mended and supported him-whenever we believed the public interest would thereby be aavanced. Mr. Roosevelt's j attack on the World can be explained lonly on the theory that he believes he j can muzzle the paper, and our recent impeachment of his veracitv seems to have been the last straw that broke his automatic back. It is true that the World printed the public reports concerning the Panama canal affair, which resulted from Wil liam Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney's office during the re cent campaign to prevent the publica tion of a story which was said to be in the hands of the democratic nationaf committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's own action which raised the issue in the campaign. "If Tbl Be Treason." Etc. It is true olso that when Mr. Roose velt made his attack -upon Delavan Smith the World called attention to certain statements which Mr. Roose velt must have known to have been false or misleading, and appealed to congress to end all scandal by a full and impartial investigation. If this' be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the most of it. Indiana Paper CojuStie. Indianapolis, Dec. 16. The Indiana polis News, mentioned in the special message on the Panama canal deal sent to congress yesterday, by Roose velt, today ksued a reply- to the chief executive. It says: "It is difficult to characterize fully the latest outbreak of the president witholit resorting to the use of lan guage as undignified and blameworthy as that which has put the president's utterances iu a class by itself in the official literature of the high office he holds."

Following is a summary compiled from the official proceedings of the work of both houses of congress yesterday: SENATE The president's ' Panama canal message was read, and ita read in was received with loud laughter by some of the senators. Senator Koraker endeavored to have adopted a resolu tion calling on the secretary of war for ueiauea miortnaiion concerning the . men employed, instructions given and expenses incurred In the Investigation by detectives into the Brownsville af fair, referred to by the president in hi message of Monday. Senator Warren objected to immediate consideration, and it will come up .today. The postal savings bank bill was made the subject of speeches by Senators Carter and De pew, both of whom advocated the meas ure. The bill was made the unfinished business, displacing the' joint resolu tion for the repeal of the commodity clause of the interstate commerce law. On motion of Senator Fulton the omni bus claims bill will be taken up Jan. S. Brief memorial services . were held for the late Representative George W. Smith of Illinois, and at 8:80 the senate adjourned. HOt'SB The hopes of the so-called insurgents for a revision of the rules of that body were dissipated, for .the time being at least, when Mr. Gardner of Massachusetts failed to obtain the adoption of an amended resolution call ing for the appointment of a committee of eight members to consider the sub ject and report the changes, deemed necessary.. By a substantial majority the house voted to take away from the vlnced that everything was as it should have been.
