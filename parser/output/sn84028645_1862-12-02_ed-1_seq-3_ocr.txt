Synopsis of the President's Message. 71 I , He saya tbe correspondence' touching foreien affairs which has taken plaoe duriog tbe last rear is herewith submitted, in compliance with request to that effeot. If tbe oonditlon of our relatioos with other nations Is less sratifr iocr than formerly, It Is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted might bave reasonably apprehended. A blockade of three thousand mile of aeaooaat oonld not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of (treat commercial aotivitv like the present without committing occasional mistakes and lnfliotlDg unintentional Injuries npon foreign nations and subjects. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so far as possible, nearu ana rearessea complaint by Iriendly powers. There Is, however, a large and aug menting number of doubtful oases upon wblch the Government Is unable to agree with the Governments whose protection is demanded by tbe claimants, inure are, moreover, many oasea in which the (Jolted States or tbelr oltl aens suffer wronge from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, whloh the Gov ernment or theee Htatee are not at once ore pared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States Interested, mutual conven tions to examine and aduat euoh complaint. i nis nas neen maae especially to Ureal Britain, Franoe, Spala and Prussia. In eaoh oase it has been kindly received, but not yet formally aaoptea. . Applications have been made to me by maoy free Americana of African desoenl to favor tbelr emigration with a view to suoh coloniza tion as was contemplated In rcoent aota of Con gress. Other parties, at borne and abroad, eome from Interested and other motives, bave suggested similar measures, while on the other band, several or tbe Spanleh American Republic have protested against the aendlng of inch colonies to their re- apeotlve territories. Under these circum stances, I bave deolluod to move any snob colony lo any State without first obtaining the consent of its Government, with an agreement on Its' part to receive ond protect such emi grants In all tbelr rights as freemen, and I bare at the same time offered to tbe several States situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to tbe advioe and consent of the Senate, to faror the voluntary emigration of portions cf that cla-s to their respective territo ries, upon conditions whloh shall be equal, just aud humane. Liberia and HaviI are yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go, with cer tainty of being reoelved and adopted as oltl aens; and I regret to ear that snob persons con templating ooloniiation do notseem so willing to emigrate to these oountciee as lo some others, nor so willing as I think their interest demands. I believe, however, that the opinion Is Improving, and that ere long there will be an augmented ana considerable emigration to both these oouatries Our relations with European States remain undisturbed, and with the Stales of our conti nent tbey have improved, especially Mexico, Costa Rica, etc. Tbe Presidont favors the projeot of the Atlantio telegraph, and extending the Paolfio line to connect with that being extecded across tbe Russian Empire. He thicks tbe mineral resources of our territories ought to be devol oped aa rapidly aa possible. Every step In that direction would bave a tendency to im prove tbe revenues. It is worthv of serious consideration, whether some extraordinary measures to ptomote that end cannot be adoDt- ed. The means which suggests Itself as mo;i likely to be effsotive, la a scientific exploration. The vast txpenditnres incident to tbe mili tary aud naval operations required for the suppression cf the rebellion, bave hitherto been met with a promptitude aud certainty uousual In similar eircumstenoes, and the pnb Ho credit has been fully maintained. The oontlnuanoe of the war, however, and the in creased disbursements made necessary, de mand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary , revenue. The snspenslon or speole payment by the banks made large taeuea of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could tbe payment of tbe troops and the satisfac'loa of other jnet demands be so economically or as well provided for. It is extremely doubtful whether a oiroulatlon of United States notes payable In ooin, aud suf ficiently large for the wants of tbe people, oan be permanently usefully and eifoly maintained. Is there any other mode in which the necessary provision for the publlo wants oan be made, and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency seoured ? I know of none whleh prom ises so certain results, and at the lame time so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking association under a general oot of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To euch aeso dations the Government might furnish circu lating notes on tbe eecurlty of United States bonds deposited in tho Treasury. These notes, Srepared under tbe supervision of proper offloe;-, eing uniform in appearanoe and security, con vertible always Into coin, would at onoe protect labor against the evils of a vlolous eurrenoy, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe ex ohacges. A moderate roserratlon from the In terest on the bonds wonld compensate tbe United States, for the preparation and distribution of tbe notes, and a gener&l supervision of tbe sys tem, and would lighten the burden of thai part of tbe publlo debt employed as security. The publio orodit, moreover, would be greatly Im- iroved, and ttie negotiation of new loans great y facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It lo an additional 'recommendation ot the measure, of considerable weight, la my judg ment, inai u wouiu reconcile as tar as panicle all existing interests by tbe opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganise under tbe act, substituting only tbe secored uniform Na tional circulation for the looal and various cir culation now Issued. The President then gives a aummarv from the Secretary of the Treasury's report, lie refers to the reports of the Seoretariea of tbe Navy and War, and aaye, though lengthy, they arc onlv a brief abstract. He ears there is a de- olded improvement in tbe financial oonditlon of tbo roatcmce Department, compared with pre ceding years. Tbe Secretary of the Interior reports that the publlo lands have oeased to be r source or revenue. Speaking of Indian affair and reoent troubles. ne sayei a suomii lor your speoiai consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remod led. He suggest the earliest completion of the raoino rauroau; aieo laroraoie action bv Con- Sess on projeot for enlarging tbe great oauals New York, Illinois and Miohlgan. The rreeident refer to His compensated emancipation proclamation of September 9fld, and says: That portion of tbe earth occupied by the people of tbe United State Is well adapted to be tbe home of one national family, but not for two or more. In tbe Inaugural addresa I brieflv pointed ont the total Inadequacy of disunion as a rem edy lor ainerenoes between the neon e o! tbe two lections. I did so In language whloh I cannot improve, rnysicaiiy ipeakiug, we oan not separate; we oaonot remove onr respective sections irom eacn otner, nor build an impass able wall between them. He then remarks at length on the difficulty of making any natloual boundary line. , . i . Tbe President then suggest amendments to the Constitution: Congress concurring, to be proposed to the Legislature or convention of tbe several mates, wniob, ir ratified by threo lourins oi saia jj-giaiaiures, to be valid as part of laid Constitution. The first artiole proposes that all State Rbollsbinir ilaverv ba. fore January 1st; 1900, shall receive oompenv (ation from the United States. 91. All slaves freed by ohanoes of war any time before the end of tbe rebellion, shall be forever free; but au owners woo naa noi neen disloyal shall be compensated. 3d. Congress may , ap propriate money and otherwise provide tor colonising free colored person, with their oonsent, at any plaoe without the United State. Tbo President discusses these artiole at acme length, and aake, If then, for a common object, dave property la to be laorifioed, la it oot just It should be done at a common oharge? and if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preterro the benefits of the Union by this mean, than we can bv the war alone la it not economical to do ltl The proposed emancipation would shorten thla war, perpotU' ate ponoe, insure Increase In pornlntion, and proportiouaUil t' n wealth of tho country. The President t n puje: The plan conslst- lug oi loose article . i n eon 'necdel not but that a restoration of thn n . ior;M authority would be acoepted without It. adoption, nor will tbe war or proceedings under the otoolamation of September 22J, be etaiuJ totalise of tbo recommendation of this plan, iu timely adopt ion, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both: and notwithstanding this plan, tbe reoommendation that Congress pro vide by law for compeneatlng any State which may adopt the emancipation before this plan shall have been acted npon. Is hereby earnestly renewed. Thia plan la recommended as a moans trot in oonoiuaion of but additional tu all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout tbe Union. The subject is present ed exclusively la it econimiaal aspeot. Tho plan is proposed a permanent constitutional law. .... In conclusion, the President iava the dogmas of tbe quiet past are inadequate to tbo stormy present. The oocaalon is piled high wltb dim eolty, and we must rise with the occasion, The fiery trial through whlob we pass will light us down In honor or dishonor to tbe latest generation. We say that we are for the Union. The world will cot forget that while we say thia, we do know bow to nave tbe Union. In giving free dom to tbo slave, we inauro freedom to tbe free bonorable alike in what we give and wnai we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last beet hope of the earth. Otber means mar eocoeed: thla could not fail. One way la plain, peaceful, generous, lust a way which, if followed, the world will forever appiaua, and uod must forever bless." Fight at Snicker's Ferry. Brio . Gen. Stabl has just returned. He attacked tbe enemy at Snioker'a Ferry, and followed them with three hundred oaralry into their oamp on the otber side of tbe rlrer and near Berryvllle.
