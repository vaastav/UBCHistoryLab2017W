On the local page of to-day's GBAFIUO will be found some interesting reading under the head of the "Southern Ques tion," in wliiAh Capt. W. V. Lucas, of this county, and C. N. Walker, of Ken tucky, discuss "the future of the negro." The subject, though not a new one, is none the less Interesting. Both the gentleman are partly right and partly wrong. It could hardly be otherwise in a diseussion carried on by two sueh ex tremists. Mr. Walker, in denying the right of suffrage to the negro, practieally admits that he does not enjoy that right. After being »o repeatedly told by south ern editors that a fair and free ballot prevails throughout the .South, his can dor is ^oite refreshing. Capt. Lucas be lieves that the negru of the South should be allowed to vote and have that vote counted. While not claiming a cou Jr.sry belief it is fair to say that the Cap tain, in common with thousands of other well meaning citizens of the North, does not—or will not—understand the condi tion which would overlt&e .tie South should his ideas be carried into immedi ate effect. Imagine, if you can, an In dian population in Dakota In excess of the whites three to one and the right of suffrage gr«nle4 .the Indian. :This would mean the utmost supremacy of the Indians in our local government. It would mean an Indian legislature, Indian governor, Indian judgeB, Indian sheriffs, Indian justices, and soon through all the lesser offices, municipalities, etc. If the right of suffrage was granted the Indians under a Demoara.lic administration natur ally they would ttlljbe Democrats, as the negro of the South ja naturally a Repub lican for similar reasons. In contemplat ing those things for a moment, the exact condition of many ot the southern stales is readily realized. It uiust be borne in mind that the negro of the South is no more to be compared in intelligence with the negro of the North than dark ness with Hay light, and is not one wnit more cabable of casting nu intelligent ballot than the Sioux Indian. There arc exceptions of course, but it only only makes matters worse. We iu Da kota have seen how this works by wit nessing the ease with which the redskin, Sitting Bull, manipulates his less intelli gent followers. At its best the southern questiou is a perplexing one for, laying aside all party prejudice, it is only tair to say. First, that so far as tho colored population is concerned, thure is no no such thiugas a fair vote aud an hon est count in the majority of the South ern states. Secoudly, that a fair vote and an honest count would mean the abso lute supremacy of the colored race 111 the political alXtiiiii of these states. If thesa conditions me agreed to. all candid men un st acknowledge that the situa tion in the South is one Involving prob lems of the very gravest character. The southern negro is by laws of the nation a legal voter. To deny him the nj(ht to vote, or to make nngatory that vole, when polled, by fraud or trickery, are abstractly considered crimes that call for condign punishment. On the other hand, the testimony from the uioat reli at)Ju sources seems to warrant the con clusion ill«t the colored people of the booth are at this tune, as in the past, to tally disqualified to esrry 011 the public affairs of thai section. In oilier words, that negro supitinacy there means ca lamity even to tho negroes themselves. It is an awful state of society iu which home, properly aud progress depond on a chionic poll of fraud and violence Yet such appears to be the present case mlheboutli. bo far as local politics of the bouth are concerned, the people of the iNorlh ure nappily spared the duty of assisting 111 any solution of problems, pertaining thereto. 1 hey could not le gally do so it they would, and lliey would probably harm more than they helped if they could and tried. But when it comes iu ri'pri'sentiii 1011 111 con gress arid the cleutoia! culkt.'M tlia situa tion is different. It is upon the-e through congress, mat »iiii people ill* iorth ujuy rpeak uud act. JJoas.it sund to reason that a condition can long bo submitted to under which the vote of one miti in South Carolina counts for as much 111 congress and the electoral col lege as the vote of seven men in Illinois? This is a practical denial of sufiragc to tho North, and it will uot be endured much longer, for thert is a legal way to amend the wrong and the power to carry the amendment into practice. Other wrongs there are as great perhaps as the one under consideration that congress should set right, but the people do not yet see them so plainly and, as a conse quence. are not so resolute about undo ing them. Just now the public mind ia se» upon justice In the matter of the suffrage so far as congress can lawfully act. There will be no peace'till equity be had. f, "a— "There is more than one way to skm a cat," so it Is written.

It comes to the Cliurinc that the city coun cil down there recently appointed Col.

Tho president's message was given to cpngress Monday. It is as long as all his others, equally as able, and like them, particularly noteworthy for his studied neglect of the Dakota question.

Sixty Democratic members of the Orand Army of the Republio per fected a society which will be known as the Democratlo Soldiers' and Veterans' Association of Indiana. The Democratic members of the Q.

With two-thirds of the pop ulation and wealth in the Bonthern half it's folly to be imposed on in that kind of style. If all cannot agree on South Dakota and North Dakota let the fel lows up north look up a new name. It ip reported thut a sentiment is gain ing ground in North Dakota that the prefix "North" smacks strongly of the artic regions and the home of the bliz zards and, consequently, a ew name en tirely would be better suited to the north ern portion of the territory when ad mitted as a Blate.

Devils Lake New.—On the question of the decline of the water supply from artesian wells because of exhaustion or the frequent tap ping of the water bearing strata, Prof. Chamberlain says: The too current no tion that a subterranean pool, which has been struck by a well, supplies it for a time and then becomes exhausted, may be dismissed witlioutmuch consideration Especially Is this true of the artesian wells of Dakota, which, from the great depths at which the currents are reached, indicate afar distant reservoir and a per manent supply. At Lillers, France, an artesian well has been in operation since the year 1128. The aitcsian wells of London, England, the provinces of of France and Ou Thong, China, have been flowing lor years an unyarytng supply of water. And, at home, the constant flow of wells in Sew York, Wis consin, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Alabama,. Illinois and Iovra, prove the adequacy of the supply of the respective fountafii-heads. A tempo rary decline of tho flow may occur by reason of the filling up of the bore with mud, sand, and loose rock the collapse of the pipe, because of the wearing effects of the corrosive Ingredients of water faulty and defective piping, which will permit pf lateral leakage, or from olher causes but cessation of flow be cause of the exhaustion of the supply, may be considered as disproved by science history.

After trying various proscriptions, without benefit, my physician finally determined to givo 1110 Aver Cherry Pectoral. I took it, and tho effect was magical. I seemed to rally fiom the first doso of this medicine, and. after using onlv three bottles, am as well and sound as over."
