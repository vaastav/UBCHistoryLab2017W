By tho payment of W0, any lady may beCumc a lite member, and according to tho constitution of tho society, such member is exempt from the payment of all further due s. However, the good ladies whom the congregation of the church make, lifo members always in? sist on contributing tojtho society funds, \ so that life membership partakes largely of the nature of an honor conferred by tho congregation. Tho ladies who were made life mem? bers of tho Women's Missionary Society were Mrs. L. L. Greene, wife of tho de? ceased pastor for whom the church was named, Mrs. William Lind and Mrs. Dr. T. W.

Chief of Polico Morris yesterday re? ceived a communication from one J. T. Ford, of Columbia, S C, proposing tho establishment at Roanoko of a new and novel "industry." Ford, who wished to go into tho turkey-raffle business, said that ho understood that "kono and other strong games went" in Roanoke, and that no objection could be made to his raffling scheino. He olTered to "make it of interest" to tho chief if ho would lend him his support. Mr. Morris wrote a curt reply to tho lettor to tho clTect that Koanoko does not get turkeys in that way. Tho ohief was indignant at the propo? sition, and intimated that he would thrash tho party if he were to make it in person, lie characterizes as a lie the statement Ford makes as to "kono and other strong games" being in operation hero.

IN THE BAD 

LANDS. The Hostile Indians Moving Camp and Raiding Settlors. Omaha. Nob., Dec, 1.?[Special]?A lleo special from Pino Ridge agency says: The Indian police on duty a few hundred yards from the agency build? ings dashed into Agent Roger's office late Saturday night and said a panic In the camp of the friendless was inevita? ble unless they were given protection. All had received urgent invitation to join the hostilcs and go on the war path with thorn. Agent Rogorsont tliem an extra guard of 100 armed scouts hut oven this did little good. The Ijutian village continued melting away and the Sabbath morning revealed tho fact that over two-thirds of tho 3,000 who where hero at sunset had dis? appeared. Tho hostilcs have decided to move their camp into "Had hands" and there await the coming of the troops to cap? ture them. They began moving there yesterday morning ami by night all were hid away in that region, which tho best scouts described as being worse than the lava beds in which the Modocs took ?heiter. The bad lauds and an utterly barren region of preciptous canons and fantastic and ghastly formations. Pew white men arc acquainted with the region, the Indians, however, know? ing it thoroughly. The scouts that brought information concerning this latest plan of the hos? tilcs, said that the latter had just slaughtered live hundred head of goats and cattle, and three hundred belong? ing totlco. Mellette, of South Dakota. The scouts saw this beef being hauled in wagons and pack trains to the new camp in "Bad Lands.

I Washington, Dec. I.?The President's message was read in both houses of I Congress to day. I it advises the party to stand firm on : its tariff position and pass the federal [ election bill. The tirst live or six thousand words I are devoted to a resume of the reports ! of the different departments of the gov? ernment and to statements showing the ' peacufulness of the country at homo and abroad. Continuing the President then says : 1 congratulate* the Congress and tho country upon the passage at the first session of the Ififty-lirst Congress of an unusual number of laws of very high Importance That the results of this legislation will be the quickening and enlargement of our manufacturing in? dustries, larger and better markets for our breadstuffs and provisions, botli at I home and abroad, more constant* mploy j ment and better wages for our working ' people and an increased supply of a sato currency for tho transaction of business. : 1 do not doubt some of these measures ! were enacted at so late a period that tb?? beneficial effects upon commerce, which ; wore in the contemplation of Congress, , have as yet but partially manifested j themselves. The general trade and industrial oon j dition throughout the country during the year have shown a marked improver ; ment. ?Tho merchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our favor, but during that ye ar and tho year following they turned aAainst us. it is very gratifying to kntKV' that tho last fiscal year again chows a balance in our favor of 300,000,000. Tho production of pig iron, always a ' good guago of general prosperity, is I shown by a recent, census bulletin to I have been l?L' per cent, greater in 1800 I than in 18SP, and the production of steel ' \".i0 per cent, greater. Mining in coal I has had no limitation except that ru ' suiting from do lie lent transportation, i The general testimony is that labor is , everywhere fully employed, and the ro i ports of last year show a smaller num? ber of employes alVceted by strikes and lockouts than in any other year since 1884. The depression in the prices of agricultural products has boon greatly relieved and a buoyant and hopeful tono ! was beginning to le felt by all our ] people. I Those promising influences have been ! in some degree checked by the surpris ! lng and very unfavorble monetary events which have recently taken place : in England. It is gratifying to know that these did 1 not grow in any degrou out of the tinan i clal relations of London with our people i or out of any discredit attached to our ; securities held in that market. There turns of our bonds and stocks was caused by money Btingenoy in Kngland not by any loss of value or en dit in tho ~ euril ies themselves. 1 We could not, however, wholly escape : the ill effects of a foreign monetary agi J tation accompanied by such extraordin? ary incidents as characterized this. It ; is not believed, however, that these I evil incidents which have for the tttno unfavorably affected values In this ooun I try can long withstand the strong, ; sober and wholesome Influences w hich 1 are operating to give to oar peoplo ; profitable returns in till branches of ? legitimate traue and industry. The apprehension that our tariff mJ i again, and at once, he sui j. c. d to im I portunt general changes would undoubt ! i dly add a depressing Influence of tho ' most serious character. Tho general tariff act has only par | llally gone Into operation, some of ita ! important provisions being limited to i take i l'octat dates yet, in the future. ! 'I'hc general provisions of tho law have I been in forceless than sixty days. Its permanent effect upon trade and prices i still largely stand in conjecture. I^-1* curious to :oto that the advance in frfo I prices of articles wholly unall cted by j the tariff act was by many I asttly as ; uribed to that act. Notice- wu ? not taken i of the fact that the general tendency of i the market s was upward from Influences ! wholly apart from the recent tariff leg t islntion. The enlargement of our cur i rency 'by tho silver bill undoubtedly. . ' I gave an upward tendency trade and I had a marked effect in prlc . but, this I natural and desired effect oi tho silver , legislation was by many err- a ously at? tributed to tho tariff act. ' There is neither w isdom nor justice in tho suggestion that tin subject of tariti revision shall be again opened bo fore this law has had a fair trial; it ia quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections. , No bill was ever framed. I suppose, that in all of its rates and classifications had tho full approval, e ven ,.f u party caucus. Such legislation is always ana necessarily tho product of compromise* j as to details, and tho present law is nt> ? I exception. Hut in ltsgoni ral .cope ami ? etfect I think it will justify the support 1 of thoso who believe that Amerioan.
