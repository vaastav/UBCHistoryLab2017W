COMMENTS OF MESSAGE. Candidate Docker)- Says the President Omitted Important Points. Macon, Mo., Dec. 0. -'The presi dent's message is adroit in what it did not nay," remarked Congressman A. M. Dokery to a small erowd in Itailroad Commissioner MH'ulley's office this afternoon. "There is much said about the iu fariou.s trusts anl monopolies and a uniformity of state legislation sug gested to control them, but the great breeder of trusts, a high protective tariff and husiin-ss monopolies will be largely imp issible. With our great inventive ami productive ener gy we must have enlarged foreign trade relations or lalr will remain idle and our products unsold. I believe to-day we are upon the threshold of one of the brightest busi ness eras of our history, but to reap the harvest to its fullest extent w must remove obstructive taxation increase t he volume of silver money and remove the taxes from the shoul ders of the small property owner and place it upon incomes and lai jre es tates. I see the president proposes to rivet the gold standard to tli mast head and advocates further grants of power to national banks In reply to that we will go la-fore the people advocating u lower tariff; op position to imperialism, reiterate the monetary plank of the Chicago con vent ion a n 1 ilemantl commercial ex pansion in its fullest am broadest Bense.

P.oth at the time of their appoint ment, he said, lived in a state of po- lygamy. and although the president was urged to recall their appoint ments, and the senate requested to reject them, both were confirmed and given office lerause there were no court record to prove that they were guilty of crime. In speaking of these cases Mr. Rob erts said to the Post-Dispatch core spondent: "When those two men were non.i- Il!,twl I""tests were filed against them on the ground that they were living with plural wives. These protests were supporreu uy arn.iavits trom tlie sectarian sources from which came the protests niel against me.

Regarding the report that the gov ernor might appoint him to fill Utah's vacant seat in the senate, Mr. Rob erts said: 'The rumor is entirely without nomination. 1 lie governor is a re- publican and is not eveil my personal Mr- Koliprt said that he would in person conduct his case before the house committee of investigation. lTless public opinion forces the door to l,e ojen the hearing of witnesses is t tie private.
