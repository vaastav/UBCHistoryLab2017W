1i ASHEY1LLE CITIZEN. JORDAN STONE, S-lMTOKi. J. D. CAMERON, ) FRIDAY MORNING, DEC. 9, 1SS7. It is said in the Washington po litical circles that eleven of the Ran dall following Iiavc been converted to Carlisle, and that the opposition to tariff leduction is decreasing every day. Subsequently to this report the President's message comes out. It is a p'unner, and he will be a headstrong bigot who re sists its torce. Now let us rach the internal revenue law. It seems clear that Mr. Carlisle will not again act as obstructionist to the admission of th legislation looking to the repeal or modification of a law most generally offensive and oppressive. The intimations are that at least some of the most ob jectionable features will be stricken out. 'i The prohibitionists have scored oca victory.. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the Iowa prohibition law as constitu tion. The question came up partly on the question raised by the brewers that their property by force of the prohibition law, had been taken from them without com pensation, in other words that build ings erected for a speeial purpose had lost their uses and became val ueless. On this point the court says : 'The State of Kansas had prohib ited the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away the property o: the breweries. It simply auated a nuisance. Tho property is not ta ken., from its owners. They are only prohibited from vising it for the specific purpose which to Legisla ture declared to be injurious to the community. And it may be added that this decision is another enunciation of the doctrine of State sovereignty assailed by Republicans in solid column, the maintenance of which is essential to the perpetuity of tree institutions. We are happy to ?f e it at last recognized by the highest tribunal in the land. 

STATE FINANCES. From the Raleigh correspondence of the Petersburg Index-Appeal, ve obtain the followiug information : The sensitiveness of capital has recently Vsen demonstrated by the sale in this citv, on Friday last, ol 812,000 four per cent. North Caro lina bonds at ninety-five cents in the dollar This is doubtless the result of the recent decisions of Judge Bond in the drummers' ii sense case, but there really is no cause for the least uneasines. A plain statement of the finances ol the State should be sufficient to dispel any doubts whatever as to the ability of the Treasurer to meet all demands. The estimates of the fiscal vearsl887-'SS were based upon a total tar valuation of $202,000,000 at 23 cents on the hundred dollars. This, with the various special taxes, would have made the total resources for the present fiscal year $792,997" 06. At the time the Treasurer made his estimates it was supposed that the Legislature would reduce tax on land from 25 to 23 cent?, but it was scaled down to 20 cents. On this basis, the estimates would fall short of meeting all libilities of the State general and special. Fortu nately, however, the tax valuation of property in the State has increas ed, accordiug to the last sssesment, to $209,000,000, upon which at 2.) cents per hundred dollars reduction, a tax of $418,000 will be derd, which by the various special taxos will be increased to $773,627,OG. the estimated expenses for the fiscal year ending December 1, 1888, are $697,050. This includes eyerything for which the State will be liable for the year, including all interest on the public debt. Ihis wiil leave a balance in the Treasury of $75, 977.09, at the close ot the year. Add to this sum $95,000 on hand at the close of the year 18S7, and there will be at the close ot 1888, $170, 977.06. Deduct the $80,( 00 which may probably be lost to the State by reason of Judge rsond s decision in the drummers tax case, there will still still be a balance on hand of $90,077.06. In addition to this fa vorable outlook, the State has re cently bought in $300,000 of her bonds, and H there should appear the most remote signs of a shortage the public Treasurer has ample artbority to sell them, which he could easily do at first rate prices There re but few, if any, ;f the States ot the South on a soundsr fi nancial basi3 than North Carolina, and none that will meet all oi-iiga-i i it m ra or.wnptly. 

EFFECTS OF THE PRESI DENT'S MESSAGE. The following embrace some of the opinions expressed on the mas terly message of Mr. Cleveland : All of the leading Democrats in the Senate and House who were spoken to on the subject expreised themselves as being fully in accord with the President's views on the tariff. Senator Ransom pronounced the message an admirable paper worthy of the great man who pen ned it. Although the President does not go so far on the subject of internal revenue as North Caroli nians would have desired, yet they are willing to accept the suggestions he has made an evidence of good faith and a brighter prospect in the luture. lie has recommended no radical reduction of taxation, but he has placed the entire subject be fore Congress and the people in such a plain and unmistakable lorm that he Icavm Congress no altera tive but to reduce taxation. The liepubiicans showed clearly that the message made a profound impression upon them by its frank and maulv tone. They evidently did not expect such a strong docu ment, !o they immediately con eluded to try and break the force of the arcurrent it contained by ridiculing it Senator Hawley, of Connecticut..an aspirant for Presiden tial honors, said : "If the Demo cratic party wants to nuke its next national light on the message the Republicans will be pleased to meet them on that i?sue. It is trashy and weak and coutains only a mass of stale and exploded ideas." Other Republicans characterized it as a rehash of old ideas without a now feature or sug-estson. Others said it was inferior to many free trade speeches delivered in Congress and on the stump. Some went so far as to say lh . President begged the question at issue, and treated a great national issue as a schoolboy would his first composition. Enjoy L.ife. What a truly beautiful worl.l we liva in!
