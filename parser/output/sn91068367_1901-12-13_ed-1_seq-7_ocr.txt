There are forty prisoners in Jail here and all came near escaping. The negro convicts, with a murderer named Fos ter as their leader, cut several bars in one cell Sunday afternoon while they were singing to drown the noise of the saws. Their attempt was discovered lyesterday and they were moved into an other cell, while a bar and an extra heavy lock were put oa the door be tween their cell and the one from which they had nearly cut the bars. They last night filed bar and lock in two in order to get into the cell in which they had done sg much work. They were searched yesterday and two saws, two cold chisels and a. hammer were found. iToday they were again searched and two more files and hammers were found. They attempted to mutiny when ordered to go into separate cells and be searched, and one swore he would die first and threatened the sheriff, who tamed him by a heavy blow on the head. Policemen aided in handling the prisoners. It is quite evident that negroes out side the jail pass saws and other imple ments into the jail at night, by getting over the low iron fence between the postoffice yard and the jail yard. A high fence will be put there. The ring leaders in the trouble are now heavily ironed. Foster is here for safe keeping. He broke out of Louisburg jail.

Raleigh, N. C, December 10. Last September Maggie Thompson, a negro woman of marked size and strength, serving a 2-years term for burglary in Lenoir county, which she committed while dressed in man's clothing, escaped from the penitentiary here in a sensa tional way. She was working in the penitentiary garden, and while the guard was not watching she stepped into the woods a few yards away. She had stolen a suit of clothes from an other guard and wore these under her female garments. She cast oft the lat ter and fled out of the woods. Search near and far was unavailing until last night, when she was found to be a cook for a prominent family here. When the officers arrived she locked the door and it had to be forced. She then made a desperate fight before capture. She has committed many crimes, masquerading as a man, and has served one term be fore. She is back in the penitentiary to finish her lorg term.

TI1C DISPENSE CLOSES ItH Evidence In the onine--vyren .Murder Trial. Washington, December 10. Three medical experts gave testimony today at the trial of Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine, all going to show the alleged close range at which the fatal shots were fired. Dr. Sterling Ruffin testified that the chest I wound inflicted on Ayres must have been from a shot fired when the pistol was from five to eight inches distance from the body. Drs. Carr and Bovee also gave testimony along the same lines showing the results or experi ments designed to prove the close rang at which the fatal shots must have been fired. WTien recess was taken it was expect ed that all the testimony would be in by adjournment this afternoon. Deputy Coroner Glazbrook and morgue keeper Schoenberger were ex amined at the afternoon session. Their testimony was unimportant. The defense then announced its side closed. The prayers of both sides will be sub mitted tomorrow and the case probably will go to the jury Thursday or Friday morning.

DIRTY SENATORIAL LINEN WASHED BEFORE THE PUBLIC BY SOUTH CAROLINA'S SENATORS. SENATOR JONES TAKES A HAND Senator McLanrln Arises to a Ques tion of Personal Privilege and Complains of Attempt to Read Him Out of Democratic Party Senator Tillman Challengers Hlm to a Joint Resignation Senator Hoar Sag Bests that Doth Seats are Vacant by Reason of the Resignation of Last Spring; Washington. December 9 The senate chamber was the scene of a highly dramatic episode today when Senator Tillman, of South Carolina, challenged his colleague. Senator McLaurln, to re sign with him on the spot in order,' to use his own language, that they might be able "to wash their dirty linen at home " Senator McLaurin did not take up the gauge. ine exciting clash between the two senators today was the direct sequel of the very bitter controversy which arose between them in South Carolina last spring. Senator McLaurin arose to a question of personal privilege today and pro ceeded to explain what he charged was a conspiracy to discredit him in his own state for acts and views which did not meet the approval of certain demo cratic leaders. He declared that he was being humiliated and. according to pub lic print, was to be excluded from the democratic caucus because he had acted upon certain public issues in a way which he considered was for the best interests of the country and the people of his state. He announced himself a believer in the old democracy, and, af ter denouncing the new democratic leaders, who, he said, had brought de struction upon the party, declared that he could not be driven from his old allegiance into a party with which he did not care to affiliate. Senator McLaurin's statement drew the fire of Senator Jones, chairman of the democratic national committee, who denied he had any "ulterior motives" in not inviting Senator McLaurin to nter the caucus. From Senator Tillman it brought forth a review of the whole controversy, in the course of which Senator Hoar took occasion to express the opinion that it was very doubtful whether both the South Carolina seats in the senate were not in reality vacant. He con tended that when the resignations were offered last spring to the governor they could not thereafter be withdrawn, but that they became immediately opera tive. He cited a precedent and sug gested, that the committee on privil eges and elections should look into the matter. The climax came when Senator Till man challenged Senator McLaurin to join with him in preparing their joint resignations and handing them to the presiding officer of the senate. This challenge, however, Senator McLaurin did not accept and the episode was brought to an abrupt close by a motion of Senator Lodge that the senate go into executive session. At the conclusion of the morning business there was something of a stir in the chamber when Senator McLaurin of South Carolina, arose to a question of personal privilege. He had before him a huge pile of manuscript. "I arise to a question of personal privilege in connection with the published state ment that I am excluded from partici pation in the democratic party," he an nounced- With evidence of considerable emotion he proceeded to explain that if such was the case and if he was to be without assignment upon committees the right of his state which he in part represented in the senate would suffer. The personal effect of an exclusion from representation on committees, he said, was not of so much importance as its effect upon the state of South Carolina. The only notice he had ever had, he said, that he was to be excluded from the democratic caucus came last spring before the adjournment of the senate when he was accosted by -the chairman of the democratic national committer in the cloak room and asked why he no longer attended the democratic cau cuses. Senator McLaurin said he had replied that in view of his opinion of the questions growing out of the Span ish war he thought that his presence might be embarrassing. The demo cratic chairman had replied: "Then perhaps, it would be less embarrassing to you not to be invited to the caucus?" Senator McLaurin said he had re plied: 'Certainly." This incident Senator McLaurin de clared was the culmination of a long series of events in a contest waged by an element of the democratic party against him. By this time the entire senate was in terested. Several republicans crossed the political aisle to the democratic side in order to better listen to what Sena tor McLaurin had to say. Continuing. Senator McLaurin said he would be silent, did he not fear that the movement against him was one to keep alive sectionalism. For many years the people of the south had realized that they had not obtained their fair share of the national benefits. Senator McLaurin recalled the fact that although Samuel J. Randall had advocated a protective tariff he had been voted for in a democratic natipnal convention for president. Hancock, al though he declared that the tariff was a local Issue, had been nominated for president and David B. Hill although he opposed the income tax had not been read out of the democratic party. The holding of such views by north ern men. no matter how diverse, did not endanger the position of certain political leaders, and, consequently, they were immune from attack; but when a southern man, said Senator Mc Laurin. tried to get the benefit of the . : Jkr UI. 1 . I. n n - . 1 : . I and humiliate him. He had contended that if the tariff was a robbery his section should share in the booty. Upon the issue of that speech he had. later, gone into a campaign in South Carolina and although his democracy had been attacked upon the stump, the people of his state had endorsed him. He de clared that during that campaign "calumny, falsehood and trickery" never before equaled in American poli tics had been employed, and now the principal charge against him was that during the McKinley administration he had been ''bought by patronage." and that he had renewed his former con tract with President Roosevelt. Entertaining the high personal regard that he did for both the late president and his successor. Senator McLaurin said it would be unnecessary for him to say that neither would stoop to so ig- noble an act. It was true that an unfor tunate condition of affairs had existed in his state, and that he had recom mended good men for office, because he did not desire to see a repetition of the horrible affair at Lake City, when a negro postmaster had been burned to death. He had voted for the war with Spain and declared that in the same spirit in which he had cast that vote he fflt that he was compelled to sup port the administration that conducted It He still thought that the condition of the war should have been non-partisan and during its progress he had never heard from President McKinley's lips a word concerning party advantages-Senator McLaurin paid a high tribute to th te pre. ilct.t vlrr.i he clu:rac terized as a "broad statesman anJ Christian gentleman." Senator Mclaurin said that he had no official knowledge of the charge brought agairst him by his democratic col leagues, but that from the newspapers he understood that the principal charges were trat he had not opposed the nUilic&tlon of the treaty of peace with Spain; ihat he had upheld the ad ministration in its efforts to restore or der in the Philippines and to that end had voted for an increase in the stand ing army and that he was in favor of the upbuilding of the American mer chant marine. "If these are the only charges," said he dramatically, "they are true and I dory in them." He said he had not wished to vote against his party upon the ques tion of ratifying the peace treaty and had it not been for the re-opening of nosunues in the Philippines he would have deferred to the opinion of his col leagues; but hi declared "the dictates of reason and conscience should not be stifled by the the party lash." Witn bitter words Senator McLaurin then proceeded to excoriate the new leaders of the democracy who. he said, had guHed the party through its de struction during the last six years and who were trying to crucify those who would seek to draw the democratic party back to its old allegiance. That party, he declared, had always been triumphant except when the sectional issue was raised. He still proposed, he said, to vote in his judgment for what ne beiieved to be along the lines of democratic principles, but he did not propose to place himself against a pron- osition he believed to be for the best in terest of the people simply because it was advocated by republicans. In conclusion Mr. McLaurin said he did not propose to be driven from his party nor to be forced into affiliation with the party with which he did not care to ally himself, and that on great puoiic question he would act accord ing to the dictates of his own con- ecience and the best judgment. When Senator McLaurin took his seat Senator Jones, of Arkansas, took tne floor to make a statement. Some of the statement made by Senator Mc Laurin, Senator Jones said, he consid ered a reflection upon himself and he desired to offer a statement concerning tne incident to which Senator McLaurin had referred. At the extra session of the senate last spring he had been asked by the caucus officer for the list of senators who were to be summoned to a caucus and Senator MrTnrtn's name being mentioned, he (Jones) had said he would himself see the senator from South Carolina. "I met him in the cloak room, said Senator Jones. 'and recalling the fact that he had not attended a democratic caucus for more than two years, I asked him what his status was. He replied that his rela tions with the party were such that he thought it would be embarrassing for him to enter the democratic caucus. I then said to him: 'You do not wish to be Invited then.' and he replied 'Cer tainly.' As to the charge of ulterior motive on rry part. I am content to treat it with the contempt it deserves. it is a notorious fact which every one seems to understand except the senator from South Carolina, that there has been no democratic caucus at this ses sion of congress. I have no hesitancy, however, in saying that in a recent conversation with a leading member on the other ride I said to him that I did not think the democratic caucus could undertake to provide committee as signments for the senator from South Carolina. Senator Tillman, of South Carolina, was on his feet when Senator Jones concluded. In his characteristic .way he announced that while his name had not been mentioned he realized that he was the cause of it all. He said he would not at this time make an ex tended reply Briefly, then, he reviewed the controversy between himself and Senator McLaurin, which led to the joint tender of their resignations to the governor of South Carolina last spring. and told of the governor's suggestion that the resignations be withdrawn. Senator Tillman said he contended that the governor was simply "a box into which we had put letters for the legislature," and that they could not undo their act, but that Senator Mc Laurin has hastened to withdraw his letter. Senator Tillman said he ex amined the record and of about 200 cases in the history of the government where senators had resigned. Senator McLaurin enjoyed the enviable distinc tion of being the only one who had withdrawn his resignation after offer ing it. As to Senator McLaurin's charge of conspiracy to humiliate him by barring him from the democratic caucus. Sena tor Tillman called attention to the fact that he had not been in Washington during the extra session of the senate last spring. "This conspiracy." he said, "is a dream conjured up by him. It Is a creation of his own brain." In conclusion Mr. Tillman with a sweep of his arm, adjured his demo- sT)Hr mlloa rrnpq not tO "fret" abOUt the charge that they were conspiring to discredit Senator McLaurin at home because "his crowd was demoralized, cowed and whipped." Senator McLaurin made no reply to Senator Tillman, but he arose for a mo ment to reply to Senator Jones, to say that he did not desire that there should be anything personal in his charge that there has been an "ulterior purpose" in anything he had done. "I thought I was justified in saying what I did." said he. "I accept his disclaimer." "I disclaim nothing," retorted Senator Jones without rising from his seat. I simply contradicted." "I thank the senator for his courte sy." observed Senator McLaurin bow ing with mock deference, as he took his seat. , Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, ad- rirpssmi himself to the legality of the J resignations, which the South Car olina senators had sent tc the gov ernor of their state. He declared that the resignation of a legislative of fice vacates the office at once, and that he doubted whether such resignations could be withdrawn. He said that SDeaker Blaine bad so held upon one occasion m tre house, contrary o the IlPgllsh notion '.hat 1 lecislat'v nfice cannot be resigned. He said that a mi n could not be kept in office against his will and raised a laugh by observing that in his opinion neither of the South Carolina senators had a right to ad dress the senate if the statements made by Senator Tillman were correct. In reply to this sally Senator Tillman said he had himself been of the same opinion, although he was not & lawyer and in withdrawing his resignation from the governor of the state he had, added that he withdrew it "if it was lawful to do so," He suggested that the judiciary committee should look into the matter as he should enjoy nothing so much as washing the dirty linen at home. Jumping to his feet Senator McLaurin declared, in ringing tones, that he was ready to meet his colleague at any place or at any time for the discussion of the issues between them. Thereupon In the most dramatic fash ion. Senator Tillman challenged his col league to resign on the spot. "Let us draw up the papers now." said he. "and tender them to this man." pointing with outstretched arm toward the presiding officer, "and that will settle it." All eyes were turned upon Senator McLaurin. as Senator Tillman paused as if waiting for his colleague to accept the challenge, but Senator McLaurin although looking him steadily in the eye did not rise from his seat or make reply. Senator Hoar again took the floor and explained in detail the occasion upon which Speaker Blaine had held that a resignation immediately vacated a seat in the house. A resolution for the ex pulsion of a member from South Caro lina was about to be voted upon and the member, knowing that the resolu tion would be adopted, sent his resig nation to the chair with the Intention of addressing the house and then offer ing it before the vote on the resolution was taken. As soon as Speaker Blaine saw the nature ot the communication sent to him he immediately declared the seat vacant, thus putting an end to all further proceedings. Senator Hoar contended that if the facts bearing upon the case of the South Carolina senators had been correctly stated it was doubtful whether they were entitled to seats upon the floor of the senate at this time. He thought the committee on r-;" ip and elec tions should Inquire Into the matter. Senator Tillman said he was glad that his own legal instinct had been backed up by such an eminent authority as the chairman of the judiciary committee. If his colleague would prepare any doc ument that would vacate his seat as well as his (Tillman's) he would be gla J to sign it. As long as he represented the people on the floor, he said in con clusion, he proposed to represent them honestly and not in a fashion which was a disgrace to his state. Senator Lodge at this point arose and announced with a smile on his face that while the resignations were preparing he would move that the senate go into executive session. The motion was car ried. After half an hour behind closed doors the senate adjourned. Till:

Fleshman, cashier of the Farmers and Merchants' bank, of this city, has dis appeared with a sum of the bank's money which vice president H. W. Hell man estimates at $100,000. The short age was discovered today. Fleshman has not been seen since 9 o'clock Saturday morning- At that hour he was at the club. He notified the bank people that he was ill Satur day morning and would not be at his desk. Nothing was thought of th matter at that time. When he failed to report today his accounts were examined and the short age was discovered. The exact amount has not vet been ascertained. Fleshman has been cashier and assistant cashier of the Farmers and Merchants' bank for many years. He began work for the bank when a bov in 1S75. He was un der bond with a surefy company for $30,000. In addition to this, he has real estate and personal property In this city sufficient. In the opinion of Mr. Hellman, to protect the bank from the loss of a dollar. Fleshman married the daughter of A. J. Harrell, a wealthy cattle-man. of Visalia, but was divorced sometime ago. He was a man of 42 years of age. The Farmers and Merchants' bank, of which I. W. Hellman, is president and H- W. Hellman is vice president, is the oldest and strongest bank In southern California. Its capital is $300,000. with a surplus of $1,000,000 and deposits of $5. 500.000. H- W. Hellman said of the missing cashier: "Fleshman had no valid excuse for taking the money. He has property enough to realize the amount he had taken from the bank. He was always considered a man of simple habits and unimpeachable integrity. We are at a complete loss to account for his action. The bank is amply protected and will not lose a cent. We have not the slightest idea of his whereabouts. It Is probable that he left Saturday after telephoning the bank that he would not be down. Of course, with such a start it may be some time before he is lo cated." , If you would have an appetite like a bear and a relish for your meals take Chamberlain's Stomach and Liver Tab lets. , They correct disorders of the stomach and regulate the liver and bowels.
