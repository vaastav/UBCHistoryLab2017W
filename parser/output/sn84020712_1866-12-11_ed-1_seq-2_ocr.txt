Senators an id lie- , whose people had ! rion eould be completed, and mission to Congress of loyal pre6entatives from the States whose peopl icbelled against the lawful authority ofthe! General Government. This question devolved j upon the respective Houses, which, by the Con- j ttituiion, are made the judges of the elections, j returns, and qualifications ol their own member?; : and its consideration at once engaged the alien- j tion oi' Congress. j Jn the meantime, the Executive Department j - no other rlan having beeu i ro;oscd by Con- grcss continued its efforts to perfect as far as j was pi utui-auii , me- i imui ai lull ui i.uc ; relations between the citizens ofthe respective Ptatts and the Federal Government, extending, j from tioie to time, as the public interests seemed j to require, me juaiciai. revenue, anu posiai sys- j terns of the country. With the advice and con- j sent of the Senate, the necessary officers were ' appointed, and appropriations made by Congress j for the payment of their salaries. The propo- ! pition to amend tho Federal Constitution, so as j to prevent the cxistenco of slavery within the j Uuitcd States or any place subject to their ju- risdiction, was ratified iy the requisite number ; cf States; and on the ISth day of December, 1SG5, it was officially declared ro have becntne valid as a part of the Constitution of the lnu- these States remain as they are. the right of rep ted States. All of the States in which the in- j resentation will be no stronger the right of ex- furrection had existed promptly amended their ; Constitutions, so as to make them conform to i the gteat change thus effected in the organic law c f the land declared null and void all or-1 all i dinances atid aws of secession; repudiated pretended debts and obiigationa created for the I revolutionary purposes ot the insurrection; and , proceeded, iu good faith, to the enactment of j measures tor t lie ptotection and amelioration of fbe condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation; and it was not until towards the close cfihe eighth month ofthe session that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Seuators ood Representatives. I deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus for failed to admit to seafs loyal Senators and Representative from the other States, whose inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten States more than one-fourth of the whole num ber remain without representation; the seats of fifty members in the House of Representa tives and .of twenty members iu the Senate are yet vacant not by thtir own consent, not by a failure of election, but by tho refusal ol Con gress to accept their credentials. Thtir admis sion, it is believed, would have accomplished much towards the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discouteut on the part of the inhabi tants of those States. It would have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the Dec laration cf Annrican Independence, that no people ouyht to bear the burden of taxation, od yet be denied the right of representation. It would have been io consonance with the ex press provisions of the Constitution, that '-each 6tate shall have at least one repnscntative," and "'that no State without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal euffiage in the Senate." These provisions were intended to secure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the framersof the Constitution that the equality ofthe States in the Senate should be preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Cousti tuiion can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice io that branch of the National Legislature. It is true, it has been assumed that the exis- tence of the States was terminated by the rebel- nuut acta ui iucu muaunnnis, ami uiai Uie insur rection Laving beeu 6tippiessed, they were thence forward to le considered merely as conquered territories. The Legislative, Executive, and Ju dicial departments of the government have, how ever, with great distinctness and uniform consis tency, refused to sanction an assumption so in compatible with the nature of our republican sys tem, and with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that thes ten political communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the very com inanceinent of the rebellion, each House declared, vith a unanimity as remarkable .as jt wa -aignifi- I cant, that the war 7as not 44 waged, upon our pari, ' j in auv spirit of oppression, nor tor any purpose of r r.:. ...:.k .t.i .

If tho admis sion of loyal members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress w as wis and expedient one year ago, it is no less wish and expedient now. If this anomalous condition is right now if, in the ' exact condition of these States at the present timi, it is lawful to exclude them from represen I tation, I do not see that the question will bf chan ; red bv the efilux of time. Ten years hence, if elusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of the Uni ited States makes it , tne uuty oi in l'resiueiit to recorninena to tn t iYwiitMi'n t inn i f ( if. cm 4iirli mMiiruc 144 hr shall jiidge necessary or expedient." I know of (!Very consideration of national interest, sound policy and equal justice, than tho admission of loyal immbers from the now unrepresented Sta- tes. 1 his would consummate the work of resto- ration. and exert a most salutory influence in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and frater nal feeling. It would tend grently to renew tho confidence of the American peoplo in the vigor and stability of their institutions. It would bind i us more closely together as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recup erative power of a Government founded upon the will of tin' people, and establishrd upon the prin ciples of liberty, justice, und iutelligei.ee. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would i: refragabiy demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government. The admission of loyal members from the States m'W excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into the channel of trade and in dustry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of those States, and, by inducing emi- gratimi. aid in the settlement or fertile regions uncultivated, and lead to an inereasedoro- .. .. . . . now uucnouoi inose staples wincn nave anuea so greatly to the wealth of the nition and the com merce of the world.

Wcalf folt nni I : i. m in iif iiijrirr. m uiatiuK ., m . pmressed expressed my general views upon these subjects. I need now only call attention to the necessity of carrying into every department of the Govern ment a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment and wise economy. With no ex ceptional nor unusual expenditures, the oppres sive burdens of taxation can be lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as will be con sistent with the public faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the fiscal year ending the 3Uth June, 18G5. the last 3-ear of the war, the public debt was increased $941,902,537, and on the 31st of October, 18G5. it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 3lst of October, 1S0G, it had been reduced to $2,551, 310.006, the diminution, during a period of four teen months, commencing September 1, 1805. and ending October 31, I860, having been $206,379. 565. In the last annual report on the state of the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters of the fiscal -ear ending the 30th of June last, the debt would be increased $112,194,947. During that period, however, it was reduced $31, 196.387. the receipts of the year having been $89.905. 905 more, and the expenditures $200, 529,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statesments the extent and availability cf the national resources, and the rapidity and safety with which, under our form of government, great military and naval es tablishments can be disbanded, and expenses re duced from a war to a peace footing. During the fiscal year ending the 30th of June. 1866. the receipts were $558,032,620, and the ex penditures $520,750,940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that the expendi tures will reach the sum of $316,328,078. leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158.633 308. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1863, it is estima ted that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the expenditures will be $350,247,641 showing an excess of $85,752,356 in favor of the Government. These estimated receipts may be diminished by a reduction of excise and import duties; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in popu lation and wealth, and yet the debt be extinguished within the next quarter of a century. The report of the Secretary of War furnishes valuable and important information iu reference to the operations of his Department during the past year. Few volun teers now remain in th service, and they are being dis charged as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops. The army has been promptly paid, carefully provided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be furnished with breech-lc-ading small arms. The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the discharge of volunteers, the disposition of unserviceable or perishable 6tores, and the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war mate rial to meet any emergency has been retained, and frwin the disbanded volunteers standing ready to re spond to the national call, large armies can be rapidly orgauized. equipped and concentrated. Fortifications ou the coasts and frontier have received, or are being prepared for more powerful armaments; lake surveys and harbor and river improvements are in course of en ergetic prosecution. Preparations have been made for the payment ofthe additional bounties authorized dur ing the recent session of Congress, under such regula tions as w ill prot- ct the Government from fraud, and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received arti ficial limbs or other surgical apparatus; and forty-oue national cemetries. containing the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military appropriations is $25,05,669. It is stated iu the report of the Secretary of the Navy that the naval force at this time consists of two hundred and seventy-eight vessels, armed with two thousand three hnudred and fifty-one guns. Of these, one hun dred and fifteen vessels, earning one thousand and twenty-nine guns, are in commission, distributed chiefly among seven squadrons. The number of men in the service' is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great activ ity aDd vigilance have been displayed by all the squad rons and their movements have been judiciously and fficieutly arranged in such manner as would best pro mote American commerce, and protect the rights and interests of our countrymen' abioad. The vessels nn employiMl are undergoing repairs, or are laid up until their services may be required. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until decisive action should be taken by Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as the most eligible location for that class of vessels. It is important that a suitable public station should be pro- viaeu ior uie iron-clad fleet. It is intended that these Vt'8s?Js. shall be iu proper condition for any em. rgency, arm it k ltir!.l'i. tla ...,K;n .f; i nnA Inland and it is desirable that the bill accepting League Island I for naval purposes by the House of Representatives at its last session, should receive final action at an early j period, iu order that there may be a suitable public sta- ti in fiir tl.to ,.C . ..l.. 11 ... .... f , .in, ui t:sei, as wen as a uhvv-iij ui area sufficient for the wants ofthe service, on the Dela- - rr. t . . . - ware river. The r.aval Pension fund amounts to 1 1 750,000, having been increased $2,750,000 during the year. The expenditures of the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June last were $4-!.324t526, and the estimates for the coming year amount to $ ia.568,436. Attention is invited to the coudition of our seamen, and the importance of legislative measures for their relief 10 repon oi tne rostmastcr General presents a most satis,actory condition of the postal service, and submits recommendations which deserve the consideration of Coll&rt.ss. The revenues of the Department for the congress, i ne revenues ot the Department yar ending June 30, 186, were $ 1 4V$Sb9J-6, and the expenditures $15,352,079, showing an excess of the latter of $905,093. In anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropriation was made by Congress the act approved July '26, 1C.H3. Including the standing appropriation of $700,000 for free mail matter. as a legitimate portion of the revenues vet reinainincr "Hv aC",al -'''T-3. 1.r. r F1 year 13 only $bT,093 a sum within $51,141 of the amount estimated in the annual report of JWH. The- decrease of revenue comparvd with the previous year was one and one-fifth per cent, and the increase of expenditures. ntrmir nnncimllv tn thp ml.nnn,linl nf )!, ...il vice in the South, was twelve per cent. On the 30th of June last there were in operation six thousand nine Hundred ana tinny n,au routes, with an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty thousand nine hun- its steady extension in the Southern States indicates their conftantly improving condition. The growing importance of the foreign service also merits attention. The Post Office Department of Great Britain and our own have aTeed upon a preliminary basis for a new Postal Convention, which it is believed will proTe eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction ofthe international letter postage to one-half the exist iijf rates; a reduction of postage with all other countries toana from which correspondence is transmitted iiv the British mail, or in closed mails through the United Kingdom; the establishment of uniform and reasonable charges for tlie sea aud territorial transit of correspon dence in closed mails; and an allowance to each Post Office Department of the right to use all mail commu nications established under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence, either in open or I closed mails, on the same terms as those applicable to ' the inhabitants of the country providing the means of ; transmission. j The report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits j the condition of those branches of the public service ( which are committed to his supervision During the i last fiscal year, four million six hundred and twenty- j nine thousand three hundred and tw elve acres of public land were disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninetv-two thousand five hundred and sixteen acres ot j which were entered under the homestead act. tne policy originally adopted relative to the pub'ic lands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate rev enue, aud not their rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature of our land system. Long experience and ear nest discussion have resulted in the conviction that the early development of our agricultural resources, and the diffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory, are objects of far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity than the proceeds ofthe sale ofthe land to the highest bidder in open market The pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of 'unoffert d lands" at the minimum price. The homestead enactments relieve the settler from the navment of purchase money, and secure him a permanent home, upon the condition of residence for a term of years. This liberal policy in vites emigration from the old, and from the more crowd ed portions of the new w orld. Its propitious results are undoubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development. Congress has made liberal grants of public lands to corporations, in aid ofthe construction of railroads and other internal improvements. Should this policy here after prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title to the lands should not pass by patent or otherwise, but remain iu the Government and subject to its con trol until some portion of the road has been actually built. Portions of them might then, from time to time, be conveyed to the corporation, but never iu a greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire length ofthe pro jected improvement. This restriction w ould not oper ate to the prejudice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw fiom mailt. t the lauds falling within the operation of such grants, and thus to exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse right. A breach ofthe conditions which Congress may deem proper to impose should work a forfeiture of claim to the lauds so withdrawn but uncouveyed, and of little to the lauds conveyed which remain unsold. Operations on the several lines ot the Pacific Railroad have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and suc cess. Should no unforeseen causes of delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughfare will be completed before the expiration of the period designated by Congress. During the last fiscal year the amount paid to pen sioners, including the expenses of disbursement, was $13,459,190; and 50,177 names w ere added to the pen sion rolls. The entire number of pensioners, June 30, 18;i6. was 120,7:22. This fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the Federal GeVernment, aud to maintain inviolate the integrity ofthe Union. They impose, upon us corresponding obligations. It is esti mated that $33,000,000 will be required to meet the exi gencies of this branch of the service during the next fiscal year. Treaties have been concluded with the Iudians who, enticed into armed oppositiouto our Government at the outbreak of the rebellion, have unconditionally sub mitted to our authority, aud manifested an earnest de sire for a renewal of friendly relations. During the year ending September 30, lSf6, eight thousand seven hundred and sixteen patents tor useful inventions und designs were issued, and at that date the balance in the Treasury to the credit of the Patent fund was $8,297. As a subject upon which depends an immense amount ofthe production and commerce oi the country, I re commend to Congress such legislation as may be neces sary for the preservation' of the levees ofthe Mississippi river. It is a matter of national importance that early steps should be, taken not only to add to the efficiency of these barriers against destructive inundations, but for the removal of all ol.triu tions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. The District of Columbia, under existing laws, is not entitled to that representation in the National Councils w hich, from our earliest history, has been uniformly ac corded to each Territory established from time to time within our limits. It maiutains peculiar relations to Congress, to whom the Constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat of government. Our fellow-citizens residing in the District, w hose interests are thus confided to the special guardianship of Congress, exceed in number the popu lation of several of our Territories, and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of their choice should not be admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives. No mode seems so appropriate aud effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar coudition and wants, and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I therefore recommend the passage of a law authorizing the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a delegate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a delegate representing a Territory. The increasing enterprise and rapid progress of improvement in the District are highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts of the municipal authorities to promote the pros perity of the national metropolis will receive the efficient and generous co-opeiation of Congress. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture re views the operations of his Department during the past year, and asks the aid of Congress in its efforts to en courage those States which, scourged by war. are now earnestly engaged in the reorganization of domestic in dustry. It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign com binations against cur domestic peace and safety, or our legitimate influence, among the nations, have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of reconcilia tion, loyalty, and patriotism have increased at home, a more just consideration of our national character aud rights has beeu manifested by foreign nations. Tin; entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph between the coast ol Ireland and the Province of Newfoundland, is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the opening of an era in the pro gress of civilization. Theie is reason to expect that equal success will attend, and even greater results fol low, the enterprise for connecting the two Continents through the Pacific Ocean by the projected line of tele graph between Kamschatda and tho Russian posses sions iu America. The resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign Governments of persons convicted of in fa mous offences, on condition of emigration to our coun try, has been communicated to the States w ith which we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of complain: on our part, has not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of j Russia, upon his escape from attempted assassination, j have been presented to that humane and enlightened ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. . j Tae Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish- ; American ad venturers to induce the emigration of freed- meu of the Uuited States to a foreign country, protested : against the project as one which, if consummated, would reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assu rance has bei-u received from the Government of the ; Slate iu which the plan was matured, that the proceed- '. ing will meet neither its encouragement nor approval. : It is a question worthy of your consideration, whether , our laws upon tins subj- ct are adequate to the preven tion or punishment of the crime thus meditated. In the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments, the first of which.it w as understood, would leave Mexico in November, now past, the second in March next, aud the third and last in November, l3(i7. Immediately upon the comph tion of the evac uation, the French Government was to assume the same attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mexico, as is held by the Government of the Uuited States. Re peated assurances have been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he would complete the promised evacuation within the period mentioned, or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus ! eosUnaplated wppid produce a eceis of great political interest "in the Republic of Mexico. The newly ap pointed Minister of the United States. Mr Campbell, was therefore sent forward, on the 9th day of November last, to assume his proper functions as Minister Pleni potentiary of the United States to that Republic It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant General of the Army of the Lulled states, wnn me iew oi ouiam ing such information as might be important to deter mine the course to be pursued by the United States in re-eslablishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the Republic of Mexico. Deeply in terested in the cause of liberty and humauity.it seemed au obvious duty on our part to exercise w hatever in fluence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of a domestic aud repub lican form of government. Such was the, condition of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the r&id of November last, official information was received from Paris that the Emperor of France had some time before decided not to withdraw a de tachment of his forces iu the mouth of November past, according to euc-airement. but that this decision was made with the purpose of withdrawing the whole of tnose torce8 in tne ensuing spring- oi mis ueiermina tion, however, the United States had not received any intimation; and so soon as the information was received by the Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that France will re-consider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico w hich will conform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus meet the just expectations of the United States. The papers relating to the subject will be laid before you. It is believed that, with the evacution of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no subject for serious differ ences between Fiance and the United States would re main. The expressions of the Emperor and people of t ranee warrant a hope that the traditionary hiendship between the tw o countries might in that case be re newed and permanently restored A claim of a citizen of the United States for indem nity for spoliations committed on the high seas by the French authorities, iu the exercise of a belligerent power against Mexico, has beeu met by the Govern ment of France with a proposition to defer settlement until a mutual convention for the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects of both countries, arising out of the recent wars on this continent, shall be agreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deem ed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which claims for indemnity by foreign ers, as w ell as by citizens of the United States, arising out ofthe late civil war, shall be adjudicated and de termined. I have uo doubt that the subject of all such claims will engage your attention at a convenient and proper time. It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made towards au adjustment ofthe differences between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of the depredations upon our national commerce and other trespasses committed during our civil w ar by British subjects, in violation of internal law aud treaty obligations. The delay, however, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic sit uation of Great Britain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that country during the last session of Par liament. The attention ofthe new ministry was called to the subject at an early day, aud there is some reason to expect that it will now be considered iu a becoming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early dispo sition of the question cannot be exaggerated. What ever might be the w ishes of the two Governments, it is manifest that good-will aud friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity, shall be restored between the respective nations On the 0th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military expedition and enterprise against the British North American Colonies was projected and at tempted to be carried on within the territory and juris diction ofthe United States. Iu obedience to the obli gation imposi'd upou the Executive by the Constitution, to see that the laws are faithfully executed, all citizens were warned, by proclamation, against taking part in or aiding mch unlawful proceedings, and the proper civil, military, and naval officers weie directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement ofthe laws. The expedition failed, but it has not beeu without its painful consequences. Some of our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged iu the expedition, were cap tured, and have beeu brought to trial, as for a capital offence, in the Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pronounced against some, while others have been acquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of government, that severity of civil punish ment for misguided persons w ho have engaged in revo lutionary attempts which have disastrously failed, is unsound and unwise, such representations have been made to. the British Government, iu behalf of the con victed persons, as, being sustained by au enlightened and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce iu their cases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty to all w ho were engaged in the movement Counsel has been employed by lhe Government to defend citi zens ofthe United States on trial for capital offences in Canada; and a discontinuance of the piosecutious which were instituted in the courts ot the U. States against those w ho took part in the expedition has been directed I have regard.-d the expeditiou as not only political in its nature, nut as also in a great measure lorgeign from the United States iu its causes, character, and ob jects. The attempt was understood to be made in svm pathy with an insurgent party in Irelaud.and, by strik ing at a British Pioviuce on this Continent, was de signed to aid in obtaining redress for political eric v. ances which, it was assumed, the people of Ireland had suffered at the hands ofthe British Government during a period of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly natives of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become citizens ofthe United States under our general laws of naturalization- Com plaints of misgoverument in Ireland continually en gage tne attention ot the lintish nation, and so great an agitation is now prevailing in Ireland that the British Government have deemed it necessary to suspend the w rit of habeas corpus in that country These circum stances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained in regard to an expe dition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute-books, thev should be faithfully executed, and if they operate harsh ly, unjustly, or oppressively, Congress alone can apply me remeuy. oy uieir moa.ncation or repeal. Political and commercial interests of the United States are not unlikely to be affected in some decree IfV events which are transpiring in the eastern regions of .1, . ..... i i j-mope, uu me, nme seems to nave come when our Govcrnnn nt ought to have a proper diplomatic represen tation ill Oirvtf. This Government has claimed for all persons not con victed, or accused, or suspected of crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation, aud a choice of new national allegiance. Must ofthe European States have dissented from this principle, and have claimed aright to hold such ot their subjects as have immigrated to. and been naturalized in. the United States, and after wards returned on transient visits to their native coun tries, to the performance of military sei vice in like man ner as resident subjects. Complaints arising from the claim iu this respect made by foreign States, have here tofore been matters of controversy between the United States and some of the European Powers, aud the irri tation conseqent upon the failure to settle this question increased during the war in which Prussia, Italy, and Austria were recently engaged. While Great Britain lias never acknowledged the right of expatriation, she has not practically insisted up on it. t ranee has been equally forbearing; and Prus sia has proposed a compromise, which, although evinc ing incieaseu iioeramy, nas not ueen accepted by the United States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to be a favorable time for an assertion by Congress of the principle, so long maintained by the Executive Department, that natural ization by cue State fully exempts the native-born sub ject of any other State from the performance of military service under any foreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits. Iu the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution, I have thus submitted to the Repre sentatives of the States and of the People such informa tion of our domestic aud foreign affairs as the public interests seem to require. Our Government is now un dergoing its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is, that the peril may be successfully and finally passed, without impairing its original strength and symmetry. The interests if the nation are best to be promoted by the revival of fraternal relations, the complete oblitera tion of our past differences, and the reiuauguration of all the pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to the early accomplishment of these great ends, let us en deavor to preserve harmony between tl e co-ordinate Departments of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in se curing the maintenance v-f the Constitution, the preser vation of the Union, and the perpetuity of our free in stitutions.
