It is not Inaptly said of the President's message that tt contains just such Informa tion ns "common-place" people, liks to know. Provident Attbur seems to bare a way of keeping his own counsel anil carrying bis points. For tho first time in years tbo cor respondents were, this week unable to get oven a glimmering of wbat tbo message con tained until it was read In Congress. Tbo House bas an aggregate of 293 mem bers, of whom 147 are a majority, and It con sists of 140 llepublicans, 130 Democrats, 11 Greenbackers and two llcadjusters. There aro 10 ltepublican members from tho South against 4 in tbo last Congress. Wo take pleasure in presenting our readers with the President's message this week in supplement form, and printed in large, clear type, so that it may bo read with comfort. Tbo message is of unusual length, but it is also a document of unusual interost, and all intelligent people will find themselves well repaid for its careful perusal. Mr. Morrill of this stata bas brought for ward an important bill in tho Senate which provides for a commission to examine tho tar 1 IT and rovenuo laws, to bo composed of niuo persons, appointed by the President and ap proved by the Senate. They aro to report result) and testimony from timo to time, aud to make a final report by tbo yoar 1833. Senator David Davis bas made an interest ing discovery, llo says President Arthur's message is tho first document of tho Kort in forty years that has not referred to the South as a distinctive section of tho country. All well-minded people would liko to sco in this circumstance an omen of a time not far dis tant when tho South will bo a mere geograph ical term and will have no more political sig nificance than the East or tho West has now. John. Taylor, tho successor of Brigham Young as head of tho Mormon Church, bas taken unto himself another wife. Her nu meral rank in tho household is not given, and she is only described as "a wealthy wid ow." Taylor appears to stand in more dread of tbo United States statute against polygamy tban did his predecessor, for ho did not ven ture to have the ceremony performed in Salt Lake City, but went off to a country town where he could enjoy the exclusive company of tho "Saints." The ocean steamships which havo arrived at Now York during the past week report the worst weather they havo ever experienced. Nearly all of them were several days late, and in some cases great .anxiety was felt at their non-arrival. A number of sailors were washed overboard, some were killed and others injured. For days together the ves sels were almost constantly submerged in the breaking seas, and hugo volumes of water swept the decks with a fury that nothing could resist. Seamen of forty years' expert enco say they never before saw such violent and protracted storms. A fire, at Minneapolis, Minn., on Sunday morning, destroyed four flouring mills, a cotton mill and other property, valued in all at over $500,000, and an explosion occurred by which four persons were killed and oth ers injured. It will be remembered that four years ago two of the largest flouring mills in Minneapolis were destroyed by fire, and by explosions of mill-dust which attracted much attention in the scientific world as a novel form of calamity. It is now demonstrated beyond a doubt that the fine dust floating in the air of a flour mill becomes under certain conditions a destructive agency as terrible as gunpowder. Col, Hooker's nomination and election as sergeant-at-arms of the House of Represent atives was granted him with a unanimity which is very complimentary to him, as it certainly is gratifying to all bis Vermont friends. Tbo Colonel bas an enviable war record behind him, he has shown himself a capable man in civil affairs, and by his wide acquaintance and excellent qualities of good fellowship he soems to be especially fitted for the position to which he has been chosen. The office is an honorable one and imposes a large degree of responsibility. We believe that Col. Hooker will perform its duties with credit to himself and to the satisfaction of his constituency. Tbo annual report of Mr. Lincoln, the Sec rotary of War, is chiefly devoted to tho con sideration of the recommendations contained in the reports of his subordinates. General Sherman's recommendation that the army bo increased to 30,000 men receives Secretary Lincoln's approval. Tho attention of Con gress is called to the need of legislation to prevent intrusion upon Indian lands. The Secretary invites attention to that part of the report of Gen. Wright, Chief of Engineers, which refers to seacoast defences, and says that It seems simply a matter of common pru dence that wa commence without delay, and under liberal appropriations, to put our coasts in an efficient condition of defence. Six hundred million dollars, almost one third as much as the publio debt when it was the largest, is the sum that by estimate will be required to settle tbo claims made and to be made under the Arrears of Pension act. It is safe to say that the act never would have been passed at all in the form it took hod not members of Congress from both parties been afraid to vote against it for fear of alienating the soldier vote. It Is believed that millions of dollars aro being drawn from tho treasury on falso claims, and yet Congress, so far, has declined to Interpose to prevent. If the new Congress wants to gain the approval of tbo country it will deviso without delay means to stop this enormous leak and send knavish claimants and their agents to the rear. The physicians who attended upon Presi dent Garfield havo been asked by the finan cial agent of Mrs. Garfield to send their bill to her, but they have refused to do so. Dr. Bliss said that he would not think of taking from Mrs. Garfield what would be a mere bagatelle to the government, while it would sensibly reduce her income. He and the oth er physicians have declined to take anything at all unless it comes from the government. Gen. Garfield's friends in Congress, will try to have a commission appointed to audit all bills growing out of bis illness, and will ask to have them paid out of any unappro priated moneys in the treasury. In this way they hopo to have tho matter quietly arrang oil without an undignified squabble. According to Comptroller Knox's annual report tho total number of national banks Oc tober 1, last, was 2132, tho grcatost number of banks ever in operation at any one time. Tboro is only one state in tho Union, Mississ ippi, and one territory, Arizona, which do not possess one or nioro of those institutions. The national banks of Vermont havo an ag gregate capital of $8,161,000) circulation, $6,442,899 1 loans and discounts, $10,899, 22 1 individual deposits, $5,191,852. It is a somewhat curious circumstance that whilo New Hampshlro leads Vermont in savings banks, In tbo proportion of thrco to ono in both number of depositors and amount of de posits, our national bank figures largely ex ceed thoso of our neighboring state. The Now Hampshire national banks have only $5,830,000 in capital, $5,168,000 in circula tion, $7,319,000 in loans and discounts, and $1,293,000 in individual deposits. Tho report of Secretary Folgor on the finan ces of the country is a sound, able and con servative document. Tho essential recom mendations made by the Secretary are that the issuo of silver certificates should bo stopped; that tho cotnago of silver dollars should hereafter be limited to tbo amount which the business of the country may re quire j that the extended three and a half per cents should not bo disturbed by a now re funding scheme, unless it be found practica ble to place long term bonds bearing a much lowor rate of interest ; that the excessivo tax ation of National banks should bo reduced, and the National banking system conserved and perfected ; that the surplus revenue should be diminished by abolition of other intornal taxes than those upon spirits and to bacco ; and that revision of the tariff should be made with great care, and by tho aid of ft commission especially qualified for the work. It will bo noted with satisfaction that Presi dent Arthur, in his message, concurs with Secretary Folger in his recommendations. The. President's ITlesauire. Tho message of President Arthur, which we present to our readers to day in tho form of a supplement, commands almost universal approval as an able, careful and well-matured state paper. Tho message opens with an eloquent tributo to Gen. Garfield, and pro ceeds to a review of our foreign relations, which aro pronounced satisfactory. In tho consideration of our financial matters the recommendations of the President concur with thoso of Secretary Folger, which are elsewhere summarized. The President urges that immediate action bo taken to build up a navy such as the safety and dignity of the na tion demand. He favors the postal-savings recommendation of the Postmaster General and declares in favor of prosecuting tbo star routo irregularities "with the utmost rigor." Upon the Indian question, President Arthur is in full accord with the policy of civiliza tion, and speaks with feeling and forco in its favor. In regard to polygamy, be is abreast the most intelligent and determined publio sentiment, and not content with tbo mero rhetorical condemnation of this evil, bo points out tbo measures required for its radical treat ment. He finds in the result of the arrears of pensions law an admonition to Congress and the Executive to givo serious attention to similar projects in the future, and suggests legislation for tho prevention of fraud in tho prosecution of pension claims. Tho Presi dent urges upon Congress, with a gravity and emphasis which recent ovents in our history fully justify, tho need of a new law for ascer taining and declaring tbo result of presiden tial elections, and for determining the ques tion of presidential inability, and the succes sion to tho presidential office. The fact that a larger part of tho message is devoted to the consideration of tho civil service than to any other topic, shows that the President appre ciates tho general interest of tho country on that subject. It is evident that bo has made tho subject ono of considerable study. Tho President doubts if the best results will be secured by a strictly competitive system of examination, but thinks that the present evils may be eradicated if examining boards shall have tho discretion to ascertain the charac teristics and general capacity, as well as the scholastic attainments of candidates. The President, however, declares that It Congress shall Bee fit to establish competitive teBts he will givo the measuro his earnest support. Meanwhile ho urgently recommends Congress to appropriate $23,000 to carry into effect ex isting laws designed to improve the civil ser vice. It is to bo hoped that Congress will show itself ready to second the President in his evident readiness to institute a reform in this most vital direction. Ihe Harrow Gsuffe PaiHnrcr lliulneaa. We have obtained from the several station agents on the Brattleboro tt Whitehall rail road figures showing the number of tickets sold from the time the road began running, Nov. 18, 1830, up to Dee. 1st inst. These figures are as follows : Regular Excursion Ticket. Tickets. So. Londonderry, 1544 100 Winhall, 205 45 Jamaica, 1900 100 Wardsboro, 11C1 80 W. Townshend, 1303 238 Townshend, 2820 210 Newfano, 2535 170 Williamsville, 145G 99 W. Dnmmerston, 812 50 Brattleboro, 4803 200 Totals, 18,539 1292 The total number of tickets, Including reg ular and excursion tickets, sold in the period hero included one year and eleven days, It will be seen, is 19,831. The conductors of the two trains have made a careful estimate of the number of fares collected by them and believe 3200 is entirely within bounds. This added to the total of ticket sales gives 23,031 as the number of faros during the year. In arriving at the number of passengers actually carried, however, the item of "return" tickets must be included that is to say, of tickets sold from stations up the line to como to Brattleboro and return the same day. The number of such tickets sold is 1C3C, and they are included in tho figures already given j but each of these tickets represents two passen gers carried, or one passenger carried each way, and these tickots should therefore be counted twice to give the actual number of passengers carried. Add 1C3G to the total last given and we have 24,GG7 as tho number of passengers carried from Nov. 18, 1880 to Deo. 1, 1881. The number of working days hero Included is 324 ; dividing 24,CC7 by 324 we havo 70 and a fraction as tho average number of passengers carried per day. Tho number of excursion tickets from Jamaica, West Dnmmerston and Brattleboro, it Bhould bo said, is estimated, but tho estimate is sub stantially correct. We Imagine these figures will surprise oven the warmest friends of the new road, but whether they do or do not, the road, in the first year of its operation, has surpassed by an averago of ten passengers per day, or over 3000 per year the most Ban. guine estimate ever mado in our columns of its probable passenger business. The figures Bpeak more forcibly than words can do of the need which existed for the road's construc tion, and of the extent to which its accommo dation is appreciated by the people of the West lliver valley. The past year has been in many ways a very trying ono for the road and its management, and it has en joyed a re markable freedom from serious accidents. The road-bed bas been under constant im provement and is now in excellent condition throughout. We hope, in a future Issue, to bo able to givo some facts with regard io tho freight business of tbo year. Congress. At tho ltepublican caucus of representa tives at Washington, held last Saturday after noon to nominate officers of tho House, Gen. Keif er of Ohio was nominated for Speaker on tho sixteenth ballot. Hiscock of Now York was defeated partly because it was thought that Now York already had its share of tho honors, and partly through tbo opposition of Conkling, Piatt and Cameron. Edward Mc pherson of Pennsylvania was nominated for Clerk without much difficulty, Now York go ing for him in retaliation for Cameron's oppo sition of Iliscook. Mr. McPbcrson bas serv ed as Clerk of the llouso twelvo years, and bis experience from tho timo of Colfax and Blalno makes him a very valuable officer. Col. Hooker was nominated on tho first ballot for Sergeant-at-Arms. For Doorkoeper, Col. Walter J. Brownlow of Tennessee, a nephew of tho celebrated "Parson Brownlow," was nominated on the first ballot. Henry Sher wood of Michigan was nominated for Post master, and Rov. F. D. Powers of Washing ton, President Garflold's pastor, for Chaplain. On Monday, at tho opening of tho first ses sion of tho Forty.sovonth Congress, tho lle publicans effected tho organization of the Houso, by the election of their caucus nomi nees, without difficulty. Gen. Keifer received 148 votes for Speaker, comprising tho whole ltepublican strength and the two Virginia He adjusters. The Greonbackcrs, some of whom wore supposed to be willing to act with the llepublicans, stood out by themselves, and gave eight votes to Mr. Ford of Missouri. Tho Democrats gavo Mr. Ilandall 129 votes. Mr. Keifer had five votes more than tho number necessary to elect, but if tho four Democratio abscntcos bad been presont ho would havo gono in by one majority. After the election and swearing-in of Gen, Keifer, objections were raised to tho swearing in of several mem bers, Including Chalmers of Mississippi and Dibble of South Carolina ; but all objections were finally withdrawn or tabled, and all wero allowed to qualify. Tho organization of tho House was then completed by tho election of tho remaining Republican nominees. Speak er Keifer, in his excellent address on taking tho chair, hoped tho present Congress would bo marked peculiarly as a "business Congress." In the Senate, Mr. Sherman of Ohio intro duced a three per cent funding bill. Bills af fecting tho tariff and Chlnoso questions were also introduced. Tbo President's message and tbo report of tho Secretary of tbo Treas ury were sent in on Tuesday. Hank Directors unit Hank Xxnmlnert. Comptroller Knox takes occasion in bis an nual report to emphasize the lessons taught so painfully by the disasters to the Mechan ics' bank of Nowark and the Facifio bank of Boston. Such being tho case the report has a special interest for tho latitude of Brattle boro. Tbo Comptroller lays special stress upon tbo responsibility of bank directors, and is at considerable pains to excuse the short comings of bank examiners. Ho especially points out that, while tho publio learns onco in a while of a great defalcation or misman agement which has been covered up, it docs not hear of tho numerous instances in which the examiners detect reprehensible practices and havo them set right. In many instances the capital stock of a bank has been found to bo impaired, and tbo deficiency has been mado good without tho knowledge of tho general publio. In other instances banks havo been obliged to pass their usual divi dends, using their earnings to liquidato all bad and doubtful debts. The examiner visits tho bank but once a year, and can spend but two or throe days in investigating its affairs. He has but a limited knowledge of tho habits and character of tho bank employe's, and may not be ablo in bis brief timo for examination to unravel a system of falso entries or forged papers which a teller or cashier may have been practicing for months. The directors, howevcry know their officials ; they have full power to appoint and to remove them; they aro on tbo ground and meet regularly ; and by their oath of office, and tho by-laws of the institution, they aro bound to exercise watch ful care over its affairs. The Comptroller says : "The duties of tbo board of directors aro plainly defined, and however innocent they may be of any intention of wrong, they are responsible for the safety of funds com mitted to their care. If it can bo shown that any of them had notice of illegal transactions, it is a serious question whether they aro not legally bound to make good tho loss which may occur ; and it is a question whether they are not also liable for losses which may occur from neglect of duty even without notice." Such disasters as those which have recent ly occurred, the Comptroller thinks, exhibit, not the weakness of tho national banking sys tem, but rather the weakness and wickedness of human nature. Private companies and in dividuals are continuously suffering from em bezzlements and forgeries. It is scarcely to be expected if a robber or a forger is placed in control of all of its assets that a national bank can bo saved from disaster by the oc casional visits of an examiner. Some addi tional legislation will be required, but there is not so much necessity for additional re strictions as there is for increased care upon the part of examiners and increased diligence on the part of the directors. The contest over the position of delegate from Utah Is raging with great virulence. Cannon, the Mormon candidate, had a large majority of the votes and has been placed on the rolls by the clerk. Campbell has tbe cer tificate of the governor and expects to be seated. It is said that a large number of men have been appointed to clerkships in Washington on the ground that they are veterans of the late war, who are impostors. During November, the cost of tho star mail service was reduced $111,155, making an ag gregate reduction of $1,802,419 einoe the be ginning of March. A commemorative silver plate has boen placed upon the pew formerly occupied by President Garfield in the Christian Church at Washington. It is inscribed with his name and the dates of his birth and death. Since his death the pew has been draped in mourn ing, and is to be kept thus draped as long as the church stands. President Arthur took possession of the White House on Wednesday. The mansion bas boen thoroughly and handsomely fitted up. John Davis, a nephew of Judge J. 0. Bancroft Davis, and librarian of the Depart ment of State under Secretary Fish, is to be tbe President's privato secretary, It is inti. mated that Mrs. Davis will be the mistress of the White House. Tbe paper on which the President's mes sage was written bad a heavy black border and was fastened with black tape. Jefferson Davis, with his wife and daugh ter, arrived in New York from Europe on Wednesday. It is said that the neighbors of President Garfield at Mentor who were chosen by a lo cal court to appraise his personal property have found that including books, stocks and bonds, cattle, life insuranee, etc., it amounts to about $100,000. Gen. Joseph Warren Keifer, the new speak, er, was born in Clark county, 0,, in 163G; was brought up on a farm, graduated at An tloch college and was admitted to the bar In 1858, He went into the army soon after the first call for troops as major of the 30th Ohio infantry and served with credit until the end of tho struggle, being wounded four times and promoted from time to time until ho reached the rank of major-general. At the close of the war he reentered the practice of his profession, but soon went into political life, no held various local and state offices and bas been in Congress two terms. Gen. Keifer is kindly remembered by tbe officers of the Tenth Vermont, which belonged to his division of tbe Sixth corps and fought with his brigade at Cedar Creek. 

GVITEAITB TRIAL. TOE cnOBS'EXAMlNATIOM CLOSED JODOE pon TErt's SIIBEWUNESS (ll'ITEAU OUTWITTED EXAMINATION OF EirEOTS BEDBTTINrj TES TIMONY. Gulteau's cross-oxaminatlon closed on Fri day, after having lasted for nearly three days. The prisoner kept himself on the alert throughout and discussed questions of poli tics, ethics, law, theology and business with a mental vigor that would bo considered ex ceptional in a persou of unquestioned saulty and ability. Ho evidently misconceived tho theory of Judge Porter's cross-examination, fancying that it was to bo a trial of his wits instead of his lack of wits, and accordingly he made tbe most of bis opportunity and bent himself to tho task of giving the Judge as good as he sent. Whenever be was led up to anything liko Inoonslstency he either sheered off, or fell to bUckguardlng the Judge, or refused to answer. When, for in stance, the Judge asked him it ho would havo shot President Garfield on July 2, if Mrs. Garfield had been with him, he replied that bo would not. "Than," pursued tho Judgo, interrogatively, "It depended entirely on your will f" The prisoner saw tho trap and per ceived that there was no way to avoid it ex cept by shutting his mouth and refusing to answer ; for it it depended entirely upon his will, then tbe agoncy of tbe Deity in the case was eliminated. So he took up a newspaper, adjusted his eyo-glasses, and commenced reading, pretending that ho had already an. swered the question more than onco, and that it would bo n waste of time to answer it again. All through the three days be showed the clearest apprehension of tbe nature and quality of his act. This was especially illus trated in the dramatic climax with which tbo cross-examination closed. Judgo Porter had beon questioning tho assassin upon the inci dents of tho shooting. Then folding bis arms and fixing bis dark eyes full upon him, Judge Porter said, with slow, impressive utterance t 'And from that day to this you have never felt remorso for tho deed ?" Guiteau tried to escape from tho query. Ho shifted about restlessly in bis seat, and bis eyes, which wero lowored, ran backward aud forward along thn top of tbe witness box. He soem ed to shrink from looking at Judgo l'orter. Being pressed hard for au answer, he finally replied, throning angry and furtivo glances at the cross-examlnor, "Why, of course, I felt remorse, to far " "That Is all," said Judge Porter gravely, sitting down. "Tlit cross-examination is end ed." Guiteau had seen tbo mistake as soon as bo had made it, and Judgo Porter did not get his words out of his mouth before tbo assaa siu was pounding on the front of the witness box and hotly explaining that bis remorse was only a regret for tbe necessity of the act. On Saturday Emory A. Hlorrs, the eminent Chicago lawyor, was called and testified, but did not help tho prisoner's case. Senator David Davis was also called, Mr. Scoville's purpose evidently being to obtain an opinion tbat tho tendency of tho political methods be fore tbo tragedy was to ruin the country. Such an opinion Mr. Davis declined to give, and he was excused after a few moments. On Monday the examination of experts be gan, and was continued through Tuesday, when tho testimony for tbo defence, practi cally closed. Several of the most noted spe cialists in tbe country were called. These gentlemen wero only asked to answer a hypo thetical question which assumed all tbat the defence claims concerning Gulteau's mental condition. They were not allowed to say whether they considered him responsible for his acts or not. Others, it is said, wero not put upon the stand at all, because it was known to Mr. Scovitlo tbat they had become convinced of Gulteau's Banity by observing his languago and behavior duriug the trial. Guiteau demanded to havo Gen. Grant, ex Senators Conkling and Piatt. ex-Gov. Jewell "and that sort of men" called to testify. Dur ing one of his speeches ho declared tbat be "would rather be hung as a sensible man than acquitted as a fool." Mr. Scoville de sired to have President Arthur called to the stand, but finally consented to prepare a list of written questions to bo submitted to him. On Wednesday Gen. Sherman testified that his first thought on hearing of the shooting was that it was a part of a conspiracy, and for tbat reason he ordered out tho troops at once. Upon making inquiries, however, he was soon satisfied that it was the act of but ono man. As Gen. Sherman was about to leave the stand, Guiteau nodded familiarly and saluted him with : "I want to thank you, general, for your promptness in calling out the troops. I'm indebted to you for it ; oth erwise I should not now be hero. I want to thank you and Maj. Brock for protecting me." Important testimony was put in in op position to the alleged insanity of Guiteau. People who bad known the prisoner and his family intimately for years said they never supposed any of them were insane. The rebuttal testimony was continued on Thursday. In the minds of many people the theory of hereditary insanity in the Guit eau family has been completely overthrown. Tho President's answers to tho questions sent him by Mr. Scoville were received. The answers state in short, that the Presi dent knew Guiteau in a passing way, that the President knows of no service that Guit eau has ever rendered the Republican party, and tbat ho was never promised any office. Dealb of Gen, Kllpatrlck. A despatch received at Washington an nounces the death of Gen. Judson Kilpatrick, United States minister to ChilL Gen. Kil patrick was born at Deckertown, N.

He was ap pointed minister to Chili in 16G5, was recall ed in 18C8, and was again appointed by Pres ident Garfield last spring. Senator David Davis left tbe chair of tbe Senate on Tuesday and mado a speech once more explaining his position. The Adminis tration of President Arthur be said he should treat candidly, sustaining it when right and opposing it when wrong. As to tbo com mittees and offices of the Senate he stood just where he did last spring, and should vote to keep the committee organizations in the hands of the Republicans and the offices in possession of the present Democratio incum bentsa purpose which he afterward carried out by voting for the Edmunds resolution continuing the Senate committees as consti tuted by the Republicans. The election of Col. George W. Hooker of Vermont to the office of Sergeant-at-Arms of tbo House is a fitting recognition of a man who is not only a sound and active Republi can and who was a faithful soldier in tbe late war, but of one whp is conspicuously quali fied for the position.

TRAGEDY AT GREENFIELD. FATHER MO OABTT, PABISU POTEST, SHOT AND FATALLY WOUNDED A CASE OF DOMESTIC TBOCBLE THE MUBDEBEB ABBESTED. Father McCarty, parish priest at Greenfield, Mass., was shot and mortally wounded last Saturday evening, at tbe parochial residence, by David MoMeUen, an employe' In Boston of the American express company. MoMelien's wife left him several years ago bocause he treated her badly, and has recently been aot lug as housekeeper at tbe priest's house. He visited her last week and urged her to live with bim, but she refused. Saturday night he called upon her again, and she still refused to go with him, He returned three times to the priest's house, ringing the bell violently and kicking at the door. Father McCarty fi nally came to tbe door himself, and MoOarty shot him twice and then ran away. Father McCarty died Tuesday night. McCarty was arrested at Boston, and is now in Greenfield jail. His story is that bis family was broken up because he is a Protestant ; that bis wife had promised to live with him, and that he went to the priest's house Saturday evening to see why the promise was not fulfilled. He says that be was refuted admission, and that Father McCarty pursued and attaoked him, and be (McMellen) shot him In self-defence, MoMeUen is a favorite with the express com pany, and one of its best clerks.

Valua ble and appropriate gifts were presented and the evening passed very pleasantly, Mr. L. L. Davis, tbe new Chief Engl, neer, has for 27 years past been actively con nected with the fire department, and for eight years bas served as one of the assistant en gineers. He is a good fireman, as well as a courteous, intelligent and responsible citizen, and will command the confidence and respect of the community in his new positiou. Mr. Davis has appointed as his assistants J. 0. Howe, W. N. Kinson, W. M. E. Adams, and 0. 0. Turner. As Hannibal Hadley was engsged in hitching up tbe horse ot his son-in-law, Geo. E. Selleck, on Thursday morning, the horse, in an excess of good spirits, started out of the yard, and Mr. Hadley, in attempting to seize him by tbe bridle, was thrown down and the buggy passed over bim.

On theday after Thanksgiving a rifle bul let was fired into the Esteyville school bouse, entering through the porch, shattering a slate blackboard In the front end of the school room, passing across the room and lodging In tho wall at the opposite end. The com. mlttee looked after tbe matter sharply and finally sifted tho matter down to two boys, aged about 14, who were called up and made to confess. They will be properly dealt with, and their case ought to be a warning to olher reckless boys that the business of mutilating school houses isn't always a safe one. The Murray club's presentation ot the popular oomedy, "Our Boys," at Crosby hall, Tuesday evening, was an unqualified success. The play was well cast, Mr. 0.

Mr. and Mrs. E. 11. French, formerly of Londonderry, and now In chargo of tbo kitch en department of the Vermont asylum, have for some two years past had with them a lit tlo girl, aged about 12 years, which they look from a Boston charitable Institution on Deer Island, and havo intended to keep aud bring up ns their own, although no legal adoption of the child bad boen made. Last Friday tho child was unceremoniously called out of tbe Grammar school by an agent of tbe BobIoii Institution referred to and told to make ready to return to Boston, which sbo did, in spite of her tears and protestations against leaving her "fotber" and "mother." Mr. and Mrs. French wero greatly disturbed over the mat ter, but, under the clrcumBtancos wero power less to prcvcDt tho child's removal. Tbo agent gavo no explanation of tho Institu tions' courso, but intimated that there wero reasons for believing that tbo child had not been properly treated, Tbe asylum family aro satisfied tbat tho girl has had only tho kindest treatment since Mr. aud Mrs. French came thore in May last, aud responsible Lou donderry peoplo believe that she bas buen treated like a daughter. Tho only possiblo Infstenco is that tbe child has been taken away through the malicious misrepresenta tions of some person or porsons having a grudge against the Frenches. Tho matter will not bo allowed to rest as it stands, and proper measures are being taken to havo it set right.

Tho annual village meeting, last Monday evening, was quite fully attended, although it was generally expected that little would transpire in tbe way of "fun." It seemed to be conceded by all that tbo old board of officers bad transacted tho business of tho village in an economical and satisfactory manner end deserved a re-election ; and, with the exception of chief engineer Wales, they were re-elected ri'ra voce, with little or no op position. When chairman R. W. Clarke call ed for nominations for the office of chief en gineer, tbe names of Elijah Wales and Lafay ette ii Davit were presented in tbe order named and a ballot was called for. No speci fied method of votlog having been previously agreed Ukju, the chairman, ignoring the call for a ballot, but in accordance with parliamen tary rule proceeded to put the question on tbo election of tbo nominee first presented. The call for tbe yoas and nays was feebly responded to on either side, but the chairman declared Wales elected and attempted to pro ceed with other business. The friends of Mr. Davis, however, wero dissatisfied with the chairman's method of procedure, and gave such forcible expression to their sentiments that on suggestion of Col. J. J. Estey, a vote was called for on tbe question, Shall tbe rul ing of the chairman bo sustained? Tbe house refused to sustain tho chair, and a ballot was ordered, which resulted as follows : Whole number of votes cast, 213 Necessary for a choice, 12.i E. Wales had 111 L. L. Davis, 13G C. B. Fairbanks, 1 Mr. Davis was therefore declared elected. Tbe article in tbo warrant relative to tbe pay of the fire department was discussed at some length and resulted In the appointment of a committee to take into consideration the question of a thorough reorganization of tbe department and report at a future meeting, and tbe cbalr named as such committee L. K. Fuller, II. D. Holton, C. F. Thompson, L. L. Davis, E. C. Crosby, E. Wales, and C. N. Davenport, A motion to appropriate the sum ot $200 as compensation to tho bailiffs for their services was voted down. In accord ance with the recommendation of tbe bailiffs, it was voted to raise forthwith a tax of 3.1 per cent on the grand list for the payment of cur rent expenses and tbe reduction of the interest-bearing debt. The reports of the treas urer and chief engineer, which were present ed and accepted at tbe commencement of the meeting, were substantially in accordance with the reports published in pamphlet form and alluded to in our last issue. Below we give tho list of village officers for the coming year : P. Bsrrows, dark and treasurer ; R. W. Clarke, J. J. Eatey, 8. N. Uerrlck, F. 1L Harris, Leander Thomas, bailiffs; L. L.

OLENWOOD CLASSICAL 8EVINABY EXAMINATIONS AND CLOSIXO EXEBCISES. The fall term of Glenwood Classical Seminary ended on Tuesday evening of the present week. The classes were examined on Monday and Tuesday. Tuesday evening was devoted to rhetorical exercises in Acad emy ball, which wero of unusual merit. Prof. Shaw and his excellent assistantsMisses Brown and Streeter, deserve, and wo doubt not, will reoeive the thanks of all friends and patrons of the school for the very efficient and satisfactory manner in which they have discharged their several duties. The winter term will commenoe on Wednesday, Deo. 14. THE 

COMMITTEE'S BEPOBT, By invitation ot Prof. Shaw, principal of Glenwood Classical Seminary, the nnder. signed was invited to sit as a member of the examining board at tbe recent examination closing tbe present term, and also officially to make report concerning the administra tion and progress ot the school. Judging from the examinations attended, the seminary is under careful and able guid ance, and tbo pupils good in scholarship. We can only speak in general terms of the work of tho school because the pressure of other duties forbade our presenoo at all the examinations, but both our own impressions and the freely expressed opinion of the resi dents of the West town especially lead us to say confidently tbat good work is being done under tho present administration ot the semi nary, and that it is steadily growing in popu. larity, the latter taut being corroborated by tbe large and increasing number of students. Prof. Shaw's assistants are faithful and able, and with himself furnish a very creditable and trustworthy corps of teachers. Tbe ex. hibltion ot the primary scholars which we attended evinced good training on their teacher's part, and a cheerful willlnguess to learn in the little ones. It will be well just to say a word of commendation of the wise effort which Prof. Shaw is making to give his pupils tbe benefit of good musical train ing, since nothing will so ameliorate the man. ners of a school as a careful education in this branch, Geo. E. Mabtin. THE NEW 

80JIOOL HOUSE. At the school meeting In tho West village last night the district voted to build the new bouse with a single school room. Strenuous efforts were made by some for an additional smaller room for the younger scholars j but it was shown that the littlo ones are well Ac comodated at the primary department of tho academy, and considering the location of the new houso perhaps this is tho belter course to pursue. Miss Streeter shows n decided talent as n teacher of tho younger children, and as tho tuition Is only thrco dollars per term, few parents will regard It burdonsomo to pay nine dollars per annum, In vlow of tho supc rlor care and Instruction affordod. x.

Appropriate remarks were offered by 0. M. Russell of Wilmlngtou, Mr. Joshua Sherman, David Goodell, Elijah Par sons and others. Mr. Bowen responded in hearty and eloquent terms.

DEATH or A. A. BANNET, Alfred A. Rsnney died suddenly of heart disease Thanksgiving morning at Mm homo of bis third daughter, Mrs. Martha l'iV, lu Livertnore, Colorado. Mr, Rannoy was the fourth child and third sou in thu family of thirteen chlldrenof Hon. WalUtell It. lUntiey for many years a citizen of Townshend auii extensively known as a physician and poll, tlcan In southern Vermont. Alfred was born In 1816 on the old Ranney farm near West Townshend, where he lived until about fifteen years ago and where he raised an Intelligent and Interesting family of four daughters, all of whom, except tho youngest, with their mother, survive the fatbor. During the lone rcsldenco of Mr. Ranney In Townshend, ho was a successful farmer, highly appreciated aa a true Christian gentleman and a man of much more than ordinary intelligence. Sinco leaving town he aud bis wife have resided part of tho time In Now York city and part o( the lime with their daughters In different states. Mr. llanney's death leaves but sit of the original thirteen children in tbe family o Dr. Rannoy, tho names, professions and resi. dences being as follows : Dr. Evander Ran ney, the oldest, now and for many years a practising physician In Now York ciity, Dr, Lafayette lianney, also a practising physician In New York and a prominent member of Dr. Taylor's church and of tbo city school board' Hon. Ambrose A.

Goodell A Co. have their new rupee in running order and wo expect soon to hear tho sonorous voice of tho new whistle. One could hardly have imagined one year ago the industry that has been built up In tho vicinity of the depot, and we think Goodell & Co. de servo much credit for their enU-rprke. Qui(e a little stir has ben produced the past week or so, occasioned by thn confession of one Fred Wilder, and Frank Tunny, for unlawfully taking palmleaf hats from How ard & Fullerton, and but for their prompt set tlement they would have been arrested. But still graver charges have been preferred against them with one or two others from Jamaica (but not, as the correspondent for tbe Reformer from Jamaica in bis last week's item had it, any from Townshend) in confii cating quite a number ot sheep from farmers in different parts of Jamaica, and to such an extent that settlement only with the state will give satisfaction. Whereupon, these facts presumably coming to tho ears of the young men, they concluded to save the state farther expense, as is supposed, by taking themselres to parts unknown, and, as the case now stands, wo have got to await farther develop ments before finishing this chronicle. x. Tenon. Rev. A. B. Truax will preach in the clisp. el next Sunday at two o'clock, p. u., on the Bible doctrine of tbo Resurrection.

Williams was killed Tues day morning by a tree falling on him which be was cutting. Ho left home alone early in the morning, taking his dinner with him, and was not expected home until evening. Not returning then, search was made for him and he waa found under tbe tree with bis bead badly bruised, and his back, ribs, aud one leg broken. He was probably killed early in the day, as his dinner uas not eaten. He was at work for H. F. Bond cut ting somo open land trees In the pasture be longing to J. It. Morse, and was not far from tho highway. Quite a number of people passed tbero during the day and saw his horse hitched near the fence, and the tree was also in sight of tho road, but as bis death probably occurred instantly there was no noise to attract the attention of those passing iy. trilmlnrson.
