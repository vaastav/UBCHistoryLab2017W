It is more lengthy than the former messages of President Grant, but will be read with interest nevertheless. The various matters pertaining to gov erns ntal affairs are treated of with candor, impassionately, and in a man ner indicative of a thorough knowedge of the various and manifold interests involving legislative action. That portion relating to the Cuban difficulty will be found of unusual interest, also, that relative to finance While the president has made no attempt at rhet oric, he has succeeded in giving to the people a Message that, on the whole, is recognized as a sterling paper, re plete with excellent suggestions and full of administrative wisdom. The Cuban Dilliculties. The terms of settlement agreed upon between the United States and Spain in the adjustment of the Yirginous dif ficulty, seems to meet with but little favor in the Cuban government. There seems to be a manifest detemina tion to brave the authority of the Mad rid government, as well as the power of tue United States. It is obvious that the home power has little influence over its subjects in Cuba, and in the face of all the facts from time to time commu nicated, it looks very like a war cloud after all that is hovering in the horizon over the sea. The latest from Havana is, that more time is demanded, and that the Virginias must be delivered ove to a neutral powar. These de mands the Administration, will not conceed to. It is hoped however, that the hot Spanish blood will have cooled shortly, and the matter adjusted ac cording to the terms proposed. In the meantime warlike preperations are be ing prosicuted with vigor. Deuth of Bishop Arm it age. The telegraph brings us the sad in telligence of the death of Bishop Ar mitage of Milwaukee. Tie was the Episcopal Bishopric of the Wisconsin Diocese succeeding Bishop Kemper. His death occurred at St. Luke’s Hos pital in New York City on the 7th inst., occasioned by a surgical opera tion in the removal of a tumor in the region of the spine. He was agad 43 years, and recognized as a strong speak er, a genial gentleman, and a Christian officer. Nepedah, Dec. Gth, 1873. Ed. Reporter: —ln your last issue you ask, “Cannot something be done to prevent its (Scarlet fever) onward march. In answer to this query per mit me to call your attention to the use of Belladonna as a preventive of that disease. All the Homeopathic cooks with which I am acquainted maintain that “the administration of a dose of Belladonna, night and morn ing, to children who have not had the disease, will often ward off an attack should the disease occur, notwithstand ing this treatment, it will undoubtedly greatly modify its severity. Adminis ter two drops of the first dilution, in a half wine glass lull of water the first thing in the morning. In a severe ep edemic the dose should be given twice daily for a few days.” There have been several cases of Scarlet fever in this vicinity lately but not a case has occurred where Bella donna has been used as a preventive. It is worth trying. Any Homeopathic physician, and they can be found in any town of considerable population, can furnish Belladonna of the proper dilution. Respectfully K. Kerosene. —At the La Crosse Cir cuit Court in the case of Sheldon vs. the Northwestern Union Packet Com. experiments were tried in Court with kerosene. Several samples wero ob tained from dealers and retailers in the city. There was not a single sam ple of kcroseue, except what is known as headlight oil, that did not explode at 9G degrees or jess, v, nilo the law requires it shall sUad a test of not less than 310 degrees. livery dealer who sells that article, is violating the law, and endangering the life and property of those to whom it is sold. A law was passed last W inter which makes every person selling kerosene that will not stand the test of 110 degrees, li able to a hue of §IOO or imprisonment for 20 days in the county jail, or both line and imprisonment. The law re quires every person selling kerosene ti test it before uttering it fur sale, and jf it will ignite at less thau 110 de.- grees then it is dangerous and unlaw ful to sell it. Every dealer in this State should give this matter prompt and careful attention, or they may be subjected to the penalties the law im poses People using this article will demand that the law be complied with, and the sale of this dangerous oil be stopped. In the course of the same trial some illustrations were given of the value of some “Hell's Broth” which has been sent forth to the world under the de-1 lusive, deceptive and fictitious title of, “Danforth’s non-explosive petroleum | fluid.” A long board was brought in-j to the the Court Boom, and placed | upon seats between the Judge and Jury. Drops of this fluid were placed on this long board in spots several in ches apart; and as soon as a lighted match was placed in contact with one of these drops or spots of fluid, the flame was immediately communicated along the board. Half a gill of that dangerous Danforth fluid was poured into a bucket half filled with water and ignited, when another half bucket of water was poured into and upon the burning fluid, without any percep tible diminuation ot the flame, which mounted up so high and produced such a heat as to cause the Jury to sud denly escape from their seats. It Dan forth, or the manufacturer, or seller, or shipper of that stuff which destroyed the War Eayle, and the lives and prop ' erty that were then lost, had been pres | ent, he would have stood a good chance to get a hot bath in his own murder ous fluid; especially in view of the fact that it is sent out branded “Non- Explosive” in order to throw common carriers, dealers, consumers and the public generally off their guard.— Mansion Star. Killed by a T rain.—lt is our painful duty to record another instance of man's instability in this eventful life. On Tuesday oflast week, at about 9:30 o'clock, A. M. Thomas Wallace aged about 17 years, attempted to board the construction train of the W. Y. 11. I\. upon which he was working as water carrier. While the train was passing at a rapid rate at the depot near this point, having laid hold of the ladder attached to the Caboose Car, he lost his foothold, and slipped ; snowy ice covering the platform at the time, and was dragged some distance, to near the south end of the depot, where having lost his hold, he fell from the platfon.a, to the track, a wheel passing over the to'e of his right foot, and hav ing acquired a like motion with the train, he was violc'otly thrown longer tudanly upon the rail ot the track, and under the bin'l wheels of the caboose car, one wheei passing diagonally across his forehead and com pletely crushing in the skull, and scat tering the poor fellows brains within the track, while tlie other wheel pass, ed in the same direction across his body, breaking bis shoulder blade, dis locating bis arms, forcing his ribs to part, so as to become a mass of bone and jelly. The spinal columns was in three places crushed too such an ex tent that three internal wounds could be seen upon his back besides the fract uring of one leg below the knee, and one arm above the elbow. All this happened near raid day, within sight of his comrads. And why? Becanse of the lack of caution. The poor fel low when picked up and conveyed to the residence of Mr. Burk, near by, presented a most heart sickening ap pearance, which was more intensified by the presence of, and sobs of poor Tom’s Father whose warm Irish heart could not control bis pent-up feelings, when called to witness the disrobing of his idolized son; The boys father is much respected. And when the by standers met bis gaze of yearning for sympathy as it seemed to flow from his very soul, strong men bowed and strong hearts flowed with sad but si lent emotion so sudden was his over whelming misfortune. The remains of the unfortunate lad were removed to lowa from this place, and placed in the grave of his deceasej mother who died in that state some time ago. Great credit is due to Dr. P. Steb. bing, for the manner in which he res ponded to the demands of the sufferer He repaired to the spot the instant he heard of the sad news, and tfith kindly acts and words of sympathy gave con solation to the bereaved father—and set to work in a most skillful and sur geon like manner, (assisted by that able good man Dr. P. Hurly, who had then arrived,) in the tenderest way, accomplishing a most difficult task of restoring the distorted and blood, feat ures of the lad, ceasing their labors only when the mangled mass of humanity was restored so near as could be to its natural condition. It is difficult to concieve how, in j the lace of such accidents daily report ed some persons can be found who will ■venture life and limb in endeavoring to board trains while in motion ; it is a dangerous practice at any time, but dally so at a season like this, when no person is sure of his footing, and this accident should be a caution to all men on this or any other road, and if tempt ed to jump on a ear while moving last or slow, remember the fate that betell poor Tommy Wallace.
