The Democratic caucus met the same even: ing, but adjourned without action until to-day {Monday). The Virginia Legislature meets on Monday, 4th lust. It is a carious fact that In the House oy Delegates, of ninety-six members, with a single ex. ception—that of the delegate from Rockbridge county—every member is an “old line Whig;" while, in the Senate, the exceptions are but three or four, the remainder being all of the like party antecedents.

The revenue frauds at Pithole, far which <as announced by telegraph) several wells of the United States Company were lately seized by the Assessor, develop, upon inquiry, a systematic course of cheating trader the complicated interests by which oil wells are owned and operated.

The law thus been violated, but the defence was tbat this had been done under as understand- ing with tbe agents of the land Interest that tbe latter would pay their share of the tax after receiv ing their proportion of the oQ. Of course, tbe owners of the land interest paid nothing, and they non deny that they knew anything about It! The case is still under advisement.

Tbe testimony was entirely unfit for publi cation, but nevertheless attracted a crowded audl toiy of scandal-loving *»d vulgar men, and of wo men who sat with their veils down. In Westches ter county a suit for divorce has been brought by a Broadway lawyer, residing at White Plaint, against Mia wife, whom he accuses of attempting to poison him.

There were but two copies extant, and fabulous prices were offered for these by persons in the interest of the Hew York operators. The for innate possessors were dogged about and Impor tuned for private interview* with wine and money, till it floallyleaked out that the printed Utleebeetcov cred nothing more than a couple of quires of blank piper, slichcd and trimmed for samples. The anx iety to gel bold of advance Information as to the Secretary's views about the financial future later erish, notwithstanding he distinctly avows that his mind has undergone no marked change since the Fort Wayne speech. The sensation will be created by certain statements and recommendations from the Commissioner of Internal Bevenne.

Dec 3.—The KJpaso Mexican cor respondent ol the Utmld, under date of November 3, says the French General Brincourt left Chiahoa-r bua, movinc in tie direction of Durango, on .the 2iftb ult. This movement is the first confirmation of the report from the City of Mexico, to the effect that Marshal Baris was about to concentrate all his forces In the interior States. This u farther cor roboration of the fact that tbo French have aban doned the Slate of Sinaloa.

HAUL’S ARCTIC JOURNAL. Pull Particular* Concerning Crazier and Other Survivors of the Franklin Expedition. The following: are extracts from the journal of Capt. C. F. Hall, the Arctic Explorer, in which most interesting details arc given of Esquimaux reports concerning Sir John Franklin’s crew. Mr. Grinnell, in giving these parts of Capt Hall’s Journal to the pub* lie, says: “These extracts will give every one the means of forming his own opinion as to the assertion made by Mr. Hall, that some of the men of Franklin’s expedition may yet be living.” Dicmnt 6, 1601.—This night I have had a deeply Interesting Interview with several of the natives here. On the return of the walrus banters they almost uniformly call at oar Tillage during the evening to see and me. Tula evening Ar-mon first comes in. ' I ashed him when he was at Igloolik a few yean ago, (Too-koo-li-to was my interpreter in thislmportantmatter.) what names of Kob-lu-na* be beard of that he remembered t The answer was Farcy, Lyon and Crazier—the first two were Esh* e-mul-ta or captains,) but the latter one was not! . Ar-too-a. the An-not-ko, next came In. I may say here that this party haa never been lo Igloolik, hat be hsa seen and is well acquainted with many Inn its who have been. Be bad been to Felly Bay, which Is near Boothia Peninsula. While at my house Ar-too-a once told me that he bad heard* of Crazier when at Felly Bay, that be (Crazier) was one of the Kob-lu-nos belonging to the two ships that were in the Ice near Boothia for two years be lore the white menlefl them. 1 proceeded to ask Ar-too-a the questions of the names of the white men he had heard of from In nultt who bad been lo Igloolik. He said Crazier, Farcy and Lyon—he had heard ot others, hat coaid not now remember them. I asked him if be bad beard a great deal about Crazier, and be replied with warmth that be had, and then went on talk ing with Ar-mon and E-bier-blng, telling them bow much he knew about 'Crazier. , • • • Too-koo-U-to’a face glowed with delight as she said: That same man Crazier, who was In Igloolik when Farcy and Lyon were there, was Eshemntta (meaning captain inithU case,. the literally Chief) of OmPot . mlMloit to tbolceat Keitch-U-le. Crazier was the only man that would not eat any of the meat of the Koh-lu-nas, as me others all did. Crazier and_ the three men with him were very nungry,’but Crazier, though nearly curved and very thin, would not eat a bit of the koblunas—bewailed till the Innuit (who was with him and the three men) caught a seal, and then Crazier only ate one mouthlul—one little Wt first time. Next time Crazier ate of the scat be took a lltUe larger piece, though that was a little bit, too. One man of the whole number (there were four. Including Crazier) died because be was side. The others all lived and grew fat. and finally Crazier cot one In suit wirh his Hiak to accompany him and the iv o men *ln trying to pet lo the Kob-iu-nar country by travelling to the southward. _The In null* here think these two men and Crazier are alive vcl: think that they may have returned to Kcitch-U-le if they found they could not gel home lo the Kob-in-nar country, and lived again with ’“Kbrnmla at Peby Bay I CHICAGO, MONDAY, DECEMBER 4,1865.; lUe Innnlta that be (Crorier) a great many years betoro bad visited I-wil-Uk (Repulse Bay), Nu-c nung-ou-Jn-a (Winter Island) and Igioollk with two ships; that while at tbe latter two places be (Greater) cot acquainted with a great many In nulls. When 00-e-la and hta brothers, Shn-she ark-nnk and Ar-tdo*, beard tbe story bow hungry Crazier bad been, they felt very bad, for they bad beard bow very kind he (Crazier) bad been to the Innnlta at Ku-e-mmg-ou-jn-a (Winter liloud)and Igioollk, when he was at those places. Tbe In nulla at Peliy Bay beard of Crazier through their relatione who live at Neitch-iMe, The samelnnnits told them all about the two ships, and bow they were deserted; bow most all the Kob-lu-uas starved and ate one another. The two \rlntcn tbe two ships were in the ice near Ncilcb-lMe were very cold. The Imrults never knew such very cold weather—there was no sum- rmr between the winters—could catch no seals or kill any reindeer at most of tbe usual places where they were wont to find them. ESQUIMAUS mgTUDT. Relative to the Interview described, I was thank ful, delighted indeed, that Too-koo-U-to bad checked me when I was about to request her to tell the Innmts present what I bud In mind. A most important fact came onl in consequence, shewing that the Innnits far and near arc conversant with all the events of this nature that take place io their country. Tbe Pclfv Bay Innnlta, from what had been told them by Intmiis who bad seen Crazier, knew that he (Crazier) waa not an Esh-e-mul-ta (captain) when with the‘two ships that visited Igloollk and the other places. But they knew he (Ororier) was £eh-e*mat-la when at Neitch-U-le. Tbe fact that Cnvder was notan Esb-e-mnt-tawheu at Igloohk was well known to Oa-e-la, Shn-ebe ark-nak and Ar-too-a when they were boys. Erk lu a knows this well, and so it is known all tbe way from hers to Igloollk, and even Pond's Bay. I doubt not, ’ How remarkable It is that each matters are per p<lusted by a people that have no knowledge of books and writings. Bat these facts which I now .give record to cannot be learned is a moment Friendship and confidence most be established first, and even then there areobstaclcs ever in the way, which prevent rapid acquisition of knowledge among mis people. I am blessed with having E-blcr-bing and Too-koo-U-to for my company and interpreter?. FHAKKim’fl 

SHIPS. Sxczxbtb 7,lßG4.—This morning Erk-tu-a, (be rebel of E-wc-rat, and old.mother Onk-bar-100, called on me Juft after (be walrus-hunters bad cone to the walrus grounds. Too-koo-lido, my exccUant Interpreter, expressed her readiness to assist me. 1 began by asking Erk-to-a to report to me all the names'she could'recollect of the Kob-lu-nas she saw when at Igloolik. She began, and continued thus: Fa-rce, be Esh-e-mnt-ta (captain;) Ly-on, he Esh-e-mut-ta (captain*) Par-mo, he Esh.o-mul ta-nar (mate on Lyon’s ship;) 00-h-re (on Parry’s cm ship;) Cro-zhar, Esh-e-mut-ta-nar (mate or some officer not so great as captain, on Parry’s ship:) Pe-zart, a tall man, who she thinks was on Lyon's ship; Marg, steward of Parry's ship, same name as Parry's, an ma-ma (mother;) a boy on Lord’s ship, same name; nend-ton, she remembered well—a jollr fellow—wonld swing bis aims and cry An-ne eitf An-ne-ettl (Goooil go ontl) Erk-tn-a says that Cro-zhar (Crazier) was called Eg-100-ka by the Innnita. Grazier's name was given to old Auk-bar-loo’s sister’s son, whose name was Eg-100-ka, and Eg-too-ka’s name was given to Crazier. Innult Eg-100-ka k still living, but called 00-U-zbam (Cro-zhar). After Erk-tn-a had said ibis much, I opened Par ty's work, “Narrative of second voyage lor the discovery' of a Northwest Passage,” and turned to the list of officers, At, in the Introduction to said work. I readily made ont to whom “ Far-tne ” (as Erk-tn-a spoke the name) referred. Charles Palmer was one of the lieutenants on board of Lyon’s ship. “ 00-ll’-ze” I could not make onL I was somewhat troubled to make ont to tv bora “Pe-ran” referred, till I re quested Erk-tn-a to tell me tf she remembered any of the other parties as 1 read over and pronounced the names in the list. As I pronounced the name Fleher, she recollecied him well, and endeavored to repeat It after me. This trial at once told me whom she meant by “Pe-zart.” This was as near as the old lady could come to it in trying to speak (be name Fisher. I tried her time and again, but all she could do was to speak Pe-zart, Pczart, therefore lb© “Pe-zart” at Erk (n-a means Fisher. Now. there are two Fishers In the list referred to: George Fisher, chaplain and astronomer on board Parry’s vessel, and one Alex- under Fisher, surgeon on board Lyon’s. Erk-tn-a could only remember that the Pe-zart she knew was a tall man, and thinks be was on board Lyon’s “ Crazier, she said, was not an Eah-e-mnt-ta (cap. tain,) but was an Esh-e-roul-ta-nar, which means be was an officer of lower rank than captain. Whether ‘Marg’ (as Erk-tn-a pronounced It,) means Wm. Mogg, a name down in the list as clerk on board Lyon’s vessel, I do not know. I have given it above, and the description, Jast as Erk-ta-a gave It tome. She said thorewere two Marge, young men, one on Parry’s ship, the other on Lyon’s. Relative to Sir John Franklin’s expedition, Mother Onk-bar-100 says (very reservedly, in a way of letting me know of a matter that Is a great se crcl among the Innnlts), “that two An-nat-koa (conjurors) of Neltch-U-lean koo-ted so much that no animal—no game whatever—woppft go near the locality of the two ships which were in the ice near Neitch-U-le many years ago. The Inoults wished to live near that place (where Ibc ships were), but could not kill anything for their food. They (the innuils) really believed that the presence of the Kob-ls-nas (whites) in that pan of the country was the cause ot all their (the Innults) troubles.” Mother Onk-bar-100 continued: “One man would not eat the tlesh of bis from and Marred companions, and. therefore, when her nephew, Too shoo-ar-tar-ri-o. found Eg-100-ka (Crazier) and three other Kob-lu-nas with him, Eg-100-ka, who was the one that would not cat human flesh, was very thin (poor) and aimost starved. One of the three men with Eg-100-ka died, for be was sick, lie did not die from hunger, but because ha was very sick. The Innnlts all believe that Kg-100-la ana two men with him are still alive. Eg-100-ka was the same man she had before beard of as hav ing beat at Igloolik when two ships were there.” The two An-nal-koe at Neltcb-il-le were very bad' for they an-kon-ted (made charms) on purpose lo have the Kobdn-nas (whites) that were in the two chips two years in the lec, all starve to death. Sometimes Neitck-d-le An-nal-kos act very badly. UcrnißEu 6,1864.—1 now proceed with what was related to me In this evening’s Interview. When tbelr connn Too-fho-art-tar-ri-o first found Croricr and the three men with him. Cro rier's face looked bad—hl« eyes all sank In—looked fo bed that their cousin could not bear to look at bis lace. Their cousin care Crosier a bit of raw seal ai quick as be coaid when bo first saw him. bid not give any to the other three for they were fat, and had been eating the flesh ol their compan ions. It was near NeiTcb-iMo that this occurred, on the ice. This cousin U now living at Ncttch-U --Ic. When he (Too-sbo-art-tar-ri-o) first *avr Crorier and the men with him. he was moving, hating a loaded elcdae drawn by dogs- Be was going from place to place, making Icloo? on the ice—sealing. Crozicr and bis men had guns and plenty of pow der, shot and ball. ThrcousinlookCrozier and his men along with him and fed them, and took good care of them all winter. By-and-by they all moved to Neltch-11-le, and lived with the innnlts, who are very numerous there. One ol the men who were with Crazier died—not because be was hungry, bnt because be was sick. Beside a high difflnnuits saw something like now-yen (gulls) fall down to the ground dead, and would not touch them for Croricr bad done something to them—they (the Inualts) knew not what. In the summer Cramer and his men killed with their guns a great many birds, ducks, geese and reindeers. Crazier killed macy, very many of the latter. The Innnlts saw him do it. A Meltcb-11-le Innnlt went with Crazier and bis remaining two men when they started to go to tbeircountry. They bad a Kiak with which to cross titers and lakes. • They went down toward Oot-kce-seck-ka-llk (the estuary of Great Fisk or Back's .River I) Their cousin liked Crazier very much. Crorier wanted to give their cousin his gur, but he would not ac cept It. for he (Ibe cousin) was atraid of it—ha did not know anything about how to use it. Crozicr gave him bis long knife (sword as Too-kee-H-to and K-bler-bme interpret it) and nearly every thing he bad. Be had many pretty things. Crazier told Too shoo-art-tar-rio all ahont what bad happened, but be coaid not under-laud all. Ibis cousin is now alive, and -knows all that be saw and what Crazier told him. When I see tbelr cousin be will (ell it to me—they (my Informers) did not ask their cousin a great many questions about this matter, and are now sorry they did not, for if they bad they could tell me a great deal more. The story now is that Crozicr with his two men and a Neitch-il-Ie Innnlt started flora Neltch-iMe— in the summer or fidl—for the Kob-lu-naa 1 country, travelling to the southward on ibe land. They had a entail boat that bad places in the sides that would bold wind (air). From tbelr description, the boat must have been to Indian robber one. or something like it, with no low places in the sides for wind (air) to bold it up when in the water. [By this it would seem that Franklin may have had In his vessel* a boat or boats called Hanketts (air-boats) or Its equivalent. But 1 do not recollect of ever reading orbcaring about this particular; however, 1 believe be (Franklin), must have had something of ibis kind aboard bis ship). There were sticks or holes for this boat to keep It open (spread) when needed. This boat was wrapped or rolled up in a bundle or pock, and earned on the shoulder ol one of the men. The sides of this boat had something like Innnlt “drugs. l ' that could l>e filled with air. Crazier told the cousin about a fight be and many of his men (before they died) baa had with the In dians. Crazier used afterward to tell tbelr cousin many Interesting stones of what had happened to him while near Neitch-IHe. About the time Cro-. Tier and his company had the fight with the In dians, be used to go out bunting with his gnu. and to look at the land. One day when out on the land, as be was walkmg.along, he eaw, all at once. Indians creeping toward him nehmd some rocks. Sud denly one Indian very near him Jumped up from behind a big stone ana threw his uncc at him, hil ling him in the forehead. The lance passed right across the forehead of Crazier, Just above the eye brows, and cut a long, ugly gash In It, Crazier, having bis gun all loaded and ready, immediately shot at this -Indian, killing him instantly on the spot. All the other Indians then ran away. Next morning Crazier, with a boat load of hts men, went to the land where be bad killed the Indian, and there they had a big fight with (he seme Indians. The Indians having only lances, while the Eob-lu-nas had guns, were all killed by Crazier and his company. How many Indians died be did not know, but there were a good many. This story be told the cousin who took care of Croner and the few men with him after he found them. It was after this fight with the Indians that the men starved and froze to death, and then Cra zier and three men lived with tbelr cousin. No Kob-10-ua was killed when this fight occurred with the Indians. Crazier told their cousin that all the men were dead but himself and three men. Cra zier told their cousin of a brig named Vrat that be and bis men bad lived in in very cold weather; that many of the men starved and froze to death. Tbelr cousin told them (my informers)-©! several boats. One bad a great many things in it. Evening—l have had a talk this evening with : tic man. The gun of Crazier (said the e Innulls) their cousin womd not accept—he was very much afinld of tt-oiraid that It wonld kill him (the cousin)—lt made so much noise and killed any thing withont any one seeing how it did It. (Some of the Nfltch-11-le Innnlts very bad—two sorcerers killed all the Kob-ln-nts except Crazier and those tbelr cousin found. The two An-nar-koe killed them by bewitching all the animals and birds to keep away from that part of the country near where the ships were.) The preceding, In brack • els, was told me by Too-kee-li-to, who says that several different Innnlts have told her of it at va rious limes,but they do not whb me lo know it - Dec. 9,ISW— 1 7:80 a. a.—lt was one year after the coosin saw Crazier on board of bis ship m the ice nearNeitch-iMc. that he (tbcconsln) found Cra zlerand the three men with him. Crozicr was, at the lime of his finding him, almost starved—was tost like all bone in Els bee; his lace looked so bad that be (the cousin) could not look at it again for some time. Crazier had three men with mm who were fat. The cousin was moving when he found them—moving on the ice, having alongwitb him a team of dogs, sledge and bu family; was engaged sealing, living in Igloo on the ice. The cousin then beard (bat tho three men were fat be cause they had been eating the flesh of tbelr com panions, who bad died from freezing and etarviM- Croricr was so poor and nearly starved because ho wonld not eat human flesh. Tho condo pave, quick as be.could, to Crozier a very little piece of seal, raw, because bo could not stop to cook it, □e (the cousin) would not give either of the three men who were with Crozicr. because they had been eating human flesh and were fat. [Too-too-h-to says to me the actual reason of the cousin's not giving the three tthh any seal at the lime of giving Crazier some, may be found In this: The Innulls never give any raw meat toany of their people who have just been eating human (le«h,ou some time after (her have firetoeen fed (and that, too, fbr many days) on cooked meat. No one who has been eating human Oeeh I* allowed evea cooked meet till several dayi hue jfiised, If any InnuU Trun ebonld give any person any raw seal, for in stance, whose last food has been boman flesh, he would never ealeb another scab Certainly, there needs no farther explanation of the conduct of the cousin in not giving meat to tbe three men at the came time he gave It to Crazier. conduct was regulated on principle.] Ar-too-a said that It was several days before hU cousin cave any meat to the three men. At point A-too-a called for the chart, which 1 have often shown him and to others of bis people. It belongs to Dr. Kane's book of 1347. tub sum. Ar-too-a then told me that the two ships—in one of which was Crazier—that Anally went to Igioollk, first made into the bay by I-wli-Uk (Repulse Bay,) and then ran his Anger thence alon'* the chart to Lyon's Inlet, and near its en trance indicated about where the ships remained, while some boats went up the mlot. to the heed of It. Auer (hat, the same year, the ships nude harbor at an island, which be (AMoo-a) pointed out- [lbis Island la Winter Island.] In the winter the same Innnlta (who bad seen the two boats.) and many more of the natives, found the two snips- Bfifrra the two ships left this island all thelnnmts about there started to move to Ami. - too-ka.

I failed to doit; and then 1 took In hand Parry's narrative aud found that tbe Innnlt's oral history corresponded remarkably well with the written. I am often astenfahed at the correctness, exactness, of their traditions. - - From some conversation this evening with some ot llelnnmts, In connection with the subject of the fight that Crazier and bis men had with the Indians, one thing I am sure of, and Inis is, that a figut did occur near the estuary otthe Great Fish or Back's River. On-e-Ia and bis brother say that ilicircoasintoldthcm that it was a big island on which tbe Eob-ln-nas first lauded after leaving their ship. They (the Kob-la nas) did not put their things, which they took from the ship, all in oneplace on tbe land, but in many places. [One time two women went inland od this big lemntl,jnst for a walk, os Innnit women are wont to do. They came across a long, large, strong box, made of wood, which they could not open; so they took stones and pounded away upon Che box until they made an opening In It. It waa filled with ammunition and a great many other things.] What is here in brackets Too-koo-U-to thinks most have some mistake in it. bhe says G-bier-Mng, who waa my interpreter, mistook a boat for a box. sbu-sbe-ark-nuk says that two women found a boat tamed over—found it on an Island not far ftomNcUcb-iMe—and under It were a great many things, a good deal of powder, shot and hall. When his cousin saw Crazier, at the tunc be was nearly starved, he fotmd ont what (he black, fine sand, or something that was like It (powder) was for. SIB MORTON PETO AT HOME. What he Saw in the United States. A Glowing Pancgyrli, On bla return home to England from his American tour Sir Morton Pcto, the Railway King, delivered a speech In Bristol in which he gave an elaborate account of his observa tions during his late travels In this country. The London Times published the speech In full, from which we take the following Inter esting extracts: Sir Morton passed on to speak of the treatment bo received In the United States, and the unbound ed hospitality that fell to him there, no received kindness without precedent, and had the amplest opportunity siren him of knowing everything he neared to snow: and It was bis own fault if the dc*ire for knowledge was not more than era tilled. Ho went there at the most Interesting epoch in the history of Amerla—at the close ot the moat tre mnedous struggle known in medern times. Ho did expert to fin aexhaustion, and society somewhat disarranged; hot he saw nothing ot the kind. (Cheers.] There was nothing tbronghout the whole of the great country that would have led him to suppose such a struggle had existed. Sir Morton entered Into statistics which showed the rapid growth and development of some parts of the United State*, and be Instanced the city of Chicago, a few years ago a mere dot on the boundless prairie, but which had advanced from a small village to a vast city, with apopulaiion exceeding a quarter ot a million, and with public buildings finer than any city be. knewot. Sir Morton referred to the public works of the place, and especially a contrivance for carry ing off a nuisance that existed. Ann (n addition to the public works be instanced a magnificent uni versity which would be an ornament to any city. There was no subscription, and all bad a right to it. No distinction of denomination was known. Each particular denomination appointed its own theo logical tutor, and (he secular education was open to all alike. (Cheers.] Sir Morton also alluded to the vast growth of Boston and New York. To nn den-land America,' be said, you most go there, and no nun of business entering Hfe should consider nls education complete mull he had paid that coun try a visit* TUB van AND SIATSRT. Just a few words about the war. It was from the very first a war of principle. Slavery was at the bottom of it. [Hear, hear.] At the same timo he was bound to tell them that those who originated the war did not at the commencement of it see what would be Jt» final termination. Then was a ‘letter of Mr. Lincoln’s which he wished everyone of them had read, and before he sold another word let him say to them that the character of the great man bad never been appreciated in Europe, and when they came to read his letters, messages and aevpa’.chcs just published In New York, as be bad read the greater part of them, they would rise from the perusal with a profound appreciation of the man. and thankfulness to Cod that such a man lived in snch a time. Now, who fought in that war? There had been an Impression throughout England that the war was fought by mercenaries, but it bad been shown that ninety per cent of tbo«e who fought in that war were native Americans (cheers], and two-thirds of the remainder were of the German element, and the other third were Irish; and alter enlarging up on this feci and adverting to the manner in which the widows end orphans' of those slain la battle were cared for, Sir Morton Peto next said that be went to llhcoU, and found in every part of that great, fruitful, and glorious district that he could not speak to a man be met In regard to the war and its results, but that the tears would trickle down hrrface. and be felt that (ho great heart ol America was one In all that question and as to HssetUcmcut. jCbeere.] bo that East, and West, and Norm, and even South, he believed, would concur In the one t-cntiroent In regard to It, now that the war is set tled. [Cheers.] Bin HORTON AND A REBEL GENERAL. • * * Sir Horton Pcto next spoke upon what they might consider as the result of the war, and bo referred to an interview be had with a noted South ern Gcueral, whom, having been pardoned by the President, be had met at the house ol a merchant in New York. After dinner, when the gentlemen went to join the ladies In the drawing-room, be caught bold of the General and took him into tho conservatory, when bo asked what was the whole feeling of the South with regard to the Issue of aflaira: and his reply was that the Southerners fell they had done their duty while the s-niggle lasted, and had appealed to the sword. They bod now, however, taken the oath of allegiance to the North, and as men of honor they should never again try to dissolve the Union. [Hear, bear.] Sir Morton remarked that there were almost unlimited resources in the North, and they felt that the dork spot which bad come into every question since the Missouri Compromlse.fhat made everything difilcult in regard to legislation, was put an end to now. THR 

ALSO OPTION OF TOE All MX. Then as to the army. There was a wonderful thing in the absorption of that army. The United States army was 1,300,000 strong, and Geo. Grant had told him at St. Lonla he hod mustered out 875,000 men up to that day. Be stated that he did sot mean to have more than 50,000 men, and if their friends of the South were sincere, they would bring the army down to 30,000. [Cheer*.] If these men could go and be absorbed in civil life, it must show that ibe country possesses resources such as were never seen before, and which nations In Europe would do well to Imitate,. [Loud cheers.) INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JOHNSON- About the rc-coutirnetion of the South, one thing that occurred to him lo his visit to America was bis interview with the President. He was a rpf" whom, if once they were brought into contact with him, they would never forget- He was one of nature's true nobility. He bad not only talent and vnied. but, thank God, a heart as well. [Cheers.] Andrew Johnson was almost a Southerner, though he had not been treated very well by his country men on account of his upholding the Union. But it was a good thing far the South that An drew Johnscn knew bow lo forget and Jorpfr®* and he was meeting his brethren iu tho South in a way that such men should be met. He did not refuse to take them back to his confidence. If they only said, “1 am sort lor what I have done; lam ready to take the oath," the President's answer would lie simply, “My good friend, you are pardoned." [Cheers.] He (Sir Morton) bad read one of those pardons, and the condition was that If the party having that pardon should have a <lavc. or abet slavery, that pardon would cease, (bond cheers.) SIR 

MORTON AND A SOUTHERN PREACHER. And now let him ask them for a moment what was tho result of that policy to the blacks. Ho wrote to a friend whom be knew very well. He was a preacher very highly respected and regarded, and be (Sir Morion) know that no was a Southerner, and he was going to read them an extract from a letter of his. bur Morton Peto then read as fol lows: > " Bern in Louisiana, on my father’s sugar planta lion, near New Oilcans, I had known slavery in all its phases, though I have. bad no connection with it for twelve vean. Two year* ago (after the eman cipation of the slaves) one of my father's planta lions In Louisiana came Into my bands. There were one hundred and fifty negroes on the planta tion. From that dav to this I have not heard ot one instance of difficulty among tho workmen. The gentleman who leased the property for a series of year* Is a Southerner, and was a very ardent -cccssionlst. He is also a truly Christian man. He writes me that be has had no difficulty with bis workmen (hat was not very easily arranged by con versation. They have been paid regularly every month their ftul wages. Their children go to -chool, and the -work of the plantation goes oo with greater alacrity than when the negroes were ■Unvcs. The some may be said of several planta tions in the neighborhood, where the workmen are regularly paid and kindly treated. I have no fears for (be future of the freedmen, unless they are driven by harsh laws to array themselves against the whites. And if the South produces less in the .Utnre (b«n she has done In tho past, it will be be cause she does not legislate wisely. The barren ness of Jamaica to-day Is due to (he harsh legisla tion which drove the negroes from the plantations to their mountain patches, where what they pro duced was their own.” Sir Morion next gave an instance of slaves re ceiving their freedom, and he said be would men tion (he name because it wonld show that the beta could he inquired into. CoL Drury, one of the most prominent men of the Southern army, on the day that Lee surrendered, called togetberhls slaves, about one thousand in number, and addressed them to the effect that be had done the best for them hitherto, and henceforth they were free men. If they would continue to work for. him he would »Ivc them as big wages os anybody else, and would put Ihdr children lo school. There were only three who left. (Cheer*.) He (SirMorton) came home in Ibe Scolla with one. of those estimable men, like their dear friend George Thompson. Prolonged cheering.] He was a mem lierof the Society ot Friends, and told him that he was coming borne from iho Sonlb. where be bad been on a mission of mercy, and when he (Slr-Mor ton) told them that be had taken from the Society of Friends fifteenihousandponnds sterling and had disseminated it ia the most Judicious manner among the freedmen of the South, they would feel ready to wish (hat some others wonld u go and do likewise." (Cheers.) He thoosbt it wonld be a graceful and right and proper thing that the whole church, without any restriction and of every de comicatioD, should Join togetherand do something in that work. They recollected perfectly well what the North did in regard to our starving operatives doling the cotton famine. [Cheers.] The North wanted no help from England, but It would be a graceful thing, a right thing for them to do la - that work of mercy to which he had rclerred. TUB SOUTHERN WHITES. ’ Re had oo fear of the South, and be wonld tell them why. Uw ttisUUe South were noUtvi4t& over to the attorneys middle Kea >. Jamila tad been, but that Ibe oamere of the ealatea were looking after their workmen, so that they would be treated fairly, ir tbe f we f® n °i President had cbostlmifd* commission la the Sooth, and to that commit s ' Qn every question was referred. Wit b Imrattl to M>"o= men »ho emupkmed that certain maatera did »t't hire than wages, a notification came to Bj® effect that unless the employed received a right! - * lO of wages the gov ernment would withdraw all tU® ™ en ft ool ib® em ploy of those masters who refim properly com pensate them. There was a d»h ® m the North to treat the South In a spirit ol eqa *l7- bir Morion related an anecdote of a large capitalist who had informed him that he should not pa®" his debtors In the Southern Slates if they sooiud take their coats off and go to work. If such a it’tc of things were the case, he had no fear for the Sa’uth. Amer ica would not do what England ha* done in respect to Jamaica—emancipated the slaves swl let them take their chance [cnees>l; but America would rule them In equity and fairness, and they meat do (heir part. [Cheers.] He would say a word on one or two other mat ter?. First, with regard to FcnlanUm. What did Fmlamsm in America meant Well, It meant this, tuat a number of foolish Irishmen, having more moncy-than they knew what to do vrftb, allowed ,other people to pick their pocket*. [Laughter. The Irishman in America was a different being to what be was In bis own country. He bad there cast aside the influence of tbe' priest, and was- to .a certain extent his otvn master. He received two ; dollars a day, If he only took the position of the i merest laborer. Ihe honorable barooct went on to -remark that when be talked to some friends In America respecting the matter, they laughed at It, and said: “ Why does not England pat her own strong hand upon It and put an end to it? [Ap. (danse.) They were not in a position to do us any dJutt, and we could afford to show them our pity.” [Cheers.] ’He then adverted to the correspondence be tween Lord Russell and Ur. Adams, and expressed bis belief that it would not end m war. [Load cheers.] Such was not the .Intention of tbe American people. [Cheer?.] They had no idea of the kind [applause]; and when at New York, the other night, he was asked to give an address to the Union League, he labored bard to ehow how important it was that two countries, ad vanced m civilization, possessed of half the com merce ofthe world—of the same race and . ancestry —of the same language, of tbe same laws and the same literature, bound together by the rsamc ties, should be on amicable terms, and remarked that if these two nations were to imbrue their bauds in each other’s blood, it would be going back to the time when barbarism ruled instead of Christianity. (Loud applause, tbe whole assemblage rising to their feet and chccrizig tbe honorable baronet most enthusiastically.] NTrto aahcrttseinents ZP~C. n.
