Time's Pilgrimage. - to the the our not ! have loiter, and golden epoch, whoa. t t. J: I'lltn, for Th pilgrimage of old 1862 draw to a close. With rapid stride he last ap proaches the Winter of Death. A few short day and he will wrap the drapery of hie icy coach about him and lie down in endless sleep. The last sand are drop ping from the life-glass of th old year. How swiftly as an arrow from a strong bow, it ha flown) How rapidly the days, like chariot laden with the trophies of victory, have swept by 1 It seem bnt yesterday that we stood at the portals of the year, now so near its close, or returned thanks that the light of a New Year had dawned upon the tents of our pilgrimage. It seems as thongh but - a single forward step has been taken, for the shrines of the New Year's day are still in light but still it is the real fact that w have jour neyed a long distance, and are many day of toilsome travel nearer our journey' end than when the year began. We have mounted many a hill of Difficulty, rested at many a way-side inn of Content, drank of many a hitter pool of Sorrow, upon which we shall never look over which we shall never toil at which we shall never kneel again. We have passed on our journey many a milestone, and pluck ed old mo from it,' beside which we shall never again pause for rest. W have spoken sad good-bye to - friend friend whose faces we shall look upon no- more ; we have smiled at bridal whose pealing anthem of rejoicing W (hall never hear again ; we have stood at graves, and lain dear one therein, whose feet, will never again walk the green path of earthf and whoa sunny smiles will never again cheer our drooping spirits. , j But in the year so swiftly going, thus thickly strewing life with shadows, have we not also gathered, her and there, clus ters of plessant fruit by th wayside in which w journeyed T Have w not found leave of healing, with the cypres wreath, and sometimes, too, pearls at the bottom of our cups of sorrow T Uan we see no ray of sunshine through the lowering war- j cloud , u no sweet voice whispering Hope and Hap piness in th future T , Ah. yeat No life U wholly dark ; there are flower al well a bramble in every garden : there are joy and victories, a well a griefs and defeat in every expert nee.

BOWLING GREEN, KY., Nov. 29, 1862. 7b (a Kditur of lU Enquirtr ; - Soae tiatee the eoal of a sick eoldier is brought back almost from death's border by a cheering letter from home. No medicines ean eqnal it, no doctor words have bait the thee aad eoDaolation. Neat to the home- letter is home news, prosperity, saccess to friends, and Party triumph of principle and truth aad right. Yesterday a letter from my wife, to me the best of womea, cheered me so that I eonld walk eot from the hospital, and to-day I bought from the news-boy a copy cf the ' qrtirtr, and having read it through, I feel well enongh for writing a letter, and almost well enough for dntv. The people the Democracy the power of ire government, has again spoken load and clear, and strong as a thnnder-bolt for the "Coettitutioa aa it is, and the Uuion as it waa" No degradation of while men by placing asgro labor in competition with theirs. The people have responded to the command of Ood, and said we will not "covet our neighbor's man servaat or his maid servant;" we will sustain the Administration if it is right, but if it is wrong, we will demand it to return, through the ballot-box. Down with the Emancipation Protlaroatioo, says the late elections, down with Abolitionism ; and does the f resident near and will be beed the voice? That ballot box made him President; can't that ballot-box ando what it has done ; hasn't that ballot-box elected a Congress which hat power to inmate, through impeachment, what it has made through ballot 7 We only ask the question, haa it such power ? the speech ef U U Vallandigbam ta ene of the moat cheering signs of the times. Its power in the nation is worth its thousand men. There is in him a moral hero. Part of hi greatness consists in the fact that he nas never tattered, never Hesitated tor one mo ment to lift a voice for freedom and his in jured country. When the sky was dark above him, and the storm swept around him in its larv, he stood upon the old Deaocratio ship. aad amid her tattered masts, and above her breaking Umbers, bis voice was clear and loud, bidding bold defiance to the power that threatened him. Those were dark days wbea Vallandigbam, Ben Wood and Dan Voorhees we?e the few men who dared mention "Constitution." Newspapers were silenced, publie speakers were take from the stand and from their homes and cast into Baatilesto suffer, rot and die ; martial law was proclaimed, the writ of habtat corpus suspended, and a great cen tral power had laid tha ax at the root of re served rights, making way tor the mighty de potisns which was slowly lifting its head, set ting its foot upon the neck of constitutional freedom, and caitiag its proud glance over the continent And still these men are de. nounced as traitors and seceah, because they dare speak wnat our latnera died to achieve. And by whom? By the aoldters T No, bat Tew or tnem speak that way or U U V alien dicham. Thev love to read his speeches ; tbey say he is right, and to-day not a few eyes nave brightened aa l read to tbem what be said. Ne. I will tell von the class of men who abuse C. L. Vallandigbam as a traitor to bis country. I heard two of them denouncing him to day, and rejoicing over his late deleat, and hoping his speech at Cambridge City, Indiana, would be the cause of his arrest They are eitisens of this town, they are con tractor of the army id the beef line, thair name are omitted Editor. waa laat winter a strong rebel, took the oath of ailegi anee, held office, aad received pay under the rebel Government; smuggled cotton-cards through from the North to the South ; secur ed to their interests aad purposes all the means and capital of the branch Bank oi Kentucky. But soon after the evacuation of this place by Sidney A. Johnson, he turned "Union man," and now hold conjointly the beef contract with , who is so kiod and charitable to the Union cause that be charged twenty-two cenu a piece, and made tha Gov ern men t pay it, for hemming coarse towls for the hospital, when the towels could have beea bought raay hemmed tor twenty cents a piece. I am a sick soldier with but little money, lor 1 am ae contractor and no omcer. I walked op to these two aen Unlay and asked them to change for me one dollar, that I might buy some medicines, and took my eilver dollar and offered me eighty cents in post office currency, telling me that change waa worth twenty cents to the dollar. "A private soldier," thought he, "dirty and sicv, feeble aad sad, was a fine bait for a money sharker." Such are the men, and such are the circumstances ander which I heard that patriot statesman abused to-day. Well may contractors and those in high placet, when they hear of a Democratic eucceas, growl and ramble treaaoa, and secesb, and butternuts, bat the tide mast and will sweep on. A I sweep along down throujh one year and look into the Balls of the coming Congress, I can see the workmen allbuty; they are making the oof&n and digging the grave of Abolition ism ; tbey are legislating for the best interests of th poor white men of the North ; keeping the negro where he fs and leaviag the sin of African slavery between tbe people where it exist and their Ood, feeling that as we have aane, it is noes Of ear bueineea Proposing such term to the seceded States aa will be just and right under the Constitution, restore MW
