Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been re-opened to commerce. There h reason also to believe that theso proceedings have increased; rath er than' diminished, the friendship of Japan towards fie United States. The ports of Norfolk, Fernandinn nrd Pensacola, have been opened by proc Iftnation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is notsafer and more profitable to them selves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to thesa and other open ports, than it is to pursue through many hazards, and at vt cost, a con traband trade with other ports which arf closed, if not by actual military oc cupation, at least by a lawful and effec tive blockade. For my part, I have no doubt of the power ami duty ot the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States, It Congress should think that proceed ings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ouIit to be tuither regulator. I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domiciles and facilities for . their criminal occupation in our country.

Itl view ot the insecurity of lif.i io the region adjacent to the O inimiian border, by recent assaults and depreda tions, committed by inimijal and des perate persons who are harbored there, it has been thought pioper to give no tice that, alter the expiration of six months, the previous conditionally stip ulated ti.no m tho existing relations with great Hnlan, tho Ulile 1 Statis. must noi l themselves at liberty to iu creafie tiicir naval armamant upim the lak.s, if they should find that proceed ing ueeessary. , Tho condition of the border will uouessaiily come iato con sideration iu tho connection with the question of continuing or modifying ths ri-ht of travel from C mada through the United States, as well as the regu lation of imports which wero tempor arily ent-ibl'shed by tho reciprocity treaty of the tit!) of J une, I85i.

The a'jt pissed at ihe last session for the encouragement of imigiation has, as far as was pos-d'ole, been put into op eration. It seems to need an amend ment which' will enable the ofiioers of tho government to prevent tho practice of frauds against the' imigrants while on their way, aud on their ariival iu our ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition to waids this great national policy is man ifested by most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving tho "immigrants effect ive national protection. ' 1 regard our imigraotJ as one of . the principal re plenishing streams which are appointed by Piovtdence to repair the ravages of internal war, and its wastes of national strength and health.

For the actual receipts aud disbursements for the first quarter, and the estimated re ceipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the fiscal year and the general b'.l'ines of the Treas ury in detail, I refer you to the report ot tue Secretary ot the Treasury. concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of the monies required to meet the expenses concurrent upon tho war, derived from tax ition, should be increased, and I earnest' v invite your atten ion to this subject to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shad be required to inael the just, ex pectations of the Secretary.

The first exhibits a satisfactory condi tion and conduct ot the operations of the Treasury. The national banking system is proving to bo acceptable to capitalists and. to the people. Oil (be 25th of November, 584 nation 1 banks had been organized, and a considerable number ot which were conversions from State banks. Changes from the State system to .the national system are rapid ly taking place, aud it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no bank of isjtie not authorized by Congress, and no bank note circula tion not secured by the Government. That the Government aud the people will deiive general benefit from this change in the banking systems of the conntry can hardly be questioned. Th national system will create a reliable. aud permanent influence m support of me national creuu, anil protect tlie p!0 pie against loss in the use of paper mo ney. Whether or not any further leg islation is advisable lor the suppressisn ot State bank issues, it will be for Con gress to determine. . It seems quite clear that the Treasury cannot be satis factorily conducted, unless the Govern ment can exorcise a restraining power over the bank note circulation ot the country. The report of the Secretary of War, and tho accompanying documents,' will detail the campaigns of the armies iu the field since the date of the last an nual message, and also tho operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during the past year.'

The' report of the Seoretary of the Navy ' presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affiir of that Department and of the naval service. U is a subject of congratulation- and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy ot such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and suco'ss. The general exhibit of the na vy, including the vessels under con struction, on . the hrst ot December, 1804, shows a total ot 671 vessels, car rying 4,610 guns and '610,398 tons, he ms' ah actual increase during tMyeari WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1861.

There have been captu red by the navy during the year, 324 vessels, and the whole number of cap tures siuce hosti'i ios commenced is 1,300, of uliich 207 are steamers. Tne gros proceeds arising from the sale of condemned priz.j property, thus f ir re ported, amount to $14,390,250 5 1. A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be re port e J, The total expenditures of tho Navy De partment of every description, including tho cost of tho immense squadrons that have been called into existence- from tlie 4f,U of March. 1801, to the 1st of November, 1804, are $238,047,202 i. Your favorable con sideration is invited to the various recom mendations of the Secretary of the Navy, and especially in rcjrard to a Navy Yard, aud a suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vesls and the machinery and armature for our ships, to which refer ence was made in my last amurd message. Your attention is also .invited to tho views expressed in the report, in relation to tho legislation of Congress, at its last session, in respoat to prizes on our inland water.

Tho organization and admission of tlie State of Nevada has been completed in con formity with law; and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the moun tains which once, seemed a barren and unin habitable waste between tiie Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of tlio Pacific Ocean. The territories of tho United States arc generally in a condition of prosperity aud rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, liy reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have bairn onlv partially organised, but it is understood that tiij.se uiihodities are about to disappear, sir iruverunieiiN like I wiiidi vi:l . penult their governments li k. those of others, to go into speedy and full operation. As intimately cennected with, and promotive of this material growth of the u nion, 1 ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and important recuominjiidations relating to tho public lands, Indian affairs, tho Pacific railroads, and tumoral discoveries, contained in the re port of. the Secretary of tuo interior, which is here .yith transmitted, an 1 which report also embraces the subjects of patcuts,. pen sions . ana otue.r topics ot public interest pertaining to his department. Thoquautity of public laud disposed of during tiro five quarters ending on the 3Xh of September last, wis 4,221, 342 aares, of which 1,538,014 xvi-a were entered under the Homestead law.

The inaoino from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1701, was $87,8Jd, 2l ag.tin.st $13,-007,79-3 'received daring the preceding year. The aggregate of acres .surveyed daring the year has been cjual to tlie quantity dispos ed of; and there is open to settlement about 1 83, 000, IKW acres of .surveyed land. Ttio great enterprise of connecting tho Atlantic with the Pacific States by railway and telegraph linos, has been entered upon With a vigor that gives assurance of suc cess, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from tho prevailing high prices of muterials.and labor. The route of the main line of tho road has been definitely located for 10; miles westward from the initial poiut at Omaha, City, Nubraska, and a prelimina ry location of tho Pacific railroad of Califor nia has been made from Sacramento east ward to the great bund of Mucker river in Nevada. Numerous discoveries of gold, silver and cinnabar mines have been added to mauy heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra, Nevada and llocky Mountains and subordinate ranges teem with enterpri sing labor, which is richly renuinerated. It is believed that the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has, during the year, reached, if not exceeded, $100, 0UJ,0i)0 in value. It was rccom mended in my last annual message that our Indian system be reiuod elud. Congress, at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for recognizing tho system in California,, and it is believed that, under tho present organ ization, tho management ol the Indians tliro will bo attended with reasonable suc cess. ; .Much yet remains to bo done to pro vide for tho proper government of the In dians in other parts of tho country, to ren der it secure for the advancing settler and to provide for tho welfare; of the Indians.

It is peculiarly the people's department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other. I coinmen 1 it to tha continued attention and fostering care of Congress. Tho war continues. Sinso tho last annual Messagj all the important lines and positions then oeeupia 1 by our forces have been main tained, and our armies have steidily advan ced, thus liberating the regions left in the roar, so that Missouri. Kentucky, Tonnoswe, and parts of other States, have again pro duced reasonably fair crops. Tho most re markable feature in the military opoarations of the year is .Gen. Sherman's at tempted inarch of. :-!';) miles directly through the in surgent region. It tends to show a great in crease of our relative strength, that our tienraVin-chicf should feel able to hold in check every active force of tho enemy, and yet to detach a well-supported, largo army to move on such an expedition. The result not , vet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged. Important move ments have also occurred daring the. year, to the ctFeet of moulding society tor durabil ity iu the Union. Although short of com plete success, it is so' much in tho right di rection that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Arkansas urid Louisiana have organized , loyal State Governments with free Constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them. Tho movement in the r,ain direction, more oytensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucy and Tennessee, should not be over looked. But Maryland presents tho exam ple of complete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Mary land Like another foul spirit, being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more. At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of tho Constitution aoolishing slavery throughout, tho United States passed uio oouar.e, out tailed tor tact nt the room site two-thirds vote in the House of llepre sentatives. Although tho present is 'the same Congress and nearly the same niem- oers, without questioning the wisdom or pa triotism of those wno stood iu opposition, I venture to rocsoniuiedd the reconsideration and passage of tho measure at tho present session, ui course the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election shows almost certainly tnat the next Con gross will pass ths measure, it this does not. Hence there is only a question of time as to when tho proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it to so go at all events, may we not agree that tho sooner the belter, it is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on Members to ciiaoje tueir views, or their votes, any further than, as an additional clement to be considered, tiietr judgment may be affected "j lt- It is tiie voice of the people, now t.ir the hrst tiuio hoard upon tiie Question In a great natioaal crisis lise uurs, unanimi ty of aoliou among those seeking a common' cud, is very desiraole almost indismmsib'le: and yet, no approach to such unanimity is attamai.no, unless sonic deierence shall bo paid to tne will ot the majority, simply be cause k is tho will of the majority. In this case, the common cud is tho main tcuance of the Union; and among the means to secure that end, such will, through tli election, is most clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment Tho most reliable indication ot public purpose in this country, is derived through our popular e- lections. Judging by the recent canvass, of its result, the purpose of tlie people within the loyal states to mimum the integrity ot tuo l. nion was never m jro Una, nor more nearly unanimous, than now. The extraor diuary calmness and good order wi-di which the millions of voters mot aud mingled at tue polls, gave strong assurance ot tins. Not only all those who supported tho Union ticket, so called, but a great majority of the opposing party, also, may be fairly claimed to entertain, and to bo actuated by tho sumo purposes. It is an unanswerable argument to tins elleot, that no candidate tor anv of fice whatever, high or lo', has ventured to seek votes on tha avowal that ho was for giving up tho Union. There lias been much impugning of mo tivos and muoli heated controversy, as to the proper moans and best mode of advanc nig tne union cause; nut in tne distinct is sue ot Luion or no Luiou, tne politicians have shown by their instinctive knowledge, that there is no diversity among the peojue. In awarding tho people the fair opportunity of showing, one to another, and to the world, this firmness and unanimity of pur pose, the election has been ot vast value to tho national cause, The election has exhibited another fact, not loss valuable to bo known ; the fact that wo do not approach exhauston in the most important branch of national resources, that of levying men. While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves, and caused mourning to so many homos, it is some relief to know that, compared with tho surviving, the fallen havo been so few. Whole corps, and divisions, and brigades and rcginieuts, have formed and fought; and dwindling, and have gono out of ex istence. A great majority of the men who comprised them, are still living. The same is true of the naval service; Tho election returns prove this. So many voters could not -else be found.

Thus swelling the aggregate to 4,075,773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war, to 149,751. " Atable is append ed, showing particulars. To this again should be added the numbor of all voters in the field, from Massachusetts, Khodo Island, New Jersey Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, aud California, who, by the laws of those Statos, could not vote vote away from their homos, and which number cannot bo less than ninety thousand. Nor yet is this all. The number in or ganized Territories is treple now what it was lour years ago; while thou a ids, white and black, join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines. Ho much is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced, or to show that it won'd have beeu greater, but for the warr which is probably true. The important fact remains demonstrated, that we have more men mw 

TERMS 82 PER ANNUM than ever, Ihe national resource, tnon, arc unexhausted, and as wo bel'eve, inex haustible. The piib'ij purpose to reestab lish and maintain tho national authority is unchanged: and as wo believe, unchangeable. The manner of continuing the ellort re mains to choose. Oil careful con -adoration of a' the .evi dence accessible, it, seems to mo that no at tempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in auy good. He would accept of nothing short of tho severance of the Union. His declarations to that effect are explicit and oft repeated. Hi docs not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no ex cuse to deeeivo ourselves; 'wc cannot volun tarily yield it. Between him and us the kaio is distinct, simple and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war, and decided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten. If the South ern peopl i fail him, ho is beaten. Either wy it would bo tho viotojn? ik1 defeat rbV lowing war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not necessary true of those who follow. Altlio' he cannot re-accept the Union, they can. Some of them we know alredy desire peace and reunion. Tho number of such may in crease. They can atany momenthave peace, simply by Living down their arms and sub mitting to the national authority under tho Constitution. -After so much, the Govern ment could not if it would, maintain war against them.. . The local people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should re main, wo would adjust them by the peace ful moans of legislation, conference, courts, and votes; operating only 'in constitutional and lawful ohannols. some certain, 'and other possible questions are, and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust. For instance, tho admissission of members into Congress; and whatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself would bo greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeiture.-;, however, would still be within Executive control. In whit spirit and temper this control would be exor cised, can be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago, general pardon and amnesty up on specified terms, were olorcd to all except certain designated classes; and it was at the same time made known that tho excepted classes wore still within contgmplaliou of special clemency. During tHij year, many availed themselves of the general provision; and many more would, only that tho signs of bad faith in some, lod to such precaution ary measures as rendered the practical pro cess less easy and certain. During the saiuo time, also, special pardons have been grant ed to individuals of the excepted classes; and no voluntary application has bean de nied. Thus, practically, the door has been for a full year, open to all except such as wore not in condition to make free choice; that is. such as were iu custody, or under constraint. I t is stiil open lo all; but the tims may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it bo closed, and that, in lieu, more vigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted. In pmsenting the abandonment of arm ed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgnuts as tho'only indis pensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I'retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat tlie declaration made a year ago, that while 1 remain in my present position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipa tion proclamation, nor shall I return to sla very any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of tho acts of Congress. If the poople should by what ever modo or means, make it m'y esocutivo duty to ro-en-lave such persons, another, and not I, must bo their instrument to per forin it. In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say, that tho war will close on the part of tho Government, whenever it shall havo ceased on the part of those who began it.

Mr. Morgan presented tbfrt, credentials of Charlos Smith and R. Cutler King as Senators elect from tho State of Loui-iana. Ho did not propose that these persons be now sworn in as members of this body, but the Senate would be much better informed and qualified in relation to all the proceedings connected with' the election af ter they have been carefully examined and reported upon by a committee of this body.

He moved to reconsider tho motion of reference. In the twenty-four hours since tliis bill was in troduced, great mischief has been done, and every day and hour this bill remained where it was still greater mischief will result ia raising the price of gold.-. It indicts three States of the Union, and makes every man guilty of a misdemeanor, and every claupo of it commits the HouNe to an impossibilr' ty. Gold rose yesterday twelve per.
