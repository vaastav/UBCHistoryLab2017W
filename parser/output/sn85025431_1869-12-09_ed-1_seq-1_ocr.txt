AUSTIN, MINN., DECEMBER 9,186!). "J. is an unpleasant fact thai nearly all classes of men, with perhaps the single exception of dealers in money, are to-day unable to meet (heir indebt 0 Ineaa. We speak now, more especial ly with reference to Minnesota, though the same remark is true of most other new Western States. The common ex planation of this undesirable condition of things is that the product* of the State being at a low price in market, while articles of importation required for lomc consumption are extremely high. .ct us accept this theory, which is un doubtedly correct. The staple product ni'the State is wheat. To-dav, the far utcr goes to market with a load of this commodity and receives therefore the sum of sixty cents per bushel. He takes his money and goes to the mer chant to buy clothing and groceries l'ir his family, and pays for them near 1 or quite as high a prioe as was de manded when wheat was worth one dollar per bushel. The machinery with which he tills the soil and gathers his harvest costs as much now as when wheat brought double the present price. The causes which keep merchandise up to the present standard and operate so unjustly towarus iiid JfwuTlcing clss? are found in the financial problems that now agitate the country, and are consequently beyond the control of our home merchants. Eveu if they could get their pay, the traders of Minnesota are deriving very little more profit from their business now, than when wheat was worth a dollar and twenty five cents per bushel. Hundreds of merchants in all parts of the State are insolvent, and many are going into bankruptcy. They claim that this is because the farmers will not pay them. Now, here are two prominent facts, I^oth of which are of sufficient impor tance to command attention, first the producing classes of the State are at the mercy of traders, and second, mer chants are crippled in their business in consequenae of the failure of customers to pay their debits. How to avert such calamities in the future is the problem of the hour. The present unfortunate condition of the fanning population of 3Iinnesota is the certain and inevitable result of re lying upon a single product. In this instance the product is wheat, it might be something else with the same results. Pork, beef, butter, and cheese, and young stock, all command a good price, and how many farmers mourn that tbey have not now these products to sell. But the fault is their own, and this experience, ought to be sufficient to teach them to devote henceforth, at least, half their money and time to stock raising. Again, the vast expenditure for ma chinery that is now impoverishing so many farmers should be reduced at lea9t one half. The extravagant pur chase and profligate use of reapers, see ders. mowers &c., is absolutely astonish ing. This farm machine business has become a mania, aud will ruin the country unless checked. There is hard ly a better grass growing region in the west, than southern Minnesota, and the sooner the people turn their attention to this branch of industry, the sooner will they relieve themselves from the embarrassed condition they are in to-day. Wheat is good, but like anything else, to much or it will make a man poor Merchants, as well as farmejs, are also in trouble, and the fault is partly their own Since the war a large number pf young men, with a few hundred dollars and no business capacity or experience, have set themselves up as merchants. Tne west, always offering an ample field for enterprise, has become crowded with this class of traders, all anxious to dis pose of their wares. Competition has been active and the demand for credit has been great, which,, they have not been slow to gratify. Consequently a majority of these unexperienced trades men find themselves to-dfay embarrassed beyond hope of recovery. The goods they bought on time w* Wt Pa"l ^or their customers have BO money, aud bankruptcy stares them in the face. These evils may be avoided in fu ture. At least one-third of those who call themselves merchants should buy a peico of prairie, go to work and help strengthen the productive forces of the country. The balance should sell only for cash,cxccpt to a few who are known to bo prompt and honest. It is proverbial that a Western man will buy anything lie can get trusted for, whether he needs it or not, but the pay day is too frequently forgotten. The credit system is the father of dis honesty and ruins both parties, those who trust and those who get trusted The experience of these dark days oughtAo be worth something. The ca lamities of the past ought to be a warn-, ing for the future. Minnesota needs to-day fewer merchants and wiser farm ers. The raising of herds, to consume tho herbage of our vast pasture. lands, must take the place, in part .at least, of wheat growing before our agricul tural communities will be relieved from their hardens of dabt. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The first annual message by Presi dent Grant was sent to Congress on Monday. It is much more lengthy than we had anticipated, but its length is dne to the multitude of topics on which it ranges. Upon these topics the views of the administration has been looked for with intense interest. On the Financial question, the Presi dent gives very satisfactory ideas, which will generally be endorsed by the Re publicans, and which has been awaited with deep anxiety. He considers the irredeemable currency an evil growing out of the war, which should command the early attention of Congress, and that a part, and one of the highest du ties of the government is to secure to the citizens a medium of exchange of fixed unvarying value, and that immedi ate resumption, if practicable, would not be desirable that it would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium of gold at the date of their purchases and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. He earnestly recommends such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments, and put an immediate stop to fluctuations inthe value of currency to secure which, the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented and to withhold from circu lation all such currency redeemed until sold for gold. He puggests that-the Governor of Georgia be empowered to convene the old Legislature requiring each- mem ber to take the oath, who are eligible under the third clause of the 14th amend ment. He takes a bold and high tone towards England regarding the Alabama Claims and opposes a reciprocity with Canada and recommends a neutral attitude to wards Cuba. Our foreign relations are generally in a very satisfactory condition. A synopsis of the reports of the va rious Departments of the goverment is given, exhibiting a healthy condition of their transactions, during the past year. On the whole, the message is a good one, and will command the praise of all good men. It is fair, candid and coin Lj eise, treating the various matters with commendable sagacity, and casts into shades all doubts as to the poliey which the administration designed pursuing, Of this message we shall speak again mora at length.-- W» ntg« our-reader* to carefully read it and ponder on its many suggestions and see if does not campare favorably with their own views. Wo shall lay it before our readers either in supplement or in next week's issue. The luconae iaw. The law imposing the Income Tax, expires during the coming year by its own limitation, and it will bo removed, unless Congress shall renew it. There are mauy advocates for Exemption of incomes, but we are not yet prepared for it. Our National debt is still heavy, and though it has been decreas ed at a rapid rate, unprecedented in the history of Nations, yet the improve ment in our crcdit is not sufficient to invite undue liberality when we get our debt into consuls, bearing a lower rate of kterest, we may begiu to let up a little, Only through this law do we reach the wealthy bondholders, who have put their capital into bonds, which are not taxable, either by the State or Nation. As a political measure the Republican party must not assume, the responsibility of exempting from taxation the wealthy men who draw large incomes from coupons, iuterest "and rents. It is enough that we have to contend against repudiation ists and those who complain because bonds are not taxed, without adding ',l jtfiother privileged class. Such bond* holders are taxed on their net an nual income, and in that way help to support the government. It will not do to tax the income ofthe enterpris ing manufacturer who puts his mon ey in works which sustain a large population conferring thereby immense benefits on the community at large, and then exempt the crafty capitalist who seeks the safest and least expen sive investments that can be found. "The bond owner has exemption enough—we are willing to abide by «the, contract we made with him to thc{ utmost of the letter and spirit thereof —but no more. At present ouly lefc tho tax on the'poor man's tea, eofiee and sugar be taken off—but let the wealthy render to the govern ment,the tribute due to it for the fidelity with which their interests have been always guarded. It is said our people are uncommonly sensitive about officials prying into their private affairs. There is force in the objection but they have been taught by the events of the late war to snbdue their extreme sensibility. It WJS some time before we quietly submitted to direct taxes, but we* have., come to it «n.d BPW consider- it t'ne best adapted mode to our necessities. We are not prepared to djjgpens? with tho income tax. It meets our present necessity. Our chief concern is to pay thft. debt, improve the public credit, until. thei payment of interest is reduced, and then talk about exemption to those who consider themselves oppressed..

Richardsn, who was shot by McFarland, in the N. Y. Tribune office, last week, died on the 2nd. We suppose, Mr. McFarland stands before the world a murderer, but is there, judging from the past, any likelihood of his receiving the punishment he justly merits. A plea of insanity will doubt less set him at liberty. Previous to his death, Mr. Richardson was married to Mrs McFarland, by the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Horace Greely and others being present.
