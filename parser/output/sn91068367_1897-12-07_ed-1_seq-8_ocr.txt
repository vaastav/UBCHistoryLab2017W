Tho Military court at Prague In SomIoo, "With tho Hangman and a Priest In At Scaulauoe for Summary Execution of Con ! nned Rioter Prague, December 3. Tha city authori ties, Che Bohemian National and the atudenu associations, and the workmen' a aieciatles met today .nd appointed a vigi lance) committee. The- stadthalter was than waited upon and Informed that the -object of the committee was to soeuro rder and safety of life and porperty. The stadthalter was requested to with draw the troop, hut this ihe refused to ak, declaring1 that he was responsible tor the maintenance of order. The stadt fcalter, toowever, invited the deputation sYom the vigilance committee to request th committee to use its Influence to pre vent further disturbances. Another regiment of infantry and a sjejuadron of dragoons have arrived to re inforce the garrison here. , At Pllson last evening the troops were ailed upon to dispense a riotous mob of 4everal thousand youths. Some of the tlatter were wounded and many arrests were made. Subsequently the. military 'Jorces were withdrawn. The town has sdnce heen quiet. Owing to an attempt to wreck the Bo hemian schools at Badenboch, military '.assistance lias been asked for to. quell the disturbances. At Beraum the windows of the houses ocupied by Germans and military offi cers were broken yesterday evening. Th troops subsequently occupied the streets .and dispersed the rioters. , .Although the streets of Prague are still patrolled "by the military, business is being gradually resumed. A military court has been established at the court ttouse, and the Ideal 'hangman, his as sistants and a priest, will remain there txntil further orders, in readiness to carry ;-ut death sentences, should such steps be necessary. The troops now here number twenty-six "battalions of infantry and two -aquadrons of cavalry. Serious excesses aro reported to 'have been committed at Koeniggraetz, whera the PTaenkel 'hotel -has been partly de molished. Troops have been dispatched there. Reports from various places in Bohe mia, including New Bidschow, Melnik and Kralup,' tell of disturbances during the last few days, the houses of Germans and Jews being attacked by the Czechs. The Germans of Bodenbach made repris als m the neighboring Bohemian village of Kroeglitz, where a school, two inns and a shop were attacked. A number of jeople were 'badly injured, despite the in tervention of the police and burgomaster. The Germans also fomented riots at Gablonz, stoning a Bohemian school. It was necessary to call out the troops to quell the disturbance. Vienna, December 3. A deputation of -Germans from Prague that waited upon Baron von Gautsch von Frankenthurn, the new Austrian premier, today were as sured that every measure possible would toe taken to preserve order and protect property. Herr Kramarsh, vice president of the relchsrafh, declares that neither he nor Dr. von Abrahamovlcs, its president, will resign in the face of mob intimadition. He considers, however, that it will be impossible to carry the Austro-Hunga-rian compromise bill in t'he reiehsrath, id that the present arrangement with Hungary will 'have to be prolonged by imperial decree, without the assent of the reiehsrath. This probably . means the Indefinite .proroguation of that body and the reign of something li'ie absolute gov ernment. The enforcement of the system of sum mary trial without appeal at Prague speedily quieted the disturbances, there. ITaur rioters who were arrested yesterday were tried last night and sentenced to twenty years penal servitude within three hours of the time of their arrest. There seems little to choose between the Oermans and t'he Czechs. In towns where the former predominate they have committed eerious excesses against the latter. Thorn Sentenced New York, December 3. Martin Thorn, or Torceswisky, convicted on Monday of 'the murder of William Gul- densuppe, was today sentenced to toe electrocuted in the week beginning January 10, 1898. When Thorn was brought into court In Long Island City he stepped as briskly, walking between two officers, as he had done on the days when 'he was on trial. He preserved the same -calm, imperturbable" expression of -countenance that he had worn at ev ery crisis in t'he working out of has fate during the trial, and when, as a pre liminary to the passing of sentence of leiath., Judge Maddox put the custom ary questions to him, he responded promptly, collectedly and without out ward 'evidence of emotion. Thorn listened to the sentence with out moving a muscle and when the Judge had finished, he inclined 'his head -slightly forward as if bowing to the court.' The prisoner's- lawyers then lianded up an affidavit applying for an Appeal. Justice Maddox took the affidavit and avill pass on it later.

At a late hour tonight "Mother" McKinley was reported sinking and the physician fears will not live until morning. Whatever the outchme. President Mc Kinley will be in Washington for the opening of congress next Monday. Although there has never been in the history of the government a case ex actly similar, It is necessary for the president to be at the capital in person at the opening of a session of congress to receive the Joint committees from the two houses. Until this committee has waited on the president and receiv ed his communication the regular bus iness of congress cannot proceed. He has arranged 'to leave Canton at 2:03 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the spe cial car provided for "him attached to the regular Pennsylvania train which reaches Washington Sunday morning. He "will leave Washington as soon as possible after attending to the func tions of opening congress. The train bearing the president made record -breaking time after leaving Pittsburg. At that place Assistant Secretary Day, while the president was asleep, accepted the offer of the rail road company and a special engine was attached to the car. Without the loss of a moment, the special engine dashed out of the smoky city. All trains on the route were put on side tracks and the last 101 miles were reeled off in two hours.

Fayettevllle Presbytery met in the Presbyterian church at 7 o'clock last evening, Rev. Mr. Ferguson acting as moderator and Rev. P. R. Law as sec reatry. Besides the members of the body, there was quite a large gathering of those interested in the proceedings. Representing the Fayetteville congre gation, protesting against the absolu tion of the pastoral relations. Captain S. C. Rakin and Messrs. H. McD. Rob inson and G. G. Myrover addressed the presbytery; Rev. A. J. McKelway, spoke forcibly as to his position and his convictions of duty, and Revs. Dr. H. G. Hill and Mr. Craig urged the granting of Mr. McKelway's request. Dr. Hill's remarks were able .clear and convincing. Evidently presbytery re garded the superintendency of home missions and the editorial management of The North Carolina Presbyterian as forming a field of work of greater im portance than the pastorate of the church, for the relations were dissolv ed by an overwhelming vote. Fayetteville is much pleased to learn that Colonel Gardner, chief engineer of the Atlantic Coast Line system, contem plates residing in Fayetteville hereaf ter. He has just as many friends here as he has acquaintances, who will cor dially welcome him, and make pleasant the home if the evening of his days. Mr. Herbert Lutterloh and the fair bride whom Wilmington bestowed on on him have returned from their wed ding trip, and are making their home with Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Lutterloh on Haymount.

A General and Heavy Snow Storm Cedar Rapids, Iowa, December 3. Eight inches of snow and suspension of street car traffic is the situation here. Omaha. Neb., December 3. Snow has fallen in Nebraska continuously for twenty four hours and In some parts ! of the state it continues. At Omaha ; t'he fall amounts to about eight inches i and in the northern part of the state it : Is much heavier. Hartington reports sixteen inches and still falilng. The ; snow is general in western Iowa and South Dakota. The storm has stopped the gathering of corn, with fully a fifth of Nebraska's big crop yet in the neld. The movement of trains is greatly ham pered and the wind, which is rising to night, may cause troublesome drifts. Minneapolis, Minn., December 3. The first accident due to the-present bliz zard occurred at Durham, Mont., this morning. A Great Northern passenger train was derailed, , engineer William Clark was killed and three other train men w.ere injured. Kansas City, Mo., December 3. Though the snow storm of yesterday and today has been general throughout Kansas and northern and western Mis souri, railway traffic has been but slightly impeded. In southern Kansas, where the fall of snow has been un usually large for the season and where zero weather was experienced this morning, there is some suffering among settlers who had neglected to secure fuel. Slusxon the Champion New York, December 4. By defeat ing the champion Ives, George F. Slos- son, won the series in the billiard tour nament for the championship of the world. During this series the "student" has won against all of his opponents. taking four games. Tonight's game was one of the finest exhibitions ever given here. Ives held the lead until the very last inning, being within two of the game when Slosson, far behind, took up his cue. The "student" by marvellous work ran out and won with sixty points in the forty-first inning. Schafer takes second place with three games won, Ives third, Daly fourth and Sutton, who lost all his games, last Ives wins the best grand average prize and the prize for the highest run which is the record. 140.

IOP0RTA1II TAX QOESTiOn WHETHER f FERTILIZER DEAL ERS MUST PAY PURCHASE TAX Tne TrtMnrer and tha Attorney General Iiffer In Opinion A &top Put to Giving Away Trees from the Capitol Square K wardt for Arreat of the Murderer of Kn-gn-r Itumgardner Coremoalee at K Interment of Kemaina of General Cling mn ,- 'Messenger Bureau, Raieigh, N. C, December 3. John F. Croorn, of Magnolja, writes the agricultural department that he Is a dealer in commercial fertilizers and that the commissioners ot his county, Duplin, insist that he must pay the "merchants purchase tax" on , fertili zers. He insists that fhe tonnage tax covers all taxes on fertilizers.. The com missioner of agriculture did not pass on the matter, but sent It to the treasur er, together with section 2205 of The Code, which says that whenever any manufacturer df fertilizers shall have paid the tonnage tax his goods shall not be liable to taxation hy any city, town or county. The treasurer refers the case to the attorney general, who says that under section 22 of the reve nue act of 1897 Croom is clerly liable; that he is simply a buyer and seller of fertilizer. The treasurer does not take the same view. No doubt Croom will make up a case so the supreme court can pass upon the matter. This year's sales of fertilizers in this state exceed $4,000,000, so the tax is quite an item, of course. The agricultural department reports that the sales of fertilizers this au tumn are 33 1-3 per cent, greater than they were a year ago. Methodist ministers, who are here in such great numbers, say they find the people in the state bent upon having good government. The populists are very earnest about this matter, they say. Rains are again falling. The state 1s badly behind on rain. Small, grain needs it. Cotton fields are 'being ploughed up and put In wheat. It is said that it was the purpose to day to give away some more trees from the capitol square to private individu als. But the board of public building and grounds has checked the move ment. ., The annual meeting of the directors of the insane asylum here will be held next week. This year not a company of the state guard has been disbanded. For Osborne Lambeth, the white tramp who murdered Engineer Bum- gardner near Hendersonville, no less than $800 reward is offered, $200 being 'by Mrs. Bumgardner. It is believed that the murderer is in hiding near the scene of his crime. The republicans are now saying that next year they expect to nominate congressmen in each district in the state. They think they can do with out populist help. There is to be another hearing, of Governor Russell's side, 'in the 'North Carolina railway lease matter . this month before Special Master Kerr Craige. The time for hearings ends January 26th. John C. Dancy, colored, says he is now sure of the appointment, as col lector at Wilmington. 'A snowy owl, 5 feet from tip to tip, was received at the state museum to day. It was shot Tuesday during the day In Hyde county. It is the second ever killed in the state. It is a true 'Arctic owl. Some times during the win ter these owls make a flight as far south as Long Island. '. The ceremonies at the reinterment of General Clingman's remains at Ashe- ville will be imposing. There will be a (battalion of troops, the Bingham cadets, the confederate veterans and the sons of veterans. Revs. J. S. Felix and McNeely DuBose officiate. W. H. S. Burgwyn, Theodore F. Davidson and V. S. Lusk will make memorial addresses. The first great Methodist revival in 'North Carolina occurred here in 1811, during the first meeting of the Vir ginia conference here. It met in the. old capitol. At that time, and in fact for many years later, there was no North Carolina conference. 'It' is said that t'he failure of the Piedmont bank at Morganton will be a bad one. During November the highest tem perature here was 76, the lowest 27 de grees; the mean being 53, or2 degrees above the average. The rainfall was 3.43 inches, an inch above theaverage. The deficiency in rainfall this year Is 16.78 inches. 1 hoso Who Kndure The pains of rheumatiism should be remindeu that a cure for this disease may be found in Hood's Sarsaparilla.

XXATTIATf 3 EXCITCD Over If ewa ef Approach of Two Worth I p Tbo "Wawhlp" aro 2aTaJ BebooUhlpa Now TJruUioc la the ITeet Iadle " Washington. December 3. The Haytian minister, Mr. Leger. was an early caller at the state department today, having news from home of a most disquieting nature, of which, he wished to talk with the officials. Secretary Sherman being still confined to his home by a coM. and Assistant Secretary Day having attended the president on his' Journey to Canton, Second Assistant Secretary Adee was acting as secretary of state, and to him Minister Leger had recourse. It appears that his government has cabled him from Port au Prince that the Haytian consul at Kingston. J a., had telegraphed that two German warships safled yester day from that place for Port au Prince. The news had created the greatest ex citement in the town and all over the island, and disturbances were appre hended. The foundation for the statement is be lieved to be that the two German echool ships which have been cruising in south ern waters, are Just starting on their way northward to the United States. About the middle of last September the Ger man charge d'affaires nere, Mr. Reiche nau, formerly advised the state depart ment that the German cadetship Stein would arrive at Charleston. S. C, Feb ruary 2nd next, and that the cadet schoolship Charlotte would arrive at the same port February Uth. They are to depart on the 5th and 16th of February, respectively. Neither of these vessels can properly be regarded as warships, although they are attached to the German navy and carry a large number of young naval cadets. Nevertheless, the Haytian minister fears that their appearance In Haytian waters. Just at this Juncture, when the threat has been made that German wars?hins ' will make a demon stration In the harbor of Port au Prince, may lead to serious trouble there. The Freight Car Equipment Hearing Washington, December 3. The hearing given by the inter-state commerce com mission on the question of extending the time within which the railroads of the country may comply with the provisions of the car coupler and train brake act, was concluded at noon today. The com mission intends to take some supplemen tal testimony under oath before coming to a decision. There seems to be no doubt that an exten sion will be granted and that the exten sion will be general In its character, the hearing having demonstrated that any discrimination would fall as heavily on roads which have complied with the law as on these which have thus far disregarded it. The general impression among both the railroad men and the labor leaders who are in attendance on the hearing is that the extension granted 'by the commission will be a compromise. The railroad representatives asked for five years, with the condition that one fifth of the unequipped rolling stock of each company should be equipped each year, and the representatives of the rail road organizations protested against an extension in excess of one year. Three years is generally believed to be the maximum extension which the commis sion will grant. The commission is evi dently in great doubt as to its ability to impose conditions on an extension, and it may be that it will grant but a year's extension at a time with the under standing that against those Toads which do not complete the yearly portion of their equipment during that period the law shall become operative.

Latest Kwi From Cuba Havana, December 4. News has been received here of a fire which occurred yesterday at Jaruaco, a town of 10.000 inhabitants, in this provinence. About 110 houses were destroyed, with nearly all their contents. No accurate esti mate of the amount of damage can be made. Hundreds of families have been rendered homeless and the situation at Jaruaco is very distressing. The fire originated through an accident. According to an announcement is sued from Spanish headquarters this afternoon, the Spanish' forces belong ing to the Manzanillo division have had a sharp engagement with the in surgents at Piedra. province of San tiago de Cuba, with the result that they captured all the positions of the enemy, and compelled the insurgents to retreat with numerous loss. "Owing to an accident to the field columns." the annuncement continues twelve soldiers were killed and Majr La Torre, Drs. Matorell and Siball. a chaplain attached to the Baza battalion and thirty-eight soldiers were wound- j ed." Reports "from Pinar del Rio city say ' that smallpox is rapidly spreading there and that thirty deaths occurred recently from the disease. Many " deaths from the same cause, are re ported from other towns. Dr. Jover, of the Havana sanitary board, has been ' commissioned to proceed to Pinar del Rio for the purpose of vaccinating the inhabitants and thus preventing the 'further pread of the scourge. j It is announced that the grinding of sugar cane will be begun before De cember 15th on the central plantations ; Constancia, Andrieta and Doshermanos in the Cienfuegos district.

He is convinced j that by making such a pecuniary effort Cuba, except in the eastern part, would be pacified by June next, when the local government could finish the war." Havana, December 3. Sen or Canale "Jas, the special commissioner of the Spanish government, has returned from his visit to the province of Pinar del Rio. He says there are in the prov ince 40,000 "concentradoes" peasants gathered in from the country in the neighborhood of the towns for protec tion from the insurgents, or to prevent them from Joining the enemy, and that they are all in want. Of this num ber 15,000 are orphans and the majority are children of tender years. There is great anxiety here to know the terms of the message of President McKinley to congress. The central committee of the autonomist party has passed a vote of confidence in its pres ident, as a result of the larlcv's nego tiations with the reformist party to bring about a union of both parties. Consequently, Jose Pellon, Carlos Font. Antonio Mesa and Dominguez, all law yers, have withdrawn their resigna tions as members of the central com mittee of the autonomists. ' It was officially announced today that the Spanish cavalry. In pursuing the insurgents under General DucasI, who is said to have been badly defeated re cently in Pinar del Rio by the Spanish aces under General Bernal, has sur sed an insurgent force, killing nine teen of the enemy and capturing five mounted men. The Marquis de Apezteguia, president of the standing committee of the Plant ers' Association, expresses the opinion that all signs indicate the success' of the season's sugar crop. Although the reformists have ap pointed a committee to negotiate with the autonomists, it is believed never theless that nothing definitely will be decided upon until the arrival from 'Madrid of leading members of the par ty who have been appointed as dele gates by the Cuban reformists there and who are now on the way. The governor of Pinar del Rio is en deavoring to relieve the critical situa tion in that province, where a majority of the inhabitants are Identified with the tobacco trade. The crop this year is only half the normal, though some good judges have put It at about 60 per cent, of the usual yied. Washington, December 3. Informa tion was received here today from Ha vana that the organ of the autonomist j party of the Island has issued a for- ' mal circular, declaring, in behalf of the j Cuban autonomists, that they were sat- ' isfied with the plan of Cuban autonomy now extended to Cuba, a realization of i the policy they had urged from the be ginning of the century; expressing the greatest hopes in the new regime, and declaring that with the fulfillment of t all the aspirations of the Cuban peo- ' pie, there remains no reason for con tinuing the fight in the field. The state ment closes with a patriotic appeal to the men In arms to return to the peace ful homes of their regenerated father land. This declaration from the autono mists of Cuba is said to be an impor tant feature In the present situation, as the success of the autonomy plan granted by-Spain Is dependent on the attitude of Cuban autonomists to ward It.
