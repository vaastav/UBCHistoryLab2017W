One very consoling reflection to those ,-who perceive a certain tendency of the 'American people away from popular in stitutions toward the Ideas that Hamil ton maintained lies In the Increasing demand for the election of United States Senators by popular vote. There Is no doubt of this tendency. Already thirty four States have through their Legis latures spoken In favor of such a change moro than enough to ratify the Con stitutional amendment if it were sub mitted to the people. Not a single valid argument has yet been advanced against this desired change. The conservatism which the founders of the Republic endeavored to give the upper houso of Congress by an Indirect method of election is con ceded to be amply attained by the long service term of the Senator. The elec tion of Senators by popular vote would do away certainly with the deplorable instances of corruption which have in many instances attended the choice of a Senator by the Legislature. In the Democratic platform of 3900 a plank favoring tho popular election of Senators held a place. The Republican platform contained no such plank. The majority cast for the Republican nomi nees in 1000 does not In any way in dicate that the movement for the popu ular election of Senators lacks tho ap proval of the American people. The present obstacle In the way of this change In the United States Constitu tion is in the body whose method of election would be changed by such an amendment. United States Senators prefer to take their chances with the Slate Legislatures rather than to go be fore tho people. When the United States Senate onco places the subject before the people ratification will come quickly. 

STILL HATES MISSOURI. It is characteristic of tho Clobc Democrat to make a malicious attempt at the material Injury of certain por tions of the State of Missouri whoso people exercise their right of choice be tween the two great parties by main taining their alignment on the side of Democratic principles. . It is also characteristic that this malign and hostile newspaper, which has never hesitated to slander its own State, should not have further hesitated 1o resort to misrepresentation in assail ing certain Missouri counties wherein a largo vote was polled for the Demo cratic national and State tickets last month. These "decadent counties," as the CIobc-Democrat stigmatizes them, are evidently in for the same sort of black guard abuse which that newspaper used to direct-at the entire State, regardless of the trutlu The Globe-Democrat knows that in certain counties of Missouri natural con ditions have prevailed to prevent that increase by immigration which lias been -scored elsewhere. It knows well that in no State in the Union is the ratio of in crease maintained at the same average in the various sections. It knows equally well that this may not fairly bo charged to lack of enterprise or of progressive spirit. It cannot but know that if hucli an argument holds good against the Democratic people in cer tain Missouri dibtricts it must hold good against the Republican people in vast sections .of the East, where abandoned farms are the rule and not the excep tion. But it serves the Globe-Democrat's purpose to malign these certain Missouri counties solely because their people vote the Democratic rather than the Re publican ticket. It is due to the same spirit which made the GIobe-Dcmocnit for years-blazon this State to the world as 'Toor Old Missouri" and "The Rob- bcr State." The :iob-Icinocrat Is never so pleased with itself as wlien liiackj-nareliiiK Missouri. It hates llio tifth State in the Union witli a Mtter hatred possible only to the most enven omed partisanship. Tliis unwholesome tnitli cannot be denied. It is a matter of record. STATl'S IN CONGRESS. In the fact that the Congress now In session will not call up the World's l'air I bill until a fund of Sr-.tHit-.ooO sli.il! have been raised in St. Louis, there is found J an mianswcraMe argument for the com pletion of the local subscription by means of vthich that fund is to lie created. There is no time to lo-c in tins' mat ter. The present Congress, is over burdened with wurk. The sooner the Tawney bill, providing for tl rcation of :i national Louisiana riirch:tsi- Ex position Commission, for a national ex hibit, for the remitting of customs duties on foreign exhibits and for the inter national advertising of tho World's Fair, can be taken up, the more certain Is its passage. It will not be taken up until the citi zens of St. Louis shall have subscribed $.".iiu0,000 to the World's l'air. I'aiiuro of the present Congicss to pass the Tawney 1111 would in all prob ability mean failure of the World's l'air undertaking. All the work nou success fully done would have to be done again before the succeeding Congress, if, in deed, it were not then too late to attempt anything further. The reason for such failure to act on the Tawney bill the noncompletion of the local fund would also make It impossible for the loaders of the World's Fair movement to Induce tho Legislatures of other States to pro vide at once for State exhibits at the World's Fair. As the succeeding Legis latures will not meet until l'.Mt;! this in Itself would be fatal to the World's l'air enterprise. Do you not see, therefore, how impera tive it is that the St. Louis subscription of $..,000,000 shall be completed prompt ly? It should be done within the next two weeks at the latest. Every St. Loulsau who is a friend to St. Louis must help in this great work. A refusal to do so Is an net of hostility to the city In which you live. Ruckle down to work with a determination that success shall be achieved for St. Louis's sake. Com plete the World's Fair fund. 

STEADY RETROGRESSION. St. Louisans can well examine the claims made for the Zlegenheln ad ministration by the Star, which asserts: "It is notorious that the City Hall was finished by Mayor Zicgenhcin ond pre pared for occupancy without subjecting the treasury to auy unnecessary drain; that the block patrol street cleaning sys tem was inaugurated during the Ziegeu hein administration and that $50,000 was set aside yearly for a new Citv Hospital." Not one of these claims is sound. St. Louis's City Hall is not finished and, from appearances, will never be finished . unless a business administra tion takes hold in St. Louis. The rj tunda and the north and south corridors are bare, unsightly avenues of plaster stained nreprooiing. A rough partition of unplaned planks shuts these sections off from the rest of the hall. The main entrance to the hall on Twelfth street is still shut with rough pine planks. Ele vators are still lacking and those who nave ousiness on the upper tloors of the hall must climb stairs. The City Hall is not finished. It is merely occupied. Iu bringing tiie hall Into condition for occupancy Mayor Ziegeuhein used the funds handed down by a preceding administration. When Mayor Ziegenhein came into of fice the finances of the city were iu good condition; so good, in fact, that the street reorganization bill was one of the first measures passed to provide su perintendents, inspectors and overseers whose salaries might take up the slack in the current revenue. Mayor Ziegenheln, using his "practical knowledge as a builder," went over the specifications for the City Hall and "skimped" them: that Is. iu siii.stit,i Inferior materials, "but Just as good," for those named in the specifications. For instance, he cut out the hardwood floors, for which the specifications pro vided, and substituted cheap soft-wood flooring. In this way he made the funds In hand when Mayor Walbridge retired cover the cost of bringing the hall Into condition for occupancy. The hall Is not finished and work on it has entirely ceased. The block patrol system of street cleaning was established by Street Com missioner Milner during Mayor AVai bridge's administration and abandoned during Mayor Ziegenliein's term. The ordinance setting aside annually a certain per cent of the current mu nicipal revenue as a fund for a new City Hospital was introduced at the suggestion of the Hospital Commission during the administration of Mayor Walbridge and before the Hospital Com mission presented its report. The hos pital fund had a narrow escape from annihilation during Mayor Ziegenliein's term. It was saved only by a Mcrn protest from the physicians of St. Louis who visited the City Hall iu a bod v. Nowhere has the Ziegenheln adminis tration held the ground which St. Louis gained iu former admiuistratlous. The last three years have been years of steady retrogression. TWO TYPICAL RILLS. Senator Vest, in Ids comments upon President McKinley's message to Con gress, is right iu his assurance that no Democrat in that body can consistently favor the passage of the anuy increase bill and the shipping .subsidy bill, loth strongly urged by the President. Permanent increase or the army to something like 100.000 men is a notable step iu the direction of militarism. Its ouly iMjssible excuse must be found iu a lasting adoption of the President's policy of imperialism, foreign conquest and participation iu whatever laud-grabbing may iu the future be doue by the Eu ropean Powers. When the insurrection in the Philippines shall have been sup pressed and a civil govurnnient estab lished we shall certainly not need a mili tary establishment of such numerical strength unless wc tshall be reachiug out for more territory. The imposition of a tax burden of nearly SlW.OOO.oOO iqwu the American Iieople foryrrie exclusive benefit of such uionopoKstie combinations as the Han- na-Payne-Fiye-Staiidard Oil syndicate will lie a direct concession to trustisin. The principle upon which the ship-subsidy bill is based is essentially undemo cratic. It is hostile to the American doctrine of "equal rights to all, special privileges to none." It tends to the further fostering of the interests or a favored caste at the expense of the peo ple at large. It will be impossible for a Democrat to support such :i measure without repudiating his Democracy. Yet it is reasonably certain that these tno measures, one of imperialism and one of trustisin, will be passed In the near future. The lCepiililicau parly is philged to their pass;,., and the Re publican party is in contiol of Congress. If there is any Republican opposition It will 1 rushed by the President and Maik Ilanna. The two bills typify what may be epeclcd throughout Mr. McKin ley's second term. The trilstltes and the imperialists posses the power to do the tilings they wish done. The second ad ministration of Mr. McKinley will wit ness the doing of them. IT WASINi:VITARLK. That Secretary Roofs estimate of the appropriation necessary for the fiscal jear of 11)01 exceeds the War Depart ment's army expenditures in the preced ing j oar by .:t7,ono.oiu) is a matter which should not surprise the American people. There N as yet no evidence pointing to the likelihood of a in Miction of War De partment expenditures. The conflict iu the Philippines is being carried on as stubbornly as ever. The present Con gress will cither make a great perma nent increase in the regular army or authorize a three years enlistment of a third volunteer army. At almost any moment there may again be a sudden demand lor the sending of troops to China. Under such conditions the Secretary of War must see that his d partment is amply supplied witli tho sinews of war. The burden of this increased ost of our military establishment must, of course, fall on the American taxpayer. It is difficult to see how there can be any change for the bettor If our present foreign policy shall prevail during the next four years. All signs, indeed, point to a steady growth of the cost of the American military establishment. It is the price of such power as that for which we are now striving, the power coining from foreign conquest and the government by force of the conquered peoples. AVith one business manager, one at torney and three experts thc'Meraince Springs water supply promoters made a tandim tackle buck of the St. Louis rush line, but indications are that when the struggling mass resolves itself into its constituents the Meramec Springs team will be found to have lost several yards on the play. While President McKinley" was telling in his message what the United States had done at the Paris Exposition and what he expected of the Ruffalo Exposi tion, lie might have said a few words In favor of or at least regarding the Louis iana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis. Students at West Point poured Ta basco sauce down the thioat and threw red popper Into the eves of a hazed victim. Next time lynchers want to tor ture a captive they should call iu the help of West Pointers. Councilman Carroll's belief that the estimates or the city's revenue made by the Comptroller will be greatly exceeded is as optimistic as was Mayor Ziegen liein's consoling thought that St. Louis still had the moon. ".Mouthing hypocritiV Is the elegant designation which the GIobe-Demo.Tat lms devised for the St. Louis business and professional men who want a busi ness admiuistr.it ion in St. Louis during the next four years. Early conventions and unassailable nominations are what the people of St. Louis demand of the parties. Unless they are forthcoming St. Louiaiis will cast loose from parlies entirely iu the St. Louis Socialists have already a full ticket in the Hold for the Mayoralty elec tion iu April. The example of prompt ness and forehandednoss is commend able, whatever the merits or demerits of the ticket. Determined to save something from tiie local November landslide, the Globe Democrat is making strenuous efforts toward further confirming its title of the Ananias of Missouri. When the husband of Frances Hodg son Rurnett wrote a book about dogs lie probably chose his subject so that critics could not charge that his wife helped him in the woik. When it hears unreasonable criticism of Its World's Fair St. Louis should ic member Swift's saying that "(Vnstiro is the tax a man pays to (lie public for being eminent." Missouri counties that go Democratic are heralded to the outside world by the Globe-Democrat as decadent and decay ing counties. This is partisanship with a vengeance. When it comes to blackguarding Mis souri the "lobe-Democrat is a past master, having served a long and glad apprenticeship iu that especially dirty craft. It would have been inconsistent to ex pect anything but a trustite and im perial message from a President who stands for trustisin and imperialism. Such a little matter as tiie truth does not stand betweeu the Globe-Democrat and its chosen mission of befouling its own State. Tlio Sncrllli-r. Ah.

THREE CUBAN IDEAS OF A CONSTITUTION. Complete Documents Submitted to the Convention by Rivera. Quesadit and Morua. Havana. Dec. 4. The Cuban Constitu tional Convention rcsun.ed Its slttln-ts to-elay with an air of buslne-.-. The first thins elcno was to defeat overwhelmingly the mo tion eif S-nor Guallee'rlo Gomez to eliscuss General Woods's address at the openinK of the ce.nvcntion. This action probably will close the Incident. Three complete constitutions were sub mitted by Gene ral Hivcra, Senor Quesaeii and the colored General. 3Iorua. respective ly, 'risen. will ls prlnte-1 and dlsirlbutesl air.oui; the elele-gater, who will discuss them later. General Klvcra's proposed censtitutton prr.v ides for a Pres'dent. a Senate, a House of Representatives, a Governor for each of the -Is IVovhices. a legislative body for each Province-, and for one- member of the House of Itcprescr.tatlve-s fcr every 00.3C0 Inhabitants, with election by popular vote. His scheme calls also for the election eif three electors In each municipal district, whore duty it shall be to elect a leglslatlve lody of eleven for the Provlnco In vvhlcn they reIde. This IcBlslative body shall elect the- Governor and four membcrj of tl.o senate. Finally, the six legislators shall meet and rhoose the Pre ldent. whe- must bo a native Culian. Candidates for senatorial honors must have incomes of at least fl,J a j ear. General Rivera's Idea Is to have tho joner vested In the central government, ar.d the convention virtually pledged Itself to nno State government at yesterday's secret ses sion. Senor Dc Queaada's proicsaI would rtn tralizo the Government in a President. Sen i.te and House of Repie-se'ntatlves elected by the people, suffrage being restricted to edu cational eiu-illf.catlons. General 3Iorua offered for approval the. Constitution of the United States, with the eye-eption that any one who fought in tin war might be chosen President. Ills pro posal leaves the question of an army and navy to 1m- dccii'ed by Congress. Scnor Zavas offercl :i clause providlns that a judicial body higher than the Su preme; Court should 1-e elected by iw.pular vote and provldlrg that any cttlclal removed from office should have the- right of api-eal to this iMiely.
