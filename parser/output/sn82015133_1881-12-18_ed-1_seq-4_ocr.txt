Weekly Citizen. SUNDAY, DEC. 18, 1SS1 national rourics. Congress this -winter trill be the pcone of plans anil counter plans for ennninff political campaigners. The battle ground of the near future is the Southern States. Already dispatches from Wash- inrrton indicate the beginning. The Ile- rmblieans think the opportune moment for breaking up the solid South has ar¬ rived. The policy of the party during the coming session will be to strengthen anti-Bourbon movement in the South One of the Virginia KeadjuBters is tc hare a chairmanship of a committee. Virginia -will undoubtedly be redistrict ed so as to make the anti-Bourbon strength more potent in controlling tho Congressional representation of that State. In their efforts to break up the solid South the Bepnblicans are aided by the disinterested faction which want of success has engendered, and the jeal ousies and bitter rivalries which are the natural outgrowth of this " too sold condition of affairs. "Washington is said inU fnll nf x-Democrats from the South readv to ioin any anti-Bourbon movement and great dissatisfaction is expressed at the national Democratic management. The Bigns of the times point to the end of our sectional strife, and the com inr of the time when questions of pub lie nolicv. not the hntes and prejudices of a past generation, will form the lino of division between the great political parties of the country. Ever since the repeal of the bankin In-r them has been a treneral agitation in the commercial world for the enact¬ ment of some substitute which should be free from the objectionable features of the old. This matter will receive the early attention of Congress. A Wash incton special says that the snb-Com Vii - I F ' Snnntor In rails is chairman, has com tilpted tho work assigned to it, and its report is prepared, ilr. Ingalls has worked steadily all the summer collect¬ ing information on the subject Over fortv thousand circulars were sent to merchants, manufacturers, lawyers and commercial bodies, asking for their opinions as to the necessity of a national bankrupt law, and suggestions as to its nrovisions. Great interest appears to have been taken by business men, rihI manv thousands of letters were re¬ ceived. The proportion of answers fa vorable to the enactment of some law was overwhelming. Very few opposed it outside of the great Eastern cities, and these were generally great jobbing houses, whose business was great enough to allow them to promptly take advan¬ tage of snap judgments and preferences in settlements. .Much objection was found to exist to tho establishment of the machinery of the old bankruptcy laws. A majority of the sub-Comroittec is favorable to the Bnggestion, which originally came from Chicago bnsiness men, that the United Status District Courts be given charge of bankruptcy proceedings, with special piovision to enforce their judgmeuts. It is known that Senator Edmundit favors this idea. The water question is not alone of in¬ terest to Tucson, but has been of con¬ siderable importance to miners in many of our districts. Tho reports which have been made of the extreme dryness of Arizona has deterred capital from com¬ ing here. It is true there is no water for hydraulic mining in this territory, but there seems to bean abundanco for the practical purposes of quartz mining. The further developments which have taken place in districts reported abso¬ lutely destitute of water, have shown that nature had not entirely omitted that important element of life. In tho Cababi, which has been noted as a dry region, the flow of water in the Deert mine has compelled the suspension of labor until machinery can be provided to take care of it .Prospecting for wa¬ ter in that district has been as sneeosa- ful as prospecting for mineral. The Cababi district has been known for years as one or the richest mineral sec¬ tions in the Territory, but the water question has kept it tr. Tho opening r2.tUfllrict will no longer be de¬ layed by this obstacle, and its bullion output, in tho near future, will greatly increase the product of tho Territory. What is true in relation to water in the Cababi is true of other districts reputed es too .destitute of water for practical mining. It looks as if the onvious would soon be compolled to resort to some other ground upon which to disparage Arizona mining. The next issue of the Mining and Sci¬ entific Press of San Francisco will le a large 24-page edition, fully illustrated, and devoted to the mining intorests of Arizona and New Mexico. In a recent issue the Press says: Both these great southern Territories are now attracting a very large share of attention, not only of sottlers, but of miners, capitalists, railroad men and others interested in developing the wealth of comparatively new regions. Bailroad plans are being perfected, sur¬ veys made, roads built, and plenty of work is being done. People interested in agricultural pursuits are looking anx¬ iously that way for tho opening up of new sections where they may locate and where they will have transportation for their products. The prospectors jnd miners, however, so far make up the bulk of the people nowinterested In theso Territories. Ari¬ zona makes a glorious showing in the ranksot the bullion producers, and her minia are constantly on the increase bothin number and yield. New Mexico is fAy now beginning to have any min¬ ing interests and her mines are not so well known. Yet there aro large areas still unprosnectod and capital is now go¬ ing in to help those who are developing tho country. The represcntati'.e silver bullion pro- i&ifu-g-Slutes of the West propose to make war on tho administration if it op¬ poses their chief interest. The San Francisco Bcport says: Representative Bedford, of Colorado, declares that tho President's message discriminate; against the mining section of the coun¬ try, and that if Arthur desires to niako war on his State he Bhall not support him in his policy. We do not know how Senator Miller stands on tho Silver question, but as ho represents a mining State and as the interests of the State of Nevada aro closely allied to tkoe of California, he is no doubt in favor of silver. Senator Jones, of Nevada, is an enthusiastic silver man. The Chicago Tribuno says: Iowa has retired Hiram Price, and he became In¬ dian Commissioner under Garfield, but it is said, is not to be retained. Two things are in his way: he is growing fee¬ ble from illness, and he won't give the Indians any whisky, a proceeding which is not liked by contractors or Congress¬ men. The Senate has confirmed the nomi¬ nation of ex-Senator Frelinghuysen :is Secretary of State The appointment is a good one, and will reflect credit upon the administration. The California Senators have kindly takeu Arizona under tho shadow of their protecting wings. Senator Farloy has introduced a bill providing for the ap¬ pointment of three commissioners by the Secretary of the Interior, to proceed to Arizona and examine all claims pre¬ sented for valne of property stolen, de¬ stroyed or captured by the Indians. The comraiwioncrs are to require full partic¬ ulars, supported by the oaths of claim¬ ants and witnesses and upon the sworn testimony thus taken each claim pball be considered, adjusted aud allowed, or rejected, according as the majority 1 of the commission may determine. Claims for damages are to be admittod and al¬ lowances are confined to the actual value of projierty lost. Tho commis¬ sioners are to submit their report to the Secretary of the Interior, who, in turn, is required to transmit it to Congress ns a bai for an appropriation bill. This is a wove in tho right direction. The Indians are the wards of the govern¬ ment, kept upon the reservations in thin Territory against the will of the civi¬ lized portion of its inhabitants, and as an inevitable result they have broken out and murdered ami plundered our people. It is not even meeting the de¬ mands of common justice for the gen¬ eral government, which is responsible for the present imbecile Indian policy, to pay for the loss incurred. Congress ought also to pension the relatives of those who were slaughtered by the gov¬ ernment's Indian pets. ! n; ii thi .i.temco!. u h.iuilsomelj fU- i jriavt J , irJ loari:.g on one fold the , Pr-bident b mai;o ou polv.imy, print- , ed in letter of gM; on the other fold in crimson ' i 

COAST XEWS. i,.r- l .;..- it'- N.i- f ri.ih Coxokeshmax 1'aoe, of California will introduce abill to appropriate SCOO,- 000 for the purpose of making such im¬ provement.-; or works undor tho direction and supervision of tbe Secretary of War as he may see fit for the improve¬ ment of the Sacramento, Yuba, Feather and American rivers and their tributa¬ ries so 86 to protect tlietn from overflow from tlie debris and the filling up of the said rivers, and for the removal of the deposits of debris that now impede nav¬ igation, ami also to.prevent the destruc¬ tion of lands and property adjacent to the said rivers, and to protect the lwr- lor of San Francisco from further in¬ jur? from the said cause. There would Ik; full as much reason in granting this request as in appropriating 810,000,000 to improve the Mississippi. The inter¬ ests involved are large. The gravel bods of northern California produce about Sl!i,WX),000 per annum, andare estimated to contain S800,000,000 in tlie precious metal. It is certainly desirable to have all interest on the above mentioned stream protected, and .he eountry needs the precious metals for commercial pur¬ poses. The appropriation asked for it- small, and if sufficient to accomplish the object the expenditure will prove an economy. Lakae portion! of Colorado are now under snow, and mining will soon be suspended until next summer. That is one of the disadvantages under which which southern Arizona does not labor. Here mining operations can be carried ou during the whole year, and now is the busiest treason. Then Arizona has other advantages which capitalists should not overlook. Arizona's one rail¬ road, the Southern Pacific, has done more to make the country -accessible .ban the same length of road could do lu any other mining region in the United States. Ariwnia's mountains are peculiar. Tliey arc not a series of al mott unbroken ranges, rising higher and higlier, but isolated peaks and short ranges surrounded by vast plain, which furnish the finest natural roads to be found anywhere in the world. This makes our mines accessible. Immense hums do not have to be expended to get to the valuable dejosit which lie hid¬ den in almost every mountain. Nature has provided highways and a climate which iiennits the miner to pursue his avocation uninterruptedly. The people are after forfeited land grants. Senator Plumb has introduced a bill which provide that where a grant of public html has lieen made to aid the construction of auy railroad, and such road has not lieen completed within the time prescribed by law, the land so granted or such quantity thereof as had wot been patented or certified to such company, or to any State or trustees for its benefit, prior to the expiration of time fixed for the completion of the roads shall revert to the United States, and elial! be open to settlement as othei public lands. The bill further provides that immediately upon its passage the Secretary of tlte Interior shall give pub¬ lic notice that the lauds described arc open to settlement, and that entries will be received at the Land Office in the district in which the lands are situated. When tlie road is leiug constructed in good faith by tbe corporation and thore seems no ques'ion of the early comple¬ tion of the road, we think Congress would bo justified in extending the time long enough to enable the company to complete the work. It mui be apparent to every intelli¬ gent reader of the proceedings in tlie juiieau trial that the assassin is play- . . , -1 n ing a part, jus conuuci mie ou ion stand and being cross-examined as to his terrible crime all indicate that while he may lie morally unbalanced, he was sane enough to know the terriblo enorm¬ ity of the crime he has committed. His knowledge of the act and tho effect that this trial is liaving upon him are not the symptoms of a madman. Sixteen ex¬ perts, after examining Guitoau, pro¬ nounce him responsible for his acts. The chances of tho assassin's escape upon that plea are daily diuiiuisliing, and the prospect of lus suffering tlie fall legal punishment for his heinou crime is im¬ proving. The New York Herald has the follow- lowing: " Albuquerque, New Mexico, has a greatly respected J usticc of the Peace. An illustration of his method of justice is commended to justices in oth¬ er far west towns. He said to a Mexican: Ye are charged with stealing canned goods; wliat have ye to say?' Tlie Mexican replied, (Juien sabe. 'Well,' said the judge, ' Til thrust the harpoon of justice into yez, and send you up for ninety days, till yes maybe can salie. Nixt.'- At a recent Cabinet meeting the trouble with the cowboys on the Mexican border received attention, and it is bulioved some action will be taken to protect the frontiers of Iioth the United States and Mexico from depredations by this class of marauders. In Kansas liquor is now given out upon physicians' eertitleatos. A corre¬ spondent says one patient, whose sole complaint was a boil on the arm, had prescribed for him in eleven days ten pints of "spiritns frumenti" and thirty bottles of bfcr. It is announced from Washington that President Arthur will appoint no women to office. Thuir votes don't count, but they have a wonderfully per¬ suasive influence with the voters. A Sal Accttaat.

Having received information that tbe hostile scouU were located near Cedar Creek, in the Cibieu country, a boot twenty mile from here, General Csrr sent K troop. Sixth Cavalry, under Lieu tenants Kingsbury and Hodgson, to try and sur¬ prise them. Tbe information was to the effect that tho hostile had been drink¬ ing tizwiu, and in a drunken row among tberoeolves killed one of their number. The troop which left here on the night of tbe iith, found a camp on a high hill commanding- a view of every side and well foi tilled with rocks. The camp was deserted, the hostile? evidently ha vim? been apprised of the approach of the troops. They found the body of the dead Indian, who was recognised ae one of Cruee's scoots named Mickey. Tbi is the ttt&t time the hostile scouts have been definitely located. EqnH Oar BobM. Special to the CitimcxJ De.mi.vo, N. M., December H.

Paeheco, who came np from Mexico last week, informs ns that when he left Janos there were about 450 Apache Indians, including the lmods of Nana, Ju and Cnino, encamped at that place. These Indians, bays Sr. Pacbeco, seemed to lie enjoying themselves. Their camp was tlie focus of hilarity and mirth; war dnnces aud debauchery were freely indulged in. They liave sev¬ eral hundred head of stock, horses, mules and horned cattle, brought with them from Arisona anil New Mexico. These they live upon, ami buy corn from the people, make tizwiu, and take life ea.y. There are a few Mexican troops at Janos, ami several hundred moro were expected there when Sr. Pacbeco left. The Indians appeared to be on the best of terms with the people of Janos and the surrounding country, and with the exception of an occasional petty theft, they were giving no trouble. It was rumored that the Mexican authori¬ ses were preparing to take advantage of tue unsuspecting savages, and lnre them into a trap and massacre or take the hole outfit prisoneic, bnt Pacbeco thinks there is no movement ot the kiud contemplated. The Indians have manfested a friendly disposition towards the Mexicans, and so long as they remain at peace, the au¬ thorities will avoid any trouble with them. Sr. Pacbeco says these Indians have a wholesome dread of New Mexico and Arizona, and will not return unless to make a raid and ttgain get Imck into Chihuahua. If this statement of facts is true, and we have no reason to doubt it, the Gov¬ ernment should look after the matter. Our neighbors across the lineshoidd not be allowed to harbor these Indians while we are engaged in a war with them. Bnt the trouble is that the general Govern¬ ment of Mexico has but very little more control over the people along its border than it has over tbe 1 ndians. They pay but little respect to the laws or authori¬ ties of tbe country. Every town or dis¬ trict acts uion its own hook, and gener¬ ally independent of tbe uovemment. If the people of Janos want to make a treaty with Indians, or any one else, they do so- without consulting the Govern¬ ment or the legally constituted authori¬ ties on the subject. In this way they make pence with the Indians, and should the Government of the country attempt to interfere with the arrangement it wonld, very likely, lead to a civil war, that is. a civil war after Ae Mexican style. But if the people of Janos will keep the.be 430 Indians there, ami not allow them to return to this country, we shall not dispute with them about tbe manner of doing it whether the Gov¬ ernment of Mexico consents to it or not. But there is very liUlo lwiie of such a result These Indians will return when they get ready, withect asking- tht per- raission of the Ulwriean Govern m ant or auy part of the Mexican people, aud they should be closely watched. Itast Explosive. Dust mixed with air in a dangerous explosive. If a large log of wood were ignited it might he a week before it wonld lie entirely consumed. Split it np into cordwood and pile it np loosely and it would burn ia two hour. Split it up into kindling wood, pile it up looaely, and ierhaps it would burn in less than an hour. Cut it into ahtvings and allow a strong wind to throw them into tbe air, or in any way keep the chips comparatively well separated from each other, ami the log would perhai lie consumed in two or three minutes; or, finally, grind it up into fine duet or powder, blow it in such a manner that each particle is mi mutinied by air, and it wonld burn in less than a second. A Curhtns Pact. Dr. Lewis Balcb, of Albany, in a re¬ view of the medical evidence in the cel¬ ebrated Billings murder case, allude to the enrious fact that a ball of a given calinre fired through glass may make a hole enough smaller than tbe fnll size of the ball before firing to prevent an nrtfired ball of like calibre isvmng. Dr. Balcb notes having seen " a base liali, thrown with great force and having a rotary twist, make a hole through an or¬ dinary windoT light, and when the ball was tried to be again passed through tbe same opening, the hole nearly one- third too small." - .
