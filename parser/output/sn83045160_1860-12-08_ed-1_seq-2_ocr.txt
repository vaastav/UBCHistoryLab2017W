This morning Senator Hale's vsry aanpaattc remarks that there most be a speedy settle ment of tbe existing 'roab'en or war, brw'ght oat a rejoinder from Mr. Wigl!, aboani cg la inflammatory language peculiar to tha: gen tleman. 8otb discussio e only help to widen tbe breach, that promises soon tr engulf our eouatry. Senator Hunter is expected to s; -ak to-rr. r- row. He it opposed to eecessic n rithoit a union of the Southern Stat-s, and be will set forth the views of the membtis from the bor der State. The more conservative rit g of lbs soutt em Desweraey propose, aaa basis for adjustment, Me extension of the Missouri compromise to the Pacific; the recogni ion of the ruth' to carry ad bold slave south of It, with fmtrc tten. if neeestarv. until State governments be far mod. and the declaration tbat the powir of Congress to regelate commerce hall not be so construed aa to authorize the abolition of the slave-trade between the States. They give asearaneea that sncb a compromise would hold all tbe Southern States but S 'Utb Carolina, and her secession would be re oiisidered. All the opposition members frora Maryland, Teaaestee, Kenteekr. North Carolina and Louisiana, with many of tbe Democrats from those St a ev, are earnes'ly dssirous of effect ing seme re tsonsble and fair arrangement. The Gulf States are really desirous of se eediag aad of involving the whole South in tbe movement; heace they interpose obstacles to ... aeiMeae which is sue rested. The coaa- puritoa of opinions between southern mem nerr thus far shown that no plan yet uggeated covers the pouts of embarrassments practi cally. It is generally conceded that the proposed committee of thirty-three can only agree to luisil aa amendment to tbe Cenetitotion tbat Congreet may call oa the States te repeal bne null trying acta, aaa uu uc rugiuve nave law may be amended. I believe that no one here now doubts that South Carolina will declare herself oat of the Union within one week from the 17 th Umtant; while the largely preponderatiag opinion in Washington with reference to the probable action of Florida. Alabama and Mississippi is that they will do the tame thing within a week after tha meeting of their several Slate con ventions, oa the 7 h proximo. It it further eadenstood here that there Is at this time a maioritr af nearly twenty thousand in Geor gia against secession, ere a genernal Southern State convention shall procUim that to be tbe rightful remedy under existing circumstances. If Georgia patties the difficulty may be settled in tbe Union, provided tbe North in Congress properly awakes to a realization of tbe fact that the Constitution met' be promptly altered to suit the altered condition of American pub lic affairs. Mr. Preoeott, Assistant Secretary of State, bat gone to Socth Carolim with a view of urging a postponement of any hostile demon stration against forts and otLer public proper ty until after tbe close of Mr. Buchanan's term. Ine Atcninistrauoo acre is anxious 10 transfer all aucb responsibility to Mr. Lincoln, aad maintain a truce until tbe 4 u of March. Mr. Pr escort's miaaien will not produce much effect in the preaeat temper there. Tha reromal or many represent attres to vote oa Mr. Bottler's resolution o.: Tuesday is re garded by nearly all here as ai intimation of their disinclination toward any settlement of entreat troubles whatever ia the Lmon. They are written down at ditnniomstt per it, and it is judged by many that thy rpr stnt correctly the utsssnt strength of the'psrty in tbe House; but I am inclined to bekete'he impression to be incorrect, for I have good reason to think that many more of the Southern members are not only willing but anxiou mat no settle ment ot the difficulty shall be arrived it In tbe Union. We are indeed in th, -midst of fearful times, as all will realize, even mors fore ble than at presen', when tbe members explain plainly tbe purposes of their respective States, acernr at raey compreoen j uiraj. It is understood that Speaker Pennington avows the determination to compose the com mittee of one from each Sea'- entirely of con servative members, of rent.emen earneatly anxious for a settlement .f tb current threat ening troubles within the Union. This isaa it should be. if so appi the committee ma; accomplish tometL.-it: toward mdurirg Alabama, Mississippi a d Geugta to pause are determining to sscritice the t i.ion with Hit serious and sincere effort to preserve the njrhts of the South, without the cestruction of tbe many incomparable bleasi&ga which the whole Confederacy undeniably en joys under ibs ex isting government. But haidlv othetppm The reason tbat the thirty Reptrblieaat op-poe-d Mr. Boteler'a resolution wis that tbey Believed it waa a step toward a compromise. inasmuch at it waa claimed the msjoritv of a committee that eenstrueteu would be on the stdc of the stare States, whether the members from Soath Carolina acted or not. Mr Bote ler'a object in refuting to serve on special com mittee was to bare Milmoa appo tied, wlcm be supposed svootd exert mere influence in ef fecting a settleaaent. Tbe South Carolina delegation stale that they do net desire to provoke any exciting con troversy, but will withdraw quietly at tbe proper time. Mr. BonbasB, who resigned bit teat, is here I bear to-dav that Mr. Seward will make no speech immediately, and will submit no pr p esittea. His polley is to watch the deelop- at of events and direct tbem Wisely a', the proper time for pence and the preservation of the Uatoa. Senator Deris, ta conversation nth I gen- tteman, said tbat Mississippi did not m'end to leave until the 4th ef March, bat that now she would go oat sa tbe 8th of Jaaoary. Mr. Iversoa, of Georgia, entertains the same views at Senator Davis. Governor Fl zpatrick says that the menage will rather precipitate action in the cotton States, aad dees not believe that anything which Congress may de caa avert disruption, or stay tbe revolution. re-ay the leaning KepuMicaa senators. sath as Seward, Feaeeadea, Trumbull, Chandler and Wilkinson, held eonaaltatian, and were united aad oaheettatiag ia pro nouncing tbe President's message a weak, namby-pamby paper, unworthy aaaa a aaaa at such a time.

The telegraphic correspondent, of the Cin cinnati ComsKvriel, fires the following ac count ef Senator Ivereon'a tpeteh in tbe Sen ate, on th 6th last.: - Irereeo, of Georgia, wat quiet at first, bat haughty and defiant at tbe end. He accepted the President's declaration that secession is revolution. " The States nnderstand that tbey do it at the peril of consequences." He did Bot believe It would lead to war, but if It does the South ta preparing to receive Its enemies sih bloody hands to hospitable graves. " He hoped that there would be no war that we would live In petes. The South would regard tbe ftorth imong the most favored of nations, and so treat with her, hut to remain in tbe Union, she would not. No poster on earth could prevent her with draws!. Tbe repeal or the personal liberty bil's of the Nor h would be vain. True, tbey are obnoxious, but we care nothing for their practical operation.

On may not touch pitch withoat being defiled. It Is impossible ta approach so unsavory a sub ject at Toomey without clfaetorv spasm. Boole is a kind of moral quagmire, exhaling legislative miasma, and dripping with era torieal ooze. The board, la its aggregate ca- Kelty, " smells to heaven," and tbe duty which pels the journalist to stir up Its roUeaaeos is liate that which animates tbe samon in bis poet-moriem ceremonials upon issiat, ua pleas ant bodies, like that which Mr. MtatlliBi threatened to become. The nomination of candidates for aldermen at tbe approaching charter election are soch that we cannot pate them by without comment. Among the shining aspirants to that stattea ws tad the eminent name of Enrich t, Mr. John E. En right probably req aires no formal introduction to the New York public. Read era ot tbat entertaining portion of tht litera ture etjoaxnamma wbirh is Invidiously elatesd as "criminal reports,'' "police returns," "oot rtgeoes swindling," aad so on, have sees with cocepteuou frsqueecy this honored name at seeJsted tbetvaitb. Few opportunities of dia credi table distinction have been thrown away upon Mr. Enrigbx. Hs has boxed the compass of scoundrel ism, aad compassed the gamut of depravity. He will be remembered at the dis tinguished sanitary authority whom Mayor Wood was so discriminating at to appoint to tha oeJcc ot health wardea, and who, a few days soiMequent to his appointment, waa arrett ed apoa a charge of swindling aad assault. He is a brother of that ornament of th "nogas ticket" prefeaslnn whom Judge Gould has re cently sent to Sing-Sing. Hit qualifications for the oatca of alderman are andoubt-d. His ignorance Is vast, unutterable, unfathomable. Hit moral perceptions are let acute than the of tbe average gorilla. Hit mental qualities could be compared to those of sn oyster, only at tbe risk ot doing tbat bivalvnloas secretion injustice. Io personal coarseness it ia enough to aay tha1, compared with Boole, he ie at a roped net to a veil of Point d'Aleneon what boulders ars to teed.

After thia superficial recapttulatiou ot hit merits, it it superfluous to add that bis political claims are warmly seconded by Fernando Wood; that, it elected, Mr. Wood will nave in tbs board at least oat uncourpremtelng partieannd that Mr. Wood's brother, Henry, recently emerged from the minstrel bsatasss, will have at least one vote in conarmetion of bis appointment to the of fice of street commissioner. AlderasB Brady has secured a renoeuna Uoa. This refulgent person waa a conspicu ous abetter of tb Jspaness swindle. In bit speech before a small assembly of lis con stituents, gathered together to ratify bis nomi nation, ws discover, dimly, amid tbs on orical fag which be exhaled, aa outline of something slightly penitential aad supplicatory. "Am I to be crashed out," says Brady, la a seddca howl ot pathos, "br the newspapers, 'cause 1're beea ia tb commoa council fire years, and only committed on sis?" Come, come, alderman, tbe public ta Bet composed exclu sively of marine. That sort of narration Is fit only for each credulous auditors. We should be inclined ta forgive tht alderman aot one sin merely, bat seventy times sevsa, if we were at ait tare of bis penitence. But death-bed rt pentsacs Is rarely much respected. Aldermsaie anguish and remorse for past miedemesnors, upon tha eve of an election, is popularly re garded ia tbe staater light of a "dodge," if we may emptor tbat concise though Inelegant term. But even if we were disposed te carry te Brady's credit the peal teace which be prof sales, we do not see upon what rational ground we could recommend our readers' to vote for him. His ratification speech exhibits him in the light of a wholly illiterate persoa, whose chief boast it is tbat be ene cleaned boots a-d scoured knives tor a living, aad tbat be subsequently clapped that meritorious climax by working for his board. There is nothing discreditable in tbcee useful pursuits; but, on tbe other hand, there is nothing in the discipline which they impart te tbs mind to specially disqualify a person tor tht functions of legUta ion. We think that, by a severe effort of self-denial, the city could dispense with the aldermanlc services of Mr. Brady, and we treat the voters of bis ward will endeavor so far to smatbertbe as pirations In which tbey indulge en bit behalf, as mercifuUy to return him to that nsefnl oc cupation of auir-baildiag, which hs Is said to aderSgs he certainly docs not tbe councils of John Van Tine it one of the candidatea for councilman. Those who hare aa eye to tbe festive qualifications ot tbe city olEeere will certainly vote for him. Tbs city is indebted te this meenmiatal example of towering sta pidlty ferprobatily the most gorgeous festive taawsptioB tbat ever apranc from the human mind. Tan Tine, with the air of a man wb aao umtiBctiy gone and done a deed of aatmr- "tasnfigrace and felicity, placed before tne immtmi envoy, wno visited nt a few years bsos, lbs two immemonsl abominations of bsaraat. Yin Tine catted tbe tablet of the Catrkall to groan beneath a superincumbent lead at ham, sandwiches and champagne bot tlea, aad Yan Tine still lives. Although it was clearly tie duty of Van Tine, after tbat parfcrmmnce, to go somewhere and expire, we have tbe beat authority for announcing that hs survives. The statement will undoubtedly oecaatoB regret, but we are compelled te re cord It, W em-jrhopc that the duty of ebroa icliag bis election will be spared as. We find little te commend in the nomina tions ot either lefaaart, Tamtnany, or tbs X publican argaaixattea. From the first two we have of coarse teag ceased to teak for. aay iasas of good.

We had in deed a faint hops tbat from the independent and Bepublieaa nomlnatteas we might be able to select some names of which we -ould con scientiously approve.
