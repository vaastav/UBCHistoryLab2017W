PRESIDENT TO CONGRESS Message Read to Both Houses of National Assembly LEGISLATION CALLED FOR Financial Standing of the Nation De clared Excellent Control of Cor. poratlons, the President Thinks, Should Be Left to the National Government Labor Leaders Come In for Criticism Respect for Law Vital to the Well-Delng of Country. Vaahlngton. The mossago of 1'rosl dent Hoosovclt wan rend In both housco of congrcHs Tuesday. In cub Unco tho doctimont was ns follows: To (lis Senate and Houso of Represen tatives: Tho financial standing of the nation at the present tlmo la excellent, and tho financial management of tho na tion's Interests by the government dur ing tho last flovon yoars has shown tho most satisfactory results. Hut our cur rency system Is Imperfect, and It Is ear nestly to be hoped that tho currency commission will bo able to propone a thorouchly Rood system which will do array with the existing dofects. During tho period from July 1, 1001, to September 30, IMS, thcto was an Increaso In the nmount of money In circulation of tMl,ti91,399. The Increase In tho per capita during this period was $7.0G. Within this Urn there wcro several occasions when It was necessary for the treasury de partment to come to tho relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds; by Increas ing deposits In national banks; by stim ulating additional Issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating Importations from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur rency system tins mnds these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance In tho fall of 1107 Immensely Increased tho dtfllculty of ordinary methods of relief, by the mid dle of November tho avallablo working balance In the treasury had been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing houso associations throughout the coun try had been obliged to resort to tho expedient of Issuing clearing house cer tificates, to be used as money. In this emergency It wan determined to Invite Subscriptions for 150,000,000 Panama canal wuiiui, anu ivu,vw,vw inrco per cent, certificates of Indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13. 1S9S. It was proposed to redepostt In the national banks tho proceeds of these Issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. Tho moral effect of this procedure was so Treat that It wits necessary to Issue only $24,031,980 of tho Panama bonds and $16, 

4JG.GO0 of tho certificates of Indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 80, 1003, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and tho net ordinary expenses of (he government bowed a surplus In the four years 1902. DOS, 100C, and 1907, and a deficit In tho years 1904, 1905, 1903 and a fractional part Of the fiscal year 1909. Tho net result was a surplus of $99,233,413.54. The finan cial operations of tho government during this period, based upon these differences (between receipts and expenditures, re. ulted In a net reduction of tho Interest bearing debt of the United States from 1937,141,040 to tS97,2C3.930. notwithstanding that thero had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting In tho aggrcgato to tJ4.C31,9S0. and an Issue of throo per cent, certificates of Indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1S9S, amounting to io,i3!),wv, uerunuing operations of tho treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted In the conver sion Into two per cent, consols of 1930 of 1200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of Interest. A decrease of $3,087,950 In the annual Interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during tho seven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the Interest-bearing debt by ninety millions. In splto of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual Interest charge. Control of Corporations. As regards the great corporations en gaged In Interstate business, and espe cially tho rallroadu, I can only repeat what I have already again and again said In my messages to the congress. I be llevo that under the Interstate clause of the constitution the United States has complete and paramount right to con trol all (agencies of Intoratato commerce, and I believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this right with wisaom ana erroctivencss so as both to tcure Justice from, and to do Justice to, the great corporations which are tho most important factors In modern busi ness. I believe that It Is worse than Colly to attempt to prohibit all com binations as Is dono by the Sherman anti-trust law, becauso such a law can bs enforced only Imperfectly and un equally, and Its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good, I strongly advocate that Instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, thero shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are In the Interest of tho publlo, but shall at the same tlmo give to some agency In the national government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire pub licity In all matters which the public has a right to kn6w, and furthermore, tho power, not by Judicial but by execu tive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of Improper favoritism or othor wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the Interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. Tho power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that It could exerclso complote supervision and control over the Issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. . . . Rates must be made as low as Is compatible with giving prop er returns to all the employes of the rail road, from the highest to tho lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders, but they must not. for Instance, be re duced u such fashion as to necessitate a enffin the wages of the emnloves or rrfc!fo abortion of the proper and legitimate lirouia ut uuiirni auurenoiuers. Telegraph and telephone companies en gaged In Interstate business should be put under the Jurisdiction of the Inter state commerce J commission. 'It is very earnestly to be wished that eur people, through their representatives, hould act In this matter. It la to ithe Interest ofi all of us that there should be .a (premium put upon In- t ., . iiumniiuiu .WJ,V"'U'." vuv """ parity, and an amplo reward for the great directing Intelligences alone com petent to manage tho great business op erations of to-day. It Is well to keep In mind that exactly as the anarchist Is the worst enemy of liberty and tho reaction ary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights of property liao most to fear from tho wrongdoers of great wealth, and tho men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from tho demagogues who In tho name of popular lights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men, honent men of wealth; for the success of either typo of wrongdoer necessarily In vites a vlolont reaction ngalnnt the cause tho wrongdoer nominally upholds. . . . Need of Centralization. The proposal to mako the Ra tional government supremo over, and therefore to give It complete control over, tho railroads and other Instruments of Interstate commerce Is merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one of the prlino purposes, If not tho prlmo purpose, for which tho constitution was foundod. It does not represent centrallxatlon. It represents merely tho acknowledgment of the pntent fact that centralization has already come In business. If this Irre sponsible outside business power Is to be controlled In the Interest of tho goncral public It ran only bo controlled In one way; by giving adequate power of con trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex ercising such power the national govern ment. To abandon tho effort for national control means to abandon the effort for all adequuto control and yet to rondcr like ly contlnunl bursts of action by state leg islatures, which cannot nchlevo tho pur pone sought for, but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring nny roa! bonoflt on the public, Thoro should be regulation by tho na tional government nf tho great Interstate corporations, Including n simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of tho Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. Thero should bo short-tlmo franchises for nil corporations engaged In publlo business; Including tho corporations which get power from water rights. Thero should lin national as well as stato guardianship of mine and forests. Tho labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to should con currently be enacted Into law. To accomplish this, means a certain In creaso In tho uso of not tho creation of power, by tho central government, Tho power ulrcady exists; It does not bavo to bo created; tho only question la whether It Bhnll bo used or left idle and meanwhile tho corporations over which tho power ought to bo exercised will not remain Idlo. The danger to Amer ican democracy lies not In tho least In tho concentration of ndmlnlstratlvo power In responsible and accountable hands. It lies In having the power Insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held rcsponslblo to the peoplo for Its use. Concentrated power Is palpablo, visible responsible, easily reached, quickly hold to account. Democracy Is In peril wherover the administration of po litical power is scattered among a variety of men who work in secret, whoso very names are un known to tho common people. It Is not In peril from any man who derives au thority front the people, who exercises It In sight of tho people, and who Is from tlmo to tlmo compelled to give an account of Its exorcise to the people. Legislation for Wageworker. Thore uro many matters affecting labor and tho status of tho wagoworker to which I should like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the problem In all Its aspects is not now nec essary. I bcllevo In a steady ef fort, or perhaps It would bo more accurato to say In steady efforts In many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which tho men who work with hand or with brain', the laborers, tho superintendents, tho men who produco the market and tho men who find a market for tho articles produced, shall own a far greater sharo than at present of tho wealth they pro duce, and bo enabled to Invest It In tho tools and Instruments by which all work la carried on. As far as possible I hopo tn sco a frank recognition of the advan tages conferred by machinery, organiza tion and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger sharo In tho ownership by wage-worker of rail way, mill and factory. Postal Savings banks will make It eaay for the poorest to keep their sav ings In absolute safety. Tho regulation of tho national highways must be such that thoy shall serve all people with equal Justlco. Corporate finances must be suVorvtsed bo as to mako It far safer than at present for tho man of small means to Invest his money In stocks. Thero must be prohibition of child la bor, u.mlnutlon of women labor, short ening of hourn of all mechanical labor; stock watering should bo prohibited, and stock gambling so far as Is possi ble discouraged. Thero should be a progrcRslvo Inheritance tax on largo fortunes. Industrial education should bo encouraged. As far as posslblo we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy; but theso qualities coaso to bo the main factors In accu mulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where It would tie seriously affected by any inheri tance tax such as I propose It Is emi nently right that tho nation should fix tho terms upon which tho great for tunes aro Inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who Inherit them In their cntlroty. Thero should no longer be any palter ing with the question of taking care of the wagoworkers who, under our pres ent Industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of tho regular incidents of a given busi ness. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, It call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-age pen sions have been taken In many of our private Industries, These may be In definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory schemes, or through tho agenoy of savings banks, as under the Massachusetts plan. Urgent Need of Reform. Our present system, or rather no oys. tern, works drendful wrong, and is of benefit to only ono class of people tho lawyers. When a workman Is injured what he needs Is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through immediato administra tive action. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to Interfere with this and similar movements. Pending a thoroughgoing Investiga tion and action thero Is certain legis lation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at the last session of the congress .granting compensation to certain classes of employes of the gov ernment .should be extonded to Include all employes of the government and should bo made more liberal in Its terms. There Is no good ground for the distinction made In tho law be tween those engaged In hazardous oc cupations and those not so en gaged. The terms of tho act pro viding compensation should be made ruoro liberal than in the present act. A year's compensation Is not ade quate for a wago-earner's family In the ovont of his death by accident in the course of his employment. And in the ovont of death occurring, say, ten or eleven months nfter the accident, the '""A family family would only receive as compen- the equlvalent-of one or tw months' earnings, In this respect the generosity of tho United States towards Its employes compares most unfavora bly with that of every country in Eu rope oven the poorest. I renow my recommendation made in n previous messago that half-holidays be granted during summer to all wago workers In government employ . I also renew my recommendation that tho prlnclplo of the eight-hour day should as rlpldly and as far as practi cable bo extended to tho entire work being carried on by the government; tho present law should be amended to embrace contracts on thoso publlo works which tho present wording of the net seem to exclude. Would Double Salaries of Judges. I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of increasing tho totally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the wholo thero Is no body of publlo servants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed roward Is so Inadequate compared to their work, Be ginning with tho supremo court the judges should have their salaries dou bled. It Is not befitting the dignity of the nation that its most honored publlo scrvnnts should bo paid sums so small compared to what they would earn In private life that the performance of publlo scrvlco by them Implies an ex ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It Is earnestly to bo desired that some method should bo devised for doing away with tho long delays which now obtain in tho administration of Justice, and which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons of small means, and favor only tho very criminals whom It In most dcsirablo to punish, Thcso long delays in tho final decisions of cases mako In tho nggrcgate a crying evil; and a remedy shorn J bo devised. Much of this Intolerable delay Is due to improper regard paid to technicali ties which are a mcro hlnderanco to JubMcr. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted In a striking denial of Justlco, and flagrant wrong to Mm body politic' Labor Leaders Criticised. At the last election certain leaders of organized labor mado a violent and nwccplng attack upon the entire Judi ciary of tho country, an attack couchod In such terms as to Include- tho most upright, honest and broad-minded Judges, no less than thoso of narrower mind and moro restricted outlook. Last year, bofore tho house com mlttco on Judiciary, thcso same labor leaders formulated their de mands, specif) Ing the bill that contained thorn, rofuslng all compro mise, stating thoy wished tho prlnclplo of that bill or nothing. They Insisted on a provision that In a labor dlsputo no Injunction should Issue except to protect a property right, and specifical ly provided that the right to carry on business should not bo construed as a property right; and In a second provis ion their bill mado legal in a labor dis pute any net or agreement by or be tween two or more persons that would not havo been unlawful if dono by a single person. In other words, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalizing, for Instance, thoso forms of the secondary boycott which the nnthraclte coal strlko com mission so unrcsorvedly condemned; while tho right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which tho law throws over property. Tho demand wns mado that thero should bo trial by Jury in contempt cases, thereby most seriously Impairing tho authority of tho courts. All this represented a courso of policy which, If carried out, would mean tho enthronement of class privilege In Its crudest nnd most brutal form, and tho destruction of ono of tho most essen tial functions of tho Judllcary tn all civ ilized lands. m Tho violence of the crusado for this legislation, and Its complete failure, lllustrato two truths which it is essen tial our people should learn. In tho first place, they ought to teach tho worklngman, the lahoror, tho wage worker, that by demanding what Is Im proper and impossible ho plays into tho hands of his foes. Such a crudo nnd vicious attack upon the courts, even If it were temporarily successful, would inevitably In tho end causo a violent reaction nnd would band the great mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the Judges, competent and Incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels of Justice stopped. Tho wagoworkers, the worklngmen, the laboring men of the country by tho way in which they repudiated tho ef fort to get them to cast their votes in response to nn appeal to class hatred, have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. Such an attltudo Is an object lesson in good citizenship to the entlro nation. Judicial System Sound. Our Judicial system is sound and effective at coro, and It remains, nnd must ever bo maintained, as tho safeguard of those principles of lib erty and Justice which stand at tho foundation of American Institutions; for, as Burko finely said, when liberty and Justice are separated, neither Is safe. There are, however, some members of the Judicial body who have lagged be hind in their understanding of thrso great and vital changes in tho body politic, whose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the old principles mado necessary by tho new conditions. Judges of this stamp do last ing harm by their decisions, bocauso they convince poor men In need of protection that the courts of the land aro pro foundly Ignorant of nnd out of sympathy with their neods, and profoundly Ignorant or hostllo to any proposed remedy. To such men It seems a cruel mockery to havo any court decide against them on tho ground that it desires to preserve "liberty" In a purely technical form, by withholding liberty In any real and con structive sense. Thero are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly det rimental to the rights of wage-workers. This Is truo of all decisions that decide that men are, by tho constitution, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undeslrablo or Improper number of hours, or to work In unhealthy surroundings; and therefore cannot rocover damages when maimed In that occupation, and cannot bo forbidden to work what tho legislature decides is an oxcesslvo num ber of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions which tho legislature decides to be unhealthy. Decisions such as those nullify tho legislative effort to protect the wago-workera who most need protection from those employ ers who take advantage of their grind ing need. They halt or hamper the move ment for securing better and more equi table conditions of labor. There Is also, I think, ground for tho bellof that substantial Injustice Is often suffered by employes In consequence of the cUBtonjofcourta Issuing temporary InJunctloruLjjvIthout notice to them, and punishing Am for contempt of court In Instances where, as a mattor of fact, they hove" no knowledge of any proceed ings. Organized labor Is chafing under the unjust restraint which comes from repoated rosort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unwisely expressed, and often Improperly expressed, but there Is a sound basts for It, and the or derly and law-abiding people of a com munity would be in a far stronger posi tion for upholding the courts It tho un doubtedly existing abuses could be pro vided against. Injunction Must Remain. The power of Injunction Is a groat equitable remedy, which should on no account he destroyed. But ' safeguards should be erected against Its abuse, In substance, provision should bo made that no Injunction or temporary re straining order Issue otherwise than on notice, except whero Irreparable Injury would otherwise result; and In such caso a hearing on the merits of tho order should be had within a short fixed pe riod, and. If not then continued after hoarlng, It should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered Immediately, and tho chance of delay minimized In every way. Moreover, I bellovo that the proceduro should bo sharply defined, and tho Judge required minutely to stato tho particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress can If It desires examine and investigate tho same. For many of the shortcomings of Justice in our country our peoplo as a whole aro themselves to blame, and tho Judges and Juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole. It Is discreditable to us as a people that thero should be difficulty In convicting murderers, or in bringing to Justice men who as publlo servants havo been guilty of corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of public servants. Tho result Is equally tinfortunate, whether due to hairsplit ting technicalities In tho Interpretation of law by Judges, to sentimentality and class consciousness on tho part of Juries, or to hysteria and sensational ism In the dally press. For much of this failure of Justlco no responsibility whatover lies on rich men as such. Wo who mako up tho mass of the peoplo cannot shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. Hut there Is an Impor tant part of the fullure wutch has spe cially to do with Inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly. The Modern Corporation. Tho hugo wealth that has been accu mulated by a fow Individuals of recent years, In what has amounted to a oo ctal and Industrial revolution, has been as regards Bomo of these Individuals mado posslblo only by tho Improper use of tho modern corporation. A certain typo of modern corporation, with Its officers and agents, Its many Issues of securities, nnd Its constant consolida tion with nllled undertakings, finally become! nn instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of clo monts that, under various Judicial de cision", lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved In tho human brain. Corporations aro necessary Instruments of modern busi ness. Thoy havo been permitted to becomo a menace largely becauso the governmental representatives of the peoplo havo worked slowly in provid ing for ndequato control over them. Our great clusters of corpora tions, hugo trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ tho very best lawyers thoy can obtain to pick flaws in statutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret agents who seek, under tho advice of experts, to render hostile lcglsla.lon Innocuous by mnklng It un constitutional, often through the Inser tion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions ugalnst tho Interests of tho parties inspiring them; whllo the demagogues, the cor rupt crenturon who Introduce black mailing echomes to "strlko" corpora tions, and all who demand extreme, and undesirably radical, measures, show themselves to bo tho worst ene mies of tho very public whoso loud mouthed champions they profess to be. Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting Interpretations oi tho Interstate commerco law. Con trol over tho great corporations doing Interstate business can be cffectlvo only if It Is vested with full power In an administrative department, a branch of tho federal executive, carrying out a federal law; It can novcr bo effective if n. divided responsibility Is left in both tho states and tho nation; It can never be effective if left in tho hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits. Respect for Law Must Be Upheld. The courtH hold a placo of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment. Respect for tho law Is essen tial to tho permanence of our Institu tions: and respect for tho law Is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts. It Is an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and In tho most carofully guarded manner. In no other nation In the world do tho courts wield such vast and far-reaching power as In tho United States. All that Is nec essary Is that tho courts as a whole should exercise this power with tho far sighted wisdom already shown by those Judges who scan tho future while they act in the present. Let them exorcise this great power not only honestly and bravely, but with wise Insight Into the neods and fixed purposes of tho people, so that they may do Justlco, and work equity, so that thoy may protect all per sons In their rights, and yet break down tho barriers of privilege, which Is the foe of right. Forest Preservation. If there Is any one duty which more than anothor we owo it to our children to pcrfim at once, It is to save tho for tt,' of this country, for thoy constitute the first and most Important elomont In tho conservation of the natural re sources of tho country. . . . Just as a farmer, after all his life making his living from his farm, will, If ho Is an ex pert farmer, leave It as an assot of In creased value to his son, so wo should leavo our national domain to our chil dren, Increased In value and not worn out. Thero are small sections of otir own country, In tho east and in the west, In tho Adlrondacks, tho White mountains and tho Appalachians, and in the Rocky mountains, whero we can already see for ourselves the damage In tho sliapo of permanent Injury to the soil and tho river systems which comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this deforestation Is duo to the actual reckless cutting of timber, to the fires that Inovltably follow such reckless cut- ting of timber, or to reckless and uncon trolled grazing, especially by tho greut migratory bands of sheep, the un checked wandering of. which over tho country means destruction to forests and disaster to the small home-makers, the settlors of limited means. Thanks to our own recklessness in tho use of our splendid forests, we havo alraady crossed the verge of a timber famlno In this country, and no measures that wo now take can, at least for many years, undo tho mischief that has already been done. Rut we can pre vent furthor mlschlof being done; and it would be in the highest degree reprehen sible to let any consideration of tem porary convenience or temporary cost intorfero with such action, especially as regards the national forests wtlch the nation can now, at this vary moment, control. The lesson of deforestation in China Is a lesson which mankind should havo learned many times already from what has occurred tn other places. Denuda tion leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare rock; and mean whllo the rock-waste buries tho bottom lands. When tho soli Is gone, men must go; and tho process does not take long. Plea for Inland Waterways. Action should be begun forthwith, dur ing tho present session of tho congress, for the Improvement of our Inland water waysaction which will result In giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. Until the work of river Improvement Is undertaken In a modern way It can not have results that will meet tho needs of this modern nation. The plan which promises the best and quick est results Is that of a per manent commission authorized to co-ordinate the work of all the government departments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a commission the actual work of construc tion might bo entrusted to the reclama tion service; or to tho military engineers acting with a sufficient numbor of civili ans to continue the work In tlmo of war; or It might bo divided between the rec lamation service and the corps of en gineers. Funds should be provided from jurront rovenues If It is deemed wise )therwlse from tho sale of bonds. The jssentlal thing Is that the work should go forward under tho best possible plan, and with tho least posslblo dolay. The time for playing with our waterways Is past. The country demands results. Tho president urgos thrtt national parks adjacent to national forests bo placed under tho control of tho forest eorvlco of tho agricultural depart ment; ho also points out tho boncQts derived from puro food legislation. Tho mossago continues: Needs of the Secret 8ervlce. Last year an amendment was Incor porated in tho mcasuro providing for tho secret service, which provided that thore should bo no detail from tho secret ocrv Ico and no transfer therefrom. Tho amendment In question was of benefit to no ono excepting to criminals, and It seriously hampers tho government In tho detection of crime and tho securing of Justice. Tho chief argument In favor of tho provision was that tho congressmen did not them selves wish to bo investigated by the secret service men. Very little of such Investigation has been done In tho past; but It Is true that the work of tho secret service agents was partly responsible for the Indictment and conviction of a sen ator and a congressman for land frauds In Oregon. I do not believe that It Is In tho public Interest to protect criminals In any branch of the public service, and exactly as wo have again and again dur ing the past seven years prosecuted and convicted such criminals who were In tho executive branch of tho government, so In my belief we should bo given ample means to prosecute them It found In tho legislative branch. But if this Is not considered desirable a special exception could be mado In the law prohibiting tho uso of tho secret service force In Inves tigating members of tho congress. Postal Savings Banks. I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with tho security of tho government behind them. The object Is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of mod erate means. It Is belloved that In the aggregate vast sums of money would bo brought Into circulation through tho In strumentality of the postal savings banks. Parcel Post. In my last annual messago I com mended tho postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of tho parcel poit on tho rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to tho mutual benefit of the farmor and the country storekeeper, and It Is dcsirablo that the routes, serving moro than 15,000,000 people, should bo utilized to the fullest practicable extent. Education. With the limited means hitherto pro vided, tho bureau of e ducatlon has rendered efficient service, but the con grens has neglected to adequately sup ply the bureau with means to meet tho educational growth of tho country. I earnestly recommend that this un fortunntn Htato of affairs as regards the national educational offlco bo reme died by adequate appropriations. This recommendation Is urged by the repro sentnttvex of nur common schools and great state universities and the leading educators, who nil unite in requesting favorable consideration and action by tho congress upon this subject. Tho president points out tho neces sity of better organization of tho vari ous bureaus rcsponslblo for tho public health, and urges the placing of all soldiers' homes undor tho jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood tho president says: I advocato the Immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be dono at the present session of the congress. Tho peoplo of the two ter ritories havo made It ovldont by their votes that thoy will not come In as one stato. The only alternative is to admit them as two, and I trust that this will be dono without delay. Interstate Fisheries. I call the attention of the congress to the importance of the problem of the fisheries In the Interstate waters. On tho Great Lakes wo aro now, under the very wise treaty of April 11 of this yoar, en deavoring to como to an International agreement for tho preservation and sat isfactory uso of the fisheries of these wa ters which can not othorwlso bo achieved. Lake Erie, for example, has tho richest fresh water fisheries In, the world; but It la now controlled by tho statutes of two nations, four elates, and one province, and this province by two different ordi nances In different counties. All these political divisions work at cross pur poses, and In no case can they achieve protection to tho fisheries, on the one hand, and Justlco to the localities and In dividuals on tho othor. Foreign Affairs. This nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must bo dono between nations precisely as between Individuals, and In our actions for tho last ton years we havo in this matter proven our faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and aro behaving, to wards other nations, as in private life an honorable man would behave to wards his fellows. Latin-American Republics. Tho commercial and material prog ress of tho 20 Latin-American republics Is worthy of tbn careful attention of the congress. The International Bureau of the American Republics 1b doing a useful work Ih making these nations and their resources hotter known to us. and In acquainting them not only with us as a peoplo and with our pur poses towards them, but with what we havo to oxchango for their goods. Panama Canal. The work on tho Panama canal is bo Ing done with a speed, efficiency and entlro devotion to duty, which make It a model for all work of tho kind. The men on tho Isthmus, from Col. Oaethals ana his fellow commissioners through the entlro list of employes who are faithfully doing their duty, havo won their right to tho ungrudging respect and gratitude of tho American people. Ocean Mall Lines. I again recommend tho extension of the ocean mall act of 1891 so that satis, factory American ocean mall linos to South Amorlca, Asia, the Philippines, and Australasia may bo established. Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. The Importance of thoso Islands is apparent, nnd tho need of Improving their condition and de veloping their resources Is urgent. The Philippines. Real progress toward self-government Is being made in the Philippine Islands. I trust that within a generation the time wilt arrlvo when the Philippines can decide for themselves whether It Is well for them to becomo Independent, or to continue under the protection of a , strong and disinterested power, able t guarantee to the Islands order at home and protection from foreign Invasion. Porto Rico. I again 'recommend that Amorlcan cit izenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico. Cuba. In Cuba our occupancy wilt cease In nbout two months' time; the Cubans have In orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and the Island will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on.thls occasion has lasted a lit tlo over two years, and Cuba has thriv en ond prospered under It Our earnest hopo and one desire Is that tho people of the Island shall now govern them selves with Justice, so that peace and or der may bo secure. Japanese Exposition. The Japanese government has post poned until 1917 the date of the great international exposition, the action be ing taken so as to Insure ample time In which to prepare to make the expo sition all that it should bo made. The American commissioners havo visited Japan and tho postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to bo represented at the exposition. Not slnco tho first international expo sition has thero been ono of greater Importance than this will be, marking, ns It does, tho fiftieth anniversary of tho ascension to the throne of tho em peror of Japan. The extraordinary leap to tho foremost placo among the nations of the world mado by Japan during this half century is something unparalleled In all provlous history. I take this opportunity publicly to stato my appreciation of the way tn which In Japan, In Australia, In New Zealand, and In all tho states of South America, tho battle fleet haa been ro cMvcd nn its practice voyage around tho world. Tho American government enn not too ntrongly express Its appre ciation of tho abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships tn every port they visited. The Army. As regards the army I call attention to tho fact that while our Junior offi cers and enlisted men stand very high, tho present system of promotion by seniority results In bringing into the higher grades many men of mediocre, capacity who have but a nhort time to serve. No man should regard It as his vested right to rise to tho highest rank in tho army any moro than In any other profession. It is a curious and by no means creditable fact that there should bo oo often a failure on the part of tho publlo and Its representa tives to understand the great need, from tho standpoint of the service and tho nation, of refusing to promote re spectable, elderly incompetents. The higher places should be given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration. In tho stress of modern Industrial com petition no business firm could succeed If those responsible for its management wcro chosen simply on tho ground that they were tho oldest people In Its em ployment; yet this is tho course advo cated as regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except thoso of general officer. As a mattor of fact all of the best officers In the highest ranks of tho army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or in part by a process of selection. Tho scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could con sider general unfitness to command for nny cause, tn order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present In tho elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this plan is recommended only it the congress does not soo fit to provld what In my Judgment is far betV mat is, ior selection in promotion, for elimination for age. Officers i. fall to attain a certain rank by a fc'c, tain ngc, should bo retired for In stance, ''At a m.in nhould not attain Held rank by the time he Is 45 he should of courso be placed on the re-' tired list. General ofllcera should be selected ns at present, and one-third of tho other promotions should be mado by selection, tho selection to be mado by tho president or secretary of war from a list of at least two candi dates proposed for each vacanoy by a board of officers from tho arm of the service from which tho promotion Is to be made. A bill Is now before the congress having for Its object to se cure the promotion of officers to vari ous grades at reasonable ages through a process of selection, -by boards of of ficers, of the least efflolontfor retire ment with a porcentago of their pay depending upon length of service. The bill, although not accomplishing all that should be done. Is a long step In the right direction; and I earnestly ' recommend Its passage, or that of a moro completely effective measure. National Guard. Now that the organized militia, the National Guard, has been Incorporated with the army as a part of the national forces, It behooves the government to do every reasonable thing In Its power to perfect Its efficiency. It should be assisted in Its Instruction and other wise aided more liberally than hereto fore. Tho continuous services of many well-trained regular officers will be essential In this connection. A bill is now pcndng before the congress creating a number of extra officers In tho army, which If passed, as it ought to be, will enable more officers to be trained as Instructors of National Guard and assigned to that duty. In caso of war it will be of the utmost Importance to have a large number of trained officers to use for turning raw levies Into good troops. The Navy. I approve tho recommendations of the general board for tho In- . crease of the navy, calling especial attention to tho need of addi tional destroyers and colliers, and above ftll, of tho four buttleshtps. It Is desir able to completo as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the best existing type. I most earnestly recommend that the goncral board be by law turned Into a general staff. Thero Is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing the pres ent bureau organization of tho navy. The navy should be treated as a purely mili tary organization, and everything should be subordinated to the ono object of se curing military efficiency. A system of promotion by morlt, cither by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced. It is out of the question, if the present principle of promotion by moro seniority Is kept, to expect to get the best rosulUt from the higher officers. Our men come loo old, and stay for too short u tlmo, In tho high command positions. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of tho battle fleet around the world. The Improvement of the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained far more experience In battle tactics than they would have gained If they had stayed in tho Atlantic waters. The American people have cause for profound gratification, both in view of the excellent condition of the Meet as shown by this cruise, and In view of the Improvement the crulso has workod In this already high condition. I do not bcllevo that thero Is any other service in the world in which the average of char acter and efficiency In the enlisted men Is as high as Is now the case In our own,
