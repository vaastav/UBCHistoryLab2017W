We refer to that, boon to weak, nervous, suffer in? women known as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. Dr. John Fyfe one of the Editorial Staff of The Eclectic Medical Review says of Unicorn root (FIclov.ius Dioicii) which is one of the chief ingredients of the "Favorite Prescription ": "A remedy which invariably acts as a uterine invisrorator * * * makes for normal activity of tho entire reproductive system." He continues "in Helonias we have a medicament which more fully answers the above purposes than any other dmg with which I am icumintcd. In the treatment of diseases peculiar to women it is seldom that a case is seen which does not present some indication for this remedied agent." Dr. Fyfe further says: "The following are amonfr the leading: * T,_l. l??l? indications iornuiuiu<w \uuuviuiww. v * ?**? or aching in the back, with leucorrhcea: atonic (weak) condition* of the reproductive organs of Homen. mental depression and irritability. associated wild chronic diseases of the reproductive organs of women; constant sensation at heat en the region of the kidneys; meabrrbagta (flooding), due to a weakened condition of/the reproductive system: amenorfneeartaurpressed or absent monthly oeriix]/.yaVsing^from or accompanying an abnowndl condition of tho digestive organs and /i/semic (thin blood ) habit; dragging >ensuions In the extreme lower part of tho ibdoroen."

It s universally regarded as the tonic useful in til debilitated states." Prof. R. Bartholow, M.

The first day of a session never de j velops much oi interest to those usee I to attending the sessions of congress j but no other day cf a session seem; j to possess greater charm for the av j erage citizen. | The fact that both houses of con ! gress were to meet for the short ses | sinn had the effect early in the daj j of giving the capitol an appearance j of activity such as it has not pre ; sented since adjournment last June, j Senators and members of the house i began to arrive early in the day anc ! there were many cordial greetings 1 in the corridors and on the floors j Speaker Cannon and many othei ! prominent members of the house ar ! liveu cii me icipiivi iuu^ uciuic ui?

No effort was made to trans act business, even in the committee ; rooms. The day was given over abso j lutely to receptions and the forma' i business of opening the session. | Practically all the veterans of tftt J senate "were on hand, most of them j looking hale and hearty, as if their : summer rest followed by a busy cam| paign had agreed with them. One ol the familiar faces most missed was that of Senator Allison.

J Vice President Fairbanks beamed i upon the two or three score of sena' <nr<3 who sonffht him out in his room I before the seriate opened. Most of the prominent democrats, were in attendance, one exception being Bailey, who left Washington a few days ago for his home in Texas to meet and answer direct the charges brought against him by the attorney general. Numerous expressions of regard for Senator Bailey were heard and his friends predict that he will be able to answer fully the charges which have been published. Bailey is looked upon by his coll^pgues as one of the strongest men in the democratic minority and has many warm admirers in Washington. Representative Landis of Indiana introduced a bill requiring all railroads to use the automatic block signal on their lines. This bill was inspired by the recent disastrous wreck on the Southern in which President Spencer lost his life. It took the senate fifteen minutes to arrange its preliminaries, and the house an hour. The senate received from President Roosevelt a Ibng list of appointments for its con firm ration. Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania and Foraker of Ohio came forward with resolutions of inquiry regarding the discharge of the negro troops of the twenty-fifth infantry. One was addressed to the president, and the other to the secretary of war. After th<a rinnle of surDrise had passed, and Vice President Fairbanks had suggested that it was unsual to transact any business until the president's message had been received, the resolutions "went over" by unanimous consent. Not in years has a larger number of members-elect of the lower bouse of congress presented themselves at the speaker's desk to take the oath of office.

A decision handed down by the United States supreme court Monday | relative to the shipment of liquor from Augusta, Ga., to Charleston, S. C., establishes the right of a man j ) living in a dry county or a dispensary county to receive liquor from other sections for his own use. It places such shipments under the interstate commerce law until actually delivered. This decision gives a serit ous blow to communities wishing to t lorbid the importation of liquor in any form. The supreme court holds ' that a person lias the right to order liquor sent him and places such shipments under the interstate commerce ^ law until actually delivered. The case was that of Paul Heyman ' vs. the Southern Railway company, and the supreme court of the United States dealt with the question of the extent to which a railroad company becomes an insurance company to its r freight patrons. , Heyman is a wholesale liquor dealer [ in Augusta, Ga., and when some years ago he sold and shipped two consignments of whisky to purchasers j in Charleston, S. C., it was immedi( ately seized by the state authorities and destroyed in pursuance of the i iSouth Carolina dispensary law, while still in the warehouse in which it i imrt hePTi nlaced by the railroad com- | f I { pany. Heyiaan was compelled to rej turn the purchase price to the. consignees, and then sought to recover from the railroad company on the ground that the lailroad company had , insured the safe deliveryr of the goods, j I The Georgia supreme court held j , that as the property had been seized ' under legal authority, the company could not he held liable. The opinion , of the federal supreme court was delivered by Justice White and reversI ed the findings of the lower court. HIRED TO CALL STRIKE.

A Chicago dispatch says: Albert.| i Young, who, with three other labor . leaders, confessed to conspiracy in the teamsters' strike before Judge Ball, i declared, while on the witness stand, that Cornelius Shea, another defend-! ant, himself and some others had been t , bribed to call the strike against Mont- j ; gomerv, Ward & Co. i "I received $300 as my share," wuo J ; ihe statement of Young in telling the j story of the strike. i i "Shea, myself and some others met Robert Norsen, representative of 1 the Garment Workers' Union, in the i stock exchange building to talfc about j i the matter," said Young, "and Nor- J - sen displayed $1,500 and offered it to " - A j . us to can a sinne agamst iuwu^uuii ery, Ward & Co. We accepted it, Shea and myself getting $300 each. We then went to Shea's office and he said: 'We will have to make good.' , Then a strike was called." t " : BRITONS TO BUY COTTON LANDS. I i Manchester and Lancashire Manufacturers Want 5,000 Acres. It is announced in 'New Orleans by Col. F. M. Welch, in charge of the Gould system immigration bureau in that city, that the representatives of I . the Lancashire and Manchester Cot- j | tdn Spinners' Association, who have ust completed a tour of the cotton belt, ^practically have decided to purchase a 5,000 acre tract of cotton land each in Louisiana and Mississippi withv a view to raising and shipping cotton to their own mills in Lancashire and Manchester. The lands under consideration in Louisiana are in Red River, Avoyelles, Ouachita and Tensas parishes. The experiment of handling cotton /ifwvm thp farms tn tha sninners. if carried out, will be of far-reaching effect.

The , latest phase of the campaign is "The " Battle of the Mugs."

If anyone thinks there has not been ' considerable improvement made In the last quarter of a century in the use of alcoholic beverages, let him ^ stop to consider, among other things, r the fact that the old custom of New c Year's calls and the genel'tippling i is nearly obsolete. a The custom of calling on ' one's j friends, however, at the beginning of j ? ? *** ?
