That is an interesting report' which comes from Washington to the effect that a great national university is to be established there, and that Andrew Carnegie is the benefactor by whose generosity the institution will be set upon its feet. It ia, according to the story, to be entirely independent of gov. ernment control, though undoubtedly the basis on which it will rest will be the use of the government's scientific, literary, and artistic collections and facilities. It is mentioned that Mr. Car- negie will etart the Institution with a gift of $10,000,000. With such Institutions as Tale and Harvard in existence we do not sup pose that a "great national university" is really needed, even if it can be made to order. But It Is well to wait and see what the scheme is before saying much about it. A or THIS HEAL THiXQ.' That is a rather poor idea of fun which some St. Louis men have. They have formed the Henpecked Husbands' Association. Meetings are held at the homes of the members, and from these meetings the wives are barred. The object of the association is described as the promotion of forgetfulness of sor rows. If any member of the society should inadvertently praise his wife at a meeting he is to be heavily fined or expelled. Of course these men are not really henpecked. If they were they wouldn't be holding meetings in their own houses to talk about it or to eat, drink and smoke over It. They have probably better wives than they deserve. When married men are so comfortable and well treated that they feel Impelled to form a Henpecked Husbands' Associa tion to vary the gentle monotony they are in good case, and their action In forming such an association Indicates that they don't know when they are well off. The best thing the St. Louia men can do is to break up the associa tion by such praise of their wives as will result in the expulsion of all the members. The wives evidently deserve jr Carter Harrison of Chicago Is much praise for quietly putting up with Jnjj the anarchists hold meetings such antics.

Hanotaux, "that public opinion In the United States should not now be quite as well aware of the real facts in this matter as Is the United States Department of State." M. Hanotaux states that the alleged European demonstration against the United States was rendered im possible not by Great Britain, but by Russia. "Count Muravieff, then Rus sian minister of foreign affairs," ex plains the French statesman, "commu nicated to the Spanish ambassador at St. Petersburg the absolute formal re fusal of Russia to mix herself in any way with a quarrel which did not con cern Russian interests." This commu nication, "couched in the most em phatic, almost brutal language," as M. Hanotaux characterizes it, made a European coalition against the United States impossible. If we don't owe that "debt of grati tude" to Great Britain much lovely sen timent has been wasted. ' '1 he Child Eternal.

When Alaska was bought by the United States It was not generally un derstood that Alaska was a good farm ing region, and It Is only lately that Its quality In that respect has been made apparent. It now appears that Alaska Is capable of sustaining a rural popula tion of 3,000,000. This is the conclusion reached by Professor C. Georgeson, who has had charge of the experiments con ducted in Alaska by the Department of Agriculture. At "Sitka ' it was found that hardy crops "could be grown, but that at present the cost of production la so great as to make the development of the surrounding country unprofitable. It was in the Yukon Valley that the most favorable results were obtained. What was accomplished there convinc ed Professor Georgeson that there are vast stretches of land in the Interior south 6f the Yukon river on which the hardier grains can be raised with profit just as Soon as there are transportation facilities. At one station rye which was planted August l, 1900, came through the long winter In excellent condition,' and matured by August 1, this year. Barley and spring wheat ripened in time to escape all damage from frost. Many vegetables were found to be well adapted to the far north. There is also reason to believe that cat tle and horses can be raised with profit over a large territory. Horses tnat have been turned loose by prospectors to take care of themselves have not had any trouble In finding food, summer or winter. Sheep have defied the rigors of the climate and flourished on the native vegetation. Probably the emigration of farmers from this country to Alaska will not soon be very lively, but it is encourag. ing to know that It is possible to live there.

WHOM DO WK OWE XI? Nowadays Just as one gets firmly set tled In the notion that this or that ia true somebody comes along and shows that the notion, if not entirely ridicu lous, is not well founded. Perhaps most of the people of the United States be lieve they owe a debt of gratitude to Great Britain for preventing a Euro pean coalition against the United States early in 1898. The story was that the governments of Continental Europe had. decided upon concerted action to prevent the United States from depriv ing Spain of her territorial possessions in the West Indies. The success of the movement depended upon the co-opera tion or neutrality of Great Britain. The British government was sounded unof ficially by the representative of one of the European powers, interested in the scheme as to what its attitude would ie in the event that pressure was brought to bear' upon the United States. Great Britain's reply, we were told, was a prompt and unconditional refusal to take part In the movement, coupled with the Intimation that if the United States was attacked by the European coalition Great Britain would make common cause with America. Now comes M. Gabriel Hanotaux, who was the French minister of foreign affairs during the Spanish-American war1, and denies that the attitude of Great Britain had any bearing upon the til ju) I can get,"- . collapse of the European coalition in MAULED BY A LION. On Friday, October 10, news reached Mombasa of a tragedy' in the lion haunted Athl river district. Two mili tary officers had been shooting ort the Athl Plains, which teem with "game and are infested by more Jlons than any other locality in East Africa. On the 9th one of the sportsmen, Captain B. C. de Gex, of the Lancashire Fuslleers, started with his gun-bearer and a few porters on the spoor of a lion along the bank of the river. The Hon was caught sight of skulking away abnut 100 yards off toward a bed of reeds and De Gex fired, hitting him with an eight bore rifle shot. The animal, however, was only wounded, and before the sec ond shot could be given had gained the cover of the reeds. Knowing it to be foolhardy to enter the reeds in pursuit De Gex set his porters to burn them and waited for the exit of the Hon. Then occurred the incident which makes the most hardened of African Safari hunters wonder. A rhinocerous happen ed to be unnoticed among the reeds close by and, catching sight of the En glishman, made a vicious charge at him from behind. The yells of the porters warned De Grex, and ho turned and with one shot killed the charging rhi noceros. There was a snarl and a crush behind him and the wounded Hon had him by the right arm, and the whlto man and the beast were rolling about In the red dust of the Athl Plains. The porters fled to a man, but the gun bearer ran up and from a magazine rifle fired two shots Into the heart of the lion, killing him. The Injuries received by De Gex were frightful; his right arm gnawed to a pulp, his chest torn and both legs broken. He was carried to the Athi river station on the Uganda railway, a doctor was telegraphed for and the Injured man conveyed to Nairabi. The injuries, however, proved fatal, De Gex dying at 11 a. m. on Oc tober 10. Edinburgh. Scotsman. prosperity of its neighbors, and that the Impoverishment of one country brings financial depression upon others, even upon rivals and enemies. This truth is made the more evident as the peoples of the earth are drawn closer together by trade, by improvement in navigation, and by the cable. Demoralization In the financial, center of one country is quickly felt in the financial centers of the other nations. The markets of the world are dependent upon each other. We have been taught to love our ene mies, although we have not often put the precept Into practice; we must now learn that a care for their material wel fare is good policy as well as good morals. Thus It may be seen that it would not be advantageous for' a nation to destroy the property of an enemy's merchants, even if It could completely defend Its own commerce. ,But no nation Is pow erful enough to guarantee complete im munity to its sea trade. The commerce of both belligerents must suffer, so that each sustains a double damage; a direct loss in its own commerce, In addition to an indirect ' loss through the needless impoverishment of the merchants of the enemy. The present International custom permitting seizure of private property at sea is a direct menace to the prosperity of every shipowner, and of every merchant who ships his goods abroad, It is harmful financially and useless politically. Under different cir cumstances of life and trade it was per haps a useful Instrument; but It is now out; of date, and, like an ancient can non, is as dangerous to those who at tempt to make use of it as. to those against whom It is directed. ' Com merce has at times made protests against this eword of Damocles above Its head; but commerce has not yet lifted Its voice in Imperious demand, as its importance would justify it in doing. One cause of this apparent indiffer ence on the part of shipowners is that, while they see that the law of seizure is ruinous to their own individual inter ests, they have a vague Idea that for some occult reason the law is necessary to the state for political purposes. This Idea Is erroneous. The law of seizure eerves no good purpose In the state. On the contrary, it Is most pernicious in that it tends to destroy the commerce and wealth which uphold the state.
