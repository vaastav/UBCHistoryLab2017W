It is extremely rare to flrwl a bank has failed' without some of the officers committing fraudulent or lUeg al acts to hid» it. Every examiner, however, has many cases to refwrt which are taken up and corrected, sometimes after they have become very bad. flhere are a great many such cases where a bank gets in to more or Ie«s serious trouble, and yet is saved, wh« re one goes on to fail ure. "After a bank falls and disclosures of dishonesty are made, It Is wonder ed why such things couldi go on ua discovered so long. The examiner Is j&'ji t)lamed and abused, with or without reason.

It Is frequently an astounding revela tlon to all of these that the banker who has failed!, defaulted, and per haps absconded or killed himself, is not a man of wealth as well as the ideal of honor and business integrity. Only men who establish such reputations have the opportunity to betray large trusts, and of these, only those with skill, shrewdness, and peculiar cour age can cany them on for any length of time without discovery.

For every birth and death in the state there is a report mad? vo the stale ooard of health on a blank 7% Inches by 8% Inches. A margin is left on one edge of these reports and it is expected to sort them out fcy counties and townships alphabetically arranged and bind them in Book*. As there are from ISO 000 to 200,000 of these reports every year, and. destined to be many nroie than that whei a'i deaths and ^irtbs are reported, '.line will be frm fifteen to twenty Hg books of 1,000 sheets, or 2,000 pages each, to be bound up each year to be filed away. The executive council bought a filing case of the new mod ern type for the state bO'ar& of health t«,Qle reports in. Inside of six months the filing Case was filled and now the reports are being stacked up around the room on the tables, desks, window sills and even on the floor awaiting some method of filing them till they are ready to be bound. Und-jr tl:e present law the secretary of state must keep the accounts and. credit the differ ent registrars with the amounts they are to be paid for their work. They are paid from the county treasuries twenty-five cents for each report and for each postal card saying there have been no deaths or births reported. It keeps one clerk in the office of the secretary of state busy keeping these accounts which are certified to the county auditors and bj' these warrants are drawn on the county treasurers. Dr. Kennedy believes that considerable confusion would be avoided .If all the work were to be done In one office, either in the office of the secretary of state or the board of health. But the chief difficulty he finds is due to the physicians and others not reporting the deaths and births. They receive no compensation for such reports and, hence he says it is difficult to get them educated. The law has been In,force but about eighteen months and Dr. Kennedy believes with continued agi tation the physicians will get in the way of making the reports more reg ularly, but acknowledges that the sta tistics are worthless unless some method Is devised of getting reports Of all deaths and births. fv 'i The supreme court will meet next Tuesday for the fourth and last period of the September term.

NO CHARGE AGAINST GOODNOW Name Not Mentioned in Brown's Talk With President on Chines* Boy cott. -v Washington, Dec. 7.—An autfcorlta yve statement ill m&de at the state de partment' that J. H. Efroiwn, of Port land, Ortj., who saw the president yea-' terda^'tfrta discussed the: Chlnese boy cott, has not made any charges, against John Goodnow former consul, general at Shanghai, as, being a promoter 6t or In other ways connected with, the boy cott to the disadvantage of American Interests. A further statement Is made that if Brown had made such charges they would not have been considered, as Mr. Goodnow is not now connected with the government In any way. In this connection, it was said today, that at the time the boycott was In full swing, unofficial charges were made to the state department that Mr. Good now was one of those who conceived it and that he was energetic In pushing it among this Chinese. It cainot be said that the department took cogni zance' of these charges, but the story is that Mr. Goodnow repHed to them, denying that he had anything to do with them, and presenting documen tary evidence of his connection with certain American business houses, do ing business in China, and showing that if the boycott were enforced it would mean- the total loss of buslnesa to himself. This statement could not, be verified, and, in fact, officers of the department, who were asked about it, declared they had not heard it. Department officials, with whom Mr. Brown has talked, say that he Is urg ing reforms in the consular service In China, particularly with reference to consular courts and the Imposition of certain fees.

President Roosevelt did not expati ate on the desirability of the maximum and minimum tariff In his message. De cause, as I am told, he had received as surances from the leaders of both houses that they favored the idea. Our foreign relations are involved to such an extent that It was not deemed •wise to call general attention to this subject thru the medium of an extend ed discussion In his word to congress, Yet today Senator Lodge of Massa chusetts, the acknowledged spokesman of the administration, introduced a maximum and minimum tariff bill in the senate. At the same time, I was told by one of the ways and means committee of the house his colleagues almost surely would adopt a similar bill and urge Its passage. There Is a vast significance in these two statements, for If such a Itfll Is passed direct reciprocity with any na tion will be Immediately possible, and the great American commonwealth will have in Its hands already fashioned a club with which to beat down the com mercial hostility of Germany and other nations.
