The limited amount was inadequate to pay all witnin the purview of the law the full rate of tifty centa per mile, aud it would have been unjust and .uuwise to have given it to some and denied it to other*, Nor could contracts have been let under the law lv all at a rate to have brought the aggregate without such practicil pre-arrangement of terms a* would have violated it. The rate of sea and i aland postage which was proffered under another statute appears to be a fair compensation for the desired service, being three times the price necessary to secure transporta* tion by other vessels upon any route and much beyond the charges made hy private persons for services not less bur densome. Some of the steamship com panies, upon the refusal of the Post master General to attempt by the means provided the distrihntioa of the sum ap pro|Tated as extra c ->npeneation, with drew the service of their vessels uud thereby occasioned slight inconvenience, though no considerable injury. The mails have been dispatched by other means. Whatever may be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line or pub lic conveyance ur travel, I am satisfied tliat.it -should nut be done undercover of an exptndlture incident to the admin* istr.ition oi a department, uor should there be any uncertainty as to the rj* tipieuis of the subsidy or any discretion left to any executive officer as to it* dis tribution. If suchgifisof public money are to be mude for the purpose of aiding any enterprise in the supposed interest of the public, I cannot but think lhat the amount to be paid and tbe bjudioiary might better be determined by Congress than any other way. Tbo message deals at great length of tholndiau question. After reviewing the facta about the education of the In diana and their tribal relations, the President says: I recommend the pas sage of a law authorizing the appoint ment of six Commissioners, three ef whom shall he detailed from the ant /, to he charged with the duty of a caretal inspection from time tn time of all the Indians upon our reservations, or sub ject to the control of ibe government, with a view of discovering their exact condition and needs and determining what steps should be taken on befoul of the government to relieve their situa tion in the direction of their self-support and complete civilization; that tbe gov ernment ascertain from such inspection what, if any, reservations may be re duced in area, and in snob eases what part not needed for Indian occupation may be purchased by the government from the Indians and disposed of for their benefit; what, if any, Indians may. with their consent, be removed to other reservations with a view of their concen* The President urges that transconti nental roads be held to a strict account ability in the matter of their grants. He recommends legislation to prohibit the construction of bridge l * over naviga ble water in such manner as to obstruct navigation. "The report of the Secre tary of the Navy gives a history of the operations of his depattmeut, and the present condition of the work committed to .his charge. He details in full the course pursued by him to protect the rights of the Government, in respect of certain vessels unfinished at the time of his accession to ofhee, and also eoocern iog ti..- 4*w>pßtch boat, "Dolphin"claim ed to be completed and waiting the ac ceptance of the Department. No one c in fail lo see from the recital contained in this report that only the application of business principles haa beeu insisted upon iv the treatment of these subjects, aud that whatever controversy has aris en was caused by the exaoiion on the part of the Department of tbe contract obligations, as they were legally construed in tbe case of the " Dolphin," with entire justness to the contractor. Congress in its session authorized the construction of two additional new cruisers and two gunboats at a cost not exceeding in the aggregate 15,M5,0Q0. Steps have been taken for the procurement of such plana for the construction of these vessels as would be likely to insure their useful ness whea completed. We have not a single vessel of war that could keep the sea against a first-class vessel of any importaut power. The nation that can not resist aggression is constantly ex posed to it; ita foreign policy is of ne cessity weak, and its negotiations are conducted with disadvantage because it is not in a condition to enforce the terms dictated by its sense of right and jus tice. I deem it my duty to especially direct the attention of Congress to the close of the report of the Secretary oi the Nary, in which the humiliating fea tures of the present organization of this department is exhibited, The convic tion is forced upon us that before we proceed further in the restoration of a o ivy we need a thoroughly reorganized Navy Department." 

MORMON MATTERS. "In the Territory of Utah the law of the United States passed for the sup pression of polygamy has been energeti cally and faithfully executed during the pa«t year, with measurably good results. A number of convictions have been se cured for unlawful cohabitation, and in some cases pleas of guilty have been en tered and slight punishments imposed on promises by ttie accused that they would not again offend against the law, nor advise, counsel, aid or abet in any way ita violation by others. The Utah Commissioners express tbe opinion, based upon such information as they are able to obtain, that but few polyga mous marriages have taken place in tbo territory during the last year. They further report that while there cannot lie found upon the registration lists of voters Ihe name of a man actually guilty of polygamy, aod while none of that class are holding office, yet at the laat election In the Territory all the officers elected except in one county, were men who though not actually living io the practice of polygamy subscribe to the doctrine of polygamous marriage as a D vine revelation and a law unto all higher and more bindiog upon the con sci-uce than any human law, local or national. Thus is the strange specticle represented of a community protected hy a repnbhean form of government to which they owe allegiance, sustaining by their suffrage a principle and a belief which acts at naught that obligation of absolute cbediencc to the law of the land, which lies at tbe foundation of republican institutions; the strength, the perpetuity and the destiny of the nation rests upon our homes—established by the law of Ood, guarded by parental oare, regulated by parental authority and sanctified by parental love—these are not the bomeß of polygamy. The moth era of our land who rule the nation as they mould the characters and guide the actions of their sons, live according to Ood's holy ordinance and each, pnrn and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood, unperverted and un polluted, upon all within her pure aod wholesome family eirch; these are not the cheerless, crushed and unwomanly mothers of polygamy. The fathers of onr families are the best citi zens of tbe republic. Wife andchildren are the sources of patriotism aod conju gal ami parental affection and beget de votion so ihe country. The man who, undefi ej with plural marriage, la sur rounded in his single home with his wife and ohildreu has a stake in the country which inspires him with re spect fur its laws and ooorags for its defense. These are not the fathers of polygamous families. There is no loature of this practice or tha systems which sanction it which are not opposed to all that is of value in our institutions. There shonld be no relaxation in the tirra but just execution of the Law In operation, and I should be glad to approve such farther discreet legislation as will rid this country of this blot upon Its fame."

He Doom Not Advocate Silver fo Any Great Extent—Sound on Other Matters. \k\eeial to the Herald hf fJaf A*sociated Pre*: | U'ahhinuton, Decembers. —The fol lowing is the text of tbe President's message: To the Coitgre** of the ( T nitert States: Your assembling is clouded by a sense of public bereavement, caused by the recent and sudden death of Thomas A. Hendricks, Vice-President of the United States. His distinguished public ser vice, his complete integrity and devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues will find honorohle record in his conn try's history. Ample and repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence in whicb he was held by his fellow country men were manifested by bis election to offices of the most important trust and highest dignity, and at length, full of years and honors, he ha* been laid at rest, amid-it general sorrow and benedic tion. The Constitution, which requires those chosen t" legislate for the people to annually meet and discharge their solemn trust, alao requires tho President to give to Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such mevmrrs aa he shall deem noos'tary. It ia well for us to bear in mind thai our usefulness to the people's interest will be protnp ed by constant at>preoiati~m of the scot}* and character of our respeotive duties as ihey relate to the Federal Legislature. While ths Executive moy recommend mcb measures as he may deem expedient, tbe responsibility for legislative action must and should rest upon those srlected by the people to make their laws The message refers to the continued peace of the United Statea with all other nations and ptates; there are no questions of difficulty pending with any foreign government. It mention* the hill for the construc tion of the Nic traguau c*nal by the United States which was introduce lin the last Senate, and slates that th" President has withdrawn it and will withhold it from resubmission. It speaks with favor of tho Tehuante pec railway project. 

TIIE CHINESE QUESTION. On the Chinese question he says: "Tbe condition of the Chinese question iv the Western States and Territories i 4 far from being satisfactory." He then cites the recent anti-Chinese movements, and continues: "There la apprehension that bitterness of feeling against the Mongolian race on the Pnoifi j slope may find vent in a similar lawless demonstra tion. The message asserts that the Chinese outrages are traoeable to the lawlessness of men not citizens of tho Unite 1 Sta'ei. In reference to ths Chi nese restriction laws he says: "If the existing laws are inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be pleased to give earnest consideration lo any further remedial measures. lie favors the confirmation of the commercial treaty with Mex ico and International copyright leg islation, and recommends tIU Mipe*t of the act providing for the in\eslnj?nt of trust funds in the handa of the United States; requests that the legislature permit tbe denaturalization and general improvement of the naturalization laws; opposes the confirmation of reciprocal treaties with the Spanish West Indies; favor* legislation to increase the facili ties of intercourse with contiguous na tions; recommends increased appropria tions for diplomatic aud consular service and its general revision; favors the re daction of internal taxation. THE TARIFF yCESTION. Oq tbe tariff question he says: Justice aod fa-mess dictate that any modifica tion of our present laws, industries and interests in which our citizens have large investments ahould not be ruth lessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in such a man ner as to protect the interests of Ameri can labor. He recommends that a tariff reduction be made on tbe necessaries of life. THE 

SILVER QUESTION*. He introduces the silver question in tha following words: "Nothing more important thau toe present condition of oar currency and coi< age can claim your attention. The desire to utilise the ad ver product of the country ahould not lead to a misuse or perversion of the coinage power." He enters into a his tory of silver coinage from the time of the passage of the silver coinage hill in February, 1878, and reviews ihe result-* of compulsory coinage. Of this he says: "The condition i;i which our treasury may be placed by persistence in our present course is a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen. We have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the present needs of the people." He refers to the steamboat inspection service aud details how $170,000 wonld be saved in oouduoting it dining tbe cur rent year. He speaks of the effeciivo service of the Marine Hospital officials iv prevent ing the invasion of cholera fro.n Spain and France and smallpox from Canada He expresses gratification at the re sults of the Life-Siving Service during the past fiscal year, and adverts to the irregularities on the part of the officials of the Coast and Go id' ti.i Survey S*t vice, aud states that tb*y hay» been remedied by changes made in tho ser vice an 1 recommends that the survey portion of the service bo transferred to the Navy ll\t- ■ ~ -n 

ARMY MATTERS. On army asatsetS it calls attention lo tne services of the military in connection with the Arizona Indian outbreak, the threatened outbreak in the Indian Ter ritory, the expulsion of the Oklahoma boomers, the anti-Chinese riots in Wyo ming and tbe threatened Chinese tiouhle in Washington Territory. In connection with desertions and other offenses committed hy the sol dices and officers, be saysi The auggeition that probably more than half of tho army hive been tried for offense* great and small in one year, may well arrest attention. If some of tbe proceedings of Ihe courts-martial which I have had occasion to examine present the idea of justice which gen erally prevail iv these tribunals, I am satisfied that they should he much re formed, if the honor and the honesty of ths army aud navy are by their instru mentality to he vindicated aud pro tected. The Board of Fortifications or other defensos appoiuted In purauaice of ths provisions of the act of Coi gress ap proved March 3, 1885, will in a short time present their report, and it is hoped that their report may greatly aid the legislation so nscetsary to remedy the present defenseless condition of our sea coast. The work of the Signnl Service has been prosecuted during the lust year with the result of increasing tbe benefit lo tbe country. In view of the fact re ferred to hy the Secretary of War that the work ~f thru service ordinarily is of a scientific nature, and the further fact that it is assuming larger proportions constantly and hecomiug mere and more unsuited to the Axed nilei which must govern tho nrm y , iam inclined to agree with him in the opinion that it should he separately established. The Military Academy of \\ ott p l((nt is reported as being iv a high state of efficiency and well equipped for the sit isfactorv accomplishment of the pur poses of its maintenance.

He reiterates his formerly expressed views on this subject and says: "1 venture to hope that we never shall again ho remitted to tbo system which distributes public positions purely as a reward for parlizau services. Doubts may well be entertained whether our government ooold survive the strain of a continuance of this sys tem which upon every change of admin iHtratioo inspires an immense army of claimants for office to lay siege to the patronage of the government, engrossing the time of public officers, and their im portunities spreading abroad the conta glon of their disappointment and tilling the air with tbe tumult of their discon tent at tht functions of the Presidential othce, has caused public anxiety ami a just demand that a recurrence of such a condition of affairs should not he per mitted," "In conclusion. I commend to the wise care aod thoughtful attention of Con gress the needsand welfare of an intelli gent nation. To subordinate these to the narrow advantages of partisanship or the accomplishment of sellish aims is to violate the people's trust and to betray the people's interests, but an individual sense of responsibility on the part of each of us ana a stern determination to perform our duty well mu*t give un place among toose who have added iv their day and generation to the glory and prosperity of our beloved land.

The Noted Millionaire Passes Away. j 

HONEY COULD NOT SAVE HIM. The Active Brain of the Rich Man Stilled by Paralysis Without a Note ot Warning. \ftpeeial In the Herald by Antaciated Pre.'A New Yokk, December 3 — William H. Vaoderhilt is dead. Without a mo ment's warning tbe messenger came for biin and he was no more. The gilt iron cross over the gate that leads to the grounds of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum ou Fifth avenue gleamed bright ly under tbe electric lamps to-nigbt, aa seen from the graud entrance to the Vanderbilt mansion, directly opposite, against the sombre gray of the marble cathedral. It was the only cheerful thing oh the wide, deserted avenue, that seemed also stricken as with sudden death. The rays of its brightness were reflected in the windows of the huge browu stone pile behind whose closed curtains one of the richest men iv the world lay dead -stricken suddenly and without warning. Tbe busy hum and noise of traffic wore bushed in the block. Carriages turned ont and stopped to inquire if it was true that the millionaire was dead. Being told that they had heard aright, they went their way sobered and silent, tarrying mayhap a moment to gay/: pityingly upon the huge, stonu pde. luside servants and friends tip toed attout with grave faces. The door bell was rung almost every minute an I the wide portal* awung open to admit other friends who camo to mourn with the mourners. Upstairs, behind the drawn curtains of the millionaire's bed room, were sobs and tears. The chil dreu of the dead man were gathered there about his corpse. None of them bad been with biin in the hour of bis death—to none had be timo to apeak a word of farewell. Am he lay upon the bed in the large square room, the win dows of which overlook the avenue from the northeast corner, from tbe south wing of the building, to the left of the main entrance, Mr. Vanderbilt looked as though he had fallen into a gentle sleep. His features were peaceful and as i at ural as if he bad just ceased talking and laid down to rest. His death had )>een as painless as it was sudden, Mr. Vander bdt was always un early riser. When in his young days he worked his Staten Island farm, it was his custom to rise with the sun aud he had to .say in hia latter life he had often arisen at 4 o'clock to go to Now York and return to breakfast and his plow at seveo. Of late years he had made it a practice to leave hia bed at seven o'clonok not much later, and throughout bis increas ing ill health of the last two winters fie bad adhered to this practice. After arising to-day he had held his usual morning conference with bis sons Cornelius aud William X , who were the active managers of his railroad prop erty and afterward with Mr. E. V. Roa sitter, his private Secretary and Treas urer of the New York Central Railroad, to whom be entrusted the best share of the management of bis private business affairs. These conferences were held in Mr. Vanderhilt's study, on the goucd floor of the mansion in the corner to tbe left of the main entrance from theavenne, his favorite room, where he wrote aud transacted all bis business. During the morning conference to-day he had been more than ordinarily active and alert; so much so as to excite com ment, to which he replied in a good humored, jocular vein, that he had eaten a good breakfast and was looking for ward with pleasant anticipations to a tide up the boulevard with his son-in law, Hamilton McK. Twombley, in tbe afternoon. At 11 o'clock he sent to the Grand Central depot for his old-time friend, Chauncey M. Depew, Presi dent of the New York Central road, with a message that he wished to see him. Mr. Depew was engaged in conference at the depot, and sent word that he would not be able to come for an hour or two, and Vanderbilt delayed the ap pointment till 1 o'clock, and to occupy the inters .1 went down to the studio of J.Q.A. Ward, the sculgtor, in West Fifiy-sccond street, to ait for a bronze bust i f himself, which the trustees of the College of Physicians aud Surgeons wished to place in the vestibule of the college, for the erection of which he re cently gave $500,000. He returned aod took lunch at 12:30 with bis wife, his son George and Mr. Twombley. At the table he waa noticeably bright and eheerfnl. At 1 o'clock Robert Garrett. President of theßaltimoreandOhioßailway.called upon Mr. Depew at the Grand Central Depot. Finding him still detained there, he went up to Mr. \ underbill's house to iufonn the millionaire and take Mr. Depew'* place. Mr. Vander hilt greeted him cordially and engaged iv a long and animated conversation with him about railroad matters. The conference lasted more than an hour, and Mr. Vanderbilt sent word to Mr. Twombley that he would be com pelled to forego his intended drive. The two railroad magnates were discuss ing the new terminal facilities the Balti more and Ohio bad seenred by the w. s of Siaten Island, and Vanderbilt sbowi d a lively interest in the results that were to follow for the island of his birth from the new enterprise. The talk turned upon the scenes of his early childhood, and his early work contrasted with tbe tremendous achievements of his old age. Mr. Garrett was sitting oo the sofa and facing the inilliouare, who leaned for ward in his armchair, as was hia habit when be was thoroughly interested. The Presideut of the Balti more and Ohio was suddenly made a ware of a slight indistinctness in Mr. VauderbiU's speech that grew iuto an iuarticu'ate aonnd.' As he leaned over to catch his words, Mr. Vanderbilt pitched forward without warning and fell heavily on the floor on bis face. Mr. Garrett sprang to his feet aud seizing a pillow from tbe »ota laid it under his friends head. Theu he summoned Mra. Vanderbilt aod George, the younges' s° n - Messengers were sent in haste for physicians. One from tbe neighborhood responded first and was followed almost immediately by the family doctor, James \V. McLean. Such simple res oratives aa were at hand had been hurriedly applied but human aid was iv vain. Mr. Van derbilt never spoke or moved after he fell under the sudden stroke, aud died '"it WM 230 o'clock when Dr. McLean lent the stricken widow from the room where her hus band had sat planning and working iv the full pride of health and strength five minutes before. Dr. Me- Lean pronounced his death the result of a sudden stroke of piralysis due to the bnrsting of a large blood vessel at the base of the brain, of the kind that are absolutely fatal at the moment. He stated that Mr. Vanderhilt's death was ns painleaa as it was sudden. 'I he d -.'tor knew h'S patient most inti mately and promptly certified to the cause of his death, to avoid the unnec essary formality of a Coroner's inquest and autopsy. As soon as it wss ascer tained beyond a doubt that Yajderbilt was dead the man servants were sum moned aud helped to carry the body of their dead master np stairs to tbe bed room be had occupied in life. Yanderhilt was thought to be richer than a y single member of the Rothschild family. The ! I>uke of Westminster is said to be worth 1 r2CW,000,000, but Mr. Vanderbilt ; was richer, because the Duke's money only pays him alvout two per cent.,' being mainly in lands and houses, Mr. Vanderbilt had a much larger in- D.
