NOTES OF A PERSONAL CHARACTER. T. D. R. kicked that poor fellow until he saw stars, and thought himself a flying machine. At any rate he flew. Sergeant M. looked for Diamond square, but every one knows it to be hard work to find a square diamond. C. E. L. lost a half" dollar, and only got a small piece of pie at that. A certain lieutenant, and not the newly elected one either, didn't want to go to sleep for a long time. His sins appeared in a very unfavorable light. George had a bad looking shirt, the corporal a bad looking nose. Selah. Will C. knew all about Meadville, but he found a jumping off place all the same. James R. has such a bad headache he couldn't sleep. Sergeant B. coulan't make a stack if he did carry the regimental colors. It was no twenty-five cent watch either.

"Dr. Bordwell's colts got considera bly excited on Monday last, and made a run through the back streets of our village that caused all the people on the line of the route to wonder and feel much alarmed at the doctor's prospect for getting off without broken bones. The doctor cut the blinds off tho harness, and the colts became frightened at seeing the buggy behind them and started off at a breakneck pace Doctor Bordwell held on tight enough to break off the dashboard of the buggy, and when James McFar land stopped the runaways he was sitting down in the bottom of the buggy. It is very fortunate that no further harm was done. TheCougresebmal Vote of the State The returns of the Congressional vote in the State, as computed by the county return judges, show the follow ing vote : Straight Republican, 274, 078; Republican-Greenback combina tion in three districts, 39,210; straight Democratic, 204,862 ; Democratic Greenback combination in one district, 11,817; straight Greenback, 99,631; Independent Democratic, Columbia district, 3,345 ; Prohibition and scatter ing, 2,376. Total vote, 696,828. In the three districts in which the Republi cans and Greenbackers combined the latter only furnished about 4,000 votes, so that the real Republican vote for Congressmen is about 800,000. Hen drick B. Wright drew nearly hulf his vote, 11,733, in Luzerne county, from the Democrats, and the vote east for Brockway in the Columbia district was almost entirely Democrat. Giving the Democrats credit for these votes, their total vote is about 275,000. The Greenback Vote, with the 3,000 cast for Yocum in the Centre district, 1,000 in the two Philadelphia districts, in which there were combination tickets, and 6,000 for Wright, is 109,000. The decreased vote for Congressmen in comparison with the Governor's vote, 702,000, is mainly attributable to bad nominations by the Democrats In sev eral districts. This also contributed largely to the increased Greenback vote for Congressmen over that of Gover nor.

The following from the Harrisburg Patriot is very valuable, if true, and will be hailed with joy by all who are. afflicted with lockjaw: "Every little while we read of some one who has stuck a rusty nail in his foot or some other part of his person, and lockjaw has resulted therefrom. All such wouuds can be healed without any fatal consequences resulting therefrom. The remedy is simple. It is only to smoke such wound or bruise, that is inflamed with burning wool or woolen cloth. Twenty minutes in thfe smoke of wool will take the pain out of tho worst caseof inflammation arising from any wound ever saw." On Monday, T. N.

He was standing over the saw, when a boy employed in the mill pulled the bell cord and the engineer started the saw. He escaped, however, with a severe cut on one of his hands. It Was indeed a narrow escape. Cantcron Press. The above Is correct except that there was no "engineer" in the mill at the time and no boy to pull the "bell cord;'' there was no fire under theengineand nosteani in the boiler, and It would have taken a four mule team to start the saw. T.N. Hacket got his hand siightly scratched, but that was caused by his carelessness in striking it against a saw-tooth while engaged in filing the saw. And ths was his nar row escape."

One of the physicians of Tioga was called bn a case of child birth, and upon reaching the house) found the mother, a small, frail wo man, in great agony. Professional measures progressed until the birth of the child, which was a plump, nine pounder, but bereft of life. Here it was that the most wonderful case of rescuscitation we ever heard of took place. Leaving the mother In charge of two or three ladies of experience in such matters, the physician turned his attention toward saving the child After removing from its mouth all mucous substances, he immersed it alternately in hot and cold water. He then placed it in the oven, but not finding that locality warm enough to produce the desired result, the coals in the stove were raked over and the child held over them, Still discovering no signs of returning life, he inflated its lungs by the usual means of artificial respiration. .Evidences or lite were then noticed, the infant giving an oc casional gasp.
