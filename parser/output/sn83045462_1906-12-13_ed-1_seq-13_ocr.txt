DENUNCIATION IS VERY BITTER Claimed That the President is Using His Power in the Interest of LawDefying Organisations. President Roosevelt was directly charged In the Senate today with using his influence for the election of republican-Mormon candidates In the recent election In Idaho and Utah. The charge was made by Senator Dubois In the course of a speech In which he discussed the right of Reetl Smoot to a seat in the Senate. The address was of considerable length," the first portion being devoted to a review of the Mormon Church. 'Mr Dubois asserted the control of th? * church to be complete in the hierarchy, consisting; of the president and the twelve apostles, of which Mr. Smoot was one. Turning his attention to the campaign preceding the recent election, Mr. Dubois read me press aispaicnes 01 ik ioimt which stated the President had sent Secretary Taft into Idaho to speak In advocacy of law and order. At that time Mr. Dubois said lie had telegraphed the President that the only issue in Idaho was tho desire of the Mormon hierarchy to continue to dominate the politics of the state, and that the President had been mislead if he thought there was any other issue. The republican state platform, he said, was absolutely silent regarding law and order, and notwithstanding the democratic platform had denounced the murder of Gov. Steunenburg and demanded the conviction of the guilty party, none of the democratic speakers had discussed any subject save *v?a* nf Uiirmnnlsm hence there was no other issue in the Idaho campaign. Messages of Former Presidents. Mr. Dubois referred to the messages of Presidents Buchanan. Johnson. Grant, Hayes, Garfield. Arthur and Cleveland, indicating what he termed "the menace of Mormonism." and proceeded: "I call attention to these messages of the Presidents for two purposis: one to indicate the views of our former executives, the other to make the contrast between them Vin nr<iaont r?r?rM inint of thA Whitfl House. Mormonism la more insldlou.*. moro dangerous, and a greater menace to our government and civilization today than It wns at any particular period .when these mcssa**'* were addressed to Congress. Yet President Roosevelt does not deem the subject worthy of mention in a m>**8age filled with suggestions. A majority of a great committee of the Senate, after patient and exhaustive research, have reported that Reed Smoot Is not entitled to his seat a-s a senator. It was not a partisan report. It should not be a partisan subject. No President heretofore has made it a matter of partisan politics; President Roosevelt has. "When Governor Gooding of Idaho and oKolrmon of tht> r??nuhl[^fln pom mlttee were engaged in inciting law-breaking and law-defying Mormon* to additional lawlessness. :the President of the Unlt?*d 8tatea sent his Serretory of War tn Idaho to plead with the people to stand by Governor Gooding In order to maintain law and order to. Idaho { Feeling* of Non-Mormons. "The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah and of Idaho thtitfrth**'they ure-eiK'ltled to the support of law-abiding citizens everywhere in their efforts to maintain American citizenship in these Mormon states, and If they cannot receive that, they have the right to demand that the President of the United 8tates shall not tide the great power vested in him in the interest of those lawdefying and un-American organizations in their determination to rule the politics of this section of our country. "In Utah there is a republican-Mormon party, and a democratic-Mormon party. both equally controlled oy ine Mormon nir-rarchy. The American party in L'tah is composed of Gentiles, both republicans and democrats, who are battling there, under the very shadow of thLa tremendous ecclesiastical power, for American citizenship, fnr fhe seuaratlon of church and stile. and against the degradation of womanhiiTHi anil home. It is a noble, magnificent contest they are making. "They have abandoned all hope of political preferment.and suffer financially In their unequal struggle for American principle*. President Roosevelt throws the weight of his mighty influence against the Americana and for the republican-Mormons, in Utah led by President Smith and 8<*nator Smoot. He demands In Utah an indorsement of Smith and Smoot."
