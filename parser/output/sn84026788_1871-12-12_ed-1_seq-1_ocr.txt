It lias been tiMiiu Iho agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference nt Washington be tween thu Plenipotentiaries of Spain and the allied South American Republic, which Ims resulted in-an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a perumnent pence. The friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. Thj visit of the third 8on or the Kmperor is a proof that there is no desire on tho part of Ids Government to dimin ish the cordiality of those relations. The ho*, pitalde reception which has been given to the Grand Duke Is a proof th it on our side we share the wishes of that Government.*" Tiie inexcusable course of the Hussian Min uter at Washington, rendered it iiocess?iry to nsk his recall and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic representative. It was impossible, with self respect or with a just regard to the dignity of the country. to permit Air. Cutacazy to continiie to hold inter course with the Government after his personal abuse of Government officials, and during his persistent intercourse through various means with the relations between the United States ntid other puwers. In accordance with my wishes this Government has I cen relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catncnzv, and the management of the afl'airs of the Imperial Le gation has passed ii,to the hands of a gentle man entirely unobjectionable. \\ it It Japan we continue to maintain inti mate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado lias, since the close of the last session of Con It r? ss, selected citizens ofthe United States to M i te in offices of importance in several depart- j ments of Government. I have reason to think i that this selection is due to an appreciation of j the disintcic.-tedness of the policy which tho ! I nited States hi\ve pursued towards Japan.? 1 It is our desire to continue to maintain tho i disinterested and just policy with China as well 1 ns Japan. The correspondence transmitted j herewith shows that there is no disposition on j the part ol thin government to swerve from its ! established course. Prompted ly a desire to put ati end to tho j l.ul nroi,? 11 eat men i o! our shipwrecked sailors | en the^(Mf-an coast,.I instructed our Minister M IYkin to i ndcavor to conclude a convention with I'ona for securing thes.il. tv and humane Ireatiiient o|mu1i mariutis. .Admiral ilodgers was instructed to accompany him with a .suf ficient force to protect him 5n case of need.? ! small surveying party sent out on reaching j the coast was treacherously attacked at a dis advantage. Ample opportunity was given f'rexplanation and apology for the insult, but neither came, and a force was the landed.? A ftrr mi arduous inarch over a rugged anil difficult country, the forts from which the out rages lirid been committed were reduced by a gallant assault, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindi cated the honor of the Hag, the expedition re liirned. finding it impracticable, under tho circumstances, to conclude the desired conven- I tion. I respect fully refer to the correspondence I relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leavo } the subject for such action as Congress may i tv fit to take. 1 l.o Republic ft Mexico ha* riot vet repeal- j ed the very obi-cticiiahlc law establishing what i.? known as the l-)cc Zone on the fron- 1 tier of the Unit.d States. it is hoped that this may yet be done, and | also that more stringent measure^ may lie tak- I en by that It'epubliu for restraining lawless I persons on ils frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will snoii relie.vc this Gov ernmetit of tlnS difficulties experienced from these causes. Onr relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue, with one exception, to lie cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Congress re garding the overdue installments under the award of the Venezuela Claims Commissions of ISM. -The internal distention* of this (Juv enilia lit present no justilicaiioii lor the ab sence o| these efforts tu meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a subject lor congratulation that tho great Umpire of Hrax.il has taken the initiato ry step toward the abolition of slavery. ^ Our relations with that Umpire, alwnva cor dial, will naturally be made more so by this 1 act. It is not too much to hopa that the Go- { vernmentof llrazil may hcrealter find it for j its interests, as well as intrinsically right, to j advance toward entire emancipation moro rapidly than the present act contemplates. j _ The true prosperity and greatness of a nn- I tion is to 1h) found in the elevation and cdu- j ciition of its laborers. It is a subject for re gret that the refotmx in this direction, which wire voluntarily promised by thu statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out in its West India Colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of shtveiy in Cuba and Porto Hico, leave most ofthe laborers in bondage, with no liepo of rel'-axo until their lives become a bur den to their employers I desire to direct votir attention to the fact that citizens of the United States, or persons claiming to be citiz-ns of the United Slates, ate largi holders in foreign landsof this species of property, forbidden by tho fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress fn provido by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against tho holding, owning or dealing in slaves,or king interested in slave property in foreign lands, cither as owners, hirers or mortgagees, ty citizens of the United States. It is to be regretted that tho disturbed con dition ofthe Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex istence of a protracted struggle in such closo proximity to our own territory, without appar ent prospect of an early termination, cannot bo other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference iu the affairs of other Towers, naturally desire to see every countiy in theundisinrbedenjoymentof peace, i liberty and the blessings of free institutions.? ' Onr naval c< inmander.s in Cuban waters have been instructed, in c?.?o it shotild become ne cessary, to spare no effort to protect tho lives and property of bona fido American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of (lie flag. It is* hoped that all pending questions with Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may bo ad justed in tho spirit of peace and conciliation, which has hitherto guided tho two Towers in their treatment of such questions. To give importance and to add to tho effi ciency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining tho good opinion of those peoples and to secure to the United states its shaie of tho commerce destined to flow between those nations and tho balance of the commercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of those countries to servo as part of tho offi cial family of onr Ministers there. Our repre sentatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with tho representatives of Great Uriuin and somoother Powers, As now situated our representatives in Ja ! pan ami China havo to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of thoso countries ! who know onr languajio imperfectly, or pro l euro for tho occasion the services of employees I in foreign business houses or tho interpreters to other foreign ministers. I would also re ! commend liberal measures for the purj>o*o of | tupportiug tho American lines of steamers now j plying between San Krancisco and Japan and China, aud tbc Australian lin?, almost our only remaining linen of ocean steamers, uuil of in creasing their service. , The Xiiii.iii.il debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,120.80 during the .year, and . by the negotiation of National bonds at a low- ' er rato of interest, the interest uti tho public debt has been so far diminished that now the , Eiiin to be raised fur the interest account is | nearly ?17,000,000 leu than on the first of ; March, 18G'.?. j It wits highly desirable that this rapid di- j miuution should take |>h.cc, both to .strengthen ' the credit uf the country and to convince its | citizens uf t!i?.ir entire ability t.) meet every j dollar of liability without bankrupting them, , Dot in view of the accomplishment of theso i desirable ends, of tho rapid developments of | the resources of the country, if- increasing ahil- | iiy to meet la rue demands, and tlie ninount j nlieady paid, if is not desirable that the pres ent resources of tiie country should continue to J be taxed iu order to continue this rapid pay- ? ment. _ j I. therefor? recommend a modification of J both the tariff and internal tax laws. ' I re- i commend that all taxes from internal revenue ! sources be abolished, except those collected j from spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, t?- ; bacco in its various forms. ami from stamps. In readjusting the tarilf I suggest a careful j estimate uf tint amount ?>f surplus revenue c 1 lev ted under the present laws, after provi- | ding for the current expenses ?>f the Govern ment, tho interest account ami a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a man ner as to afford tlie greatest relief to the great est number. There are many articles not produced at i home, but which cither enter largely into gene- j ral consumption through articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicines, com pounds, ui\. &e? from which very little reve nue ia received, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to bo placed oh the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable I would then mi mmend that it be made upon those articles which can lust Itear it without disturiiing home production, (>r reducing the wages of Ameti-ati labor. I have not enter ed into liii'urcs, because to d.? so would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the re p il of the .Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws for collecting the revenue pay collectors of customs small salaries, but provide for moieties' shares in all seizures, which, at the principal ports of entry particu larly. raise the compensation of those officials to it large sum. It has always seemed to mo that this system must nt times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession of thoso offices, to be lax iu their scrutiny of goods entered to enable them dually to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject. Continued fluctuations in tlie value of -?,!?! as compared with the National currency his a most damaging effect it pan the increase and development of the country i? keeping up prices of all articles necessary iu every day lif.\ It fosters n spirit of gambling prejudicial alike to National morals and tint National fi nances. If the question can bo met as to how 1 t" give a fixed value to our currency, I bill value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable ohjvct will be gained. For the operations of tho army iu the past year, the expense of maintaining it, tho esti [ mates for the ensuing year, ami for continuing sea counts and other improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department, | I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War. i I call your attention to the provision of tho act of Congress, approved March Jl, lSlifl, which discontinuespronu'tioimin the staff corps of thij army, until provided for hy law. I ic commend that the numlHir of oflicers in each grade in the staff corps be fixed, and that, whenever the number iu any one grade falls below the number so fixed, that tho vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade be low. I also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by selection from the corps iu which the vacancy existed. Tho repott oi the Seuretiry of the Navy shows an i to prove men t iu the number and efficiency of tho naval force, without material increase in the espouse of supporting it. This is duo t'i tho policy which has been adopted umi is being extended as last as our marine will admit of using smalier t essoin as cruisers tin tho several stations, Hy this means wo have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent ol'cruising grounds, to visit more frequently the posts where the presence ol our flag is desirable, and generally to dis charge more efficiently thcnppn priate duties of the navy iu time of peace, without exceed ing the number of tuen or expenditure au thorized by law. During the past year the Navy has, in addi tion t > its tegular service, supplied the men and officers- ir tho vessols of the coast survey, and has completed the surveys authorized by Congress of the Isthmus of JJarien undTchu antepqe, ami under like authority has sent out an expedition completely furnished and equipped to explore tho uukuowu Oocau of tho North. Tho suggestion of report as to the necessity of increasing and improving tho material of the navy, nod the plan recommended for re ducinir tlie personnel of tho service to a peaeo btHttdurd by tho gradual abolition of cettiin grades of officers, tho reduction of < thero, and the employment of some in the service of tho commercial marine aro well considered, and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promt tions in the I navy, above the rank of captain, be by seleo , tion, instead of by seniority. This course I will secure in tho higher grades greater effi ciency and hold out nn incoctivo to young officers to improve themselves in tho knowl edge of their profession, Tho present cost of maintaining tho Navy, its cost compared with that ol tho precoding year, and estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in tho accompanying report of tho Secretary of the Navy. Tho enlarged receipts of tho Po'toflice De partment, as shown by the accompanying re port of tho Postmaster General, exhibits a gratifying increase in'that branch of the pub lie service. It is the index of tho urowth of education and of tho prosperity of tho people, two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring tho ser vice* of the mail, it i* not at present expected that this Department can bo made solf-BUs t?iningi but a gradual npproach to thin end from year to year is confidently relied on. and ; the day is not far distiut when the Postoffico Department uf tho (iovernmcnt will provo a 1 tuueh greater blessing to tho whole people than it is now. The suggestions of tho Postmaster General for improvements in tho Department pre sided ovorby him, are earnestly recommended to jour special attention, and especially do I recommend a favorablo consideration of tho ' pUn for uoiting tho telegraph system of the United Slates win* the poalul aysleiu it is bulicvcd that by "?cl1 a courac 1110 cot'"''l0'c* graphing could lie much reduced, aud tho service us well, il not bolter, reudercd. It Wnuid secure the further udvautigo uf extend ing tho (olograph through porticos or tlio couotry where private enterprise will not con struct it. Commerce, trade, and above all, the clforts to bring a people widely separated into a community of iutere-t, are always benetitted by a rapid intercommunication. Kducatiou, the ground work ol Republican institutions, is encouraged by the increasing of the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of the country, and the desire to reap the hcueiits of such improvements will siimu. i late education.

Under the ; provisions of the above act, 1 issued a procla ; uiatiou calling the mtentiou of the people ol ; the United States to the same, and declaring J my reluctance to exercise any ol' tho extra* j ordinary powers thereby conlerrcd upon me, , except in c-ves of imperative necessity, but making km.wn my purpose to exercise such power whenever tt should become necessary t. do so for the purpose of securing to all , cit zens of the United States the peaceful en- j joymcnt of the rights guaranteed to t.ieui by tho Constitution end the liws. I Alter the passage of this law informnt ?m , was received Irotu time to time, that combi- j nations of tho character referred to in tins , law existed aud were powerful ir. many parts ol the Southern Stitos, particularly in certain counties of the State of South Carolina. Care fnl investigation was made, and it was ascer mined that in nine counties ol that Mile , such combinations were active and powerful, j cuibraciug a sufficient portion ol the cit zens to coi.trol the local authority, and having j among their objects that ol depriving the , emancipated class ?f the substantial bcuelus ] ol freed-m, and ?f preventing the free point I cal niturn of those c tzens who did not sytu- , pathizi with the.r own views. Anions iheir j up,.rations were fre.juent scour/uig and oeen- , si'mnl assaiits generally perpetrated at night j by disguised persons. the\it-tim-, in almost . all case-, being citizens of dillerent political sentiment* from their own. or freed pern-ms , who had thown a disposition to elaitn equal ritflit* with other c t zens. Thousands ol in i t.lT-n>ivo and well di-p-scd einz-ns were the sutlurers by thin luwle.?s vi.ilenee. Thereupon, on the l'Jt'i of October, IS" I, . n proclamation was issued in terms ol law call- ^ in-_' upon members of those combinations to : disperse within live days', ami to deliver to the Marshal or military officers of the United I States all arms ninmun tion<, uniforms, din- j pui-os and other nn-ans and implements used by them lor carrying out their unlawful pur- , poses. This warninu' m-t hiivmu been heeded, ! on tho 17th of Uo'ober arn.ther proclamation , wa' issued, suspending tho privilege of the writ of haboiH corpus in nine enmities in that ; Stale. Direction was given that within the i Bounties so designated persons supposed upon ' audible information t' be im-mhers of such unlawful combinations should bo arrested by ilio military forces ol the United Siht*? and delivered to 'lie Marshal, lo be dealt with ac j eordinti to law. In two nl cai 1 counties. York and Spartan- , burg, many arrests have been made. At the ( lust nccouit tho number of persons thus ar rested wasoue hundred and sixty eight. Scv- j eral hundred, whose criminally was ascer tained to be of an inferior degree, were re leased for the present. Those have generally inado confession or their miilt. Great caution has been exercised ( in making these nrre.f, and imiwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no inno- j cent persons are now in cn-t >dy. j The prisoners will be held for regular trial j in the judicial tribunals of the United States. ; Ah smihi as it appeared that the authorities ol ; tho I'nited'States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law many persons ab j Hconded, ami ihere is good ground for sup* j posing that all of such persons have violated . i ho law. , j A full report of what has been done umJer this law will be submitted to Congress by llie Attorney General. I In Utah there still remains a remnant ot ; barbarism, repugnant to civilization, to dc- j ceticy and to the laws ol tho United ? tales. ; Territorial officers, however, have been found , who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity and with a duo scuso ol sus- | taining tho majesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other violation ol existing stiniics will ho permitted withiu the territory of the United Mites. It is not willl tho religion of tho fclwtylcu slims that wo are uuiv dealing, but with their ' "ll'cy will be protected in tlio worship of God according to diotat'S of their own run neienees, but tliey will not bo pertiiuiltlcd to violate llie laws under tho cloak ot religion. ! It may be advisable for Congress to consider | what, in tlio execution of tlio laws against ; polygamy, is to bo the status of plural wives | and their ollspring. 'the propriety of Congress passing an cna bling act authorizing the territorial Ucglsla- j lure of I t.h to legilauiize ull cliildren born | prior to a time fixed in the ac', might he jus iified by its humanity to these innocent chll drcn. This is a suggestion, only, and not a recom mendation. . . Tho policy pursued twrds tho Indians j has resulted favorably, so far as can bo judged j from tho limited time during which it has j been in operation. Through tho exertions of tho various fco- I cierics of Christians to whom was entrusted tho execution of the policy, and lite Hoard ol Commissioners authorized by the law of April 10, 1800, many tribes of Indians have been induced to solile upon reservations, to culti* vote il.e soil, to perf-rm productive labor of various kinds, and fcj paitially accept civtlixa They oro being cared for in suoh a way, it i* hoped, as t) induce those Hill pursuing their old habits of lifo to nmbraco tho only opportunity which is loft them to avoid ex termination. , 1 recommend liber.nl appropriations to carry | llie Indian peace policy, not only bcoaoso it ' i> liumsn, Chriiti>n-lik? ?ud economics!, but because it i? right. i recommend to your Ik* vorable consideration, also, tho policy of grjntiug a territorial government to the In* dians iu the Indian territory Weft of Arkau* bis aud Missouri and South of Kansas. In doing so every right guaranteed tj the In* dians by treaty should be sccurcd. Such a course might iu time be the means of collect ing must of the Indians now between the Missouri and tho Pacific, and south of tho ! liritish possessions, into ouc Territory or ono State The Secrctiry of the Iutcrior has treated upon this subject at length, aud I couimcud to you his suggestions. I renew my recommendation that the pub lic lands to he regarded as a heritige t.? our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been, in great pai t, disposcd of in such a way as t ? seaure acoess to ihe balance by tho hardy stt'ler who may wish to a vail himself of them. Hut caution should be exorcised cveu in attaining so de- i citable an object Educational interest may well be served by j the grant of the proceeds of tho tale of the i public binds to the setters. I do uot wish to be understood as recommending in tho least degrcu a curtailment of what is being done by the General Goverumeut lor the encourage uu'nt of education. Tho report of the Secretary of tho Interior, subm fed with this, will give you all tho in formation collected and prepared for publica* tion in regard to the census tikcn during the year 1S70, the operations of the Bureau of Kducvtion for tlie year, the Patent Office, the Pension OHicc, the Land Office, and tho In dian Bureau. The report ??l tho Commis sioner of Agriculture gives the operations of his Department for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of out prosperity, too much impoitunee cannot he ritticlicd ti the labors of this Department It is iu the hands of nti able head, with able assistants, all zeal ously devoted to introducing into the agricul tural productions of the nation all useful pro duets adajted t i any of the various c!i mates and muIs of our vast territory, aud to giving aii u.-elul information as to the method of cultivation of the plants, cereals ami other products adapted to particular localities.? Quietly, but surely.tho Agricultural J'urcuu is working a great national good. and. if liberally supported, the more widely its influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon the products of foreign countries. The subject of compensation 11 the heads of Itua'aus and officials holding positions of re?p hi* bilityamf requiring ability and charac ter 11 lid properly, i* one to which your attcn tion is invited. But few of tlio officials re ceive a compensation equal to the reasonable support of a family, while their duties are such h* t?involve millions of interest. In private life services demand compensa tion equal to the service rendered. A wise economy would diitito tho same rulo in the Government service. 1 have not given tho estimate? for thesup port of the Government for the ensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for the year ju t passed, and the mm just preceding, beenu-e all these figures aro contained in t'ie accompanying reports, or in tho*o present")! directly to Congress.? Tin so e.'timatcs have my approval. More than six year* having elapsed since tho Ia.*t hostile gun was fired between the armies then arrayed again-t eneh ither, one for the pcrpetii'.tion, the other lor the de struction of the Union, it may woll he con sidered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment should bo removed. That amendment dees nit excludo the ballot, but only impose* the disability t? hold office upon certain classes. When the purity of the halh't is secure, majorities are Mtre to clect officers reflecting tho views of the tua* jority. ! do not sec tho advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were, before the rebellion, of standing and character .'tiflicietit ti be elected t? posi tions requiring them t ? take oaths to support the OoiiMilutton, and ndmiititig to eligibility those enteiLiitiiog precisely the same views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said that the former violated an oath, w'hile the Infer did not The latter did not havo it iu their power to do so. If they had tiken this o?th. it cannot be doubted they would havo broken it a* did tho former class. If there are any groat criminals distinguished above all others for tho part they took iu op position to the Government, they might, iu the judgment of Cougrcss, bo excluded from such amnesty. This subject is submittod for your careful consideration. The condition of tho Southern States is, unhappily, uot such us all truo patriotic citizens would like to see. Social ottracisui lor Mpiou's Nike, personal violence or threats, towatds persons entertlining political views opposed to those cnteita'ned by tho majority of tho old citizens prevents emigration nud the flow of much needed capitil into the States lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condition of tho country when the old citi izens ot theso States will take an iuterert in public ti {Fairs, piomulguto ideas honesily entcitiined both for men representing their views, and t derate the same freedom of ex pression and ballot to those cntottiiuing dif- I ferent political convictions. Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February-1,1871, a territorial gov ernment was organized iu tho District of Columbia; its results havo thus far fully realized tho expectations of its advocates.? Under the direction of tho territorial officers a system of improvements has boon iuaugura* ted, by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the nation's capital. The citzeus ol the District having iuvniinti* rily tuxed themselves to a large amount for the purposo of contributing to tho adornment of tho seat of Government, I recommend liberal appropriations on tho part of Congress, iu order tlint the Government may bear its just sbaro of tho expenso of carrying out a judicious system of improvements. lly tho grout lire in Chicago tho most itu poitunt of the Government buildings in that city worn consumed. Those burnod had al ready become irfudcqnafo to the wants of tho Government in that growing city, and looking to tho near f uture, wore t itally inodequate.? I recommend, therefore, that an appropriation bo ruado immediately to purolioso tho remain* dor of tho equaro on which tho burned bid dings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fair valuation, or .provided tho Legislature of Illinois will pip a law authorizing its poo* "
