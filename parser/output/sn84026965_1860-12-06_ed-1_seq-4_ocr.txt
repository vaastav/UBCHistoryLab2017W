Love in a Cottage. They may talk of love in a cottage, And bowers of trellised vine, Of nature bewitchingly simply, And milk maids half divine, They may talk.of the pleasure of sleeping In the shade of a spreading tree, And a walk in the fields at morning, By the side of a footstep free I But give me a sly'flirtalion By the Light of a chandalier, With music to play in the pauses, And nobody very near, Or a seat on a silken scia, With a glass of pure old wine. And m; mma too blind to discover The small white hand in mine. Your love in a cottage is hungry, Your vine is a nest for flies? Your milk maid shocks the graces, And simpUcity talks of pies! You lie down to shady slumber, And you wake with a bug in your car, Andyour damsel that walks in the morning _ Is shod like a mountaineer. True love is at home on the carpet, * And mightily likes his ease? ? True love has an eye for dinner, And'stories beneath shady trees, His wing is the fan of a lady, His foot's an invisible thing, And his arrow is tipped with a jewel, And shot from a silver siring. Gen., Cashing on Secession. \Yc find in the Boston papers the fol? lowing letter from the Hon. Caleb Gush? ing, of Massachusetts, in reply to an invi? tation to 'address tho citizens of Newbury port on " the state of the-country." The letter is well worth reading: Hon. Albert Currier?Dear Sir:?I had the honor, some time since, to receive a communication from yourself and a large number of other signers, requesting mo to address tho. citizens of Newburyport on the subject of the state of the Union. ? To do so at that time seemed to me in? convenient, first, because of my belief of the impossibility, ponding the Presidenti? al cajivass, of tho accommodation of tho points of controversy between those, who, while thus differing on temporary ,incidcnt al,' or personal questions, were yet, in my judgment, alike tho true friends of the Constitution; and, secondly, because of special reluctance to put myself in the pos? ition of partisan conflict with any of my immediate fellow-citizens of this city. But all those questions have passed away, a*nd yielded place to others of a higher order and moro comprehensive character, appertaining to the now im? minent peril of the dissolution of the Amer? ican Union. To tho imminence of that peril, it is no longer permitted to us to continue, as for years we have done, wilfully to shut our eyes. It forces itself upon us in report of official acts; it has become the chief topic of tho newspapers; it pre-occupies all minds; we feel it, throughout the coun? try, in tho decline of the vendible value of stocks, merchandise and real estate, and in the universal disturbance of domestic productions, trade and labor. God forbid that, at such a moment, any thing should be done or said by me to add to tho intensity of solicitude, which al? ready exists in this relation. On the other hand, there is but one thing to allay it, which can be done or said by or in the State of Massachusetts. It avails nothing for us, in Massachu? setts^ discuss tho question of the expedi? ency or inexpediency of Secession, and to endeavor to impress on the Southern States the sacrcdness of the Union. So long as the State of Massachusetts maintains a system of legation plainly contrary to tho Con? stitution in tho veiy matter of the-special rights of the Southern States, all cars are closed to appeals in behalf of tho Union from us. To such appeals tho answer is ready-, that when we duly regard tho Con? stitution ourselves, and not until then, it will be competent to us to exhort others States' to respect and observe it; that, otherwise, wo are but meanly enjoying tho benefits of the compact without, dis? charging its obligations; and that our lau? dation of the Union is alike odious and ridiculous, whilst we cling to it only as the means of oxcrting the power of the Federal Government to tho spoilation, oppression, and wrong of fifteen States of the Union. How deeply soever, there? fore, any citizen of the State of Massachu? setts may deploro the possibility of the dissolution of the Union, she is utterly powerless to dissuade any other State from seeking or promoting its dissolu? tion. Tho nullification laws of Massachusetts wcro not only most deliberately enacted in the first instance, but tho question of their repeal has been earnestly moved in tho Legislature of the State, first by Mr. Charles Hale, and afterward by myself; and although some provisions of mere ex? acerbation in those laws have been re? pealed on the recommendation of Gov. Banks, yet the vicious substance still ex? ists, and has but just been carefully re-en? acted in the general revision of tho stat? utes. Vainly, therefore, would tho State of Massachusetts admonish the State of South Carolina to observe the Constitu? tion or uphold the Union. If wo would have equity, we must do equity, and go in? to court with clean hands. Lectures on loyalty to tho Federal Constitution como with poor grace from obstinate and syste? matic violators of the Constitution. There k is but one thing more odious and absurd than that, and it is tho idea of Masssachu setts, herself in a state of permanent re? bellion to the Constitution and laws of the Union, assuming to coerce other States into punctilious obedience to the Constitution and the laws of tho Union. Nay, if there be any article or articles of the Constitution, which, with her particu? lar notions of right or wrong, the State of Massachusetts cannot or will not fulfill and obey, then every consideration of honor, truth, faith, conscience, virtue, re ligion, would impel her cither to secede at once from the Union herself, or to co-op erato with Virginia in the call of a Con? stitutional Convention to revise the terms of the federal compact, or at least manful? ly to extond to South Carolina tho right hand of cordial nullification and secession fellowship. Our forefathers, when the}- found tho government of their country not to be up to the height of their standard of liber? ty or morality, strove in the first place to change the government, and, failing :'in that, they withdrew themselves from it. J& such course there was dignity and spirit both?there is none in keeping the good of the Union and refusing its price: asserting the bond of the Constitution where it is favorable to Massachusetts, and repudiating it where it is favorable to South Carolina. Conduct of the hitcor sort, in ordinary life, has ugly names?as cheatingjSwindling, fraud?and it deserves no softer appellation in the acts of a State or a people. Futhermore, so long as the State of Massachusetts perseveres in this nullifica? tion of the Constitution, she affords, not a pretext onry, but a justificatory cause to the State of South Carolina, to that of Georl gia, Alabama, Mississippi, or any other State, otherwise disposed to secede; for the violation of the fundamental compact of association by one of the contracting parties, serves, in morality as well as law, to release the others; and the unconstitu? tional and dishonorable attitude of the State in this matter is not less mischeiv ous in another respect, to wit: its obvious tendency to paralyze the conservative ef? forts of other Southern States, not yet prepared to secede, such as Mailand, Vir? ginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Ten? nessee. I think there is a duty in this behalf, which it is incumbent on Massachusetts, and every loyal citizen of the State to per? form; one, which it is never too early to enter upon, and never too late to persist in; and which it is peculiarly fitting for us to undertake now?namely, to repeal unconditionally these laws?which are scandalously false in their profession of purpose?which are tyrannical in then-do? mestic and treasonable in their Federal relation?and which misrepresent the spir? it and disgrace the legislation of our Com? monwealth. As this is the duty of all, it is the duty of every one; and, therefore, it will give me pleasure to speak on the subject; to expose the gravity of the situation; to de? monstrate our obligation regarding it,and to participate with you in the initiation of measures, for the wiping out of this foul blot from this escutcheon of the State of Massachusetts. Having done that, we shall then have tho right, happen what may, to stand erect, to hold up our head in the Union,to look our sister States in the face,.and if need be, to address fraternal exhortation to the State of South Carolina. I am, very faithfully, C. GUS III XG. Newburyport, November 19, 1860. -o The " Overt Act."?A writer in the Eichmond (Va.) Examiner, arguing to prove that the election of Lincoln is sulli cient to justify a dissolution of the Union, or even to make such a step necessary, thus refers to the proposition to wait for an overt act: "But setting this aside, thus much is plain, that any overt act of the Federal Government would be less a warrant for the resistance on the part of the South than is the menacing action of the North? ern States in electing Mr. Lincoln. And plainly it might be urged that then we should wait for a change of administra? tion. But as the matter stands, what hope can wo wait for ? Absolutely none. Wo havo both the Federal Government "against us and the whole united body of the Northern States. We have this as matters now stand. But day by day the Federal Government will strengthen that party to which it owes its success; and that party reciprocally will strengthen tho Government. Meantime the South will become weaker and weaker. "We must profit by the experience of others where we havo none of our own. Franco, not long since, was a Eepublic. The President was suspected of trasona ble designs. The opposition leaders wait? ed for some overt act. And we know the result. We should see, in our case at least, the most humiliating spec tacle on earth?all the Southern States subdued by pure passive inaction, just as we have seen the Monarch of Naples vanish with? out any definite or palpable attack." -?-,. In Germany, when two persons wish to marry, they must each produce no less than fourteen certificates of various qual? ifications, before they can obtain a li? cense. I???M??? -_ The Only Remedy. So far as South Carolina in concerned, the unanimous voice of .her people has disposed of the question of secession. She will unquestionably withdraw from the Union as early as practicable after the meeting of the Convention. The next question is, will the exercise of this indispensable right of sovereignty involve her in war? Will the Federal Government attempt to force her to l'e main in this present Union ? We are dis? posed to think not. although we have in? timations to the effect that President Buchanan i.s opposed to secession. Such action on his part would be a denial of the highest principle of the State Rights party, and would stamp him as a federal? ist and consolidationist. If a State has not the right to resume her sovereignty, she has no rights at all in this present Union, and is no more or less than a col? ony under the government at Washing? ton. No man at this day, who ever main? tained the first principle of State sovere? ignty or State Rights, could consistently take such a position. South Carolina,through her former Con? vention, eight years ago, asserted this right; and, the time having arrived for her to exercise it, we do not believe she will be opposed by the Federal Govern? ment; if she should be, however,-the strug? gle would be a short one, for. tho attempt to use force would bring to her side every slaveholding State, and no doubt would then exist of the prompt formation of a Southern Confederacy, embracing the whole of them. Secession, therefore, wc believe to be a peaceful remedy, and the only remedy for the evils we suffer from our present political connection. In some quarters of the South, and by some inofficial positions, it has been pro? posed to have a convention of all the Southern States. What benefit would re? sult from such a meeting before the sep? arate action of the States we cannot see. The delegates to such a Convention would not be clothed with authority to take the South, as a section, out of the Union. Even if they should be unanimous as to the course the Southern States should pur? sue, they wotdd have to return to their constituencies, submit the proposed meas? ures to the people for ratification, and at last each State for herself would have to act in her sovereign capacity. By such a course time would be lust, divisions among the people on points of expediency might spring up, leading to parties : compromis? es and hollow proposals of amity and friendship would pour in upon the South, until resistance would be finally lost sight of through the machinations of Union-sav? ers and submission isfs. Separate State Action commends itself then as an effectual, prompt, and (in all probability) a peaceful remedy for evils al? ready, borne too long, and the surest in? strumentality in the great work of our po? litical deliverance and disenthral men t. [Columbia (inardiiin. -e Mkssaok of (Jov. Rector, of Arkan? sas.?We copy from the Little Rock True Democrat, the following extract from the Message of Governor Jtoctor: lt [ The issue made up by the North, and which woof the South will not be permit? ted to decline, is. the Union without slaveryj or slavery without the Union. Wiiat portion of the Confederacy will be so infatuated as not to prepare for the coming of this sad event? What magis? trate of the law will lull his people into fancied security, by promises of peace and safety, when an enemy is at their door? God forbid that I should bo an alarm? ist; that I should be insensible of the wide-spread desolation that would fix it? self, like a pall, upon the American peo? ple, should disruption ensue. But I am not. nor will I content myself with any? thing less than a faithful exposition ol my .views upon this subject. Eleven of the Northern States, by sol? emn legislative enactments, have nullified, revoked, and trampled upon the Federal Constitution. Maine, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin Massachutts, Michigan, and Vermont, have prohibited their officials and citizens from aiding in the execution of the li Fu? gitive Slave Law." By their action, the Federal compact has been broken?they have revolutionized the Government, and have left every other State absolved from its Federal allegiance, and free, as an in? dependent and sovereign government, to seek its own destiny. But the question is asked, whether or not these offences, coupled with the elec? tion of a chief executive avowedly hostile to an extension of slavery, is cause justi? fying, as a matter of policy, immediate se? cession ? To my mind, no farther local justifica? tion is necessary. Still, if the Union was severed to-day, leaving the slave States standing as the}r originally stood sover? eign and independent governments, recon? ciliation and compromise might, neverthe? less, be induced by moderation, and a free interchange of sentiment evolved by au? thority through conventions assembled by the Northern and Southern portions of the Union respectively. In view, then, of the bare possibility that the North may still be induced to re? trace her steps, and award to the South? ern States tho rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution, I cannot counsel pre? cipitate or hasty action, having for its ob ject a final Separation of the States, and breaking up of the Union. Should any one of the Southern States, however, prompted by a spirit of just re? sentment towards the North.deem it nec? essary to declare her independence, and assert a separate nationality, Arkansas, having like grievances, and a common purpose to subserve, ought not to with? hold her sympathies and active support, if coercive measures be adopted by the General Government. Undcrsuch an exigency. 1 should regard it as an imperative duty to convene the General Assembly, that the matter might be referred to the people for their prima? ry action and advice. How Jon n "Wkntwortii Proposes to Coerce.?The Chicago Democrat, the es? pecial orga atof Abe Lincoln, has thus ear? ly indicated the plan of coercing Virgin? ia: " In order to provide for all emergen? cies, and to have at hand the safest, and cheapest, and surest way of taking care of the Virginians, a messenger has been sent to North Elba, for the suit of clothes worn by .lohn Brown when he made his celebrated foray at Harper's Ferry.? Upon the first intelligence of any traitor? ous act in Virginia, this suit will be at once taken to the scene of disturbance and prominently displayed. That will be quite sufficient. The chivalry will at once retire to their holes, as the}* did be? fore, and us the Federal troops will not be allowed to go to their aid, the ghost of John Brown will he enough to keep them perfectly quiet." Washington, November "js.?The President takes the position, in bis Mes? sage, that while denying the constitution? al right of a State to secede ho will at? tempt no coercion, but that he will see, nevertheless, that the Federal Laws are exe? cuted.

GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF CONGRESS. IPUBLISH now my annual Prospectus of THE DAILY GLOBE, and the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, to remain subscribers, and inform those who may desire to subscribe, that Congress will meet on tiic first Monday of next December, when I shall resume publishing the above-named papers. They have been published so long, that most pub? lic men know their character,and therefore I deem it needless to give a minute account of the kind of matter they will contain. THE DAILY GLOBE will contain a report of the Debates in both branches of Congress as taken down by reporters, equeal, at least to any corps of short hand-writers in this, or in any other country. A majority of them will each, be able to report, verbatim, ten thousand words an hour, while the av? erage number of words spoken by fluent speakers rarely exceeds seven thousand five hundred words an hour. When the debutes of a day do not make more than forty-five columns, they will appear in The Daily Globe of the next morning, which will contain, also, the news of the day, together with ing events. THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE AND APPEN? DIX will contain a report of all the Debates in Con? gress, revised by the speakers, the Messages of the President of the United States, the Annual Reports of the Heads of the Executive Departments, the Laws rassed during the sessions, and copious in? dexes to all. They will be printed on a double royal sheet, in book form, royal quarto size, each number containing sixteen pages. The whole will make, it is believed, at least 2,001) pages. This is acknowledged to be the cheapest work ever sold in any country, whether a reprint or printed from manuscript copy, taking for Jala the average num? ber of words it contains. The coming session will, without doubt, be an unusually interesting one. becausethedebates will, in a great measure, be upon the policy of the Pres? ident elect, and The Globe will be, as it has been for many years past, the only source from which full debates of Congress can be obtained.
