SOME ASTOUNDING FEATURES Of tho Document Called Attention to by Members and Senators In Interview*?Tho Mossugo States tho In tornal Revenuo Features of tho Turin*Dill While tlio Majority of tho Coiiimittco Say They Havo Not Agreed Upon Them?1Tho Republican Member* Know Nothing of Them?An Unprecedented Ignoring ot Courtesy and Propriety?Gonoral Opinion That the Message Is Foohlo ond Ordinary?Opening of Congress. Washington, D. C., Dec. 4.?It ia not often that tho poblic awaits a President's messago with tho intenso interest which has been manifested in the document to-day sent to Congress. riho messago was listened to with close attention in both houses and tho views of members on tho document nre portinent and interesting just at this time. Ex-Speaker Kecd said: "I disliko to comment on tho message because it would not bo seemly to do it in adequate terras. It ia largely mado up of a wearisome resume of the reports of his secretaries which have hardly improved by condensation. On tho Hawaiian question we aro left as much in the dark &s ever, and must wait the nows of the next steamer juat as wo have been waiting so long. That part of tho meseuge which relates to tho tarill is moat surprising. It asseverates tiiat tho house committeo in charge of that subject has formulated plana and #!/??ion/l ,nothmis nf taxation which as a member of tho committeo I have not even hoard propoaed. It ia a ratbor unusual sensation to loam of the deeds of the committee, not in the committoe room, but from the President of tho United States. Has that committoe ceased ovon in form to be composed of both parties, and has it without even the formality of a word inopon committeo informed the President of its determination in such way that the Presidont can officially communicate it to the house? How loner has it boon part of our system that the committeo is not an independent branch, and abovo all the committee which controls tho purse, shall report to Congress through tho President? Is this tho result of tho rumored blending of tho appointive with the legislative power? "It is bad enough to liavo a tariff bill made up by a little cotorie?a 'political bill,' as Mr. Wilson calls it?but to have it communicated to tho President beforo it roaches evon the committer, still Jess the house, shows a determination to bo moved by no facts and modified by no arguments, which makes apparent tho absurdity of appointing Republicans on tho committee of ways and means at alL" sphincter's vikws. Mr. Springer, of Illinois, chairman of tho last committee on ways and means, and of tho banking and currency committeo of tho presont Congress, said: "'M -nfaran^a tn tho tnrirf tl?A (1109. sago is clear and forcible. In this tho incssago will receivo tho cordial commend fttiou of every Democrat in tho land and of many othora who realize that our present protective system is injurious to tho boat interests of the peoplo. "In roioronco to tho currency tho President very hopefully anticipates that a survey of the situation after public confidence is restored will lead to a permanently sound currency. ^ This view of tho subject excludes definitely and forover tho policy to alluring expedients of etato banks. It is evidontly opposed to tho ropeal of the ten per cent tax on tho circulation of stato banks. "In referenco to Hawaii tho President takoa tho only course which is consistent with international honor and comity." 

MERELY FORMAL. Mr. Dolliver, of Iowa: "The mosaage ia in most rospocts formal. In the inattorg of public interest that aro in dispute the mossago lacks any satisfying exi>re?sion. In respect to Hawaii, tho Preaidont conceals from Congress all information* that is important, and seems to know reallv less about tho situation than is known to tho general pul) ic. As to the silver question, the President lacks tho courago to stato his views, and commits tho whole subject to tho policy of delay. On tho quostion of i?suin>? bonds to maintnin our currency and to ineot tho deficit of insullicent revenues tho President's language is wanting in dotinitonoss, and makes no protensoofa leadership of email opinion. llo seems to have exhausted his power of leadership in tho mid-summer attack on tho interests of silvor. The Prosidont's viows on tho tariff aro well known, and his ardent support of tho proposed Wilsonbill surprises nobody." 

DRIKP AND POINTED OPINIONS. Chairman Wilson of tho ways and means committoo: "The President's moasatro is all right He is especially right on tho tariff." Mr. Tracy, of Now York: "I am satisfied with it. It is a eood message." Mr. Caldwelljof Ohio: "Tho President indicatos that every pensioner recoived his pension by fraud, and defends his action in suspending pensions without giving tho soldiers a hearing, by assort ing it is the French method. IIo atill th maintains his on-American policy ro- it Harding tho restoration of Qtioen Lill- wi iiokulani. His recommendations of an at incoino tax upon corporations will docrcaio tho wages of workiugmcn." sa Mr. Boutelle, of Mnino: "It is tho in first executive document irbich directly fo impugned and charged malfeasance in ti< ouico auu prauucuuy iruuauu uyuu u United States minister, against whom cc nothing was charged by tho administration up to tho timo his resignation w was accepted. The people of London A may bo aware of tho policy which tho de ruler of tho United States pursues and th his authority for making war, tearing of down and putting up governments, but D wo do not." C< 

HIDE BOUND THEORIES. ?' Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania: "The President says that 'after full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of tariff reform and have confided tho h work of tho accomplishment to tho hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it.' I infer that by tho latter ex- er proasion tho President means tho ma- . jority of tho ways and means commit- l'' tee; and by 'tarilJ reform,' tho proposed tli mongrel bill given to tho press a week j:l ago. It would aoom that the President j]( has not yet heard tho news from Massa* ! chusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio j flJ and Iowa. When ho refers to tho reduc- | fi tioii of tariff charges on tho necessaries u.' of life, I suppose ho baa a re/oronce to H,1 champagne and brandy. Tho fact that tho President re-asserts tho time-worn and so often, and, under tho operation ~ of the McKinley bill, bo emphatically j11 disproven assertion that a protective tariff increases tho cost of goods to tho ,v consumer, shows what a hide bound J1' theorist tho Presidont is, and how facts lr weigh nothing with a tariff reformer. On the whole ho must be a most devoted Pl admirer of tho Presidont who can find in the message any strengthening oi tho etJ Democratic position on tho tariff quea- f.0 lion." tb Senator Voorhees: "In tho main tho w message is a eound, strong document. ?c I have not oxaminod it carefully and cannot go into details. 1 think it will j.? be well recoived by the country." j1' Senator McPherson: "It is excellent 111 all tho way through. I was especially ar pleased with tho recommendations in n' regard to tho general finances and tho jj1 tariff and as to the principles involved 1,1 in tho tariff bill." Senator Murphy: "It is a good message." m A 

DKMOOHATIC CRITICISM. Senator Palmer: "Tho Presidont goes ^ more into uotau man usuai wuu mm. ^ Tho suggeationa aro gonerally in the ^ lino of Democratic thought. Tho para- r(, graph relating to Hawaii merely showed j0 tho President's intention to take tho jc question up again. 1 have no especial at obicction to what ho says regarding ^ pousions, but I havo an ulea that his ^ improssions aro wido of tiio mark concerning fraudulent pensions. I do not ol know how it la among tho colored ex- ^ soldiers of the south, but my informa- cfl tion leads 1110 to believe that in the ^ north not two por cent of the pensions Q( aro fraudulent" Senator Morrill: Tho President's en- ^ tire sontimont of a tariff bill not yet r? agreed upon in committee was very un- r( expected and remarkable." ai bonator Hoar: "It was a most remarkable message in sovoral respocts. jj It troats tho important questions affect- gc ing tho welfare of the country foobly ,n and briefly. Tho imputation of tho aj President concerning civil service roform to tho eflecf. that tho law was jD enactcd bocausoof fear of publicopinion t|. and not because of tho conviction of the jg legislators who enactcd it is without e| precedent This reflection comes with an ill-grace from a President who has dealt as tho existing President has dealt with the consular icrvice of tho United pi States without oven taking tho advice of the aecrotary of state, aud whose ap- p, pointinent of Van Alen has been such i an offense to tho country's aonse of decency. Tho message is further remarkable in stating the report of a com- r( mitteo of one of tho houses, namoly the ways and means committee of tho house, boforo the committee has detor- j"c onil hofnrn nnmfl ftf its " members have boon made aware that tho matters spoken of aro to bo pro- P posed in the committee. Such a course S1 10 a broach of the privileges of the house w and would not bo tolerated in other rf times by a President, evon by hia most 01 zoalous admirers. HVReaisisa. t;r Senator Mitchell, of Orosoii: "I was tl very much surpriaed to loarn from tho it President's rcforence to Hawaii that tho proposition is really entertained by tho administration of ro-enthroning tho g; queen. The Wilson bill, which tho 01 President endorsos, strikes a fatal blow at all tha industries of the Pacific t) coast." r( Senator Halo: "Tho tnessago is mado r( up of details. As to Hawaii, ho leavos C( that to the future. Wo expected him r( to favor tho Wilson bill, and the lie- _y publicans are opposed to it." (c Senator Lodge: "Tho most of tho message was taken up with porfectly t| harmless rautiuo business. Tlio clause .; about Hawaii appears to announce tho extraordinary doctrine that it is our duty to overturn a government wo liavo recognized ia ordor to recognize another al govonimont On this theory, wo ought c, instantly to restore Texas to -Mexico, and Franco, which gntorod into an alliance }> with us during tho revolution, ought n now to restore us, by force, it necessary, 6( to England." ti rjtausn yctrspapeiij favored. r< Senator Power: "I understand the " mossago was printed in London this jj morning. It must have been given out there yesterday, so our British neigh- ft bora should have more time to tell us a what to do about it" fc Senator Ilawiey: "Tho message lacks tl vigor, and ia a disappointment The g: President's talk about the tariff is commonplace in the extrome, and hit re- p marks concerning the work of the n ays 01 and means committee are not justified a by any information the country has. p There haa been no fall meeting of the si committee to consider somo of these al questions." tl Senator Dubois: "It is lacking in w force, strength and Amoricanism, and muat prove a great disappointment to si the country. Concerning his rccom- oi raondation about bonds and the international monetary commission, I can only say that it looks decidedly as if tho r< President thinks he can deal with the b financial affairs oi tho country better ii an Congress and tho people, llis moment of tho Hawaiian question ill bo generally and justly criticised id cnnnot bo defended." Senator Jones, of Nevada: "Tho raea- q go contains no suggestions or rocomendations which hold out any hope r silver while tho prosont administra3n is in powor." .. Senator L'latt: "It scarcely desorvea ]y irnment" A number of other senators, most of horn were Democrats, w?3re seen by If ssociatod Press representatives, but (dined to express their views. Among ieso were Sherman, of Ohio; Aid rich, Rhode Island; Hill, of New York; .r auiel, of Virginia; Mills, of Toxas; h oke, of Toxas; Jones, of Arkansas; jckre/1, oi Missouri; Smith, of Now jrsoy; Llarris, of Tennessee, and Walt- ^ ill, of Mississippi. ]
