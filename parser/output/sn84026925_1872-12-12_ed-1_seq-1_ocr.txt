MOSES. w Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: You have entered upon the sixth session of the General Assembly since the establishment of free government in the State of South Carolina. It should be with us a source of profound gratitude to Divine Providence that you meet under auspices that betoken brighter and better days for the whole people of the State, whose sworn representatives you are. The earth has rewarded the labors of our husbandmen with abundant fruits, while all the varied forms aud arts of industry are being prosecuted with hopeful energy amid apparently universal peace and order, under our happy system of government, which guarantees and maintains liberty, regulated by law. We have been mercifully exempt from the great and disastrous fires which, during the past year, have swept over so many portions of our common country, consigning to ashes | the garnered wealth of years, and reducing 1 the rich and the poor to the same level of in^ digent suffering. f Let us endeavor, fellow-citizens, to deserve these signal blessings by a faithful and con- j scientious discharge of all the important trusts reposed in us by the people. In entering upon the duties of the high office with which I have been vested by the generous favor of my fellow-citizens, ray deep sense of gratitude to them for the honor conferred by their free suffrages is associated with a patient conviction of the grave responsibilities which has been imposed upon me by their choice. I will endeavor to discharge ray whole duty to the whole people of the State. To this end I invokethe considerable judgment and active nnrinaratinn nf PVArv mpmher of the General VV"i'V W. J Assembly, whatever may be his party creed, and the open aid and assistance of every good citizen in the commonwealth of South Carolina. While I shall not forget that, as a candidate, I represented in my person the Union Republican party, whose beneficent principles ^ are expressed in the doctrine of equal rights and exact justice to all men, now incorporated in the fundamental law of the State and nation ; and while under any and all circumstances my duty of devotion and fidelity to my party shall be ever present to my mind, I trust that I may always remember that, as the Chief Magistrate of the State, I represent all the people of South Carolina, and that the lines which limit my zeal for their interests must, in honor, be coextensive with her boundaries. Standing here to-day, in the august presence of the assembled law-makers of the State, and of this large multitude, with the oath of office in all its solemn sanctity fresh upon my lips, I pledge my best efforts to insure that during my administration "the Commonwealth shall suffer no detriment." Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives, let us re-dedicate ourselves to the great work and duty of the hour. Let us f>rove to the world, by the enactment of just awsand their impartial administration, that the highest private liberty here is consonant with the greatest public good. Our people are happy in the possession of a bountiful soil and a genial climate. Here the varied products of temperate and tropic zones * grow side by side, while our streams are flashing in the sunlight of a perpetual spring. The imperial plant, whose fleecy fibres enter into j the raiment of civilized man throughout the globe, and whose production presses heavily upon the balance wheels of the commercial exchanges of the world, has here its native home and most luxuriant growth. Yet the face of the emigrant is turned away from our State, and capital, which sets labor in motion and creates the manufactures which contribute to the comfort and elevation of mau, shrinks back from us, as if the seals of pestilence were broken, and vials emptied out upon this beautiful land of ours. Hence, nearly three-fourths of our vast territorial area, embracing not less than thirty-six thousand square miles, lie fallow to-day. This disastrous result is largely due to the fell spirit of political intolerance, which has been manifested during the past five years, by the former governing class in South Carolina, who still, in great part, represent the educa- j ted intelligence and landed property of the | State. That intolerance, which was at first success-1 fully directed to destroy the financial credit of the State Government, both at home and abroad, also proscribed every native and adopted citizen who openly declared himself in accord with the political sentiments which were entertained bv the vast raaioritv of the people of the United States, who have, by the result of the recent national campaign, furnished a most memorable proof of their firm determination that only those who are known to reflect and maintain those political sentiments shall rule in this republic of ours. Individual proscription and habitual denunciation of the government, both State and Federal, were soon followed by armed organ- ( izations in various sections of the State, which,! led by bold, bad and designing men, overawed by their numbers and daring, the law-abiding majority, and scourged and slew many of their fellow-citizens because of their political opinions or party affiliation. The barbarous acts of a minority of the minor party in the State continued, with va- j rying intensity, for a long and dark period of more than three years. The government of the State having made ineffectual attempts to check them, both by earnest appeals to the reason and humanity of those who were regar^ ded as the political leaders and exponents of the desperate men engaged in them, and by its available constabulary force, finally appealed to the national authority for protection to American citizens from lawless violence within the limit3 of the State. That appeal, after long delay incident to procuring the necessary legislation by the Congress of the United States, was effectually responded to, through the Federal courts, sustained by the military arm of the government. As the result of that intervention, for which our most profound gratitude is due to the government of the United States, many hundreds of the persons engaged in those lawless undertakings, so abhorrent to our free institu tions and to the civilization of the age, have been arrested and imprisoned, under sentence, while many more charged with having been engaged in them have, through a sense of fear or guilt, fled beyond the borders of our State. Turning away from the recollection of those F scenes which were so utterly revolting to all true lovers of liberty, I am happy to announce that peace and good order now prevail everywhere within the State, which seem to be accompanied by a returning sense of justice, and by a broader spirit of toleration in the hitherto ruling classes, which furnish a better guar* antee for their continuance than the mere temporary presence of the sword or bayonet can ever give among a free people. The grand juries of several counties in the upper part of the State, which were the chief 1 scenes of the armed violence aimed at the vested rights of American citizens, have recently expressed a becoming contrition, and p apparently sincere regret and sorrow, that this violence should have been permitted to manifest itself, unchecked by the local authorities in their several counties, and solemn } Iy pledge those citizens who have heretofore been presumed to have given a quiescent ' sanction to these atrocities, that henceforth they will actively exert themselves to mainj tain law and order, and will protect, by force ! of arras if necessary, any citizen whose political rights and personal privileges may be assailed. As Governor of this State, and as the political ally and personal friend of many of those who have been stricken down by this armed violence, and whose memories I wear within my heart of hearts, I welcome this pledge to which I have referred, and earnestly trust that it will be speedily and constantly ratified by the conduct of those in whose behalf it has been given. The grand juries have accompanied these ?ratifvine assurances by the indictment of a large number of persons, chargeable with having been actors in these unholy and crim-! inal combinations. I have been informed by members of your respective houses, who ha.ve lived in the disturbed portions of South Carolina, that this happy change, in the sec-! tions referred to, is to some exteut due to the fearless action of the Judge of the Sixth Circuit. For this he deserves, and should receive, the thanks of our people. Let us indulge the not altogether unwarj ranted hope that the dawn of a brighter future has broken upon South Carolina, and that the passions which have so long vexed her people with internecine strife, and the hates which sprung from domestic war, have spent their last red ripples within her border. While the exhibition and indulgence of such passions and hates might sometimes enable a political party to win, by them the people of the State must always lose. I, therefore, appeal to the men of my own race, in South Carolina, in the common interest of her whole people, to place themselves abreast with the advancing civilization of the age, and cultivate a nobler spirit of toleration, worthy of the ancient renown of the State. Garner up?if you choose?all that you may justly deem honorable in the mouldering traditions of our people, and walk with reverential tread near the graves of the brave and devoted men who, however mistaken they may have been, died willingly in defence of what they believed to be right. Jtsut aeai more justly and kindly with our dark foster-brothers of the State. They are your fellow-citizens, by the constitution and laws of our common country, and your destiny is bound up with theirs?for good or evil?in all coming time. Rise above that spirit of sectionalism which has so long been the dark stain on the escutcheon of our most distinguished Statesmen, and which marred the noble character and narrowed the intellectual range of the great Virginia senator, of whom Whittier, the great "Poet of Liberty," has said, with kindly severity: "Too honestor too proud to feign, A lovo he never cherished, Beyond Virginia's border line His patriotism perished, While others hailed in distant skies Our eagle's dusky pinion, He only saw our mountain's bird Stoop o'er the Old Dominion." Let the American citizen feel that wherever may have been the place of his birth, when he enters within our boundaries he will find with us a safe home and hospitable welcome. Thus will our brethren from the great States of the North be encouraged to dwell among us. The men whose skilled industry and exhaustless energies have builded mighty cities in the remote wilderness will level our forests and replace them with blooming harvest fields and cover the spots now marked by the sad ruins of disastrous war with the enduring monuments of their peaceful and civilizing arts. The magnificent and unfailing water power of our State, which is now running to waste, will then be rapidly utilized, to put in motion thousands of busy spindles and looms, in full view of the fields that are whitened by the plant that supplies the material for the fabric they weave. The hardy yeomanry of Europe?who seek abroad the liberty and prosperity denied them at home?will also be wooed to our shores, and will swell the volume of our industrial wealth. T 111 i , ii i. _r* I would also appeal 10 mose people oi me State, who were formerly the ruling class, to cultivate and cherish a loyal and devoted sentiment to the great Government of which we form a part, and to revere and worship the flag which it represents?a Government whose mighty arm is ready to be uplifted in your defense, at home and abroad, on land and on sea?a flag which you can no longer call the ensign of a power hostile to you. The illustrious soldier who is now the Chief Magistrate of our great Republic, and whose magnanira! ity in peace should make the brave men who opposed him feel that he deserved to triumph in war, desires to see all citizens of our State j dwell together in harmony?in obedience to ijust laws of their own enactment?and he' ! stands prepared to foster by generous encouragement a loyal sentiment of devotion to our country, wherever it may make itself manifest. To those of ray fellow-citizens with whom I am affiliated in political sentiment, and who | were pleased to designate me as the candidate of their choice, and to accord me their suffrages in the recent election, I desire to say I that in all matter of public policy, 60 far as any effort of mine may avail, I will regard the platform which was framed by the repre sentative body that placed me in nomination as an authoritative exposition of my official duty, which demands, and shall ever receive, my highest respect. I shall avail myself of the earliest opportunity to communicate with you as to the roi forms and amendments in our system of State, | which I think are contemplated by the spirit | and intention of this platform, by which I i hope we will be governed, j To those who deemed it proper to assail me j during the canvass with unparalleled ascerbi! ty, I would say, in kindly spirit, that the obloquy of their assaults has been met and answered at the ballot box, and I do not desire to revive the recollection of their defeat, save by proving in my public conduct that their reproaches were undeserved. I trust that it will not be deemed inappro-1 I priatefor me to refer, on an occasion like the | present, to an event which, following rapidly j the official announcement of the election of j the Republican candidates in the State and j I Nation, has thrown a cloud upon even that i splendid triumph. I allude to the death of! i Horace Greeley, which occurred ou the even- J j iug of the 29th ultimo, and which may be 1 I considered as a national calamity. History is but the record of the lives and j ! deeds of the lew men who have Deen either ! the benefactors or the scourges of their race. J This man was in his sphere illustrious above ! all his compeers in the service rendered by him to the cause of human rights, during the i past quarter of a century. Standing at the \ head of a great journal, whose pages were ; disseminated as widely as the English lan1 guage itself, he did more than any of his co; temporaries to mould the opinions of the repi resentative men of his generation, and to es1 tablish and vindicate the beneficent system of free government now incorporated into the organic law of this nation. ; Springing from the toiliug millions of the ; people, he never forgot his origin, but was al- i ways, amid his well deserved wealth and eminence, the out-spoken champion of the poor and oppressed, and of the rights of labor. No i man was more uncharitable in speech than he, aud never was man more charitable in deed, j Possessed of a hardy and rugged honesty ! which the breath of slander dared not assail, 1 even in the fierce heat of a political canvass distinguished for its bitter and malign personality, he never, where principle as he saw it was involved, sacrified the right to the expedient, but always preferred, in maintaining his convictions, rather to break than to bend. His name will be national property, and will continue for many generations to reflect lustre upon his country, while the colored race whom he aided so much to relieve from chattel and civic bondage, will, in gratefully cherishing the memory of his noble service, forget his once grievous fault. In conclusion, fellow-citizens, I would do injustice to the impulses of my heart should I fail, on such an occasion as the present, to recognize and gratefully acknowledge the services rendered to the cause of free govern ment in South Carolina by ray distinguished predecessor. First entering the State as a prisoner of war, whose command was defeated J without dishonor, he was duly exchanged, af-, ter long confinement in a military prison, and at the close of hostilities in the field returned, I with promotion to the rank of major general of the United States Army, to administer the affairs of an important bureau of the government of our State. In that capacity he organized the labor system on a free basis, protecting alike the rights of the employer and the labor. His administration as Governor of South Carolina is before the country, and by the country it will be judged. Whatever that judgment may be, I but express the opin' ion of those who know him best, when I say that he has endeavored to discharged the duties of his high office in the interest of the party that elected him and for the welfare of the people of the State. With a solemn appreciation of the grave responsibility imposed upon me in the performance of my duties, and in the earnest hope that the important matters involved in the situation before us may bring about the utmost concert and unanimity of action, I commend your deliberations to the merciful superintendence of that Almighty Power which presides over States and nations. president's^ message. Washington, D. C., December 2,1872. To the Senate and House of Representatives: In transmitting to you this my fourth annual message, it is with thankfulness to the Giver of all good that as a nation we have been blessed for the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples. With the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from earth with a breath as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the city of Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the year to record. It is gratifying to note how like their fellowcitizens of the city of Chicago, under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that their energy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles and show the same prosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we have been free from pestilence, war, and calamities which often overtake nations, and as far as human judgment can penetrate the future no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

ALABAMA CLAIMS. When Congress adjourned iu June last a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperiled the settlement by friendly arbitration, of the grave differences between this Government and that of Her British Majesty, which, by the Treaty of Washington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeoparded the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in most unhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory to this Government, and in accordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained. The tribunal, which had convened at Geneva, in December, concluded its laborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sura in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sura of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long-standing difference between the two Governments, aud in connection with another award made by the German Emperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two Governments without a shadow upon the friendly re-1 lations, which it is my sincere hope may lorever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva tribunal, accompanied I by the protocols of the proceedings of the ar' bitrators, the arguments of the counsel of ! both Governments, the award of the tribunal, ' and the opinions given by the several arbitra: tors, is transmitted herewith. I have caused i to be communicated to the heads of the three J friendly Powers who complied with the joint ! request made to them under the treaty, the thanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them respectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them, and ray appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, lind great ability with which tbey discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majesty's Government has communicated to me the appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on the part of this Government, during the protracted inquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cor dially unite with Her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to record my high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the prudence afld discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible and delicate duties committed to him; and it is due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government, to express my sense of the talents j and wisdom which they brought to bear in j the attainment of the result so happily I reached. It will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable nntil a year ! from the date of the award, it is deemed ad| visable that no time be lost in making a prop| er examination of the several cases in which ?indemnification may be due. I consequently j recommend the creation of a board of com' missioners for the purpose. | OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER POWERS. With France, our earliest ally; Russia, the ] constant aud steady friend of the United States; | Germany, with whose government and people ( | we have so many causes of friendship and so j ; many common sympathies; and the other j Powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms. Since my last annual message the exchange j has been made of the ratifications of a treaty j | with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating | I to naturalization; also of a treaty with the i | German Empire respecting consuls and trade-! i marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and j ' Norway relating to naturalization; all of which I : treaties have been duly proclaimed. THE MEXICAN REPUBLIC Since your last session the President of the i Mexican Republic, distinguished by his high I character and by hia services to his country, has died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the people?a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdom which it is believed will be confirmed by the results of his administration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen their relations as neighbors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of Mexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in various parts of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in tunioVi tkn noitrViViorinor Rprmhlin Vina an Inner " "1V-11 uvigxvuyg J " ? O ' been involved has in some degree contributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that 1 with a more settled rule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the present Government, the acts of which just complaints are made will cease. The proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately, been checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two Governments which, it is believed, will prove successful. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress of the 7th of May last to inquire into depredations on the Texan frontier, have diligently made investigation in that quarter, and their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriation made -by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially, but the press of that country state that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the cooperation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made at the earliest day practicable to enable the commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. THE WAR IN 

CUBA. It is r/ith regret that I have again to announce a continuance of the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made. While the insurrection has gained no advantages, and exhibits no more of the elements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were exhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its expression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent to its result, although humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents wherever they might occur. It is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is greatly to be hoped that the present Liberal Government of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. The law of emancipation which was passed more than two years since has remained unexecuted, in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It was but a feeble step towards emancipation, but it was the recognition of right, and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with sentiments of humanity and of justice, and in sympathy with the other Powers of the Christian and civilized world. Within the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law of emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of intention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil which oppresses a race and continues a. bloody and destructive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of conceding reforms of which the propriety is not questioned. Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend such legislation as may be proper to denounce and, if not prevent, at least to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves. 

RELIEF OF CITIZENS ABROAD IN DISTRESS. Congress, from the beginning of the Government, has wisely made provision for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision, however, has been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other Governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect are recommended in the case of citizens of the United States destitute or sick under such circumstances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of them are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or be] relieved at the private charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most benevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked tor be granted, care win be taken to carry the beneficence of Congress into such effect that it shall not be unnecessarily and unworthily bestowed. TREASURY. The moneys received and conveyed into the Treasury during the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1872, were: From customs, $216,370,286.77; from sales of public lands, 82,575,714.19 ; from internal revenue, $130,642,177.72; from tax on national bank circulation, &c., $1,136,452.34 ; from Pacific Railway Compauies, $74,986,187; from customs, fines, &c., $1,136,442.34; from fees, consular, patent, land, &c., $2,284,095^92; from miscellaneous sources, $4,441,254.71; total ordinary receipts, 8364,794,229.91; from premium on sales of coin, $941,263,765; total net receipts, 8374,106,367.56 ; balance in Treasury June 30th, 1871, 8109,935,705.59, including $18,228.35 received from unavailable; total available cash, $484,042,573.15. The net expenditures by warrants during the same period were: For civil expenses, $16,187,059.20; for foreign intercourse, $1,839,369.14 ; for Indians, $7,061,728.92 ; for pensions, $28,533,402.76; for military establishment, including j fortification, river and harbor improvements, and arsenals, 835,372,157.20; for naval establishment, including vessels and machinery, and improvements at navy-yards, $21,249,809.99 ; for miscellaneous civil purposes, including public buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue, 842,958,329-08; for interest 011 the public debt, 8117,357,839.72 ; ! total, exclusive of principal and premium on the public debt, 8270,559,695.91. For premium on bonds purchased, $6,958,266.76. For redemption of the public debt, $99,960,1253.54. Total, 8106,018,520.30. Total re: ceipts and disbursements, 8377,478,216.21. Balance in treasury June 39,1872, $106,564,356.94. Total, 8484,042,573.15. From the foregoing statement it appears that the reduction of the principal of the debt during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1872, was 899,960,253.54. The source of this reduction is as I follows : Net ordinary receipts during the vear, 8364,694,229.91; net ordinary expendi j tures, including interest on the public debt, J 8270,559,095.91; leaving surplus revenue, j 894,134,534; add amount received from premiums on sales of gold in excess of the preI raiurapaidon bonds purchased, 82,454,370.89; | add the amount of the reduction of the cash balance at the close of the year, accompanied I with same at the commencement of the year, 83,371,348.65?total, 899,960,253.54. This statement treats solely of the principal of the public debt by the monthly statement of the public debt, which adds together the principal and interest due and unpaid, and interest accrued to date not due, and deducts the cash in the Treasury as ascertained on the day of publication. The reduction was 8100,544,491.28. The source of this reduction is as follows: Reduction in principal account, 899,960,003.54; reduction in unpaid interest account, 83,310,952.96?grand total, 8103,290,956.50; Reduction in cash on hand, 82,746,465.22? grand total, 8100,544,491.28. On the basis of the last table the statements show a reduction of the public debt from the 1st of March, 1869, to the present time as follows: From March 1,1869, to March 1, 1870, 887,134,782.84; from March 1, 1870, to March 1, 1871, 8117,619,630.25 ; from March 1,1871, to March 1, 1872, 8^4,895,248.94; from March 1,1872, to November 1, 1872 (eight months), 864,047,237.84. Total, 8363,696,999.87. With reduction of taxation by the acts of Congress at its last session, the expenditures of the Government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful, however, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burden upon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure of justice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, I would recommend that no more legislation be had on this subject unless it be to correct errors of omission or commission in the present laws, until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet current expenses of Government, pay interest on the public debt, and provide for the sinking fund established by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the highest importance. Next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to provide a national currency of fixed, unvarying value as compared with gold, and as soon as practicable, having due regard for the interests of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade and commerce, convertible into gold at par. 

PENSIONS. The amount paid for pensions in the last fiscal year was 8301,693.40?an amount larger by 837,084.34 than was paid during the preceding year. Of this amount 8231,349 were paid under the act of Congress of February 17, 1871, to survivors of the war of 1812. The annual increase of pensions by the legislation of Congress has more than kept pace with the national yearly losses from the rolls. The act of Congress of June 8,1872, has added an estimated amount of 8750,000 per annum to the rolls without increasing the number of .% n i i o pensioners. >ve cannot, tnereiore, iook ior any substantial decrease in the expenditures of this department for some time to come, or so long as Congress continues to so change the rates of pension. The whole number of soldiers enlisted in the war of the rebellion was 2,688,523. The total number of claims for invalid pensioners is 176,000, being but six per cent, of the whole number of enlisted men. The total number of claims on hand at the beginning of the year was 91,689. The number received during the year was 27,574. The number disposed of was 39,178, making a net gain of 12,604. The number of claims now on file is 79,085. On the 30th of June, 1872, there were on the rolls the names of 95,405 invalid military pensioners, 113,518 widows, orphans, and dependent relatives, raakingan aggregate of 208,923 army pensioners. At the same time there were on the rolls the names of 1,419 navy pensioners, and 1,730 widows, orphans, and dependeut relatives, making the whole number of naval pensioners 3,179. There have been since the passage of the act to provide pensions for the survivors of the war of 1812, 36,551 applications prior to June 30, 1872. Of these there were allowed during the last fiscal year 20,126 claims; 4,845 were rejected during the year, leaving 11,580 claims pending at that date. The number of pensions of all classes granted during the last fiscal year was 33,838; during that period there were dropped from the rolls for various causes 9,104 names, leaving a grand total of 322,229 pensioners on the rolls on the 30th of June, 1872. It is thought that the claims for pensions on account of the war of 1812 will all be disposed of by the 1st of May, 1873. It is estimated that 830,480,000 will be required for the pension service during the next fiscal year. war department. The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, to be $35,799,991.82, and for the fiscal year ending June 30,1872, to be 835,372,159.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of 8427,834.62. The estimates for military appropriations for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, are 833,801,378.78. The estimates of the Chief of Engineers are submitted separately for fortifications, river and harbor improvements, and for public buildings and grounds, and the Washington aqueduct. The affairs of the Freedman's Bureau have all been transferred to the War Department, and regulations bave been put into execution for the speedy payment of bounty, pay, &c., due colored soldiers, properly coming under that Bureau. All war accounts for money and property prior to 1871 have been examined and transmitted to the Treasury for final settlement. During the fiscal year there has been paid for transportation on railroads 81,300,000, of which 8800,857 was over the Pacific railroad : for transportation by water $626,373.52, and by stage'848,975.85 ; and for the purchase of transportation animals, wagons, hire of teamsters, &c., $924,650.64. About $370,000 have been collected from southern railroads during the year, leaving about $40,000 still due. The Quartermaster has examined and transmitted to the accounting officers for settlement $367,172.72 of claims by loyal citizens for quartermaster's stores taken during the war. Subsistence supplies to the amount of $89,048.12 have been issued to Indians. The annual average mean strength of the army was 24,101 white aud 2,494 colored soldiers. The total deaths for the year reported were 165 white and 54 colored. The distribution of the Medical and Surgical His- i tory of the War is yet to be ordered by Congress. There exists an absolute necessity for 1 a medical corps of the full number established by act of Congress of July 28, 1866, there being now fifty-nine vacancies, and the i number of successful applicants rarely exceeds eight or ten in any one year. NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith accompanying, explains fully the condition of that branch of the public service, ito wants and deficiencies, expenses incurred during the past year, and appropriations for the same. It also gives a complete history of the service of the navy for the past year in addition to regular service. It is evident that, unless early steps are taken to improve our navy, in a very few years the United States will be the weakest nation | upon the ocean, of all the great Powers. With an energetic, progressive, business people like ours, penetrating and forming business relations with every part of the known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect of our flag abroad is necessary for the full protection of their rights. I recommend careful consideration by Congress of the recom mendatiou made by the Secretary of the Navy. DEPARTMENT OF JU8TICE. Detailed statements of the disbursements through the Department of Justice will be furnished by the report of the Attorney-General ; and though these have been somewhat increased by the recent acts of Congress to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the Union, and to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the amendments thereto, I cannot question the necessitv and salutary effect of those enactments, fteckless and lawless men, I regret to say, have associated themselves together in some localities, to deprive other citizensof those rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States, and to that end have committed deeds of blood and violence; but the prosecution and punishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the repression of such disorders. I do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all parts of the country favor the full enjoyment by all classes of persons, of those rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution and laws, and I invoke the aid and influence of all good citizens to prevent organizations whose objects are, by unlawful means, to interfere with those rights. I look with confldence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combinations prohibited by the acts referred to, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or inflict punishmeutto protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations. Applications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted of a violation of said acts, upon the ground that clemency in such cases would tend to tranquilize the public mind ; and to test the virtue of that policy I am disposed, as far as my " * * - ?Ml xl sense 01 justice win permit, 10 give nieoe applications a favorable consideration, but any action thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in my determination to enforce with rigor such acts so long as the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is regretted by no one more than myself, that a necessity has ever existed to execute the enforcement act. No one can desire more than I that the necessity of applying it may never again be demanded. LANDS. During the last fiscal year there were disposed of out of the public lands 11,864,975 acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres than was disposed of the previous year. Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for cash, 389,460 acres located with military warrants, 4,671,332 acres are taken for homesteads, 693,613 acres located with college scrip, 3,554,887 acres granted to railroads, 465,347 acres granted to wagon roads, 714,755 are given to States as swamp lands, 560 acres located by Indian scrip. The cash receipts from all sources in the Land Office amounted to 83,218,190. During the same period 22,016,606 acres of the public lands were surveyed ; which added to thequantity before surveyed, amounts to 583,365,780 acres, leaving 1,257,633,628 acres of the public lauds still unsurveyed. The reports from the subordinates of the Land Office contain interesting information in regard to their respective districts. They uniformly mention the fruitfuluess of the soil dnrinorthp nnsf-. spnarm and t.hp innrPA.spd vifild of all kindsof produce. Even in those States and Territories where mining is the principal business, agricultural products have exceeded the local demand, and liberal shipments have been made to distant points. THE CENSUS. The ninth census is about completed. Its early completion is a subject of congratulation inasmuch as the use to be made of the statistics therein contained depends greatly on the promptitude of publication. The Secretary of the Interior recommends that a census be taken in 1875, which recommendation should receive the early attention of Congress. The interval at present established between the Federal census is so long that the information obtained at the decennial period as to the material condition, wants, and resources of the nation is of little practical value after the expiration of the first half of that period. It would probably obviate the constitutional provisions regarding the decennial census taken in 1875 should it be divested of all political character, and no reapportionment of Congressional representation be made under it. Such a census, coming as it would in the last year of the first century of our national existence, would furnish a noble monument of the progress of the United States during that century.
