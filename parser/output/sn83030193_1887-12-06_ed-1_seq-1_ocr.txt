Tho Capitol was crowded thin morning for on hour beforo Con gress met. Tho Senate immediately after it was called to order, on motion of Mr. Hoar took a roccBs for half an hour to await tho President's message. Tho House met at 13.20 and took a recess of twenty minutes to await the President's message To At Congritt 0 U Uutltd Statu t Ton are confronted at the threshold of your Ice illative duties with a condition of tbo national flnanoca which imperatively demands Immediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually ozaetod, through the operation of present lairs, from the Industries and necessities of tho people, largely ezceeda tho sum necessary to meet the expenses of tbo Govern ment. When we consider that tho theory of our Institu tions guarantiee to every citizen the full enjoyment of all tee traits of his Industry and enterprise, with only suoh deduction aa may bo his shore to wards the careful and economical maintenance of tho Government which protects him. It Is plain that the exaction of more than this Is Indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal ol American fair ness and Justice. This wrong Inflicted upon those who bear tho bnrden of nstlonal tax , ution, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The publlo Treasury , which should only exist as a conduit conveying the peo ple's tribute to Its legitimate objeota of expendi ture, becomes a hoardlug-place for money need lessly withdrawn from traue and the people's use, thui crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment In productive enterprise, threatening-financial dis tnroanoe, and lnvltiog schsmes of publlo plunder. This condition of our Treasury la not altogether new; and tt has more than once of late been sub milted to the people's representatives In the Con gress, who alone oan apply a remedy. And yet tho situation silll continues, with aggravated Inci dents, more than ever presaging nnanolol convul sion and wide-spread disaster. ACT 

BKFOBB DISASTER COMKB. It will not do to neglect this situation because Its dangers are not now palpably Imminent and ap parent. They exist none the less certainly, and await the unforeseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly they will be precipitated upon us. On the Both day of Juno, lass, theoxceiaof revenues over publlo expenditures after complying with the annual requirement of the sinking Fund act, was $11,855, 783. 8-1; during the yoar ended June 80, IBM. such excess amounted to $49, 403, Sis. go, and during the year endod June SO, 1687. it reached the sum Of 155,667,849.54. The anneal contributions to the sinking fund dur ing the three yesrs above specified, amonnttng in the aggregate to $133,053,820.94, and deducted from the surplus as stated, were made by colling In for that purpose outstanding three per cent, bonds of the Government. During the six months prior to June 80, 1887. the surplus revenue bsd grown so largo by repeated accumulations, and It was feared the withdrawal of this great Bum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of tho country trial the sum of t7V,&04, loo of such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the three per cent, bonds still outstand ing, snd which were then payable at the option of the Government. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately after the 80th day of June, 1637, the remainder of the 8 per cent, bonds then outstanding, amounting with principal and Interest to the sum of 118,877.600. were called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the Treasury Department representa tions of distress in business circles not only con tinued, but Increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these circumstances the contribution to the sinking fund for the current fiscal yesr was at onoe completed by the expenditure of in. 684,283.66 in the purchase of Government bonds not yet due bearing i and 4)f per cent. Interest, tho pre mium paid thereon averaging about u per cent, for the former and 8 per cent, for tho latter. In addition to this the Interest accruing during the current year upon outstanding bonded Indebted ness nf the Government was to some extent antici pated, and banks selected as depositories of publlo money were permitted to somewhat Increase their deposits. while the expedients thus employed, to release to the people the money lying idle In the Treasury, served to avert Immediate .danser, our surplus rovenues have continued to accumulate, the ex cess for the present year amounting on the 1st day of December to $55,258,70110, and estimated to reach the sum of $113,000,000 on thesoth of June next, at which date it is expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell tho surplus In the Treasury to $140,000,000. 

VOMIT OSILB88LY SUBTBAOTKD FROM CHANNELS Or TIIADE. There seems to be no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from use of the people's circulating medium, our business community may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which wss quite lstely produced from the same janso. And while the functions of our Natl nal Treasury should be few and simple, and while lis btst condition would be reached, I believe, by its enl re disconnection with private business Interests, yet when, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should bo devised by the uovernment to restore In an emergency, without w,,e or etrsvaganco, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now exists no ?' .and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption ol 8 per cent, bonds, whloh were payable at the option of the Govern ment, has afforded a means for the disbursement in ,?

MHIIOY OP BONDnOLDBRS. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation tho surplus money accumulating In the Treasury, It should be borne In mind that premiums must of course bo paid upon such purchase, that there may be a largo part of these bonds held as Investments which can not be purohascd at any prlco, and that combina tions among holders who are willing to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the Government. It has boen suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of Interest and the dlffcrcnre between the old and new se curity paid In cash, thus finding use for tho sur ilus In the Treasury. The success of this plan, it s npparent, mast depend npon the volition of the holders of the present bonds; and It is not entirely certain that the Inducement which must bo offered them would result in more financial benefit to the Government than the purchase of bonds, while tho lstter proposition would reduco tho principal of the debt by actual payment, Instead of extend ing it. Tho proposition to deposit the money held by the Government In banks throughout the country for use by the people Is, it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as establishing too cloao a relationship between the operations of tho Gov ernment Treasury and the business of the country, and too extensive a comminuting of their money, thns loitering an unnatural rcllinco In private business upon publlo funds. It this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive effort should generally be In the op posite direction and should have a tendency to di vorce, as mueh and as fast as can aaiely lie done, the Treasury Department from prlvato enterprise. ' Of course, It Is not expected that unnecessary and extravagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding tho accumulation of an ex cess of revenue. Such expenditure, besldo the de moralization of all Just conceptions of publlo duty which It entails, stimulates a nabit of reckless Im providence not In tho least consistent with tho mission of our people or the high and beneficent purposes of our Government. TUB 

SITUATION FBAOOHT WITH DANOEK! I have deemed It mr duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to tho at tention of their representatives charged with the responsibility of legislative relief, the vravlty of onr financial situation. The failure ol the Con gress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident trie very nature of tho difficulty must necessarily produce caused a con dition of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to tho utmost all the authority and expedients within exccutlvo control, and theso appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued Inaction of Congress, the responsibility must rest where It belongs. Though tho situation thus far considered Is fraught with danger which should be fully real ized, and though It presents features of wronn to the peoplo aa well aa peril to the country, It la but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproducing the same alarming circumstances a convened National Treasury and a depleted monetary condition In tno business of tno country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, wo can only be saved from a like predicament In the future by the removal of its cause. Onr scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus IS taken from the people and put Into the publlo Treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon Importations from abroad and internal rovenuo taxes levied npon the consump tion of tobacco and spirituous and milt liquors. It must bo conceded that none of the things sub jected to Internal revenue taxa'lon are, Btrlctly spesklng, necessaries; there appears to bo no Just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these artlcles,.and there Beems to be nothing bo well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. 

REVISE TOE TARirr LAWS AT ONCE. But our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequi table, and Illogical source of unnecessary taxation ought to be at once revised and amended. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles Imported and sub ject to doty, by precisely tho sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tux paid by those who purchase for us 1 these im ported articles, iiany of these things, bow ever, are raised or manufactured In our own country, and tho duties now levied upon foreign goods and producta are called protection to these nome manufactures, because they render tt possible for those of our people whodre manu facturers, to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to tnat demandod for the Imported goods that have paid oustoms doty. So It happens that whllo comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people who never use and never saw any of the foreign prod ucts, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly or qulto the same enhanced prlco which the uuty adds to tho Imported articles, 'those who buy Imports pay tho duty charged thereon Into the public Treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who buy domestic articles of the ssme class: pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This refer ence to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but In order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner In whloh they Impose a burden npon those who consume domestic products as well as those who consume lmpoitea articles, and thus create a tax npon all our people. It la not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively continued ns the source of the Government's Income; and in oj readjustment of our tariff the interests of Ameri can labor engaged in manufacture should be care fully considered, aa well as the preservation of our manufactures. It may be called protection, or by any othtr name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be de vised with especial precaution against imperilling tho existence of onr manufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a con dition which, without regard to tho publlo weliaro or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of Immense proms Instead of moderately profitable roturna. As the volume and diversion of our nstlonal activities Increase, new recruits are added to those who de sire a continuation of the advantagea which tney conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the prosent condition been re sisted by those of ourfellow-cltlzens thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of tho suspicion, entertained to a oertaln extent, that there exists an organized combination all along the line to maintain their advantage. 

CONSUMERS TAXEII BSTOND REASON. We are In the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and Ingenuity, In American energy and enter prise and In the wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a century's national growth. Yet wiieu an attempt la made to Justify a scheme which permit, a tax to be laid upon every consumer In the land lor the benefit of our manu facturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it snlts tl.e purposes of advo co y to call our manufactures infant industries .till needing the hluhest and greatest degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from Federal legislation. It Is also said that the mere se In tho price of do mestic manufactures resulting from the present tariff Is necessary In order that higher wagea may be paid to our worklngmen employed in manu factories than are paid lor what Is called the pau per labor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force of on argument which Involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboring peopie. Our labor Is honorable In the eyes of every Ameri can citizen ; and as It lies at tho foundation of our development and progress, It Is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The stsndsrd of our laborers' life should not be measured by that of any other country :less fa vored, and they are entitled to their full share ol all our advantages. 

FACTS FOR WAGE-WORKERS. By tho last census It Is made to appear that of the l7,tsv,uW) of our population engaged In all kinds of industries. t,670,43 are employed In agri culture, 4,U74,!83 In professional and personal service (S,vM,674 ol whom are domestlo servants aud laborers), while 1,810, 854 aro employed In trade and transportation and 8,837,118 are classed as employed In manufacturing and mining. For the present purposes, however, tho last number given should do considerably reduced. Without attempting to enumerate all. It will bo conceded that there should be deducted from thoso whloh It Includes 876, 148 carpenters and Joiners, 193,401 milliners, dressmakers, and seamstresses, 178,724 blacksmiths, 133, 764 tailors and talloresses, 101,478 mssous, 76,241, butchers, 41,800 bakers, Boys' nothing. Winter Ofsrooats, Uistws. Can CoiU, Salts and TrouMT, iiswatt patterns, and strlea i moderate pneea. ITiioitBHiLL, Slots h Coaxxu, 746.760 liroadwagr, on dwbslowWhst. V 12,033 plasterers, snd 4,891 engaged In manufac turing agricultural implements, amounting In tho aggregate to 1,814,013, leaving j,fl23,0M persons employed In such manufacturing Industries as aro clalmod to be benefited by a high tariff. To these the appeal Is made to aave their employ ment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should he no disposition to answer such suggestions by tho allegation that they are In a minority among thoso who labor, and thcreforo should forego an advantage In tho Interest of low prices for tho majority. Their compensation, aa It may be affected by tho operation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept In view, and yet, with slight reflection, tney will not over look the fact that they are consumers with tho rest; that they, too, have their own wants and thoso of their families to supply from their earn ings, and that tho prloe of the neceasarles ol life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate tho measure of their welfare and comfort. lllOU 

TARIFF MAKES NECESSITIES COSTLT. But tho reduction of taxation demanded should bo so measured as not to necessitate or Justify either the loss of employment by the worklnir man nor tho lessening of nls waves ; and theprollis still remaining to the manufacturer, after a necessary readjustment, should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of the Interests of his emplojces either in their opportunity to work or In the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the worker in man ufactures fall to understand that while a huh tariff la claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages, It certainly re sults In a very lare lncrcaso In the prlco of nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in almost count less forms, ho neods tor the nse of Himself and his family, lie recelvos at the desk of nls employer his wages, and perhaps before no reaches his nomo Is obliged. In u ptirchaio for family use of an artkle which embraces his own labor, to retnrn In the payment of tho Increase In price which the tarlfr permits tho hard-earned compensation of many days of toll. A WORD TO FARMERS. The farmer and tho agriculturist who muntifnc turo nothing, but who pay the Increased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural Implement, upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, except the lncrouse of his docks and herds and snoh things aa his husbandry producea from tho soil, Is invited to aid in maintaining the firesent situation, and he Is told that a high duty on mported wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear. In order that the price of their wool may be Increased. They of course ore not reminded that tho farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his pur chases of clothing and woollen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer, as well to the manufacturer snd mercha it; nor la any mention made of the f sot that tho sheep-owners tuemselvcs, and their households, must wisr clothing and use other articles manufactured from the wool they sell at tarlfr prices, ami thus as consumers must return their sbaro or this Increased price to ttie trude.man. I think It may be fairly asauined that a large pro portion of the sheep owned by the farmcra through out tho country aro found In small flocks number ing from twenty-rive to fifty. The duty on Ihe grade of Imported wool which these sheep yield, Is 10 cents each pound if of the value of 8u cents or less, am 12 cents If of the value of more than 80 cents. If tho liberal cstlmato of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, tho duly thereon would bo CO or 78 cents, and this may bo taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would ihus represent tbo in creased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep, and $36 that from the wool of fifty sheep; and ut ptesent valjes this addition would amount to about one-tnlrd of Its price. It upon Its sale the farmer recelt cs this or a lees tariff profit, tho wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which In all Its changes will adhere to It, until It rrauncs the consumer. When manufactured Into cloth and other goods and material for use. Its cost Is not only Increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a lur' her sum has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer uuder the operation of other tariff laws. In the mean time the day ar rives when the farmer finds It ntoeBsary to pur chaso woolen goods and material to clothe himself and family for tho winter. When he faces the tradesman for that purpose ho discovers that ho Is obliged not only to return, In the way of Increased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he soM, and which then perhaps lies before him In manufac tured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further Increase In cost cau.ed bv a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus In the end he is aroused to the tact that bn has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff scheme, which, when lie sold his wool seemed so profitable, an lncrcaso In price more than sufficient to sweep away all Iho tariff profit he received npon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged m wool raising Is compared with all the farmers In the country, and the small proportion they bear 10 our population Is considered; when it Is made apparent that. In the case of o large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff on wool Is illusory; and, above all, whon It must be conceded that the Increase of tho cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with mod erate means and the poor, the employed and un employed, tne sick and well and the young and old, and that It constitutes a tax whleh, with re lentless grasp, la fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child In the land, reasons are suggested wuy the removal or redaction of this iiuty should bo Included in a revision of oar tariff laws. 

COMPETITION STRANGLED BT COMBINATIONS. In speaking of the Increased cost to the con sumer of our homo msnufacturcs, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same de scription, the fact la not overlooked that competi tion among our domestlo producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of tnelr products below the highest limit allowed by such dnty. But It is notorious that this competition Is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object tho regulation ol the supply aud price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration In the operation of these sel fish schemes. If, however, In the absence of such combination, a healthy and free oam petition redoces the price ol any particular dutiable article ol home production below tho limit which It might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, ana if, with such reduced price. Us manufacture continues to thrive It Is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduco taxation. Tho necessity ot combination lo maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point, furnishes proof that some one Is willing to accept lower juices for suoh commodity, and that such pnoes are re munerative; snd lower prices produced by compe tition prove the same thing. Thus where either of these conditions exist, a case would seem to be pre sented for an easy reduotlon of taxation. REDUCE CUSTOMS DUTIES. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are Intended only to en force an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the Government be prevented by the reduction of our customs duties, and, at the same time, to emphasize a suggestion that In accomplish ing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our people by grsnting to them a measure of re lief from tariff taxation In quarters where It is most needed and from aources where tt can be moat fairly aud Justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of snch con siderations be, with any degree of fairness, re garded aa evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing Interests, or of any lack of appre ciation ot their value and Importance. Theso interests constitute a loading and most substantial element of our national greatness and f urnlah the proud proof of our country'a progress. But If In the emergency that proises upon us our manufacturers are askeu to surrender something for the publlo good and to avert disaster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already afforded, should lead them to. willing co-operation. No demand is made that they ahall forego all the benefits of governmental regard; but they cannot fall to be admonished of their duty, as well aa their enlightened self-interest and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that financial panlo and col lapse, to which the present condition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our manufac tures than to our other Important enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform Is now offered; and none of us should be unmind ful ot a time when an abused and Irritated people, beedlesa of those who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may Insist upon a radical and aweeplng rectification ot their wrongs. A 

GREAT TASK FOR CONGRESS. The difficulty attending a wise and fair, revision of our tariff laws Is not underestimated. It will iequlre on the part of the Congi e.s sreat labor and care, and especially a broad aud national contem plation of the subject, and a patriotto disregard of such local and acinsh claims aa are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare ot the entire country. Under our present lawa more than four thousand arilclea are aubject to dnty. Many of these do not In ony way compete with oar own manufactures The World Stands on two pillar, lota and Gharttr. PAnr Pinrr stands on lUnputttiuai to only sar cui for physloal pain. and many aro hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable reduction can he made In the aggregate by adding them to the freo list. The taxation of luxuries presents no festures ot hardship, but tho necessaries of lite used and consumed by all the peoplo, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly choapened. The radical reduction of the dtittei Imposed upon raw material used In manufactures, or Its free Im portation, Is of course an important factor In anv effort to reduce the price ol these necessaries; ft would not only relieve them from the Increased eost caused by the tariff on snch material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such product, as a compensation to our manufacturers for the present I rice of raw material, could be accordingly modi fied, such reduotlon, or free Importation, would serve beside to largely reduce tho retenue. It Is not apparent how such a change can have any Injurious effect upon our manufacturers. On tho contrary, it would appear to give thim a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their wares by freo material. Thus onr peoplo might have tho opportunity ot extending their salea beyond tho llinlta of home consumption saving them from the depression, Interruption In business, and loss caucd by a glutted domestlo market, and afford ing ihelr employees more certain mid steady labor, with Its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus Imperatively prurntivl for solution should be approached In a spirit higher than partisanship ami considers I In the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should char acterize tho action of thoto Intrusted with the weal of a confiding people. But tho obligation to de clared partv policy and principle Is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented In the Gov ernment have, by repeated and auihorltatho dec larations, condemned the condition ot our laws which permit the collection from the people of un necessary revenue, and have, In the most solemn manner, promised its corrrctton; and neither aa citizens or partisans aro onr countrymen In a mood to condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. A 

CONDITION, NOT A THEORY. Onr progress towards a wise conclusion will not be Improved by dwelling upon the theories of pro tection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets, it la a condition whloh con fronts us not a theory. Relief from this condition may Involve a alight reduction ot the advantages which we award our homo productions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be contemplated. The question of freo trade Is absolutely Irrelevant, and the persistent claim made la certain quarters, tnat all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schomes of so-called free-traders. Is mlschlev ous 11 nd far removed from any consideration for the publlo good. The slinplo and plain dnty which we owe tho peo plo la to reduco taxation to the necessary expenses ot un economical operation of the Government and to restore to the business of the eoontry the money which wo hold In the Treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. Theso things csn and should be dono with safety to all our In dustries, without danger to tho opportunity for remunerative labor which ourworklnumen ncod, and with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means of subsistence and Increas ing tne measure of tnelr comforts. The Constitution provides that the President "shall, from time to time, give to Congress infor mation of the stato of the Union. " It has been tho enstom of tho executive, in compliance with this provision, to annually exhibit to Congress at the opening of Its session tno general condition of the country and 10 detail with some particularity the operations of tho different exeoutlve departments. It would be especially agreeable to lollow tnls course at the present tltn" and to rail attention to tho valuablo accomplishments of these de partments during the last fiscal yvar. But I am so much Impressed with the paramount Importance of tho subject to Which this communication has thus far been devoted, that Is iall lorego the addition of any other topic, and only urge upon your Imme diate consideration the ''state of the Union" ss shown In tho presfnt condition of onr Treasury aud our general fiscal situation, npon which every ele ment of our safety and prosperity depends. The reports ot the heads of departments, which will bo submitted, contain full und explicit Infor mation touching the trsnsai Hon of the business In. trusted to them, and such recommendations relat ing to legislation In the public Interest as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and recommendations the deliberate examination and action of tho legislative branch of the Govern ment. Tnero are other subjects not embraced In the de partmental reports demanding legislative consider ation and which I should be glaa to submit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented In previous messages, and as to them, I beg leave to repeat prior recommendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the Department of State, a brief history of the transactions of that Important department, to- ether with other matters which it may hereafter e deemed essential to commend to the attention of the Congress, may furnish the occaslou for a future communication.

Utile Delict That It Was Used by Wall Street Speculators. A morning pnpor published to-dny n story to the effect that a Washington Btenographor, employed by Col. Danlol Lamont to copy n part of tho President's incs sago, had sold n largo part of the messago to nomo Wall street specula tors, who, on tho strength of tho information thus received, had entered into extensivo speculations in tho common stock of tho Now York. Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, othor wiso known as tho Nickel Plato. This information was obtained from ono Barrett H. Proston, n young man employed in tho brokerage oflico of W. L. Law son A: Co., who professed to havo knowledge of tho ciisteuco of an advance copy of the inessago ill this city, obtained by means of souio Washington stenographer. Mr. l'roston was fonnd by a Would re porter this morning at Lawson & Co.'s office, 49 Exchange place. Ho said thnt iho facts as published wcro substantially true, but de clared that he could not say anything moro about tho matter without violating a conn- donco. He admitted, however, that ho did not know positively that a copy of tho Presi dent's message had been Bold to any specu lators in this city, and said that ho had not seen tho copy of which He spoko. Upon further question no also admitted that ho know the namo of the stenographer in Washington who had furniBhod the alleged copy of the messago.but afterwards denied that he know any ono connected with the matter except a stenographer in this city in com munication with the inysterlouB Washington stenographer, and whoso name ho refused to give. After this he refused to talk any more. As regards tho speculators who mndo usoof tho message to speculate in Nickol Plato stock, ho refused to disclose anything, but bald that tho stock was extensively dealt in. An investigation of the stock transactions yesterday, when these big deals woro alleged to have been mado,show that not a single snaro of common stock wns dealt in, and that all tho representations that Nickel Plato had an the list were transactions of forty shares in first and 100 shares of second preferred stock.
