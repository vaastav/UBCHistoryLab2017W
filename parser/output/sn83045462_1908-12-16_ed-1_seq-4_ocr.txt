Points to Roosevelt's Criticism of Congress as Another Libel. MOW 

YORK. Decern her Ifi.-Thc World, replying to President Roosevelt's message on Panama affairs, this morning under the caption, "Le?e Majeste," says: "Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken, lie cannot muzzle the World. "While no amount of billingsgate on his part ran alter our determination to treat him with judicial impartiality and scrupulous fairness, we repeat what we have already said?that the Congress of the T'liited States should make a thorough investigation of the whole Panama transaction, that the full truth may be known to the American people. "It is a most extraordinary circumstance that Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand such an inquiry. All his protestations of outraged virtue, all his torrents of imprecation and denunciation end with the amazing assertion that there is nothing whatever in which this government is interested to investigate about this transaction." Compliment Is Accepted. "The World fully appreciates the compliment paid to it by Mr. Roosevelt in making it the subject of a special message to tlit: Congress of the Cnited States. In the whole history of American government no other President has ever paid such a tribute to the power and influence of a fearless, independent newspaper. "The World likewise appreciates the importance and significance of Mr. Roosevelt's statement when he declares to Congress that the proprietor of the World should be prosecuted for libel by the governmental authorities,' and that 'the Attorney General has under consideration the form under which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought." "This is the first time a President ever asserted the doctrine of lese majesty, or proposed, in the absence of specific legislation, the criminal prosecution by the government of citizens who criticised the conduct of the government or the conduct of individuals who may have had business dealings with the government. Neither tlie King of Great Britain nor the German emperor would venture to arroj gate such power to himself. "John Adams' attempt to enforce the sedition law destroyed the federalist party 1n America. Yet Mr. Roosevelt. In the absence of law. officially proposes to use all the power of the greatest government on earth to cripple the freedom of the press on the pretext that the government itself has been libeled?and he is the government. Quarrel of Long Standing. "We are aware that for many years Mr. Roosevelt has been savagely displeased with the editorial conduct of the World. It is true that we have criticised him sharply and frankly whenever we believed the public interest required. Just as we have heartily commended and supported him whenever we believed the public interest would thereby be advanced. "Mr. Roosevelt's attack on the World can be explained only on the theory that he believes he can muzzle the paper, and our recent impeachment of his veracity seems to have been the last straw that broke his autocratic back. "It is true that the World printed the public reports concerning the Panama canal affair, which resulted from William Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney's office during the recent cam paign to prevent t lie publication of a story which was said to be In the hands of the democratic national committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's own action which raised the issue in the campaign. "It is true also that when Mr. Roosevelt made his attack upon Delavan Smith tbe World called attention to certain statements which Mr. Roosevelt must have known to be false or misleading, and appealed to Congress to end all scandal by a full and impartial investigation. If this be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the most of it. Accuracy Is Questioned. "Mr. Roosevelt's lamentable habit of inaccurate statement makes it impossible to accept either his judgment or his conclusions. In his message he does not state correctly even so simple a matter " as the pretended cause of his grievance, n "He says, for example, that the World - asserted that there was 'corruption by or r on behalf of the government of the g I'nited States.' No such charge was ff made by this newspaper, e "He says it was asserted that there were "improper dealings of some kind between agents of the government and outd side persons.' No such charge was made. * "He says that 'among those persons '- who. it was alleged, made "huge profits" t" i were Mr. Charles P. Taft. a brother of Mr. William H. Taft. then candidate for ; the presidency, and Mr. Douglas Robine son, my brother-in-law.' No such charge e was made. d "The World lias never said that Charles P. Taft or Doug'as Rcbinson made any profits whatever. Mr. Taft denied that lie was concerned in the transaction in any t way, whicn oeniai me world published s and accepted. "It would have been equally glad to t print Mr. Robinson's denial could it liava y succeeded in obtaining one from lihn, as it frequently attempted. The World lias 110 evidence that lie was associated with - Mr. Cromwell, and would accept his word to that effect: for Mr. Robinson is an estimable gentleman of high character, whose reputation for veracity is infinitely better than that of his distinguished brother-in-law. Ready to Be Punished if Guilty. "if the World has libeled anybody we hope it will be pun is :ed. but we do not intend to be intimidated by Mr. Roosevelt's threats, or by Mr. Roosevelt's denunciation, or by Mr. Roosevelt's power. "Mr. Roosevelt's seething indignation about the World's 'libel upon the Cnlted States government' is an exquisite indict ment. indeed, coming' as it noes from a President who less than a week ago officially Insinuated in his message that the Congress of the I'nited States was composed of scoundrels who amended an appropriation bill because "congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret service men." "No other living man ever so gross'y libeled the I'nited States as does this President, who besmirches Congress, bulldozes judges, assails the integrity of courts, slanders private citizens, and who has shown himself the most reckless, unscrupulous demagogue whom the American people ever trusted with great power j and authority. "We say this not in anger hut in sjnI cere sorrow. The World has immeasura; bly more respect fot the office of Presl- j ; dent of the I'nited States than Theodore j I Roosevelt has ever shown during the j | years in which lie has maintained a reign j : of terror ami vilified the honor and lion- | esty of both public offlcia's and private citizens who opjiosed his policies or thwarted him in his purposes. "So far as the World is concerned its proprietor may g<> to jail, if Mr. Rooseveli succeeds, as tie threatens, but even in jai. the World will not cease to be a tear less champion of free speech, a free press and a free people. "It cannot be muzzled." Pulitzer Was at Sea. Joseph Pulitzer, proprietor of the World, : last night said: . "So far as I am personally concerned. I j I was at sea during the whole of October. ; and. in fact, practically for two years I i have been yachting on account of my i health. "1 never read a word or syllable of this . Panama story, was not in connection with | the paper and had nothing to do with it. Mr. Roosevelt knows al! this perfectly. Me knows I am a chronic invalid and I mostly abroad yachting on account of my M health. "I think his anger is simply due to the ' sharp attacks made 1 v the World on him i politically. For that perhaps I amTespon- ; sible; that is for the nolithal criticism of ; Roosevelt on public and political grounds ] to'ely. "1 am really sorry he should be so very angry, but the World will continue to criti< ise him without a shadow of fear, if t he should succeed in competing me to edit the paper from jail." More Light on Panama Deal Is Wanted by Delavan Smith NEW 

YORK. December Id.?After reading President Roosevelt's message to Congress relative to the Panama canal investigation. Delavan Smith of the Indianapolis News, one of the editors attacked by t lie President, said last night in his apartments at the Hotel Plaga: "The President has undoubtedly fu- j deavored in his communicaflon to cover , as fully as his available information , permitted tne questions raisea oy tne recent discussion In the newspapers of the Panama canal purchase. No one ques- ' tions the personal integrity of the Prcsi- 1 dent. "It would seem that he has already sue- ] reeded in gathering much information , since his previous utterance on the subject. However, thpre would appear to be 1 many points needing light which he has i failed to touch on in his communication of yesterday. "The public should be informed fully as to the alleged American syndicate; why it was formed; who was in it; how much 1 money did each participant furnish; what was lis object; was it instrumental in fomenting the Colombian revolution? Asks Why Flans Were Changed. "Another interesting point on which the , public should have light is 'What causes led up to the sudden shift from the Nicaragua to the Panama project in the face ^ of the expert advice of many of the best American engineers favorable to the , Nicaragua route.'' "Did the Americans buy up shares in the French company when they were depre- , ciated by the prospect of the adoption J of the Nicaraguan route? Were the inventories of machinery and other assets of the old company properly made? , "Another important step that should , he taken at this time would be the determination of the feasibility of the pres- j ent plans of construction. It would seem already apparent that the cost of the canal on the present plan will reach dou- j ble the original estimate. If this be so, , would it not be better to construct a sealevel canal in lieu of the proposed lock , canal? "The government, 1 believe, should pause at this time and carefully determine all of these points. The Ratney resolution, I still believe, should bo adopted. Believes Cromwell Could Tell More. "In view of the fact that Mr. Cromwell has shown a disposition to furnish at this time some of the important information which the Morgan committee failed to elicit from him, a fresh lnvesti gation, with Mr. Cromwell as a more willing witness, might be more fruitful of re. suits than its predecessor. "We regret that the President of the United States should so misconstrue the spirit of the editorial comment of me Indianapolis News, as is evidenced by his violent expressions in his recent communication to Mr. Foulke and in his message of yesterday. The editorial columns of tlie News have always been devoted to , the public interest, and its recognized character in this respect should save it from such abuse as the President has chosen to heap upon it. "It is hardly necessary for me to say that the character of the President's relerence to Mr. Joseph Pulitzer and the New York World is wholly unwarranted. "The World, in character and influence, I hold, is the equal of any newspaper in the United Stales. Its influence is uniformly for good government, and anything that the President may have said to tlie contrary will not alter its standing among Mr. Pulitzer's fellow journalists or the American people." C. P. Taft and Robinson Deny Any Interest in Canal Stock 

PROVIDENCE, R. I., December 16.? The Providence Journal this morning prints the following telegraphic correspondence: "Charles- P. Taft, Cincinnati, Ohio: "Will you tell the Providence Journal, for publication, whether you are now, or have been at any time in the past, a stockholder in the new or old Panama Canal Company, and whether you have ever held any shares in either company?" "THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL." "The Providence Journal. Providence, R. I.: "In answer to your query. I say that I never was at any time a shareholder in the new or old Panama Canal Company, either directly or indirectly, and have never in any way been connected with the Panama business. "CHARLES P. TAFT." The question addressed to Mr. Taft was also sent to Douglas Robinson. President Roosevelt's brother-in-law. The reply follows: "My answer to the question in your telegram is no. The statement connecting my name with the so-called Panama canal syndicate is absolutely unfounded. Inasmuch as I have not now and never had any connection with any such syndicate. I do not know whether such a syndicate exists. "It was an outrage to connect my name with what was obviously a mere fabrication for campaign purposes-." ? - # a a Useless to una Kerinea uoia, Says Cromwell About Message NEW

BALTIMORE. December 16.-After tellj ing his family he was tired of living, I August Hartung, sixty years old. a var! nislter, committed suicide Monday night j by hanging himself with a piece of clothesline to a doorknob in the bed- J room of his home, 811 North Castle street. ! He was found shortly after 2 o'clock | yesterday afternoon by his son-in-law, Mr. j Conrad Ritz. 702 Maderia street, and his daughter-in-law, Mrs. George Hartung, *UC, Durham street. Hartung, who was employed by Imvenson & Zenith, :t North Gay street, returned home to his supper Monday evening apparently In a despondent mood. He ordered his wife and other members of the family to go out until he returned from a visit to a friend. "I am tired of living." he told them, "and I do not want you around me." They say he hail told them the same thing whenever he grew despondent. Mrs. Hartung went to the home of her daughter, Mrs. Ritz, and as her husband did not call for her before midnight, she spent the night there. Another daughter went to stay with a relative for the night. Neighbors saw Hartung go in the house shortly after f> o'eloek. It is believed he got the rope and placed the noose around his nerk after lie had tied the cord to the doorknob. He was found lying against i the door when it was pulled open. For the last month, the family say, Hartung had worried a givat deal over the I disappearatu-e of a son. Charles Ifartung, | who is said to have joined the army. MARYLAND AGAINST II Dpposes Removal of Revenue Cutter Service School. VOW AT ARUNDEL COVE rransfer to Connecticut Location Proposed by Cortelyou. FORT McHENRX IS SUGGESTED Raltimnr* "WilHntr for Transfer There, as School Would Then Remain in State. The Secretary of the Treasury in hie annual report, .iust issued, recommends the removal of the revenue cutter service school if Instruction from its present loca. tlon at Arundel Cove, about seven miles from Baltimore, to Fort Trumbull, on the rhames river, near New Ixtndon, Conn. The Seeretary says the present location s undesirable because it is difficult ot access and has undesirable surroundings, rhe matter of a new location for the ichool has been given careful consideration by the department, and a number lave been examined. That considered best for the permanent location of the school is at Fort Trumbull. a military reservation under tbe [ ontrol of the War Department. The reservation contains thirteen acres, with various buildings and Improvements on it. The War Department has signified a willingness to turn it over to the revenue cutter service if Congress will authorize the transfer. Mr. Cortelyou's Recommendation. The Secretary says: "I therefore strongly recommend that the Congress authorize the transfer of Fort Trumbull to this department for t?he purpose stated. Small expense has been Incurred lu permanent improvements tor Hir? si'linnl Thoco uro n*rll 24?lrt are needed for the equipment of the depot." The proposition meets with great opposition on the part of the people of Baltimore. Maryland's delegation in Congress will try to prevent consideration of any hill allowing the army authorities to transfer Fort Turnbull to the revenue cutter service. It is' stated by the revenue cutter service officials that the location of the school is not fixed by law and that the department has power to move It to a new location at any time. The location of the school has been changed a number of times since it was established without congressional enactment. Fort McHenry Suggested. The people of Baltimore want the school to stay where it Is, and steps are to be taken to remove the objections raised by the Secretary to the present location. It has been suggested that old Fort McHenry, the bombardment of which caused Francis Scott Key to write the "Star Spangled Banner," be turned over to the revenue cutter service for the school. It is possible this proposition may be taken up seriously during the present session of Congress. It is argued that the school should be kept in the vicinity of the National capital, and the Fort McHenry site would be an admirable one for the school and one that would he acceptable to the revenue cutter service officials. The recommendation of the Secretary is only for the transfer of the school of instruction. The repair and flttlng-out station of the service, which is located at Arundel Cove, near the school of instruction, is to be left at its present location. Forty-One Students In School. Cadets at the school this session number forty-one, of whom fifteen are in the first or senior class, seven in the second class and nineteen in the third class. It Is from this school that the officers of the revenue cutter service are graduated after three years of study. On graduation they are given rank as cadets. After assignment to cruising vessels they are commissioned third lieutenants. In addition to the cadets of the line eleven young men are at the school taking the course preparatory to graduation as cadet engineers. The school is under the command of Capt. John E. Reinburg. who was stationed in the division of the service at this city for a number of years. Capt. Reinburg has for his staff First Lieut. Harry G. Hamlet, First Lieut. William J. Wheeler. Second Lleuts. William H. Munter and Thaddeus G. Crapster, First Lieutenant of Engineers John B. Turner, Second Lieutenant of Engineers L. G. Farwell and Prof. Chester E. Dimmick, A.B., A.M.
