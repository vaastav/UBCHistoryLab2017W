ffomnst?? Enterprise. ACCOMAC COURT-HOUSE, VA. SATURDAY. DKCKMBEK S, 18SS Entered at the Postoftice at Accomac C. H..Va.. as second-class matter. The claim made by the Repub? cans soon after tho election of a majority from twenty to twenty five in the House of Representa tives hi the fifty first Congress has been assuming smaller proportions daily since, until it has dwindled down to a majority ranging from three to seven. Coutrary to their predictions also, the Democrats have not attempted to steal the House, by withholding certificates of .Republicans elected in the Southern States. Their majority on the contrary is due to the elec? tion of Representatives iu the South from districts heretofore Democratic. Beaten as they have been in some'districts by apathy, indifference and by Democrats so called, who "tor personal reasons? have voted for Republicans, they have made no effort to pervert the people's will. The Republicans, tbercfoie, are in control of every branch of our Government and will be responsible ior all legislation. Antagonized as they will be, how evei'jhy astrongDemocratic uiinor ity,serious apprehensions need not be entertained that dangerous sec? tional measures introduced by them will prevail.

Accoiding to a table published by the New lurk Tribune, the lead n g Republican newspaper of the (vuiiiry, Cleveland would have been elected President by nearly one liundud thousand plurality ? ver Gen. Harrison, bad the vote uT Presto cut in November been a direc one instead of for prcsideu t nil elect ois? and t he colored voters out ol the question his plurality would have amounted to nearly a million and a quarter. Tariff re? form does not stem therefore to uave deleated Air. Cleveland. It was due to ignorance, represented by a million cbior^tl votes aud money at the command of the Re? publicans, lavishly expended in the doubtful States. Another sig nificaut fact iu connection with the vote in 1888, is that the Demo oratio increase over the Republi? can, compared with 1884,amounted to ueaily eighty thousaud votes. Virginia Republicans, it is said, will be accorded great considera? tion iu the patronage to be dis? pensed by the incoming adminis? tration, in the hope thereby of gathering the old Commonwealth into the Republican fold. The close vote in the late election, it is thought, entitles them to that con? sideration and it is needless to add that they fully appreciate the situ? ation, and stand ready to accept the loaves aud fishes which will be parcelled out to them. Prominent? ly meutioni d in that connection is ex Attorney-General Blair, of "hon or won't buy a breakfast" fame and the office cf Solicitor of the Treasury, it is said, will be his re ward for distinguished services to tbe g. o. p. The henchmen of Ma boue will be served first and until tbey are satisfied, of cuurse the more respectable Republicans ueed not apply. A joint resolution has been in trod need in the House of Repre? sentatives, providing for the elec tiou of President and Vice Presi? dent bv a direct vote of the peo? ple A The .measure, will, of course, bo opposed by the Republicans, as their success in a presidential con test depends upon a judicious use of "boodle" in the closely contested Slates?aud as they soon will be in power it will probably never be heard of again. THE HtlSIDENT'S atESJSAGE. Tai?iff lUfurii. Stroiiif'jr Ucccwm.n? cd. Washington, D. C, Decem ber 3.?Tb.? President's message was presented to Congress shortly utter that body convened today.? It is a. lengthy document, making 15S pages of letter paper. The following is an abstracto.*'its most prominent subjects: The President commences his message by reminding Congress that with the expiration of the present session tue> firs'; century of the constitutional experience of the United States as a nation will be complete. On this point he says: When theexperiment of our Government was undertaken, the chart adopted tor our guidance was tho constitution. Departure from the lines there laid down is failure. It is only by a strict ad? herence to the direction they nidi cate, and by restraint within the limitation they fix, that we can furnish proof to tho world of the titucss o* the American people for self government. The President strongly urges the necessity for tariff reduction, and calls attention to the growing pow? er of trusts, monopolies and coinbi nations of capital at the expense of the toiling masses, lie says: rlhe necessity of the reduction of utir revenue is so apparent as to be generally conceded. Put the means by which this end shall be accom? plished and the sum of direct ben etit which shall result to our citi? zens, present a controversy of the utmost importance. There should be no scheme accepted as satisfac? tory by which tho burdens of the people are only apparently re? moved. Extravagant appropria? tions of public money, with all their demoralizing consequence..-, should not tie tolerated as a means of relieving the treasury of i;s present*surplus, or as furnishing pretext, for resisting a proper re? duction in tariff rates. Existing evils and injustice should be bor? est lv recognized, boldly met and effectively remedied. There should be no cessation of the struggle un? til a plan is perfected fair and con? servative, to reward existing in? dustries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers of necessaries of life, while it prov'des for our man? ufacturers the advantage of freer raw material and permits no in jury to the interests of American labor. The cause for which the battle is waged is comprised with? in lines death and distinctly de lined. It should never be Comoro mised. It is the people's cause. On the subject ot foreign rela ticus, the Presideut reports that since his last annual message such relations have been strengthened and improved by new and re? newed treaties of amity. Refer ence is made to the fishery dispute with Canada, and to the occur? rence which resulted in his de? clining to hold intercourse with the British Minister. Referring to the subject of naturalization, the President strongly urges the re? vision of stich laws. Speaking of the surplus in the treasury tae President says: j scnrtffl Kueiu to 3*. ... excessive and unnecessary '^L*a tion is continued and the Govern? ment, is forced lo pursue this policy ?d' purchasing its own bonds at the premium winch it will be necessary to paj, the loss to the people will be hundreds of millions of dollars. Since the purchase of bonds was undertaken as mentioned nearly all that have been offered were at last accepied. It has been made quite apparent that the Government was in danger of being subjected to combinations to raise their price, as appears by-the instance men? tioned by the secretary of the treasury. The President, after giving var? ious informal ion iu reference to foreign and domestic affairs, and making numerous recommenda? tions, thus concludes his message: The consciousness that I have pre? sented but an imperfect statement of the condition of our country and iis wants occasions uo fear that anything omitted is not kuowu and appreciated by the Congress, upon whom rests the responsibility of intelligent legislation in behalf of a great nation ami a confiding peo pie. As public servants we shall do our duty well if we constantly guard the rectitude of our in ten tious, maintain unsullied our love of country and with unselfish pur? pose strive for the public good.
