S liNARCHlStS AND ALIENS^ aS|or Burrows, of Michigan, has ln Id a bill for the exclusion and de- Ion of alien anarchists that is »te in Its penalties and yet force |t» provisions. Briefly stated, it lies for the exclusion from our of anarchists, and their return to Ihome country if admitted and puri ent by imprisonment and deporta ttey return. It also pro rd of inquiry to look Into ^pected anarchists, with a reive Immigration agents Jtigations in foreign coun iig immigrants. ThiB last be a valuable aid in de status of all immigrants, fias come when there is a sentiment against the nlsslon of foreigners. It is laws are intended to vigor certain diseased and weak ome of the latter manage fir people are also inclined to Educational test. A bill has !ed by the Immigration Re lague designed to exclude Vslon to the United States .all :-r 16 years of age and physl of reading, who can not ^-^hjangiage or .some other ng an admlssable now in or here for and bring In 8, and parents or grandparents over 50, if they are other wise admlssable, whether they art- so able to read or not. Itn 1890 and 1897 the Lodge bill having this object in view was up. This bill passed the national houBe of representatives three times and the senate twice by very large majori ties, but was vetoed by President Cl ve land largely because of an amendment to the bill dealing with Canadians which was added against tb.e wishes of those in charge of the bill. The new measure to be introduced will have opposition, but It is believed congress will favor it. As to an&rchistB, the suggestions of the resolution of Senator Vest are good. He proposes an inquiry by the comnon judiciary as to the powers of congiess to deal with anarchy, to suppress the teachings of anarchy and to provide for a penal colony for convicted anarchists. None of the foreign nations will care to have anarchists returned, and a penal colony would be mora acceptable all around. The nations of the earth might well unite in establishing and maintain ing a penal colony. It would be of world-wide importance. As the anar chist believes in no government he might be given a larise dose of it on some far-away island. In case of home grown anarchists. It would seem to make such a colony necessary if thty are to be isolated from the people. THE 

RAILROAD CONTEST. Governor Van Sant is about to bring action in the federal court to prevent the consolidation of the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and the Burlington railway lines under the Northern Se curities Company of New Jersey, and an earnest contest may be expected. It is stated that the governor will begin in junction proceedings under the Sherman anti-trust law and the Interstate com merce law to prevent the proposed con solidation. Altho preparing to meet Governor Van Sant's assault, the railroad authorities do not appear to be gruatly disturbed. President J. J. Hill declares, referring to the governor and the attorney general: "I am sure that the closer these gentle men look into this matter the more thor oughly they will be convinced that the Northern Securities Company ia not de signed to evade any law of the United States or of the northwestern states." Mr. Crawford Livingston, whom the Pioneer Press avers is interested in both the Northern Pacific ancl Great North ern railroads, and is supposed to know as much as anybody who Is not official ly identified with them about the deal for placing the two roads under the con trol of a common ownership, is quoted as saying: "You may safely disabuse your mind of the idea that there is any consolidation of the roa,us. There is none. There will not be any, nor was any contemplated. Each road will be run separate and distinct, the same as heretofore. The courts settled that ques tion In the Pearsall case, and that de cision was accepted by the parties in in terest, as, of course, it would by law abiding citizens. "I have no desire to find fault with Governor Van Sant or any one else whose ideas differ from mine, but I cer tainly think he is mistaken in the posi tion he takes. In the first place there has been no change in the ownership, or perhaps more properly, (he control of the Northern Pacific and Great North ern in the last four years. It has rested for that time Just where-it does now and where it will for the next four years^ and certainly, the people and the coun try thru which these roads run have prospered almost without parallel.^ If these roads can establish their con tention that they are not violating law by their latest move, the governor can of course expect nothing but defeat, tho many will applaud his efforts to thwart what they regard as a threatening mo nopoly. 

SEEKING PRIVACY. President Roosevelt, In his message, declared that "The first eiiaentlal in de termining how to deal with the great industrial combination? is knowledge of the facta—publioity. In the interest of the public, the government should, have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations en gaged In interstate busin^se. Publicity Is the only sure remedy which we can Invoke." This Is a policy that has been repeatedly urged by others. To illus trate the need of this, it is said to be the policy of the Northern Securities Company to seek privacy. The Brook lyn Eagle, in discussing the subject, says: The contest for the control of the rail roads in the northwest haa ended in the formation of a stock-owning corporation with a capital stock of $400,000,000. It is a banking concern, something like the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. The director* of the new corporation, to be called the Northern Securities Com pany, will give its stock in exchange for the stook of the various railroads enter ing into the combination, and its direc tors, thru its control, will control the railroads. This plan has been adopted to get around the anti-trust laws. Bus iness will be done In its own way and in big corporations or little ones it te prac tically impossible to frame a statute which will interfere with this law of trade. But it le peBslble to frame a stat ute which will prevent tho granting of any franchise or charter to any corpor ation containing such a provision as ap pears in the charter of this new com pany. According to the Associated Press summary of that document, it gives to the directors power to "deter mine from time to time, where, when and how the books of the company shall be open to the stockholders." This real ly puts the control of the railroads in volved in the hands'of the directors and there need not be more than three of them. No stockholder may know any thing about the conduct of the business save as them men are willing to let him. While there is a growing demand for publicity, we have here the formation of a corporation wliowe managers are seek ing privacy. They not only propose to keep information from the public, but can keep it from those who have a right to know everything that Is going on. If James B. Hill were aware of the con tents of this charter he could not have made more pertinent comments on the importance of greater publicity in the affairs of corporations than he did make in his" Chicago address last Saturday. 

IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES. The Rockwell Phonograph notices that three hi^ndred years ago any man absent from church on Sunday was fined a shilling, and Is led to exclRlm, "What a war revenue that would pro duce today!" In referring to the fact that a farmer residing near Fontanelle, Adair coun ty, this state, sold 1,002 head of hogs the other day for $13,480.60, and 410 head of cattle for $25,542.52 net, the Keokuk Gate City declares, "When it comes to hand ling large sums of money Iowa farmers are a close second to Iowa bankers these prosperous republican times." "While the message Is vigorous," says the Mason City Globe-Gazette, "it Is conservative and lacks any grand stand features which some of the fertile news paper correspondents had promised on their motion alone but which President Roosevelt failed to second." The Dubuque Times believes "Mrs. Evelyn Belden and Mrs. Clara Bell Brown could make a hit with the legis lature by hiring a hall and debating the suffrage question to a finish before the solons assemble." In the opinion of the Auburn Record er "There is no doubt that the state is threatened with serious ravages from smallpox this winter." Washington Press: We don't want any more national holidays. They are drunken affairs. Many people can't get thru one without making fools and hogs of themselves. In Spain and Italy the numerous holy days disturb all econo mic conditions. The more work days a community has the moTe virtuous it is. The alleged "curse" of work is the world's salvation. Idleness is the foun tain of vice. Discussing the duties of congress the Council Bluffs Nonpareil says: "Fortu nately the demand for new legislation does not arise so much from a discon tent at existing conditions as from the eagerness to have these oonditlons made still better. There is not such an out cry for doing away with existing evils as for getting Increased blessings. Were there nothtnfc to lose but everything to gain, the present congress would find less perplexity for it could then afford to take great chances. The cry now Is not 'anything for a change,' but the desire is to have such changes only as will ena ble the nation to hold to all that it, has of good and to add to it as much as pos sible." The Sioux City Tribune cautiously asks, "Are there any more assistant democrats to slide back Into the grand old party." Shenandoah has an anti-spitting ordi nance, but the Sentinel doubtingly ob serves that "It remains to be seen whether it will be enforced. Some of the skeptical ones say that it will be a dead letter Just like some other ordinances." "Not only in thought and pertinency, but in literary style, the president's message is a model paper, declares the Burlington Hawkeye. 

TIMES OF THE TOPICS Probably tho reason why the north pole hasn't been discovered Is because pierpont doesn't seem to want the old thing. President Roosevelt's first message to congress Is universally praised at the national capital. It Is regarded as an able state paper, conservative In Its recommendations and free from any suspicion of partisanship. Hry With a fall of snow this locality has finally taken on a wintry appearance. Reports to the "World's Work" for November, from booksellers and li braries In 24 of the leading cities, still keep "The Crisis" at the head of the most popular book" list. On the deal ers' list, "D'rt and I" holds second place with "Capt. Ravenshaw" as third, and "Eternal City" In fourth place. On the librarian's' list, "The Helmet of Na varre" occupies second place, with "Eben Holden" as third, and "Alice of Old Vincennes" in fourth place. The Den Moines, Iowa Falls & North ern railroad is being: rapidly trans formed from the paper stage to iron rails, with the prospect that thirty-five miles will be In operation this winter. In order to encourage marriage in Ser vla all young persons with at least 2,000 dinars (a dinar is equal to 18 cents) in the government savings banks were un til recently presented upon their wed ding day with a handsome premium from the bank directors. The conse-, quence was that all these young people upon reaching the age of 18 hastened to marry. The divorce frequently followed as soon as the money was run thru. As there is thus no chance of the expected Increase in the population the generous premium has been withdraw n, According to the Times-Herald more than $30,000,000 is demanded from tho city of Chicago for personal Injuries on account of defective sidewalks. The biggest verdict ever obtained against the city was that of $10,000 in favo: of Mrs. Mary J. Bleakly, 3619 Morgan street, who broke several ribs and suf fered internally. "The city has no money to repair sidewalks," said Mayor Harrliion. "All it can do is to barricade a bad place. The property owner builds the sidewalk, but unfortunately the city is responsible for accidents. The board of local improvements is hurylng up sidewalk improvements, but gtrening Ttnws-ltejmliltem, TOarslrallteum ^rrunr, Thuisdag, Jacemter 3, 1901 it has always to meet the opposition of property owners, who think they can not afford to pay for their shar« of the expense. The $32,000,000 of suitr against the city are possibly not worth $300,000. but they are there and the city will always be liable until rotten sidewalks are replaced." In speaking of American greed, Ar thur Pendenys says Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan wants to bring over the Boer war, and transfer It as a show to Chi cago, to be managed by Buffalo Bill. The state of Georgia, now one of the few states In the south which have not adopted disfranchising methods for re ducing the vote of the colored citizens by constitutional provision, has under consideration the calling of a constitu tional convention for the submirfrion of a new suffrage amendment to the vot ers. At present the Georgia method of excluding colored voters from the fran chise is by the enforcement of a poll tax. Georgia is one of the states (New York and Masachusetts are two others) which adhere to annual sessions of the legisla ture, and that of Georgia convened this year on Oct. 16 at Atlanta. A statute disfranchising the colored voters with out recourse to the constitution has been defeated. The following book titles are found In a London bookseller's orders: "Re public of Flats" (Republic of Plato) "Pharaoh's Life of Christ" (Farrar's Life of Christ) "Birth and Growth of Worms" (Birth and Growth of Worlds) "Rivers Frozen, Silent Gold and Un steeped Lands" (Rev. Frazer's Silent Gods and Sunsteeped Lands) "Boy, Muscle and Peas" (Bog, Myrtle and Peat). Brigadier General Harry M. Roberts, U. S. A., retired, has gone to Gal veBton, Tex., having been appointed by the commissioners of that city to su perintend the plans for the protection of the city from the sea In severe storms. J.':.- The building boom in Chicago contin ues to exedte Interest, despite the fact that winter Is on. It is declared that building ventures stand uncompleted or not begun because the supply of compe tent laborers is not equal to the demand. The 6,000 members of the Hod Carriers and Building Laborers' Union are all at work. On the Marshall Field building alone 500 men are busy, and on a few other structures combined 300 or more hod- carriers, mortar mixers and helpers are engaged. These facts alone show un usual activity in building. According to a citizen of Bohemian birth, now a resident of Chicago, the name of Jan Kubellk, the renowned Bohemian violinist, who is about to make a tour to this country, Is pro nounced Koobeleek, with accent on the first syllable. In his Washington correspo'hSeVice Walter Well man says: Western busi ness men who have for years persist ently advocated tjie establishment of a department of commerce and industry are likely to tfce their work bear fruit during the present fiscal year. Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, chairman of the committee on commerce, has practical ly completed a bill for the establish ment of the new department, and i» confident that it will be passed during the present congress. It Is essentially the bill he presented last year, there being a few minor changes. The bill will be referred to the committee for consideration and he promises an early report and prompt action In the sen ate. It Is the purpose of the friends of the bill in congress to secure its en actment into law in time to enable tha establishment of the new department by the first of next July. Emperor William of Germany has re cently issued an order authorising offi cers of the navy to wear beards. This is construed as a hint for all offlcere to do so, as it often pleases his eccen tric majesty to indicate his wishes indireotly in such a manner. Hence every naval officer has put away his razor and allows the hair to grow on his face. ... v'.v: .i:': The census returns give a million more women than men in the British islands, and still, an ungrateful English government prosecutes Earl Russell for bigamy.

There are now 5,358 such libraries, as against 4,0026 in 1896, and 44,591,857 volumes as against 3,051,872, an increase of nearly 85 per cent in the number of books.

BENJAMIN ANDREWS, LL. D„ Editor. The National Period of American Literature BT LORENZO SEARS, LIT, D., Profttsor of American Literature in Hrwn Unlv*rtity. iMMMt The newspaper was as yet limited to a fractional part of its present scope and circulation. The town meeting, the campaign assembly, the state legisla ture, the house of representatives and the senate chamber were the progres sive steps in the political education of statesmen who in those days listened to the words that were spoken, having no "organ" laid upon their desks each morning to guide them In the formation of their daily opinions and prin ciples.' The man who In those years aspired to Influence his fellow citizens and legis lators had to depend upon his speech in all the comprehensive meaning of the term, Including his intellectual attainments as well as his personal power with an audience. As a consequence, the orator's art became one of the ambitions of a public man, more easily acquired then by reason of its general prevalence and the inheritance from preceding generations. Congressional oratory may conveniently be said to begin with the opening of the century, when in 1800 John Randolph was sent to congress. It was fitting that the traditional eloquence of the south should be continued by this ambitious though eccentric Virginian. He cannot be called a man of peace, being usually, as was once said, "in opposition to the exercise of authority by anybody but himself." This disposition fostered a denunciatory habit of speech which easily ran into invective and sometimes malediction. It was stormy sort of eloquence, enjoyed, no doubt, by sympathizing colleagues more than by opponents, Still, it is said that his speeches -were read more generally than those of any other member of congress. Bvents that were to take place half a century later appear to have been foreseen by this ill boding but true prophet, yet what he dreaded as a "coalition of knavery and fanaticism" finally Issued in the united devotion of all parties and sections to a common country. He could predict the incidental calamity, but could not see the ulti mate restoration. Nevertheless he left on record one phase of oratory, and if it is somber and even violent at times its counterpart can be found wherever an ardent and courageous soul has met evils that threatened disaster. The name of Henry Clay recalls a career which was prominent and con tinuous for nearly half a century. It was too pronounced in its statesmanship not to elicit a variety of testimony yrith regard to his political aims, but as in all such cases the truth lies midway between extremes. With respect to his eloquence, however, the tributes of contemporaries are more concordant. It was for Its kind unsurpassed, and, considering the advantages of education and training of which he was deprived, it was phenomenal. The son of a Bap tist minister who left him the best inheritance that can be transmitted to a youth of political ambitions, a good voice and impressive delivery, the young lawyer, who had received his academic education in a log cabin school and his graduate course in a grocery store, began professional life as clerk in a chan cery court After four years of recording decisions he was granted license to practice in Richmond, where he established a school of oratory in the form of a debating club. At the age of twenty-one he opened an office in Lexington, Ky., and was soon full of business and on the highroad to politics. His ora torical ability helped him to win a contest where biB opponent's speech was followed by deafening applause, but his own by profound and impressive silence. From 1800 to 1811 he was in the house of representatives or the sen ate at Washington, where he continued, with short interruptions, until he was seventy-three. Cotifse. VIII.—Three Southern Orators. N this period, as in the colonial, some of Its best literature was spoken. It does not much mat ter whether the preliminary composition was made with pen and ink, wholly or in part, or whether the words flowed unwritten from a mind that had pondered long upon the subject, or whether in their final form they were the result of correction and revision. The version which has been accepted and approved by the speaker or in some instances by bearers and contemporaries is what must abide the tests of literary value. The oratory which had become a prominent feature of intellectual life be fore the war for independence and up to the adoption of the constitution re ceived a new impulse when this instrument came to be the rule of the national administration. It was a rule which was new to all and not a favorite with many. Those who had made concessions could not forget what they had sur rendered. There was room for varied and diverse interpretation of rights and privileges. In particular the powers which belonged to the original colonies before there was cither federation or union wore the cause of much dispute, and when a union of these separate and sometimes discordant provinces was agreed upon and established by the constitution a vast amount of definition and discussion followed. And so with respect to home and foreign policies and the conflicting Interests of different sections of the country. All this had to be brought into the sessions of the people's representatives and those of each state assembled In congress, where deliberative oratory followed as a matter of course. It would have been strange if this had not been of a high order, consider ing the antecedents of eloquence in this country and the examples of It in tha British parliament easily accessible In the reported speeches of illustrious orators. In the first quarter of the century and later oral discourse was the principal means of political instruction. The people had been trained to listen by two or three sermons and lectures a week for two centuries, and a cor responding education had been given by practice In the pulpit and at the bar to a race of speakers. r.- Of necessity his oratory was political and deliberative, but it had an hon esty and a sincerity that carried somewhat of his own convictions to all who heard him speak. Off the lines of these strong convictions he could not be elo quent. Along that line he was very able to Inspire others with his own fear less sentiments and hopeful expectations. Even his opponents were ready to acknowledge the straightforward honesty of his speech. This was clear in statement and addressed to the common sense of bis hearers. His own ante cedents favored such sympathetic knowledge of their limitations, and he made himself understood by the average man. Whea his speeches passed into printed pages, they necessarily lost much of the personal power which went with the magnetic orator, but they have the conservative element which makes them oratorical literature. They bear well the test of much rehearsing in the schools and of frequent reading by the stu dent of eloquence and of our political history. The issues are dead which called them forth, but so are those which have from time to time inspired the loftiest utterances of greatest speakers, from the Attic age to that In which Henry Clay and his compeers lived. Their eloquence is embalmed each in Its own language and is an important element in the literature of the nations. The name of John C. Calhoun is naturally recalled next to that of Henry Clay. A graduate of Tale college in 1804 and subsequently a law student in Litchfield, he cultivated extemporary speaking with great diligence and suc cess. Perhaps as a consequence be was elected to the legislature of bis native South Carolina upon his return home and to congress after he had been but nine years out of college. Questions arising out of the war of 1812, the na tional bank, tariff and nullification and finally of slavery, successively occu pied his attention. It was a stormy period, when the republic was adjusting Itself to sectional differences of policy, which were not diminished by diver sity of opinion between political leaders. But this very antagonism called out the utmost resources of party chiefs and patriots. The battle had to be fought by oral discussion before the people first as the source of power and then be fore their representatives and the executors of their will. It was before the legislative rather than the popular assembly that Calhoun was at his best. He was more severely logical than impassioned, dignified rather than inspiring. If his premises were accepted, escape from his conclu sions was ditlcult, and there was no suspicion that he was not sincere in his convictions. His earnestness conveyed these to other men with undiminished force. His generalizations were bold and even reckless at times, and his exag gerations were often absurd, as is the case with most orators when overmas tered by their purpose. It was then that he became most eloquent. But often est it was the qualities of solidity, breadth and clearness that chiefly prevailed. A natural logician of analytic temper, he could make his own position strong while exposing the weak points of an adversary's position. Discussing the relations between cause and effect, be was quick to see combinations which were effective and advantageous. In the manner and method of hit speech he was direct thoughts were well arranged In his mind, and his resources were at ready com mand. They usually gathered around a few simple propositions. He often began in a modest and quiet way, but grew loud and shrill in voice and in tensely energetic in action as his subject moved him. It was not like the ora tory of a southern speaker so much as of the logical Scotch race from which he descended. But the causes he advocated had need of demonstrative argu ment more than the ardor of advocacy and the adornment of Imagery. In con gress he had to deal with men in whom the reasoning powers were not lacking and to meet them on their own ground. It is interesting after the lapse of two-thirds of a century to observe bow far these statesman prophets divined truly the outcome of the contests in which they engaged. It Is evident that they bad many forebodings for the future, but these were always connected with nonconformity to their own political precepts. As this was common even in their own day, there were many gloomy predictions on all sides. The conviction of coming disaster grew stronger and more widespread, but when It came it was not exactly in the manner or for the reason most frequently and publicly assigned by the orators thus far mentioned. The closer they kept to the enunciation of general princi ples and general predictions the nearer they were to the final event. When they befan to particularize, they failed, like all modern prophets, but the prophecies themselves were sublime and eloquent and a noble part of the literature of the country. They dealt with great and vital themes and In their composition and utterance were worthy of the vast questions which th$y discuised. (Oopjrlfht, IMA.]: '-t and plain. US€# ""V- ably.
