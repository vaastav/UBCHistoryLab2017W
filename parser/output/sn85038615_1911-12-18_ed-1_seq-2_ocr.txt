President Taft's message, although expected to be read In executive ses? sion, probably will be made public at once. This was the plan of several of tho Senate leaders to-night. They declnre that the country sbould be tully Informed of tho gravity of the eltuatlon and of tho danger of pre? cipitate action. Congress is scheduled to adjourn tor tho Christinas holidays on Thursday next. In view of this an effort will be made to have the Senate finally dis? pose of the matter to-morrow. This undoubtedly would carry the session well into the evening, for a stormy liebste Is anticipated. it the Senate pg-jses a formal resolution of abroga? tion it undoubtedly will be referred Immediately to the House, und little i rouble is expected in obtaining an agreement to it. The language of the Sulzer resolution, which declared that Russia has violated the treaty of li>A' ln refusing to hone: passports in the hands of American citizens <>l Jewish faith, undoubtedly' wilt be vigorously defended by many of these who voted for it. but in the end the. House Is expected to acquiesce in the Senate view. In fact, sonic of the liousu leader's declared lo-hlght that with President Tatt threatening to take matters entirely Into his own hands, It vas essential that Congress should meet his views and deal with the mat? ter diplomatically.

If abrogated In the terms ol the Sulzer resolution, It wus said, .Mr. Taft takes the ground that the United States- might Just as well abandon hope of ever negotiating an pther treaty with the Russian em-1 pire. Representative sulzer to-day prophe? zeit that the Senate would pass the resolution by a vote as nearly unani moua as that by which it passed the lower branch. Mr. Sulzer was one of the speakers at u mass-meeting ar i ingcd under the auspices of tho United Hebrew Societies of Washing? ton td advocate the abrogation of the treaty. His prediction was indorsed by Senator Polndextcr, of Washington; Representatives Murray, of Massachu? setts; Kendall, of Iowa,'and Dyer, of aissourl, No Formal Protest Made. St Petersburg, December IS.?The Russian foreign ofllce declares that M. Bakhmeteff. the Russian ambas? sador at Washington, has made no forthal protest against the abrogation ot the Russo-Amerlcan treaty of lh'i'-. Dispatches from Washington nn riouncing that tentative efforts to reach nn agreement on the passport ques? tion are going on, were published here yesterday morning and appeared again In the newspapers of last evening and this morning, unaccompanied by com? ment of any nature. With respect to these negotiations, the foreign ofllce has nothing to say, considering that tli' responsibility for the reports, which are of a divergent nature, rests oh those who send them. The semi-official Rossla. prints a signed article by the editor, who de clares against restrictive laws and in ftvor of the abolition of the pale. "Pro-government Russians," he says, "cannot confine themselves to attacks upon Jews nor senselessly repeat the I saying 'the Jews will ruin Russia." Tho Jews have not ruined Polish or little Russian cities and they won't ruin j Russia, either. "The solution of the question, ' which Is the most Important question I now facing the government of Russia,) cannot bo deferred eternally. We can- I not leavo millions of people to ronst I In their own Juice. The pale is a low I economical state, dreadful In Its sani- I tary conditions. If Russia has too i many Jews she must assist In their (?migration, but the possibility of oml-! gration Is restricted by measures adopted by the British and American povernr.ients, and would be further diminished by the abrogation of the treaty of 1S32." j TOM

ROOSEVELT "BLOCKS TRAFFIC Some One ShouU "There's Teddy," and . * Great Crowd Outhern.

I Somebody shouted "There's Teddy, i and in a moment he was surrounded by I? throng that grew larger as the col ' onel strode along Fourteenth Street, looking for a taxienb. When two po 1 licemen forced their way Into the crowd I to tlnd out what the trouble was, the colonej good naiuredly explained, and they held up a passing automobile. It was a private machine, and tho lono driver was for going on until the col? onel took a hand In the conversation himself. Menntime a trolley ear had conic to a stop behind the automobile. "Hoy, you!" tho motornmn shouted to the ex-President, "run your blamed ma? chine up against the curb If you want to get In. Don't you know anything? Get off tho trnck!" With a grin for an answer, Mr. Hoosevolt hopped Into tho tonncan, and the mr.chlno bolted off amid tho cheers ot tho crowd. Coionel Roosevelt's speech at the La? bor Templo was mainly of a religious character. "I bcljevo In a living church." said the colonel, "but not In a religion that docs not translate ltsoir Into nctlvltles for decency for tho masses. The worst thing that can bo cast on any church Is that as the pop? ulation becomes dense tho church moves out. The church should fight for the masses.

Both Sides Scoff at Rumor Plea of Not Guilty Will Be Changed. Boston, December 17.?There is still a lingering doubt in the minds of some people who are In a position to be In? formed us to tho correctness of the now popular belief that tho Rev. Clarence V. T. Richoaon will bo placed on trlul January 16 for the alleged murdor of Miss Avis Llnncll. Though It is true this date has been tlxed upon for the commencement of what prom? ises to be as hard fought a murdor trial as any held In Massachusetts ?dYing recent years, and Judge George A. Sanderson assigned to preside. It Is predicted in some quarters something is going to turn up which will cause a postponement. if the venire Is Is? sued tor the Jurors, then there will bo no question raised In the mind of any one about Rlcheson coming to trlul on the duto set, but this need not be done until after the first of the year. Both the government und the de? fense in this case declare that any cumpromluu Is out of the question; that either Richesun is guilty or not guilty of murder, und .tn.u the ruiVor of a second degreo plea of guilty Is wholly the product of somo one s im? agination. Such a plea will not be accepted by the government attorneys or offered by the lawyorB for the clergyman, so they assert. It is well understood there will be dllllculty In securing twelve unbiased mon to hear the evidence in this cuse. One has dllllculty to-day In locating a person who does not have a positive belief in cither the Innocence or guilt of tho young clergyman. Almost a precedent will be established for Mass? achusetts by the speed with which Rlcheson will face tho accusation. When the Impaneling of tho Jury be? gins on January 10 it will be approxi? mately throe months to a day from October 14, the dute upon which Avis Llnncll died of cyanide poisoning. Meantime it is said a capsule filled with while powdur and a souvenir postcard written by Mlas Llnncll are to figure prominently among the ex? hibits to be oilerod by the prosecution. .Tho capsule was found in Mr. Riehe son's desk at his room in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank II. Carter, 147 Magazine Street, Cambridge. Mass., and the postcard, together with a volume of other correspondence, was among tho properly of the accused preacher which the police seized when they ransacked his lodgings. They carried off books, manuscripts and other personal effects suilleient to load a van, which wltti Captains Armstrong and McGarr as guard, waa driven to tho courthouse In I'cmberton Square. Tho confiscated property Is now hold by tho prosecution as evidence and Is stored In a room on the mcssanine landing. John R. Leo and Beverly R.
