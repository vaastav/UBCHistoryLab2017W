The movement of our vut armies, the neir np UWah of (he 1st of January, and the panic and weariness of the Southern people, have fairly compelled the foremost re!el leaders to offer to come buk to the Union, provided the Govern ment will allow them to do so and 'wume their old BUM) in the councils of the reuuited nation. 1 "',vc 11 rom l"e mot undoubted authority that this matter has not only !een brought to the iitiptitinn ol the Government, but has been can vaged for upward of two week- pist by the lead in s4,c,ioll symDilhiiera and Democratic poli- ticians at the North. Fernando Wood, in his speech in your citv last Saturday evening, stated tat was really true, tha", he had receive! com- -i e D:l J i l 1 - - mil n m in i irom munition', i.uu ihu i r.i ii-iuiiiru them to the Government heie.

Benjamin, who handed h'm letters aildresed to Gov Sevmour, of New York, Fer nando and Ben. Wood, Yallandiham and Cox, of Ohio. Senator Bayard, of Delaware, Keverdy Juhnsan. of Maryland, and a number ol oilier noted Democratic leaders in the North and in the Border Slates. In the verbal ins' ructions piven to Dr. Barney, no terms were asked lor. Tbe Southerners told him they would consent to no terms, that if not admitted into the Union again as equals, they would not come in at all What they ak is the granting of an amnesty to all the military and civil leaders of the rebellion. n tfxlitm for members of 0 1 fill can , mmJe dupi the ctmlUi, wluer lh;it b(,tlv be t.;lliej toelher llt least as earlv as April", Wjlh ()e Democratic gains in the late ,.. ia ,hl. i !omro, )e 9mm :lId ,, t))ev offer to let the terms of settlement between the two sections be m ide by that Congress. They say tl.y will never consent to any teims that the Henublicaii t arty, now in power, can offer. A settlement, however, in which they will have a controlling voice, in the next Congress, they are willing to abide by. Dr. Barne h .d an interview with lioth Secre tary Seward and 1'iesidei.t Lincoln as soon its be returned to Washington, and, according to his own story, the-e officials dc i to consider the matter in the shatie in which he presented it to ! them. He has since that time visited New York lor the purpose of seeing and conversing with John Van Buren, the Woods, and Gov Se mour. The plan now is to briim the matter before the country at as early a period as possible, so as to cieate a public opinion in tavor ol the auioelv asked lor bv the rebel leaders. It must be uu- der - tood that this whole matter h is been engi neered from Richmond, and there is reason tor believing that the recent proposal for an armistice asked for by the Emperor Napoleon hag a rela tion to this robe! scheme, and was cm ; to act with it so as to affect Northern sentiment, and force the President into the policy laid out be lorehand by Jeff D.vis and his advisers. This matter has been laid before the various representatives of tlie foreign powers at Wash inot.,n, and they state so Dr. Barney a.iys that the relu4al to grant an nmiKsly, so h lo bring about an eventual restoration of the Uuion, would set the whole world against Mr. Lincoln, and lead almost immediately to some action on the part of France, either to recognise the South, or bie.k the blockade, or both. Dr. Barney makes no secret of what the ic !- propose to lo iti the event of their being permitted again to control the majority in Congress. They propose to consolidate the Northern and Southern debts; to give France peremptory notice to quit Mexico; to seize that country, miking more slave States, and to adopt the line of 36 .leg 30 min . Iielow which they say all luture acquisitions must come in as slave Slates. The recent remarkable ar iU : L:..i a v : ..r .... o.i.

This matter has come to the knowledge of leading Republicans in Washington, who. of course, scout at it as being entirely impracticable. Thev have no notion, after all the blood and treasure wasted in the pieset.t war, of allowing the rebels to gain a victory by diplomacy, which they luve been unable to do in the field. A union in the manner they Indicate, lliey contend, would mean not only the perpeiuation of slavery in this country, but would practically place the free North at the mercy of the slaveholding South. The best Republican authorities agree in believing that the rebels hive ready no wish to come back; that their object in this shrewd j maneuver is to divide the .sentiment of the North and embarrass the action of the Administration. They think it would be a plausible story to come betöre the c-ountr that the Sourw te.dlv wishes to 1 come back, and merely asks for a suspension of eletti((h uf men)ters u( Cow, the real effect ot which would be to save them from the eman cipation proclamation, and the havoc our armies will soon create in the slaveholding States. ty-The following comes from a correspond ent connected with Gen. Grant's army: On Sunday last news came to the Chaplain of the regiment th it a good Union soldier was given up by his Surgeon, considei el In Si dying enndirfhn. and desired spiritual consolation. 1 he Chaplain, as in duty bound, went to see him, sit down by his cot, and talked of death and the resurrection, and finally opened the B ble at nut dorn lo r ad . chapter for the dying man's conso iation. The lKok opened at the account of Samson's slaying so many Philistines with the jaw bone of an asa. At the conclusion the soldier asked wir it book he read that from. The Chaplain replied, "My dying friend, it is the WSftW of (od." The soldier requeued him to read it anain. and at its conclusion to see the b .k and re id the chapter himself. The Chaplain hmded him the Bible, when he exclaimed, "Oh, dear! my eyes are so dim I can't read; but tell me. Chaplain, honestly, isn't Oeu. John Tope's name signed at the bot tom of that chapter?" The District .1 n tl a l I p . The Washington correspondent o; the Cin cinnati Gazettt writes: It may now le positively stated that Secretary Smith has finally decided on leaving the Cab met about the lt of Januarr, with the dis- tinct understanding that he shall receive the vacant Judgeship in Indiana. It is well under stood that the President would appoint Schuyler Colfax, if he desired it, but he will not accept. It is not believed now that any Indianiaii will get Smith's place, and Holt, of Kentucky, a ems to have the inside track. ZW As an indication of how the soldiers feel in regard to the late elections, we give the result of the vote taken in one company from Clay and this county, to express their sentiments. The coropniy is stationed at Henderson, Kv. When the news reached the boys that Dan. Voorhees was elected, a number of them shouted for jov, which provoked their Captain, who said that a majority of his company were opposed to him. This waa disputed. A vote was then taken, which resulted in 71 for Dm, and 19 for Scott. This made the Captain quite angry, and he swore that there were more scesionisu in Indiana than in Kentucky.

The names secitied appear only in the certificate of release furnished by Colonel Dimmick, while the order of the Department only mentions in general terms "all the Maryland St ile prisoners" and, so that none may beover looked in this act of amnesty, "urtu oihtr State j prisoners" iu the custody ol the Commandant, i We infer fiom this, that as these gentlemen weie arrested without warrant and have been held in prison w ithout law, so no record of their names even, much less any spec IflcM ion of their m putd offenses, has been kept at the War Depart ment. We must say that this scents to us a very irresponsible way of doing public business; and none the less so, that among the gentlemen re leased are persons of not a little social distinction and public consideration for instance, th late Ma or of Baltimore, and vaiious members of the Man lud Legislature, who were seized aud in carcerated when that IxhIv was broken up by the violent action of the Administration, more than a year ago We have understood that the arrest iu question was then made by order of one of Mr Lincoln's Secretaries, without the know ledge ot the others, or of the President; and also that at the verv time reports were in preparation by committees of both branches of the Legislature, showing the unconstitutionality ot ecesiou, which would undoubtedly have been accepted by the Legislature, had no such extraordinary inter ference been had with that assembly. lu const ipience of that action, however, these gentlemen have now been imprisoned luring this I '""ii pci.ou, -uu it .asi, mtrir prison uoors are ., n.

The oDeniur of Cotiirresa and the President's Message, were the leaning events of the week, and exerted a disturbing influence on the Quiet wnicn nas so long prevailed in nnanciai matters. The recommendation d the President, of a Na tional currency based upon the deposit of Gov ernment stocks, produced great sensation amongi o; bankers at the E iat, and caused an advance osW1' 2)fo per cent, iu gold and silver, ant" of 4 per cent, in demand lotcs. Stocks also advanced mH.eri.illy, and things w ere generally excited and unsettled in New York yesterday. The demand for money has been good, but the market is easy for good piper at 610 per cent , the latter the prevailing rate. Exchange has been steady all the week at the last quotations, the demand and the supply being about equal.

The weather has been cool, with slight frosts and some rain, aud on the whole quite favorable for pork packing. Hogs have arrived freely, and met. on the whole, with a demand aoout equd to the re ceipts until Monday and yesterday, when a de dine of fully 2i)($25c was established. The Houses packing on fjreign account have bought treely, and with little or no intermission, and boxed meats for the English markets are being shippeJ largely, but the aggregate shipments are slightly behind those of last year at this date. The average weight ol the hogs which have been bi ought in the past week is better than it has been previously, and is a lull one, though not as great as it was last year; bu'. it must be remembered that ho'.'s last year weie unusually large and fat, and the weight far above the u-ual average. There are coutinued complaints regarding the yield of lard, and iu many cases it is stated th it it will fall off one third as compare! with last year, but the hogs now arriving are yielding more lard than those which were first brought in.

No new mess oflerinir. nor do we know of any demand fur it. Probably not 1,0'K) barrels have tieen packed in this city so tar the prevent season.

Her remsin were interred on Ute farm of rsc fstaar, ta res taaairy hvrtaf frtsaad a fa i i i Tke Cause f ike Arrewl.w It appears that the article in the Ledger upon which Gen. Rosecrans based his request to Gen. Wright lor the arrest of tbe editor of tbe New Albany Ledger was one published on tbe 2Jih ult . giving tbe numbers of tbe brigades and di- visions to which the various Indiana regiment In Gen. Rosecracs' army were attached. It waa Dot originally published in the Ledger, having ously appeared in another paper, tbe form only being changed in transferring it to the columns oi the Ledger. We presume it was furnished i the paper from which we copied by the Indiana Military Agency at Louisrille, with the benevolent and praiseworthy object of informing the families and friends of the soldiers in Gen. Rosecrans' arrav aa to the proper direction they should give their letters. Most certainly we never dreamed of such information being considered contraband, nor, we believe, did those who, before us, prepared it and gave it publicity. Nor can we see of what advantage such information would be to the enemy. It did not profess to give a full list of brigades or di visions, but only named such as had Indiaua regiments in them, with the only object, as we have said, of informing the friends of the sol diers as to the manner of directing their let ters. We will venture to sty that not a single reader ot the Ledger imagined, when reading it, that it was improper. Those of our political enemies (tor the sake of human nature we hope they are few in num ber) who were gloating over our supposed arrest and probable incarceration, will be perhaps some- i what mortified to learn that the real offender, if j any offense has been committed, is a leading edi tor oX their own party. 1 hat editor, however, is an honorable man, and would scorn lo wreaks petty vengeance on another on account of polit ical differences. Like ourselves, he believed he was doing a service to our gallant soldiers by in forming their friends as to the manner of com muuicating with them, never dreaming that be was doing something which would render him liable to a trial by court martial for a high of fense. Published on the border, and having thousands of readers with friend in tbe army, the public naturally look to the Ledger for the latest army news. We have rndeavored to guard our col umns against contraband information, but it is possible some things may have slipped in which ought not to have been published. If so, we re gret it. We feel deeply grateful for the sympathy of that vast majority who condemned as uncalled tor and unjust this attempt to single out the edi tor of the Ledger ns an object of military vcu geance. To the few narrow minded partisans who rejoiced at our supposed misfortune, we en ter'.aiu no feelings but those of pity and con tempt. New Albany Ledger ANNOUNCEMENTS.
