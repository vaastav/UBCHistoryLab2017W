Congress is again in session and the j president's message Is the principal news from the national capital. There is no disappointment in the message; it is a strong state paper. President Roosevelt has not been hiding his opin Ions on public questions under a bushel j and the people have been reasonably i certain of what the message would contain for its salient points, and tlieir expectations have been met. For many months the trend of news from the national capital has been to j the effect that the railroad question ■would be the paramount issue of the annual message. There are those in and out of the republican party who would favor radical changes in the tariff schedules but the attitude of the administration has clearly shown that there were weightier questions in the balance than the question of tariff schedules. The key note of the president's dis cussion of the railroad question is fed eral supervision of all corporate in terests. He makes it clear that he does not seek government interference of private affairs except to regulate public abuses. The president is no enemy of the corporations. There Is no populism in his attitude. The lines that he has marked out will never lead to govern ment ownership nor any other of the socialistic ends. He believes in the corporation as a power for good, but since the corporation is powerful and Its interests in the hands of selfish men, may be used to the injury of the people, he argues for some effective power of corporate supervision. This power should be lodged in the government which represents the people as a whole, and is a sovereign strong enough to control the corporations. The corpora tion is a fixed factor of national growth and development. It has come to stay and the government has no desire to usurp its powers. The president makes this point clear and seeks only for au thority to check abuses. The tenor of the message is far re moved from the hysteria that many people have been proposing to deal with the Interests of the big corpora tions. The president emphasizes his ■doctrine of a "square deal." It is to the interest of the best type of railroad men, for the best type of shipper, no less than of the public that there should be government supervision and regulation of this great corporate in terest. It is the square deal and the high moral influence of the doctrine that the message emphasizes, and the tone of it is far removed from frenzy, and will appeal strongly to all classes. If the railroads hoped th would fall into the error of an intem perate attack lipon their corporate in terests. they have been mistaken. The ground taken is in accord with sound business Judgment and some beneficial legislation will probably result as the work of the present session. THE RED MAN NOT A 

FARMER The best commentary on the Indian ns a farmer as deduced from the report from the rentals of Indiaft lands pub lished In this issue is that the Indian Is not a farmer and except in rare in stances never will be. He does not care to take the initiative nor the re sponsibility. The Indian does not ob ject to making hay while the sun shines but he takes no pride in its being his own hay. and he is still farther re moved from the desire to work contin uously and consecutively from the seed time to the harvest. He is several gen erations yet removed from labor as a means of preparation for ttie future, work for the thrift that lays up some thing for a rainy day. His work is in termittant and irregular, a forced and unnatural condition the result of stern necessity and not of choice. The idle* leisure of an Idle race still runs riot In his blood, and except In rare In stances will for many generations yet to come. Inexcusable as It may seem. 58 people have been killed by Los Angeles street ■cars, and 430 injured in 23 months. One would infer that it were safer to walk than to patronize Los Angeled trolley •cars. "An Unmuzzled Republican Paper" is the black-type motto at the head of the editorial column of the Council Ad vance. L. S. Cool is editor. There is often much in a name, and in this in stance, may his tribe increase. president j O

COOOOOOOOCOODOOOOOOOOOOOOO O RAILROAD'S SIDE OF THE QUESTION. From "Railroad Rebates," by Ray Stannard Baker, in the December McClure's. 00000<XXXXXXXXXXX530<X)00000 If a man is too conscientious to pay rebates and break the law at the de mand of Armour or of Pabst of Mil waukee, be is eliminated and a less honest han takes his place—a man who is willing to make terms with his con-, science, to "do as the Romans do," or fine some shady device that can lie fur nished up by the legal department to look lawful. The railroad man, in deed, makes a pretty strong case for himself, showing that he is the victim of his own defenselessness which the shrewd trust shippers well know. I quote from an excellent address by J. W. Gleed, an attorney for the 'Frisco system, "A railroad must have tonnage; herein lies its weakness and defense lessness. It is an investment that cah never produce but one commodity, namely, transportation, and that com modity must be consumed where the railroad lies. It cannot be stored in July to be sold in November. Its In vestment is permanent and the ex penses run on, traffic or no traffic. Bankrupt though it becomes, its wheels still turn in desperate hope: and the worse its financial plight the more reckless and dangerous Us competition. Most western roads could carry twice their present tonnage, with compara tively slight increase of total annual expense. In this fact lies the great weakness and temptation of a railroad. A railroad man says: T can sell this one shipper transportation at a frac tion of a cent a ton and yet not be out anything, because I can easily pro duce more transportation.' " James J. Hill, undoubtedly the fore most railroad man in the country tu day, said ^acently in an interview "As the raatter now stands and has stood for a number of years the prac tice of rebates lias enabled the big shippers to hold a club over the rail roads. The more tills question is studied, the more it will be found that after all, ttie railroads need some pro tection." It Is hardly surprising, then, with this natural weakness of the railroads, combined with the greedy demands of great shippers, that traffic morals have come to lie so easy in this country. And yet, when the public says to the railroad man. as It is saying now, "see here, you are the victims of your own property and of the greed of powerful shippers; let us pass laws that will arm us both against the predatory trusts." the railroad man takes wild alarm, fearing that Ills power and his profits in some way will be lessened. But until the present methods of con spiracy-breeding secrecy and wholly irresponsible private control of the railroads are utterly revolutionized we cannot hope to have a fair system of rate taxation, we cannot hope to grap ple with the trusts, and, far more im portant than that, we cannot secure a condition in which decent business morals are even possible! One of tiie very worst results of the payment of rebates to favored shippers lias been the corroding growth of sus picion atul distrust throughout the rail road business. It is a hard thing to say, but one cannot look into the ques tion at all closely without reaching the conclusion that the honor of a promise, "the word of a man." has disappeared in the railroad freight business. A promise—even a signed contract—will not stand for one moment, if by break ing it a railroad agent can secure one car more of freight. These are strong words, but every man in the service, down in his heart, knows that they are true. I have listened to these men tell ing with absolute glee how they got to gether, all promising, even swearing— a "gentleman's agreement"—not to give a rebate to a certain shipper, and how, the moment they got out of the meet ing, every man used his best wits to break his oath as quickly as possible. Surely, a system which produces such dishonesty is wrong, wrong from the bottom to the top.
