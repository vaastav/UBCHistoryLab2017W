AI ON IM 7 EVEKING, ivEC. 7 l^(j THE President ifl a man of many words. Nearly fifteen coJnous of a Washington newspaper were required by hitfl yesterday congratulate his friends upon the defeat of the party tbat elected hita, and to tell them that tbey should continue to abide by toe verdict of the popular will; that he doe.-; not beiieve Turkey will ioug be permitted "to offend the sight of Christendom," teat be hag advised Spain to gra::" ar.orjorny to Cuba, but ibdt if ?ne won't dc bo, she will have to pursue her own cour-e until the condi? tions in mat inland be "imperatively" changed; that the declaration of war he made ag&icst Great Eritain a year ago n:-d Lhe $100,000 spent on the Ven elan commission might have been avoided, that the Bebring ?ea matter is in a fair way of settlement, that banking is not a necessary part of gov ernmentand that greenbacks should be redierced wi:b borrowed money?not v>me receipts from an income tax that pension abuseg ebould be correct? ed, that appropriations to the Agricul? tural Department are not always guard? ed, tbat tbe Gorman tariii bill, which ? a ed "political perfidy" and refused to sign, is a pretty good bill after all. ;- working satisfactorily and if allowed an opportunity will bring sufficient revenue tbesdvil service law i8 an ever present bless; ag acid should be extended to tue country postoSces. and that "noisy, pestilent and parti,. Ban office holders soouid be dealt with severely, and that trusts and monopo ..e- should be suppressed by tbe Btate governments. Tbe whole fifteen col amns conld have been condensed into '.-.e v. '>-n.::.ng a single point of interest .-'..as tbe message was tbe ist annual one Mr. Cleveland would ever send to Congress, be doubtedless deemed it well to make tbe most of bis opportunity. Wise >-.z Coo federates whose hearts a their cause,"don't like to think ol the war between the .States, as to do jo revives memories tbat well might sleep foi tbe most disagreeable of all thoughts .- that concerning what might have been, and it barrows up their souls to remember how close their cause was to success ai tbe Bret battle of Manassas, ?\ Fredericksburg and at Gettysburg. Tbe discussion of tbe reason of their de? feat at tbe latter place has been re opened. It is bootless, but is well known. At tbe time of tbe battle it was generally believed throughout the army that, the reason was tbe delay of General Longstreet in bringing his troops into action. He was ordered to do ho early be morning, but did so late in the evening. Though the President acknowledges that tbe insurgent negroes and scala? wags-in Cuba have none of the attri butes ol government, be does not think the bands of incendiary and murderous looters of whom tbey are composed should be compelled by Spain to sur? render before she makes terms with them. Hut the Jate President Lincoln, whom Mr. Cleveland professes to ad mire, refu od to treat with the (,'onfed erates, though t bey possessed each and all the attributes of an ellicient gov? ernment, upon any other ground than previous complete and entire ?urreuder. A comparison of the wages of tbe miners in thin country and in Canada, England and Belgium, hIiowh that not withstanding the tariffs on, and trusts in, and high prices of, coal here, the wages of the nu n employed in digging it out of the mines average forty-three per cent, leas than those of the men en? gaged in Himilar work in the other countries referred to. Instead of increas? ing the tarill, the duty on all the nec? essaries of life should be reduced, and revenue raised by a tax on luxuries and on surplus incomes._ 

TWENTY thousand dollars, are ex? pended annually in the purchase of am? munition for tiring a morning and even? ing gun at the military posts in thin country. The necessity for such salutes to the Htm is not apparent, but there must bo some excuse for maintaining the- preHont 42 per cent, tariff for the benefit of the protected manufacturers who subscribed to Mr. Hanna's corrup? tion fund. According to irecretarylCarlisle's ea* ti mates, which are always less than ac? tuals, the espouses of the government for next year will amount to nearly half a billion dollars, so tbat the fifty fourth Congress bids fair to exceed the famous billion Congress of Mr. Harrison's ad. i ministration. That's the way the money gjoes. Thk republicans during the late campaign declared in favor of bimetal ism, if it could be secured by interna? tional agreement, but uowone of their accredited organs speaks of Buch an agreement as a "transparent humbug." There always was a mighty big differ? ence betweeu now and then. Daniel W. Fair, the retiring treasurer of DeKalb county, Ind., is $13,500 short in his accounts. FROM WASHINGTON. 'Corr?por?d*&ce of tbe Alexaniri* Gazer.*., Washington, Dec. 8. A republican Senatorial caucus was: held this morning. Messrs. Dubois, Pettigrew, Mantle and Cannon, tne' four of the five boiling republican r^L i ators now in tbe city, did not attend, : ! but held a conference of their own in i 1 the committee room of Mr. Dubois. i : Tbe onlv republican to whom a notice I ! was not"sent was Senator -Stewart, of j '. Nevada, who all through tbe last ses- j -ion was considered as an out-and-out j populist. Senator Dubois this morning j re-'igned the secretaryship of tbe cau | cos and bis tn^mberchip on tbe steeriDg ; i committee. This may be an indica j 1 tioo of tbe proposed policy of the i ; silver men to refrain from affiliat- j j icg with tbeir o!d-time colleagues, j Senator Wilson, of Washington, was j elected s?-cretary in place of Mr. Du? bois. There was a rivalry between Senators Sboup, of Idano, and Hans- i borough, of North Dakota, for tbe va- j cancy on tbe steeriig ?-'?^rnittee caused by the resignation o: M.. Dj ois. Tue question was settled by pufitg '-?otb ! men on the committee. The chief topic for discussion was the Dinnley bill, with the result tbat the matter was referred without action to the steering committee, who will consider tbe advisability of taking it up and the po--:b.lliy of pa^.-iLg it. Senator Sher? man refrained from discussing it. The cotcensus of opinion gathered from the snort speecne= made was, tbat it would not be wise to take up the bill, owing to the entanglements tbat were sure to arise, and tbe more potent fac;t tbat u would be impossible to get tbe votes wherewith to pass it. Republi? cans who attended tbe caucus say they are firm in tbe conviction tbat tbe" Dingley bill i= now with? out tbe bope of passage. Senator Wo'cott. of Colorado, introduced a resolution, which was unanimously adopted, authorizing tbe chairman of the caucus to appoint a special commit? tee of five Senators whose duty it shall be to devise such legislation for action by this session of Congress as will se? cure an international monetary con? ference with tbe leadiog commercial nations of tbe world. Senator Wolcott made a short speech favoring the adoption of tbe resolution, arguing tbat this session should enact tbe legislation necessary to authorize the incoming President to invite tbe other nations to join in such conference and appoint tbe American delegates thereto. There was no opposition, and the resolution was agreed to without a dissenting vote. The debate on the Dingley bill was participated in by upwards of a dozen Senators. Messrs. Hale and Frye, of, Maine, thought it expedient to take up the measure and push it, while Messrs. Aidricb. of Rhode Island, and Morrill, of Vermont, were opposed. Mr. Gear, of Iowa, called the attention of tbe steering committee to tbe fact that the Pacific railroads funding bill had been referred to it at tbe last session, and urged tbat committee to make a report favoring action at this session. He threw out tbe intimation that he in? tended, if possible, to force the measure to the front, should the committee's report he unfavorable to prompt action. Mrs. Caroline P. Winslow, who bad a national reputation as a leader among women, died at ber home in this city last night, at tbe age of 74. An eL'ort was made in tne Senate to? day by Mr. Call to get in a resobution on the subject of Cuba, but as that stage of morning business had not been reached, be was forced to wait for an? other day. Notice was given by Mr. (,'ulloin that be would next Thursday submit some remarks on tbat subject. Governor Gates, of Alabama, is here to day. He says there is a proposition now before the legislature of his Slate to order a constitutional convention to so change the election law as to exclude from sulJrage the illiterate voters and those who have no interest in the wel? fare of his State, and tbat be hopes it will pass, as tbe democratic parly is so divided there now that at tbe next election there may be two democratic tickets, iu which case the republicans will win. Representative Sherman of New York, who has the Memorial Rridge at Arliugton in charge, told the 

GAZETTE'S correspondent this morning tbat while be would do all he could to have it passed, he had no hopes of success, as Mr. Fletcher of Minnesota, a member of the committee tbat reported it, had announced his intention of opposing it, even if the Speaker shall allow it to be called up. Subsequently Mr. Fletcher told the correspondent thut he certain? ly should oppose tbe passage of the bill, not only because the favora? ble report on it was obtained dur? ing; his absence, but because ap? propriations made two years ago for more necessary purposes, some iu his own diatrict, are still held up for want of money, and that he will not consent to any more improvements un? til those already provided for shall be at least under way. If the Virginians in Congress, he said, would help to increase the revenue by raising the tariff, be would not object to the ex? penditure of money, and so anxious wus he to fill the coffers of the Treas? ury tiiat be had even voted for the in? come tax. When the bill was before tbe committee, he said, be proposed that Virginia and the District of Columbia should pay one-half of the expense and the government the other halt, but that proposition was not adopted. The b:ll, ho Haid, provided for only $b'00 - 000, but everybody knew that it would cost at leaHt $2,000,000 While some of the democratic Sena? tors have not greeted Senator Palmer after their long separation, none of them has refused to recognize him, and Senator Daniel of Virginia made it his business to greet him warmly. But tho head of the late decoy ticket now find* bis most congenial associates on the re? publican side of tbe chamber. It is needless to say that the Virginia delegation iu Congress is not effusive in its approval of tbe President's mes? sage. Of two of the House part of the delegation asked about the Cuban sec? tion of it to-day, Messrs. Tyler and Mere? dith, the former said it presented four aspects for four diflereut sorts of ob? servers, and the latter, that the Presi- ' dent should "put up or shut up." There is no doubt of the fact that the majority of the membert of both parties in the House are against Spain. Tbe J Pennsylvania members were inter? viewed on the subject to-day and near ly all of them expressed themselves as in favor of interfering in behalf of the insurrectionists. It is the purpose of Mr. Powers, chairman of the House committee on Pacific Railways, to arrange with Speak? er Reed for an oarly consideration of the Otll to adjust the indebtedness of the Pacific roads to the government This indebtedness falls due within a few weeks, and President Cleveland re | ferred to it in his annual message which was laid before Congress yesterday. Mr. Powers said to-day that be did not doubt the committee on rules would report an order Betting aside a few days for a consideration of the measure. He 1= satisfied that the House will pass the bill. Carroll D. Wright. Commissioner of Labor sent to Congress to-day his re? port upon a plan for a permanent cen? sus service, in accordance with the joint resolution of March 19, li95. Among the strangers on the floor of the House to-day was Colonel John S. Moeby, who has friends among both the Virginia and California members. It ii reported at the Senate that censtor Sherman intended to o3er a resolution sum- j coning Gener?! Fltzhugh Lee before the r.'.ate Committee on Forega Relations, so | that the committee might hear his account ! of the oonditioii of affairs ia Cuba.

The date of b:: departure ::= not kdowa. but it is under? stood that he will '.t.?-~ the first available steamer.

The reading of the message in the House occupied one hour and forty minutes. At its conclusion the mes? sage and accompanying documents were referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the union. The opening words of the message, congratulating the country on the re? sult of the election, created a broad ?irnile, the democrats as well as the re? publicans seemingly enjoying the anom? alous political condition which allowed a democratic President to felicitate himself upon a victory gained under the banner of the republican party. Mr. Grow of Pennsylvania, showed a disposition to debate the message, but yielded until a later time. Mr. Turner of Georgia, then infor? mally announced the ''untimely death" of hi? late colleague, ex-Speaker Crisp, and Htated that at some future day he would ask the House to fix a day for paying tribute to "his distinguished character and eminent public services."
