THE WOOL GROWERS TALK OUT IN MEETING IN LANGUAGE THAT BEARS BUT ONE CONSTRUCTIONâ€”PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE DECLARED TO BE A DIRECT ATTACK AT THEIR OCCUPATION. Washington, D. C, Dec. 7. At to day's session of the conference of wool growers and wool dealers of Ibo United States, called by the president of tbe National Association of Wool Growers, lhe following was unanimously adopted Tbe wool dealers and wool growers of tbe United States, representing a capital of over $500,000,000 and a con stituency of a million wool growers and wool dealers, assembled in conference in the city of Washington tbe 7th day of December, 1857, having read tbe first annual message of tbe President to tbe Fiftieth Congress, declare that the sen- titneuis cf tbe message are a direet at tack UDon their industry, one of the most important of the country, and in positive violatieu of the national Dem ocratic platform of 1SS4, as interpreted by the party leaders and accepted by the rank and file of the party; that the argument made by the President for the removal of our protection against foreign corupetion ia the old one, re peatedly made by the enemies of our industrial progress, and effectively an swered in nearly every school district of our land, and so thoroughly disprov ed by the logic of facts and demonstra tion of experience and history as to need no answer from us. We acknowledge that our "small hold ings," our scatterea ana unorgamzoa condition makes us the tasy prey of the free trader, but we had a light to ex pect something different from the Chief Executive of tbe nation at onoe the most happy, prosperous, and contented of any of the world, made so by a poli cy of protection and development which be now seeks to destroy. We had a right to expect our President would fa vor the wool growers of the United States, and confess our deep disappoint ment that instead he favors the interests of our foreign competitors. Justly alartnsd at his position, we make an appeal from his recommenda tion to all the people, to the seven and three-fonrtbs millions of our fellow cit izens engaged in agricultural pursuits, to the millions engaged in manufactur ing, to the army of wage earners, whose prosperity depends upon ours, confident that tbe judgment and decision will be based upon justice and patriotism, and therefore for the maintenance of the American policy of protection to which the country is indebted for its unexam pled development and prosperity. To demonstrate tbe injustice of the President's policy and tbe fallacy of the remedy he proposes for the reduc tion of the surplus, we point to the fact that if the whole amount of theTevenue derived from wool was abolished it wotfd reduce the surplus only about five millions or less than 10 cents per capita of the population, which is paid by foreigners, while the old war taxes he recommends retained yield over one hundred and nineteen millions and a direct tax per capita of two dollars each, and what makes up tbe great bulk of the surplus of one hundred and forty millions, and which fosters a most dan gerous monopoly. We would further add the following statistics in regard to the wool industry. The annual revenue derived from im ports of wool under the tariff of 1867 was less than $1,700,000. Under the reduced tariff of 1883, the revenue last year was over five millions. The num ber of sheep in the country in 1884 was 50.62G.62G, in 1887, 44,759,314, a de crease of nearly six millions and a dim inution of the annual wool product of over 35,000,000 pound, thus showing that reducing the tariff by the act of 1883 has increased the revenue from im ported wools and diminished the num ber of sheep in the United States about 12 per cent and the annual product in the same proportion. The President's policy would bring ibout the destruction of this industry, and the same policy of reduotionor ab olition of the tariff would end in disas ter to all the other industrial produc tive enterprises of the country. The Only One. "Did any of your family get cut to pieces with a mowing machine this year?'' be asked of a farmer in the mar ket yesterday. "No, sir." "Any legs taken nffby the reaper?" "Not a leg." "Any one fall off a haystack and run pitchfork into him?" "No. sir." "Any one pet wound up in the tum bling rod of the thrashing machine f "No, sir." "Any one killed by tho explosion of a portable boiler?" "No.." None of the women burned to death by kerosene?" "No." "Well, you ought to be thankful." "Yes, I suppose so. The only acci dent we had in our neighborhood oc curred to a chap who came out froTh the city to stay a day or two with me. He fell asleep in the orchard and a calf chewed all tbe hair off his head!" An old proverb says: "False ia one thing, false in all things, which means a person who will lie about anything will lie about all things, and a person who docs not keep bis nviu uiuuui uc vjueicu iu nnyiuiug. 

MISCELLANEOUS. FORCE. The stars know a secret They -Jo not tell; And moru brings a message Hidden well. There's a blush on tbe apple, A tint on the wing, And tbe bright wind whistles, And tbe pulses sting. Perish dark memories! There's light ahead; This world's for tbe living, Not for the dead. In the shining city, On the loud pave, The life-tide is ebbing Like a leaping wave. How the stream quickens, As noon draws near; No room for loiterers, No time for fear. Out on the farm lands Earth smiles as well; Gold-crested grain fields. With sweet, warm smell; Whirr of the reaper, Like a giant bee; Like a Titan cricket, Thrilling with glee, On mart, or meadow, Pavement, or plain; On azure mountain. On azure main Heaven bends in blessing; Lost is but won; Gees the good rain-clouds t Comes the good sun! Only babes whimper, And sick men wail. And faint-hearts,and feeble-hearts, Ana weaklings fail. Down the great currents Let the boat swing; There was never winter But brought the spring. E. R. Sill in Overland. A MATCH FOR JAY GOULD. How Jimmie Got Best of the Farmer, Grocer and the Boys. The Hon. Tom Pittman told an inter esting story in one of his recent temper auce speeches. '"Jimmie was always prowling around to find something and very little escaped him," he said. "One night as five of his companions were sitting in a row on the old stone fence. Jimmie said, in a whispered voice: "Boys, I know where there is a water-melon patch, and I think we can collar just about twelve of 'em'" "Bully !" they exclaimed in a choras. to " 'Yes' " continued Jimmie, " 'we will have just two melons a piece. Meet me here tonight at 7:30 o'clock, I'll take you to the patch, we'll collar the water melons, and then hide them until the excitement's over.' " "All right, Jimmie,,' the boys replied, and scattered to their respective homes. At 7:30 they met at the rendezvous and Jimmie took them a mile down the road through a corn field, on the outer edge of which they came te a water melon patch, and it was such a patch that it made their mouths water Jim mie plugged twelve of the finest melons in the patch and directed each of the boys to take two of them and follow him. They did so and ho led to a lone ly part of tbe corn field pearer the road where they buried the melons. 'Now,' said Jimmie, 'let's all go home and keep mum, for these melons will soon be missed by the old farmer, and he'll kick up a row; but, as he find no trace of them, the thing5!! die out. and by that time the melons will be as cold as though they'd been kept on ice, and then we'll eat 'em. But keep dark and nobody'll know that we have been in the watermelon business.' So they all went home. But Jimmie went that night to tbe farmer and asked him what he thought of his watermelon patch, and the old farmer told him that they were getting along splendidly. Jimmie then asked him if he had a dog down there watching the watermelons. The old farmer said he hadn't Jimmie said he onght to have a dog, as there were a good many boys who liked water melons. The farmer said he didn't think they'd take his melons. Then Jim mie told him that they had already taken twelve and that in the morning he would tell the farmer who the boys were. Jimmie then went down to the village and asked the groceryman if he had any watermelons yet The grocery man told him he had not. Jimmie ask ed him what he'd give for twelve big ones. The groceryman told him if there were good big ones and all ripe he would give $3 for them. " 'All right, said Jimmie, liitchup and come with me and I'll deliver the mel ons." "The groceryman hitched up and Jimmie directed him where to drive, and then he jumped over the fence into the cornfield aud told the groceryman to wait and he would bring the melons, which it did not take him long to do. Jimmie took tbe money and ran homo, and the groceryman drove back well sat isfied with the bargain. "Next morning bright and early Jim mie went to the farmer and asked if he had been down to the watermelon patch. The farmer said that he had and had missed exactly twelve of the fruit, and he told Jimmie that he would now give him $10 to toll who took the melons. Jimmie said he wouldn't give the boys away, but if tbe farmer would give him $20 he'd tell him who bought the mel ons. The farmer gave Jimmie the $20 and was told that the village grocery man had the stolen fruit. Jimmie then ran to the village and rushed in the store all out of breath, and handed the groceryman $3 and exclaimed: "'Take it! take it! The farmer has found out all about it and is comin. down for those melons, and I didn' know they were stolen.' Tbe groceryman stood there, almost paralyzed, as Jimmie darted behind some boxes. At that moment tbe farm er, with fire in his eyes, entered. Then there was a terrible row. The farmer threatened to have the groceryman ar rested for receiving stolen property, and to bush it up tho groceryman paid him $100 and gave him back the melons. Jimmie saw the whole transaction, and when the money was paid, and while the groceryman was putting the melons in the farmer's wagon, Jimmie slipped from behind the boxes and out of the back door and up the cross-road, and ran back to the farmer's before ho reach ed home. "When the farmer drove rip Jimmie greeted him with smiles, and said he was glad he'd got his melons back. The farmer told him he was a good, honest boy, and would become a great man. Then Jimmie walked to the barn with the farmer and told him he wanted four melons and $50. The farmer looked aghast ; but it was no use. Jimmie said he had heard the whole transaction with the groceryman, and if he didn't get the four melons and the $50 he would have the farmer arrested for compound ing a felony, and would show it was a put up job on tbe groceryman. So tbe farmer paid Jimmie the $50 and gave him the four melons. That night Jim- mie's five companions met him. Then be told them the whole thing had been found out by tho tracks they made in the cornfield, and that he had saved them all from State Prison by compro mising with the farmer in showing him where the melons were buried, and that farmer believed they had been put to it by somebody else. Then Jim mie said: ""Boys, I've got one of those melons and let's go down in the field and eat it.' 'And so the boys went with Jimmie and ate the melon, and thanking him, they all went home, believing Jimmie be the best boy among them. And that same night Jimmie took to his own house three big watermelons. Since that night Jimmie has grown to man hood and has been operating in Wall street, and recently was engaged in a large financial transaction, which he conducted on tbe same plan that he carriod out in the watermelon business and with the same success." N. Y. Evening Sun. to its ana Dr. in was Official Crop and Stock Report of the Ohio State Board of Agriculture, December 1st, 1887. following Crop and Stock esti mates are based on reports received from the regular township correspon dents, carefully tabulated and averaged for tbe State: Wheat. Condition compared with a full average 73 per cent Amount of crop of 1887 sold as soon as threshed 42 per cent. Damage to growing crop by Hessian Fly 3 per cent Corn. Yield compared with a full average 62 per cent Amount of crop cf 1887 cut for fodder 77 percent. Aver age date of cutting for fodder, Sept. 17. Clover Seed. Probable total yield compared with full average, 63 per cent Apples. Product compared with full average 8 per cent Cattle. Number being fed for spring market, compared with last year 77 per cent Sheep. Number being fed for mutton compared with last year 77 per cent The most reliable estimates place tbe present wheat area at about 85 per cent as compared with last year, or about four hundred thousand acres short This great shortage in area is due to the un favorable conditions of weather and soil during the entire seeding season. The present condition of the plant, 73 per cent, as compared with a fair average, indicates exceedingly discouraging prospects for the wheat harvest of next year. The present low condition of wheat represents, comparod with a fair aver age, about eight millions of bushels,and adding to this about five millions re presented by the shortage in acreage as compared with last year, the present probabilities are that the wheat harvest for 1888 will be somo thirteen millions of bushels below an average product. If the condition of the plant should improve even to a fair average, which is not at all probable from present ap pearances, there will still be the short age on account of low area, and tbe harvest must inevitably be the smallest for many years. The estimated corn product is placed at 62 per cent of a fair average, being 4 per cent, less than the estimste made November 1st. Owing to the low price of cattle, the number being fed for Spring market is much smaller than usual. Curiosities op Law. Judgo "Stand up."

Those" who most vig orously fought its adoption from the very inception of it till the greenback ciaze died a natural death now acknowledge its perfec tion. To perpetuate it and make it the cur rency of the future. Senator Farwell, of Illi nois, will, at his earliest opportunity, intros ducc a bill providing for the acceptance at the National Treasury of collateral securities other ti.an those of the National Government. The Senator realizes that the United States bonds are rapidly being redeemed and that the time is therefore not tar distant when the circulation cf the banks must be protected in some other way" than that at present vogue. To this end his bill provides that National Bar.ks, now in existence and here after to be organized, can present as securi ties any State, municipal or first mortgage railroad bonds of the United States upon which interest has heretofore been promptly paid and whose market or cash value is equal to or greater than their par value and bearing interest at a rate of not less than four per cent per annum. Municipal and State bonds are not to be re ceived Dy tne Lnited States Treasurer at more than 75 per cent of their par value while first mortgage railroad bonds are not to be received tit more than 50 per cent of their par value, and their total is not to exceed $000,000,000. AH State, municipal and r.tilroad bonds thus used w collateral mast first receive the indorsement both of the Secretary of the Treasury aud the Comptroller of the Treasu ry and the Comptroller of the Currency. lhe following in the concluding section will show that the emergency of a bank fail urc has been carefully considered: Whenever the Comptroller has become sat isfied by tbe protest or the waiver and admis sioo specified in Section 5,220 of the Revised statutes oi me united fetates, or hy the re port provided for in Section 5.227 of the Re vised Statutes of the United States, that anv association has refused to pay its circulating notes, ne may, insteaa oi canceling its bonds. cause so much of them as may be necessary redeem its outstanding notes, to be sold at public auction in the city of New York.after giving 30 days notice of such sale to the as. sociation, or he may, in bis discretion, pro ceed in tue name ot Lnited States ot America, the proper Circuit Court of the United States, to collect such bonds as fast as they shall mature, i or any dehcieacy in lhe pro ceeds of all bonds of an association when thus sold or collected to reimburse the United States the amount expended in paying the circulating notesof the association the United States shall have a paramount lien upon all assets in preference to any and all other claims whatsoever, except the necessary costs expenses ot administering tbe same a & Bread on the Water. At a recent Wedesday evening lecture Paxton told an interesting incident the career of Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania. He said that when he stationed at Washington,- Cameron came tr him one day and said: 'My -young preacher, I want yon to preach a sermon from the text 'Cast your bread upon the waters and it will return four-fold after many days.' " In explaining the request, the veteran Pennsylvania politician said that when he was a young man he met a young lumberman who was bemoaning his ill luck in having his raft of timber laid up by the low water. The man was surrounded by some operators who were trying to secure the drift for a mere song. Cameron asked the young fellow, whose name was Hahnemann,if he could not hold the logs until the freshets came. "I have not a cent in tbe world." was the reply, "and these men are trying to squeeze me. I don't know what to do, for I am ruined." "Young fellow, you are not ruined." answered Cameron. "Come with me to my bank and I will hold your lumber and loan you all the money you need at the legal interest" The young lumberman was rescued and Gen. Cameron lost sight of him. "It was not many years ago," the aged Senator continued in telling the story, "and I was not an old man, but when I wanted to be United States Senator I met with sturdy opposition. I learned that there was a man in the lumber dis tricts who had great influence and con trolled tho legislative delegation from that part of the State. I went to see mm. His name was Hahnemann, and taking my memorandum book with me, I thought I would recall tho lumber in cident. The man was too young to be the one I had casually assisted, but I learned from him that he had succeed ed his father. "The young man did not know much of his father's experience,but conversed with his mother and then returned to the hotel to see me. He said his moth er was anxious to see the man who had put his father on his feet if he could be found. 1 told the yonng merchant that I was the man and he grasped me by tbe hand, said he was opposed to me politically, but hoped I would win.

St. Augustine, Fla., founded in 1565, is put down in the school histories as tbe 'oldest town in tbe United States,' but Sante Fe, N. XL, claims existence since 1552, and now comes a third competitor, viz: Tubac, Pima county, Arizona. The probate judge of Pima county recently applied at the local land office to have a quarter section added to the present township site, 'for the reason' as tbe petition states, 'that the above portion of land contains nearly all of the residence por tion anil principal buildings of the town, in cluding the church, burying ground, and his torical and other associations connected with the town, the same being highly prized by the inhabitants, the town being the third old est in tbe United States, its history running back to 1539.' The petition then goes on to say that by some over-sight of the United States surveyor who laid out the town the land was thrown open to settlement and 'one Bernardino Yalenzuela, an illiterate, igno rant Mexican, an outspoken enemy of our race, and who has but taken out bis first papers of citizenship,' filed bis claim to it, 'and if your honor does not intervene to pre vent a patent issuing to this man, it will work a great hardship, loss, and detriment to the inhabitants of what we believe to be the oldest settlement in tbe United States, for when discovered by Cornado in 1530 it con tained 50,000 inhabitants, and was tbe capi tal of tbe then Papagueria (country of the Papagos), as it has been of this territory, it having been our first capital, where our United States laws were first promulgated and put in force.' Two Blind Men. There was once in Rome two blind men, one of whom cried in the streets of the city, "He is helped whom God helps;" the other, on the contrary, cried, He is helped whom the Emperor helps." This they did every day, and the Emperor heard it so often that he had a loaf of bread baked, filled with gold pieces. This filled loaf he sent to tbe blind man who appealed to the Emperor's help. When he felt ihe heavy weight of the bread he sold it to the other as soon as he met him. Tbe blind man who bought the bread car ried it home. When he had broken it and found tbe gold he thanked God, and from that day ceased to beg. But the other, continuing to beg through the city, the Emperor summoned him to hia presence and asked him, "What ' hast thou done with tbe loaf that I lately sent you?" "I sold it to my friend because it was heavy and did not seem well risen." Then the Emperor said, "Truly he whom God helps is helped indeed," and turned the blind man from him. Kind Worda Hard to Beat. About the meanest swindie we have heard of yet is reported from McEean county. At mill where a great many lumbermen stop I feed their teams, Is a long feed box. An old farmer drove up to the mill last week with a load of grain to bo ground. After unloading, he took his team to tbe feed box, threw itf half a bushel of oats, and went into the mill. In a few minutes he had occasion go to the wagon for a bag and found the team pawing the ground as if they were hun gry. On examination he was surprised to find the feed box empty, although the horses had time to eat half the feed be had given them. Investigation showed that the trough had a false bottom and when the horses put their noses down and pressed against it the oats ran into a box below from which, by an ingenious contrivance, they were conveyed the mill. This beats the proverbial green spectacle and shaving dodge. What He Threw Away. An Albany gentleman some years ago did business for parties in Chicago. They failed and all they offered in payment of their account was a piece of wild land in South Chicago. The account was about $500 and the deed of the land was accepted- In vestigation disclosed that the land was in a swamp and apparently of no present or pros- peclive value. Afkr paying taxes on it for several years lhe Albany holder finally aban doned it and it was doubtless sold for non payment of taxes- Not long ago while vis iting Chicago tbe gentleman looked up the property and to his amazement and disgust discovered that it was in the most valuable part of South Chicago and that had he re tained it he would have been worth at least 1250,000 Albany Journal.
