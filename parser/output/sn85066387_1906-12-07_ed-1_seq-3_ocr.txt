State Has Full Power to Enforce Law Coudert Says School Stand Is Well Taken Cites Decision in Support of His Contention NEW YORK. Dec. 6.— Frederick R. Coudert, who. as was his disti^juished father, is an authority on International law, arraigns the policy of the adminis tration in dealing with the Japanese Bchool situation in California in scath ing terms. He holds, after a careful examination into the treaties and the State statutes on the subject, that Cali fornia is well within her rights, and that a grave injustice has been done her citizens. In the phrase, "international moral ity." he finds a target for the shafts of analysis and points out where he con riders the position of the President is inconsistent. He says: "If any treaty right of a Japanese subject has been violated, the State courts have full power to enforce the said right, and should they refuse to do so. an appeal from the decision runs to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court of Massa chusetts decided last spring that a treaty with Russia conferred upon the Russian Consul the right to administer upon. the goods of a Russian dying in testate. This decision reversed that of the lower courts, holding that the Mas sachusetts statutes conferring that rl^ht upon the public administrator could not be overridden by a treaty. This ruling is certainly settled law. "Then the sole question in the Cali fornia matter is whether the Japanese under the treaty possess any right to attend the same public schools as the \u25a0white children. An examination of the treaty can hardly fail to show that it does nothing of the kind." Bryan Shies at the Japanese Question 

LINCOLN. Neb.. Dec. 6.— Commenting or. President Roosevelt's message, Wil liam Jennings Bryan says there Is much that is good and much that is bad In it, but it may be regarded as the President's most important state paper. Bryan says: The message contains much that is Democratic and for which the gen frai public may well thank him. It contains some things that ought to arc-js? Fevere criticism. He pays a deserved tribute to the progress of the Japanese nation and asks for legislation which will enable Ccr.grress to protect treaty rights of foreigners. That there should be such legislation cannot be generally disput ed, but a great deal depends upon the character of the legislation. If any bills are presented in regard to this suggestion they must be carefully scrutinized to be sure that they do not deny to the various States the right to protect themselves and their people In matters purely local. There will be general disappoint ment at the warlike tone of his mes sage where he dispusses the army and the navy. He speaks of the navy as th* 6urcst guarantee of peace which this country possesses. Shame upon the chief executive, that he should place an instrument of .brute force above the nation's sense of Justice as a guarantor of peace! The best guar antor of peace is our national purpose to deal justly with other nations. War o'jjz-ht to be our last resort, not a first consideration. It is bad enough to have a few professional soldiers. It Is not necessary that the whole nation shall be keyed up all the time to tbe f.ghting point. Declares Treaty Movement Is Afoot 

WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. €.— De- Fpite official denials that this Govern ment proposes to negotiate a new treaty with Japan, which will give the Vnitcd States the right to exclude Jap anese coolies., confirmation of the re port that such a movement is on has crime from highest sources. No less an authority than Senator Perkins said today that the President had taken steps to pave the way for a modifica tion of the present treaty, such modi fication permitting exclusion of Jap anese coolies or the peon labor of the Inland Kingdom from America. Senator Perkins called on President Tioosevelt today and talked over the Japanese, situation. Later he made. It <*lesr that the movement for a modified treaty had been begun. Just how far The preliminaries have gone Senator Perkins did not say. "Exclusion of the Japanese laborers, the shutting out of the. peon labor of Japan must come eventually," said Senator Perkins. "Only in this way can a permanent settlement of the controversy now be ing discussed be effected. I believe It is the duty of the administration to negotiate a new treaty. The Pres ident has already paved the way for such neg-otlations." i Senator Perkins discussed the ques tion "whether Japan would consent 'to the exclusion of her laboring classes from this country. He expressed the | belief that the Japanese Government would not oppose it. 'Japan's repre sentatives tell us." he said, "thaf Japan does not want her people to rome to this country, but. on the other hand, wants them to go to Korea and Manchuria and settle there. Under the circumstances. I believe exclusion can be brought about." Senator Perkins was asked what concessions this country would have to make to Japan In order to effect exclusion. He did not say. but Inti mated that some important concession would have to be made. "Treaties, you .know, are give-and take affairs." France Is Pleased With the President 

PARIS, Dec. 6. — All the French news papers published editorials today on President Roosevelt's rnesage, unani mously selecting for comment his re marks upon the Japanese situation as being "most characteristic of the man" and praising the President's courag-. The general opinion can be summed. up In the words of the Petite Republlque as follows: His presentation of the Japanese Question was an eloquent feature of the address. It' constitutes a lesson in international politeness and shows that in order for a nation to have the right to Insist on the proper treatment of its subjects abroad it is necessary to begin according similar treatment to foreigners at home. The President has spoken with courage regardless of popularity. He has performed'his duty ut, as American tnd as chief of state.- , Compliments Won't Prevent War's Approach Russian Official Thinks Army Inefficient ST. 

PETERSBURG, Dec. 6.— While Russian statesmen are apparently unanimous in the opinion that Presi dent Roosevelt's message is the great est public document that has appeared in recent years, they do not agree with some of the remedies he has suggested and with his optimism in regard to in ternational affairs. A Russian administrator general, who was recently in command of both civil and military forces In the Far East, and who is well acquainted with tho circumstances which have involved America and Japan in a controversy, said today: "Although I am a monarchist, still I must confess that the address of no European ruler has equaled Presi dent Roosevelt's recent message, either in pith or depth. Leaving to Ameri can critics his remarks on the internal affairs of his country, I must disagree with President Roosevelt's foreign views. "If America wants an Eastern mar ket for goods and a free Pacific, she must be prepared to go to war. Mr. Roosevelt's compliments to Japan will not help matters, but will only delay hostilities at best. "President Roosevelt's idea that the militia and the turner societies could replace the regular army is fallacious. I have seen American soldiers in China and the Philippines, and have read the American maneuver reports. The men display intelligence, agility and initia tive, and in these qualities greatly sur pass both European and Japanese sol diers, but are utterly lacking, in or ganization and discipline. America must triple its army and form a nu cleus of veterans. Then the turners would become useful." AGE 

QUESTION IN SCHOOL DISPUTE Continued From Pas* 1, Column 3 message of the President. I don't, of course, wish to say that this was so. but the list was taken to Washington by Secretary Metcalf and the presump tion is at least permissible. "It •would be interesting to compare this list with a similarly prepared list of other foreign pupils attending the schools in San Francisco. Apart from this, however, I think it can easily be established that all of the Japanese of advanced age attending schools are In the higher grades and that the discrep ancy between their ages and that of the other pupils is not so great when figured out on class average. "I think that the entire matter will be solved «atisfactorlly and that there is no occasion for believing otherwise. The Japanese are^not striving for any thing unreasonable and are quite will ing to let the facts in the dispute guide whatever decision is to be ultimately rendered." President Aaron Altmann of the Board of Education when made ac quainted with the contentions of Con sul General Uyeno, said that the list taken to Washington by Secretary Met calf was not as complete as lists since compiled. "I don't wish to dispute the accuracy of the points raised by the Consul Gen eral." he said, "but I think he has par ticularized rather than confined himself to estimating the average differences in age between Japanese and other pupils. Our latest list shows that of the 93 Japanese pupils attending schools, 39 of them are between the ages of 16 and 21 inclusive. There might be only two Japanese who are 20 or 21 years of age, but the fact remains that the ma jority of them are much older than the other pupils in the same grades. "I should say that in the grades at tended by Japanese between the ages of 16 and 21 the average age of other pupils would be less than 14. In some schools the difference Is particularly marked. Take the case of the Pacific Heights School, for instance. This is in a residential section where many Japanese are employed as house ser vants. Many of them attend classes in this school and would reach on the average of from three to four years more In age than the other pupils. . "As for the list taken to Washing ton by Secretary Metcalf it probably had nothing to do with the recommen dations mede by President Roosevelt in his message. Judging from the interview with President Wheeler in this morning's Call, I should say it had not. The President, according to President Wheeler, had decided on his attitude and written his message be fore Secretary Metcalf had returned to Washington." President A, A. Watkins of the San Francisco Board of : Trade believes President Roosevelt was wrongly ad vised concerning affairs in San Fran cisco. "The tenor of his message would in dicate that he Is not fully acquainted with the Japanese problem in San Francisco," he said. "Apart from this, however, it would appear that the question is a State rather than a Fed eral one. No one -wants to criticize President Roosevelt, but I think the opinion of the average business •: man here is that California is quite compe tent to solve this matter for itself and will make every effort to do so."- ' A Helping Habd Tfierc is helj) for every 'woman who suffer*, from headache, faint- : n l ss * °fP rcssi °n» backache and other ailments , during those times \u25a0: when Nature makes a heavy demand' on her strength and vitality Every woman should: take \u25a0"- \u25a0-'' -v * tjp help Jier through these trying-periods and to keep the sysUfm in a normal and healthy, condition The girj just, entering woman- , vft? < 7 a £ d "*ose of maturer years, find-equal benefit. from Beecham's- Pills.

JISAN: /FRANGISGP^GALg^IgRIDAY,/ FRANGISGP^GALg^lgRID A Y , ;' DECEMBER-- ' :7;:-\906^: 7; : -\906^ Devlin Makes Plain Points in Discussion Scope of the Treaty Is the Question Involved United States District Attorney Dev lin yesterday Issued a statement in the case of the Japanese" school segregation dispute, In which he said in part: The question In issue In this case is whether or not BPCtlon IG6L' of tbe Political Code of California, which i>rnv!d«'R that the Board of Kdncatloa may establish schools for Indian chil dren and children of Cliluose or ' Mongolian de scent, and the action and the resolution of the Board of Education of San Francisco In establish ing such separate school and providing that all Japanese. Korean and Chinese children shall be sent thereto conflict with the treaty with Japan. It wouM not be proper at this time for me to discuss the legal aspects uf the onse. There are, however, certain legal . propositions that may be assumed to be true, and some that will become, undoubtedly, the subject of Judicial con sideration. In the first place it may be stated that under section 2 of article VI of the constitution of the United States all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, eball be the supreme lew ..of the land, and the Judges In every State shall, be bound thereby, tbe constitution or -laws of any State to the contrary notwlthstandins. The United States has entered into, a solemn treaty with Japan, whereby the subjects of the Japanese em pire are guaranteed certain rights in the United States, and are entitled by the proTlslons of thla treaty to receive tbe same consideration as sub jects of the most favored nations. VIOLATES THE TREATY If the State of California enacts a law provid ing for the segregation of Japanese children, bnt makes no discrimination against French, 1 Italian or English children, or children of other nationalities, the question arises whether such action on the part of the State of California vio lates the treaty provisions with Japan, and whether such action Is not a discrimination prac ticed against ,the subjects of that particular country. If the State of California had declared that all children born out of the United States should attend the schools specially provided for them,' a different question might arise. It is not so much a question whether California can' dis criminate on account of race, but whether such discrimination can be confined to a partlcnlar race with the country of which we have entered into treaty obligations. \u25a0 -\u25a0 s Under the treaty with Japan the subjects of that country are entitled to the rtehts of resi dents and to all the prlvlleces. liberties and rljrlits accorded to the most favored nations as residents or to natives as residents. The',ques tion Is not Involved whether California may or may not establish a free school system, as it may be conceded that such a matter Is ifltlrely within the discretion of the State, but if the State constitution does require the maintenance of a free public school system and does maintain such a system for the children of residents without re?<ird to citizenship, and admits to Its schools children of subjects or citizens of France, Germany. Russia or any other European country, the question to l<e presented is. is the right of education in the public schools of the State not a rlgrht secured by the treaty provision with Japan: and is a segregation of Japanese children bssed on no other consideration than they are. Japanese not a denial of equal treatment with the sub jects of the most favored nation? The object of the present treaty with Japan, which was ms<le in 1594. was to provide for the maintenance of a trood iindrret.in.ling between the two countries by increasing tbe Intercourse between them upon the basis of equity and mutual benefit. It will not be disputed, probably, .that the cit.» of San Francisco affords equal- educational advantages for the Japanese in certain schools to "those af forded the native born children and children born In other countries, but tbe question is, does the segregation of Japanese children In a school, at tended by them only, or by children of Kdrean and Chinese -descent, constitute a discrimination against the Japanese which; . under the treaty, should not occur? v : \u25a0 t •" 

QUESTIO.V AT ISSUE Then, in precise words, the question is. Doe* this course on the part of the school authorities of San Francinco give to tbe Japanese the same privileges as are given to English, French, Ger man and American children — that Js, is It not a discrimination based upon the assumption of In feriority and of. conditions unfitting these chil dren to associate with children of tbe most fa vored nations and of Americans? And for the purpose of obtaining • the decision of the courts upon tais proposition In due time 'such proceed ing in court will be comemnced as to the Gov ernment maywm necessary. I have studiously refrained. In what I have said above, from discussing the question that arises from our treaty with Japan, but as there seems to be considerable .misapprehension as to the point involved. I have endeavored to state the question to be presented without attempting to make any argument In its support until It is made in court. It may. however, be freely asserted that the United States Government will do its utmost to compel tbe observance of all treaty obligations and to secuje to the fullest extent to the sub jects of any country with which It has exchanged treaties the rights guaranteed by such treaties. It will prevent to the extant of Its power any discrimination exercised against the subjects of the empire of Japan or any other country in vio lation of treaty provisions. Silk Hat Episode Stirs Two Nations . The tin can that rudely knocked the silk hat * from the head of Japanese Seismologist Dr. F.

President Roosevelt mentions the unfortunate in cident of the Japanese scientist's hat In an interview on the Japanese ques tion. , Careful scrutiny of the record would have shown President Roosevelt that one of his own appointees — not the citizens of San Francisco- — was respon sible for this "anti-Japanese demon stration."

Dec. 6. — "The Japan ese pelagic sealing fleet.. which reported in. Bering Sea during the summer, con sisted of at least sixteen vessels, each of which. carried a. crew of thirty men and from five to seven small boats for sealing. It was only when the crews of the schooners landed or attempted to land, that the Federal 'agents were able to. make arrests, and those of the Japanese, who were.killled. belonged to parties that were caught red-handed." These statements are made to Secre tary Metcalf by Edward "TCY Sims, who at that* time was solicitor, of the De partment of Commerce and Labor, but is. now United States district Attorney at' Chicago, of the seal \u25a0 poaching by Japanese on the Prlbylof Islands early last summer, which resulted 'in the killing of five of the "Japanese raiders, the wounding of two. and the capture of a total of twelve prisoners.

POPE RECOGNIZES NEW BISHOP Speaks at Consistory of Hostility to the Churcli in France and Spain IX FEAK OF BOMBS ROME. Dec. 6. — At the consistory which , was held today the Pop© rec ognized eighty-four bishops. Including the Most Rev. ...James H. Blenk as Archbishop of New Orleans; Monstgnor John B. Morris as Coadjutor Bishop of. Little Rock. Ark., and Monsignor Giuseppe Aversa. papal delegate in Cuba, as Archbishop of Sardt The most significant appointments were those of ten new French bishops, \u25a0which were made without any opposi tion on the part of the French Gov«nv rnent. In his oculation the Pope said that every day the increasingly sad storm of vicissitudes is beating down on the church, involving great misery. "More than ever now." the Pontiff said, ."the church can be compared with a ship buffeted by the waves "in the midst of the ocean. But our faith does not vacillate in the least. Indeed, we are more than ever sustained by our belief in the efficacious assistance of Christ, who -when the time to succor us comes, will command the wind and sea to go down so that the perfect tranquillity so much desired will beam on us." "The greatest comfort of Catholi cism." the Pope added, "is the singular concord which prevails throughout the episcopacy, which is fully united to us. May God make aTI Catholics conform to these most brilliant examples of their pastors. "This imposes a sacred duty on the Christian profession which is empha sized by the present needs of religion, namely that <here alluding to France) there is hostility against the church. The people there should be urged to proceed with compact strength, and in those regions (alluding to Spain) wher© hostility is threatened Catholics should generpusly sink all personal animosi ties and dissensions and neglect so means permitted by the law and by the Christian conscience to overcom© the evil." It was asserted after the ceremony that the real reason for the change from a public to a private consistory was that the Vatican authorities feared that an attempt might be made against the life of the Pope at a public consis tory. This apprehension was based on the bomb outrage in St. Peter's on November 14.. and also on the threaten ing letters recently addressed to the Pope.
