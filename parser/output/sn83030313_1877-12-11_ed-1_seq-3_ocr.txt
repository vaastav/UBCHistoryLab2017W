A Strong Feeling in Favor of the Preservation of Peace. SENATOR EUST1S SWORN IN. Activity of tho Currency Inflationist**. FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. Washington, Doc. 10, 1877. TOT 8ILVHB QUESTION IN THE senate?de isate on MB. Matthews' besulution. Senator Matthews made hie maiden speech In the Benato to-day on hia silver resolution, and made a favorable Improsaion. He apoke boldly, and even the Senators who did not agreo with bun listened. Gen erally Senators do not listen to speeehea at all. Toward the cloae of the discussion Senator Conkling very neatly nut a spoke In the silver wheel by giving notice that be would movo to change the character of Mr. Matthews' roaolution. as tt stands, and aa be Introduced It It la a concurrent resolution, and which doas not need the signature ol the President, and, If passed, would be be a mere ex pression of opinion without lores ol any kind. Mr. Conkl'ng proposed to make It e joint resolution which oalls lor not only adoption by botn Houses, but the elgnataro ol the Prestdont, and which, of coarse, the President may voio. He explalnod that his ob: Ject was to prevent a mere paper motion. He preferred to bring up the question In a proper and deolalve shape, so that It snould, as he remarked, test not only the sense of tho Senate and of the other House, which would doubtless approve It, but also of the Executive, which wus presumed to have a voice tn this as In other matters under the ooustttuiion. A mere concurrent resolution effected nothing, A Joint resolution would, It it should be passou and signed, have the torce of law, and he had no doubt the friends of the resolution would prefer It In that shapo. But the friends of tho resolution evidently bad serious objections. They were alarmed and annoyed It Mr. Conkllng's blow, bat they could not evado It, end to-morrow, accordingly, tho Senato will vote on Mr. Conkllng's motion, and the strength or weakness if the ultra silver men In the Senate will be known. It will be literally a show ol bands, for the resolution if Mr. Matthews plumply declares that all gov iromeat bonds Issued under various acts up to and Including that of 1875 are payable at the option pf the government In gold or silver dollars, and that to coin silver dollars or the old value and pay the bonds with them is not a violation of the public faith. Thla is a cardinal article Id the oreed of the extreme silver man, and those have boasted lreqnently of lata tbat they ere io a large majority in the Mounts. Mr. Conkllng's motion will be a test of their strength, and ho has very eflootively prevented their approaches by sap and mine, and forced them to capture the Seuato by storm if at alL I When, last Thursday, Mr. Allison roported the Silver Mil te the donate, and moved to make It ? special order for Tuesday, Mr. Morrill moved to amend by making It the special order for January 11, nod this was defeated by 40 to 18. Mr. Allison's motion was Asreupon carried, 41 to 18. 01 the eighteen who were opposed to taking up the bill until January eleven were republicans end seven democrats, and Judge Oavls voted witb those who wanted tho bill immediately considered, but this vote, though U showed greater strength lor the measure tnan was supposed to exist, was by no means a tost, as some who wished for immediate considera tion would not vote for It, evon with tne amontlmenia. Senator Thurmnn to-day openly look his placo among tho silver men, supporting the Matthews resolution, but when ho said that gold had gone down sinco last Thursday, when the Senate agreed to taxe up the Sil. ver bill, Mr. Edmunds took him up rather sharply, asking bun if be knew the price ol silver to day as well as gold. Mr. lhuruan confessed that he did not, and Mr. Edmunds retorted that Senators ought not to come to the diBcurslon of so important a matter with ?o little knowledge. FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT.

THE CONFERENCE OF THE CURRENCY INFLA TIONISTS?OBJECTS SOUGHT TO BE AT TAINED?INFLATION LITERATURE TO BE DIS SEMINATED. Tbe object of the conference of currency inflation ists, held bere lust Saturday evening, has been mis represented In most ol tbe accouuts given of the meeting. The coutereuco was called by Sonator Jones, who was tho only Senator present, although It la understood that Senator Ferry Is >n full sym pathy with Its object. The Congressmen present Were Messrs. Swing, Holler, Duckner, Uartzell and Phillips. Tbe rest of tbe assemblage was made up chiefly of e number ol orators and essayists In tho cause o( inflation wbo do not, as yet, onjor Congressional honorx No new parly or independent movement is contemplated. Tbe meeting discussed the bost way to disseminate Inflation argument* in the Eastern Stales where, aa all present eompitlnod, tbe newspapers as a goneral thing overslaughed and sup prosiod the views and opinions of the greenback and Silver men. Tho Associated Press, too, was an ob tiacio to the disaemlnutlon of inflation ideas. It slurred over the speeches and pnblto utterances of the edvoceles of greenbacks and silver. To torroct all this, aud to enable and eneourage the dis tribution Of Inflation theories It was decided to organ ize a Congressional executive commines, with head quarters In Washington, irotu which to send out to tho public in pamphlet lorm or other advisable shape nil decumonte and papers bearing upon tbe subject, particularly tbe speeches delivered in Congress in favor ol the sliver bill and tho bill to repeal tho Resumption net, and tbe letter olMr. J. W. Sbuokers, of Philartel pbia, la reply lo General Gardcld, recently published In lb* Hxhald. This is all thsre is in tbe way ol a movement. There is no In tention to dsiturb present political organizations, put lo make the question a distinct Issue Insido the lines ot both parlies. A proposition was adopted to make the committee consisi, as far as might be, of on* Souuior and one Congressman from esoh State, but whon tbls plan como to bo carried out It was found to pinko only a skeleton-Ilk* committee, el least as to the senatorial part of II Arrangements for s second meeting previous to the holiday adjournment ot Congress are being made by a comml'tee consisting of Senator Jones, of Nevada, and Representatives Phillips, of Kansas, and Bnckner, of Missouri.

One member, either e Senator or Representa tive, has been aeleetod for each Slate and Territory With greenback representation In Cengrees, General j Ewlng Insists that iIm movement is entirely a non partisan affair, sad aril I divide rattier upon territory than upon part/ llnaa. Ha aaja that one ol the first steps that will lollow tbe organisation of tbe Intelli gence Boreea will be tbe printing of n great number of greenback soil silver speeches tbat have been de livered in Congress In reoent /ears, and tbat they can be Urns Iran iced sway as a part of tbe Congressional record.

PROCEEDINGS OP CONGRESS. SENATE. Wasuinoton, Deo. 10, 1877. Mr. Waoi.eiuh, (rep.) o! N. II., cbarman ol the Com mittee on i'rivilege* and Flections, called up, as a matter ol privilege, th* resolution reported from thai committee last work declaring J. B. JCustls entitled le a seat a# Senator irom Ij>alsiaoa irem January 13, 1676, lor the term eneing March S, 1870. TH! KISOBITT vtxw. Mr. I so alms, (rep.) ol Kanraa, who signed tbe minority roport, reviewed the etreumstences aiioud Ing tho eleotlon of Mr. Euatia, and said tbere were tUieo question* involved in this ante, bat two ol them ooly sure raiorrcd to m tbo report ol tbe committee. First, as to whether ne war lawfully elected; and setond, whether at the lime ol his election a vacancy existed which the Legislature ol Louisiana haa tho right to nil. The third question, a* to whether th* pipers or credentials belore tho Boost* constituted a pr!m& facie caae, upon which be could be seated, era* not referred to. The papers presented by Mr. Fastis were merely wtt.it purported to be transcripts of toe proceedings of tho Lecitlaiore, but mere was do curtiilc ae of ttie Governor as to bis election, sod it did not appear I bat tbe Governor had been asked to give suctt certiflcuie aud declined to do so. In inu next place it did not uppoar tttat auy quorum ot tbn two bouses of tbe Legislature was present ivPen the eleeiiuu was held, and that was a tatal omis sion ; besides, tbe pamphlet claiming to be a record si ; the proceedings ot tbe Legislature was awt aaftbentl ' cuted. He then quoted si length from mob paoinhkot, aud uiado su extended argument upon Ills legal as pects ol tbe esse claiming iuo Senate should eetU* now and for all tune tbe queattou ol propar crass Hals, See. do isr as tbo admission ol Mr. Basils was cuucerued there was no uecesaiiy whatever for say partisan view of tbe case. The Legislature Ol Lmiisi nna is now democratic, and it would bs In session lu January, 1878; therefor#, eboeld tbe Senate uold mat Mr. Kustii bad not s sufficient tttia to tbe seat tba | Legislature would return bitn or some other democrat to ibe Senate. Ho then quoted irom tbe set of July 115, 1800, prescribing tbe manner ol oonduoilag tbo election lor -enators, aud said now was the proper tune lor tbe Sonute to giro a proper construction to that act. That statute was one ol tbe bad results ol ihe war. It arose irotn ibe turbulence, the disquiet produced by the war, and was one of its worst re sults. In conclusion, Mr. Ingalls argued tbst there was no vacancy In tbe Senate at tbo lime Mr. Kuttls was elected; that tbe case ol Mr. 1'iiiobbtcK was then ponding before tbe Sonata, and was not settled until tbreo months subsequent to the election of Mr. Rustle. Mr. Wahlbioh, of Xew Hampshire, said bis friead (Mr. IngalU) objected, io ilia admission of Mr. Basils because bo bad not tbe certificate oi tbe Governor as to bis tiiecnou. U appeared in the evtdeuca before toe Committee on Privileges sod Rlectluns tlist be did apply to tbe Governor lor his certificate, and tbe Gov ernor replied be did not know how be could give it, baviug already given one to Mr. Pinchbaolc. The ab sence of this corlificute did not affect tbe title ol tbo olaimunt. He then referred to tbe pamphlet setting lorili the proceedings ol toe Legislature, .imt said no oue ever doubted ita authenticity. Tho committee re garded it as the true record ol ibe proceedings, and it showed that Mr. Eustt* was duly elected. No charges were made against Mr. Euntia ol any Improper con duct to secure his election, and it was admitted by all partlos that be was a proper person to fill iuo seat, do lar us the question of a vucauuy si the lime ol bis election wus concerned tbe c?mmiiieo was not en tirely tree from doubt, but nobody contested the right of Mr. Kustia io bis seat now, and the State oi Louisi ana was entitled to ber twe Senators upon this Moor, lb couclus:ou, be spoke ol the duty ol tba Hen a to to admit me claimant und thus have tbe state ol Louisi ana, so loug without representation, now fully repre sented.

INDIAN CITIZENSHIP. The Vice President thou laid bolors the Senate the speciul order lor to-day, bclug the bill to enable Indians to become citizens ol tut United Stales. Mr. Ixuallb, who has cbargo ol that bill, said be bed beeu spoken to by several Senators who desired more time to consider it, und he thoreloro moved that It be made the tpceiui oruer for the 15th day ol January next. So ordered. * MIL MATTHEWS' SILVER KH.VOLLTION. Mr. Matthews, of Onto, then called up fToin the tabic tho coucurrent resolution submitted by him ou Thursday last, declaring tho right ol tho govornmotit to pay tbo principal and Interest ol tbo bouds in stiver dollars containing 412>i grams ot standard silver. Mr. Matthews said the General Assem bly of tbe State ol Obio at Its session lust winter adopted a resolution tavorlog the restoration ol tbe silver dollar. Tbe lesoluilou was passed with great unanimity, there being but three negative votes in the House ol Kepreeeutativve and one in the Senate, and be bud no doubt that it expressed the considerate and deliberate opinion ol the people oi that Stale on tho subject with tho same uoauitnity ovmoed by their representatives in the passage ot tbo resolution. He bad been moved in part by that resolution to submit tbo one now belore tbe Senate, though his resolution did not cover tho wbole ground. l hat oil no Ohio Assembly expressed tbe opinion that saeb restoration of tho silver dollar was ueaiaaded by true financial wisdom, ana declared It would be in pursuance ol a proper public pelicy to do so. It was not now bis purpose to discuss the latter propemtten m to what would bq ex pedient and politic lor tne government aud the poeple > to do, but what would be right to do. In his opinion It would bo right tor the government to do so, and he used the word "right" in Its legal, equitable and moral sense, it was his purposo to-uny briefly io show that by the letter and spirit ol tho law tbe govarumsnt had iuo right to restore tbo silver dollar and would bo jusiiticd in doing so, and lurtbor to show tbut outside of the law, takiuc in view nil tbe circumstances ol ibe case, ovory incident of the financial legislation, that the restoration of the dollar would not he in violation ol tho declaration ol public honor, public Justice or public oqutty. TDK WORD "COIN."' He then quoted Irom the act to eirongthon tbe pub lic credit, approved March 18, 180U, and argued ihat the word "coin," as used in ibis aot, must not be inter preted to reier to geld lu cotu aione. II It must be so interpreted, then it would be Just as dishonorable, Just as illegal, to ply tbe liuited Males Treasury notes now circulating as money In anytbing else but gold ooln as it would bo topiy the bonds with anytbing but such coin. There wcro Senators here who were lamillar with circumstances attending the passage of this law and the history ol legislation aulecodcnt to tin pas sage. The question that it was deslcned to solve was not a doubtful one. Tbo greenbacks bad bcun made a legal tender for all debts and demands, public and privmo, except interest on tne public uobt and lor customs duties. The question had. ihcrelore, boon ugituted as to whether tbo principal ol the debt mt(bt not lawfully be paid lb greenbacks, and to meet lae question, lo answer It lb the nega tive, tbe Public Credit act of 1800 was passed. In bis opinion tho original indebtedness ot the country could never have ueen liquidated uuder any other cur rency than coin dollars. It could not liavo been set tled wilb mere promises to pay, in lieu of com dul. lars. That act woa intended to'settie any question of poy ing tbe principal of these bonds, sod it did seem to blm that it it had been contemplated that these bonds should be paid only with gold money It would bavo been so stated; that lu undertaking to settle a doubt this siiituta would not have raised anew one. The act of I860 declared me goverumeut would pay colu dollars. And what did coin moan at that day ? Nothing was coin la this country ex cept that wnieli by law might be coasted as money, and there was on the statute books at that tuna another law which proscribed now many grams ol gold there should do in gold coin and how many grsins of silvor in silver coin, una Irotn the Iteginning ol tbe government down to that time tbo silver dollar was known to tho people ol tbe country as one ol our coins. He next quoted irotn the set of 1862, tbe fifth sec tion ol wbicb provided in.v. all duties on imports should bo nayablo in coin, and com so received should bo set apart an a special fund lor certain purposes, Ace., und argued that up to tbo act ot 1873, winch dropped the silver dollar from the coin ol ibeUnilod Slates, silver dollars were receivable lor customs duties and were pledged ler tbo payment ol interest on tho public debt. Tn* act of 1870. He next quoted Irom too act of July 14, 1870, to au thorize iho refunding ot tbe naiiouai debt, ana said it was intended to ue a now startiug point id tbe history of tho public debt. It was intended to define with tbe utmost precision the medium lar tho redemption ot Ibeee bonds Tbe measure ol tho value ol those bonds wut most explicitly declared. They were doclarea to bo redeemuule "in coin of tne present standard value" and bounng Interest, payable aemi-annuuliy, in such coin. Thera was do ambiguity about those terms there wus no doubt about wbat more words meant. the act was ae free from any possi ble siiado ol doubt as words could make It. It referred io tho standard com iboa in existence ana no matter how much such coin might be depreciated or dooased. appreciated or Increased In value by tbe exerclee ol me sovereign power of iho government, still (hat ahoald not alleci tbe rights of ihe holders ol theae bonds wbou tbey matured, but the governmeat would deliver to ibem so mauy pieces of gold or so many piece* el silver at were known lo ibejaw when the bonds were issued. He arguod thai all the bonds, by their terras, by tho plain and proper menningof iho words on tlioin, were redeemable in the coins known 4o ilia statutes ol tbe Untlod Slates at the time such bonds were authorised. TflK BPECIK RXSCMITION ACT. He tbon referred t? the apecio Hcsumptloo act of 1875, and staled thai prior lo the passage of that act, hut subsequent lo tne act of 187U, to wit, by the art ot 1073, a new coinage was established winch dropped Irom tbe list ol authorized coins of tho United States wliai hud always been known lo our law as tbe silver dollar Now, lu law or lu morals, what difference did that maker Thu United States, as one ol tne parties to s contract, could not of its own motion change tbe cootiact, tlierelore tbst act did not affect tbe holders ol tbo bonds Tbe rorititls contained in nts pre amble aud resolution logically end legally Justified the conclusion that It was necessary lor tho govcrnmout to roiraco us steps and restore the luw as it waa prior to 1873, put back the silver dollar as It stood, a legal lender Tor the payment of ail bonds, snd to do to woo Id not be in violation ol the public laith nor in derogation or tbe rights ol tbo public creditor.

Mr. Mattiibws?Wo did not agroe to puy in copper.

The question raised by his resolution was a legal one, and wnenever the main question came up as to the remonelizalion of silver ho (Mr, Morrill) would bo prepured to ex press his views upon it, and ho hoped to he nble 10 show lhat II would be cheaper and beltor (or tho United btntos to pay Its debts lu gold. The Senator Irom Obio (Mr. Matthews) had set out with tho declaration tbai wo bad ibo equitable and legal right to par our bond! In siivor. It roust be Known to tbat Senator that for forty yoors the country had not ooined silver dollars except for exportation, aud only a small amount for that purpose. During all tbia time tho govern I had been tneut liad been lu receipt ol gold Irom customs duties, every doliur of which wua pledged lor tho payment ol iho pttollo dent. Could It ha possible now ibat Con gress could say a debt so contracted could be paid in anytblng but gold? Ho quoted from tho act of February 26, 1842, to establish tho sinking fund, Ike., ami said If ihat should bo carried out tho whole debt of the government would be paid In a very short time. It did aoem to him tbat tho pabhc lattb had been pledged to pay the boods In gold coin. Uur Secretaries ol tho Treasury had gtvou ?ttch pledges, and their acts bave never been repudi ated by Congresa He quoted Irom seotlon 4 of the tourteeuln amemlmenl to tbe Constitution of tbe United Slates in regard to the validity of tbe pablto dobt, and astd that amendment waa adopted to prevent tbuso from tbe .Southern Slates questioning Its validity and not to light the heresies of Ohio. Now, in this time of reoonelltation, when the Southern representatives had been rebapuzo.l in patriotism, tie appealed to ibetn to reject the proposition ol tbe Senator from Oblo. There were various other points ol that Senator's i-pcnoh to which he would like to reler bad be tbe time to do so, hut ono point in puriicular he could uot pass. Thu Senator (Mr. Mstlbows) spoke of locking up money iu order to gam ihoreoy. Did he not kuow that there had uever been a time in the history ol tbe government wbon money could be obtained more readily or at leas Interest. He moved tho reference ol tb? resolu tion iu tbo Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. CoKKi-isr, said he wished to submit an amend ment beluro its reference, and that was to strike out tbo word", "lie it roeoived by the Seuato (tbe Houeo of lUprcseutailvea concurring therein)," and insert in lieu thereof the words, "Resolved by tbo Senalo aud House ol Representatives. " He said his purposo was to uiakn It a Joint resolution instead of a coucnrrent resolution, so ibat. It It were udopted, It would go to tbe President for bla signature. Ibo natloual Execu tive bad deposited with him oue-sixth ol tba legisla tive power, and In a case of aach Importance as tbla be tnougbt there should be an expression of tne lull legislators power. Mr. Tpphuax, (dem.) of Ohio, arguod tbat It waa perfectly competent for either braneb ef Congress to declare its opinion as to what was the law of lbs land, uod It was perloctly competent for tbe two houses of Congress to do so by a concurrent resolution, and If Congress entertained an opinion as to an existing state ol tne law that opinion should not be nullillcd by u veto of Ibo President. Ho wanted everybody to un derstand the opinion of Congress and then tbe l'rcsluent mighiuci as be saw Dt bonrsfter; but he did not nsk tbe I'residont lor bis opinion now. Tbe resolution submitted by bis colleague (Mr. Msttbews) raised a simple question of law. Tnoro was no ne cessity for referring It to a commuter. There was nothing upon tbe subject bat ono or two statutes, and no report any oumniiuce could m.ike would lossf-n the debate In the Meoutn one boar. He was marvellously curious to kuow by what reason any lawyor could ar rive at any other conclusion tbau that expressed in tbe resolution of lite colleague. Mr. Edmund* said the question with blrn at tbe proa oni mom jdi was. What would be the effect of tne pass age of this resolution upon the public credit ? It pro posed to deelare tne opinion oi the two nouses ol Con gress not as a law, and what effect would tbat hare upon the actual condition of things ? Was It not more candid. It Congress was to say anything affecting ibo publlo credit, that It should bo done by law la a manner that would he binding boreafter? Such a resolution as ibis would do nothing effective. It would not Injure tho rich bondholder. Tbe bloated bondholder was geuerally able to take care ol himself, but it would ll()uro the widow, the orphan, tne labor ing classes who had Invested tho money In govern ment bonds and enable speculators and gamblers to gamble on the public credit. He favored tbe amend mvnlol the Senator from New York. Mr. Tuubmaii raid be bad been ulee years In tbe Senate, and If tbero had been any flnoo oial legislation for tbe bonefli of the widow and or phan or laboring classes be had failed to see It. Tbn .Senator from Vermont warned the Senate tbat tots resolution would endanger the pubil credit. Sinco tho .Senator spoke be (Mr. Thurmau) bud opened bis Now York paper. Mr. Knsixns?What is tbe name of the paper?' Mr. 1 tin km as?It is the New York Wvrld, which I know tbe Senator from Vermont rends daily with In tense uuniirntion. (Laughter.) Continuing his re mark* he said the (Senate last week made the Silver hnl the special order for to-morrow, and he saw when he opened his paper Ihm gold was one-MXieenlli lower lor Uie week. He turned then to government stocks and be lound that every houd ol the United Mates had risen in value since mat bill was made tbo special order. Mr. Mokbim.?How much has silver fnllan since tbo Blari'l bill passed? Mr. TituawAM replied?You bsvs demonetized silver. It la nut quoted. The Senator assumed fust gold was au immeasurable standard Of valvo with which every thing else mast be eomparod. Tbero never had been In bis humble Judgment, ol all the humbugs ba ever knew of, more of a lurobug than aboat this tfilver bill. Mr. Edmunds?I think so too, (Laughter.) Mr. I n t'KM a it, continuing, said there waa one class of people who thought if the bill rhould pass all they would havo to do would bo to bold up their bats aud silver dollars would rain into them; end there was another class who thought ibo public credii would be rained by It. Thorn was no reason for any such sup position. Any such Idea was Inllncioos. he emn mouied on the report of the dooretary of tbe Treas ury In regard to tbe remonetization of silver, and arguod that It would not be ?n injury to the government bat a groat boneflt to Ibe whole people. .Should tho Silver mil be passed to-day every dollar of tne publio indebtedness could bo funded at lour per cent. Pending discussion tbe Sonata, at Ova o'clock, ad journed by a vote of?yeas SO, nays 2fl?not ? test vote, as many Senators known to b* in lavor of tbn resolution voted for an adjournment ou account of the lateness of tho hour.

Mr. Urwitt, couiinuing, enldTnis passigo looks In two diriiCilvus.

The perusal of the documents accompanying that Message will convince tbe House that our reUuont witn Mexico are in a very critical condition. Already aoveral dciaciimoots of troops, acting uuuer tbe orders ol Ibo 1'resnJeut, transmitted lo General Ord, have invaded the Mexican territory against the protest ui the de lacto govern ment ol that oouuiry, which, although it has been In power longer than the proscnt admitilstranou, has not yet been formally recognizod by our government.
