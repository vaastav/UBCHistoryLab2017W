Besides, what might prove to be very good labor In the Philippines might not be so suit able for Hawaii and, as 1 have already said, there are other sources for Ha waii to look to and we can get all the good Europeans we want. "If we want to build up Hawaii's population In the right manner we should not bo bothering with the Fili pinos. Get Europeans and pay them better wages than are now being offer ed.
