Eals was a farmer liv ing near Brownlngsvllle, and his wife deserted him for John Fields, a tenant on the place. Eals induoed his wife to return, and also Fields, whom he shot on Tuesday, death ensu ing the next day. Eals defied arrest and since then a posse has been en deavoring to locate him. Eals was well armed. He took refuge in a hut. A large posse came upon the hut Sat urday night. When an attempt was made to attack it, Eals fired upon them from within. It was deemed best to wait for daylight and Sunday at dawn the attack was made. When the rush was made for the heavy timber Eals began firing. A man named McCombs fell mortally shot, dying in a few minutes, and two men named Wells and Herbert were seriously shot The storming party effected an entrance to the hut and a horrible sight met their gaze.

Philadelphia, Dec. 8. Herman W. Mudgett, alais H. II. Holmes, who was convicted of murder in the first degree for having caused the death, in this city, of Benjamin F. Peitzel, was Sat urday morning in the court of Oyer and Terminer, refused a new tiral and sentenced to be hanged. The opinion denying the accused a new trial was delivered by Judge Arnold, it having been concurred in by judges Thayer, Willson and Arnold, who heard the ap plication fora new trial. Judge Arnold then pronounced the death sentence. Holmes who had been brought into court to hear the opinion, was not affected by the udverse decision, and when Judge Arnold in deliberate tones sentenced him to be "hanged by the neck until dead," the air of appa rent indifference which was so mani fest throughout the celebrated trial was not deviated from by the alleged multi-murderer. Holmes was then re turned to the county prison and a death watch was placed over him. The date of execution will be fixed by Gov. Bastings. ' It is believed that the case will be appealed to the supreme court MAXIMO GOMEZ, The Lender of the Cuban Insurgents, Ite pulsed The Spaniards Elnted. Washington. Dec 3.

Joe Robertson and Ozlas McGaha, Negroes, who were Friday morning sentenced to twenty-one' years each for rape in the circuit court, at Lewisburg, were taken from the jail at Fayettevllle Friday night by a mob of 300 men and hanged in the court house yard. The Negroes reached Fayettevllle from Lewisburg at 2 o'clock Friday af ternoon, in charge of Sheriff Menefec, of Marshall county, and four deputies. The whole party was locked in the baggage car, and tho sheriff was en. deavoring to get to the branch prison at Tracy City with his prisoners. When the train came to a stop at Fayetteville, a mob of over two hun dred men acting on a message from parties at Lewisburg, demanded the prisoners. Sheriff Mcnefee refused and then the crowd threatened to put dynamite under the car. The sheriff would not budge. However, when the engineer started to couple up the train for the purpose of pulling out, a stal wart fellow drew a bead on him with a double-barreled shotgun. Then Col. T. N. Holman and W. B. Lamb addressed the mob and urged ahem to let the train and its cargo pro ceed. The leaders declined, but after considerable parley, agreed to let the train go if the car with the officers and Negroes was side-tracked. This was finally agreed to. Sheriff Menefee and Sheriff Sher rell, tho latter of Lincoln county, then held a conference with the result that the officers and their deputies formed a hollow square and marched the pris oners off to jail, bheriff Menefee also wired Gov.

Robertson and McGaha were taken to Lewisburg Friday morning from the Davidson county jail. They ar rived there at 1:10 o'clock, at once sub mitted their cases, were sentenced and Started to prison. The courtroom was crowded with armed men, not a few having Winchester rifles. The mob would have gotten the Ne groes there, but knew that Sheriff Menefee and his deputies were deter mined to prevent such action. As soon as the prisoners left the leaders began sending messages to friends at Fay ettevllle to stop the train and hold the Negroes until they could get there. Robertson was charged with attempt ed assault upon a Miss Stewart. He only missed -lynching a few weeks ago by the officers who arrested him near Bell Buckle, being warned not to bring him to Lewisburg. McGaha was charged with assaulting a 13-year-old white girl.
