Eldorado 7.V pfllitau. Last winter there were four special land agents appointed from Kansas, by the gen eral government, Al. Green, Geo. Orncr, luos. James and Tom Cavauaugb. Their duties have taken them all over the United Ssates, where public lands arc to be found In view of tbe recent fraudulent entries of lands unearthed in the Wichita district, It may bo interesting to know what work Is being done by these agents. Commissioner Jlcrarlaud, of the general land ofiice, was icisrviewed by a ctv York Trilunt report er, wutn tie said, In answer to the question, "Uow Is the system of special agents work- ingj" "The special agents have hem In the Held about air months, and reports from some of them are received every day. I have examined and acted upon about 800 Illegal unu irauuuicnt entries reported by them. Those entries cow red about 128,000 acres, of which the government would have been deprived except for tho new service." 'In eighty cases only, out of the 600 ex amined under this system, have objections been oficrcd to the proposed cancellation of the entries." A very large per cent, of these lands have been pre-empted by cowboys from the Tex as anil Indian Territory ranges, and the money for proving up has been furnlsbej by ranchmen and cattle companies. The lands were selected lying along the streams reaching for miles and miles, said streams were Immediately enclosed in wire leiico, and In this way the poor settler coming In to the country with a family and a half a dozen bead of cattle was crowded out both for the want ol water and land, as the best land In tboe counties, in fact the only land that Is stiseeptlblc of cultivation, is em braced In tho valleys along the streams. And tiulcss tlie.e fraudulent entries arc cancelled and the land thrown open for set tlement, us it ought to be, it will remain a herding ground with only here and there a settler when eery quarter section ought to have a settler upon IL Senator Ingalls' bill, just introduced, will defeat nil further fraudulent entries. It proposes to amend the homestead act by prohibiting commu tation thereunder until two years have elapsed from the dale of settlement, one year of which must bo of record In the land otllco. It also repeals the provision law un der which local land ofllrcrs arc authorized to receive relinquishments and Immediately throw the claims relinquished open to en try. In effect, It requires all relinquish ments to bo forwarded to the commissioner ol the gedcral land otllce and approved by blm before the land In question is thrown open to entry. It is expected that the inauguration of tbe measures proposed by these three bills will result in limiting the amount or public land a single Individual can securo under government title to 100 acres. To secure land under these bills, two years actual res idence will bo necessary, with the payment of ?1.U5 per acre. Five years actual resi dence will secure 100 acres without tho payment of money. Stafford county people arc all torn up about a railroad from Denver to Jlcmphis, and propose to vote bonds to the amount of three thousand dollars per mile for each mile the road runs through the county, which is a bad break for tbe Stafford coun ty folks to make at this time. There will be plenty of time to vote bonds to a railroad company after the road has been built up to, or near the county line, or at least after Cii somo ol tbe road Is constructed, and not all ijli.n paper. If the county tics herself up In bonds to some company wbo perhaps do not own a foot of railroad, but who pro pose to build one beginning no place and ending at a place they cannot reach on ac -v couun et a' lone.b count or tbo route selected for they cannot right-of-way through tbo territory, will ever regret It, for In tho meantime, ongbtfore the time expires for building the road for which the bonds arc voted, an actual, live, lure enough road will appeir at their border and knock for ndmlssion and aid, a favor they will bo powerless to grant, consequently tbe road Will pass them by taking some other route.,AValt gentle men until tho D., -M & A.

For tho fiscal year ending June SO, ?1.H,178,7.V or tbo public dent was paid off, and there were about ?400,O0O,000 IcR in the treasury. The president thinks that National taxes can be still further cut down, hut docs not advo cate any sweeping reduction of tho reve nues. The treasury department recom mends that the tariff on sugar be taken off. Senator Ingalls will soon Introduce a bill, providing that any person who encloses an area of public lands to which be has no ti tle shall be liable to a fine of ?100 a dsy ror the time such enclosure is maintained, and any person who obstructs the passage of another over or through the public domain shall, lor every offense, pay the aggrieved person 300.

Carlisle was elected speaker of tbe lower bouse of Congress. He was backed by a wild aouth and won. Wichita Eagle. Why didn't tbe Eagle publish the ballot taken la tbo Democratlccaucusf That bal lot shows tbe statement or the Eagle to be false. We give a portion or the ballot else where in our columns, from which it will be seen that Carlisle was backed as much by a solid West and Xortb-west as by a sol Id South. Tbe cry of "solid South," "con federate brigadiers," "shot-gun policy of tbe South," etc, etc., has been tbe stock In trade of the Uepubllcon party lor years. We do not believe, however, that it will ever again be able to rfde Into power by an appeal to tbe prejudices merely of one sec tion of the country. Wellington iJemocrat. ' Well, let us see where the Carlisle vote came Irom. In the Democratic caucus for the nomination of a speaker, IBS votes were cast, of which 83 were from the Southern States. Or these, 72 were cast ror Carlisle, 19 for Ilandall aud 4 for Cox. In other words, three-fourths of the "olld South" went for Carlisle, and he received In addi tion, only 33 votes. North or the l'otiniac and cast or the Allegbantes he received but one vote, that or Morse, or Massachusetts. Or Ilandall's OS votes, only 33 were cast by Northern members, aud or Cox's, 28 or the 32 were cast by Northern members. Thus it will be seen that more than two-thirds of the Northern votes were cast against Car lisle, while three-fourths of the Southern votes were cast for him. The "solid South" had a majority ol only two votes in the caucus, but It carried off four or the six offices to be filled. Mr. Carlisle, In a speech In 1S7G, during bis canvass ror Congress, said : "I deny that tbe United States is a Na tion. It Is a vicious system that has de stroyed sovereign States and oppressed nine millions or people in the South, if a State has no right of secessions, she cer tainly has the right or revolution. The ltepublicau party wants another amend ment to the constitution. Why do they want it? Is it not that the government shall take the school fund into Its own bands, and appoint a commissioner who shall select the teachers and series ol books to be used In the schools, and your ehild and my child be denied the right to learn the alphabet except In such a book a shall learn them to lorget Wnshingtnn, Jackson, Jefferson and the statesmen of Virginia and the South" We don't know what you would call sol id if 72 out of llj is not solid. So lar as the shot-gun policy and bloody shirt is concern ed, allow us to call jour attention to the late massacre at Danville, Virginia; but then there were only seven killed aud they were Ncgars, And when the States were called, by the clerk of the house, fur leprc sentatives to come lorward and be qualified ninety of them could not swear that they had never borne arms against the Uni ted Stales, or furnished aid to her enemies. "Do jou hear the rebel yell J" said one ltandall Democrat to auoth.tr, when the Democratic caucus bad nominated Carlisle and his friends were cheering. The selec tion or a Mlssotirian for chief clerk, Mr. Clark, who was a brigadier-genera! of the confederacy; a Texan Tor door-keeper, three of the best places in the gift of the house, means a "solid .South" ir it means anything. And it mean that the country is destined to hear the rebel yell a number of times before the present scf sion of Con gress adjourns. lu the language or Major Edwards, Democrat, to bis paper In St.Joc, "The Southern confederacy is again in the saddle, and is pushing things." 

INGALLS' LAND LAWS. The three bills relating to public lauds Introduced by Senator Ingalls, arc design cd to materially simplify the operations of the general land oflice,and change iu sever al important particulars the method of ac quiring title to public lands. The first provides for the repeal of the pre-emption laws, but authorizes a second homestead entry by persons who, having made one homestead entry, have, for any reason (ailed to perfect title and who, at the same time, never made filiug under the pre-emption aet. The second repeals the limber culture law, but permits title to be perfected In ac cordance with the provisions of that law upon all claims entered before the passage of tbe repealing act. The third and last of the scries proposes to amend tbe homestead act by prohibiting commutation thereunder until two years bavo (lapsed from date of settlement, one year or which must be or record in tho land office. It also repeals tho provision of the law under which local land officers are authorized to receive relinquishments and immediately throw claims relinquished open to entry. In efl'cct it requires all re linquishments to be forwarded to the com missioner of the general land office and ap proved by him bcrorc the land in question Is thrown open to entry. Tbe eflect of this series or measures If they became laws will be to limit the amount of public land, a single individual can secure to one claim 100 acres. Land may be secured after two years' actual res idence thereon by paying fcl.2 per acre, or after five years' residence, for nothing. The provision in respect to relinquish ments Is designed to put a stop to the prac tice or filing entries upon public lands and holding them for the purpose of selling the relinquishments to incoming settlers. Un der tbe existing laws a citizen may obtain three claims one each under the home stead, pre-emption and timber culture laws. He secures the timber culture claim with out residence, aud maup purchase prc-emi-tlon and homestead claim after six months' actual residence. FOR EX-SOLDIERS. Representative Hill will Introduce a bill at the earliest opportunity providing that surviving soldiers or the late war including privates, non-commissioned and commiss ioned officers, shall be entitled to public lands iu allotments graded according to length of service, and widows and minor children of deceased soldiers shall be enti tled to the amount which would bo under tbis law allotted to the husband or father. Allotments of land shall be divided as fol lows: To those wbo enlisted for three years or during the war and served twelvemonths or were honorably discharged after shorter service lor disabilities received in the ser vice, 100 acres ; to those wbo enlisted for twelvo months and actually served nine months, or were discharged after a shorter period for disabilities Incurred In tbe line or duty, SO acres; to those who enlisted Tor three mouths, served three months or were honorably discharged before the expiration of their term or service, forty acres. BELFORD'S RAILWAY BILL. The bill introduced by Mr. liclford to regulate railway traffic between tbe States and Territories provides ror tbe establish ment In the department or the interior a bureau to consist or three commissioners appointed by tbe president to receive a (al ary of 910,000 each with the necessary and proper expenses. Within ninety days after tbe appointment or the beard, railway com panies are required to forward a statement of tbe franchises and present condition of the roads. Power is conferred on tbe com missioners to examine tbe books and records or any person or company operating any railroad. Tbey ore also empowered to pre scribe tbe maximum rates to be exacted, and make regulations touching tbe pack ing and transporting of freight and tbe ac commodation of passengers. The Salt Lake AVsh (Mormon) has this to say of the president's message: The message will be nallca by mo Hire ling clergy with pleasure, and will receive an amount of 'popular support. It Is not shown In what way the destruction of our local government would effect the question of polygamy. The plural marriages of the MormoM are eot recognized by the terri torial laws and could not be dissolved by commissi, by edicts, by armies or other earthly power.

STRAINING AT A GNAT. The Constitution or tbls State provides that no Justice of the supreme court or judge or a district court' of Kansas "shall bold any other ofllco of trust or profit un der tbe authority of the State or United States, during the term ot office for which raid justices and judges shall be elected." No law to enforce this constitutional provision was ever enacted until last win ter. The purpose of this constitutional pro vision was to prevent judicial officers from holding or seeking other civil places. There is grave doubt, however, whether, without legislation to enforce it, tbe pro vision has any binding effect. A constitu tional enactment docs not enforce itself. It is doubtful, also, whether a State can prescribe any qualification for a Represen tative in Congress that is not prescribed by the constitution and laws of the United Stales, ir a Kansas judge was elected to any State or county office during bis judic ial term, he would undoubtedly be ineligi ble, liut tbe position or Representative In Congress is a United States, not a State of fice, and the constitution and laws or the United States specifically define the only qualifications necessary to constitute eligi bility to Congress. Judge S. It. l'cters was elected a Repre sentative in Congress from this State, in November, 1882, by a majority or 10,502. His term or office as judge had not expired. An attempt was made to obtain an injunc tion restraining the State Hoard ol Canvass ers from canvassing his vote and granting him a certificate of election. The courts refused to issue such an injunction. Now it appears Governor Click "aud other State officers" have scut Mr. Spring er, of Illinois, u protest against the admis sion ol Judge l'cters, "on tbe ground that under the constitution and laws of Kansas, he is ineligible to bold office." There was, however, no law of the State on this sub ject until some months after Judge l'eters was elected and had resigned his position as judge. The governor appears to be much dis tressed over the awful results that might follow this doubtful infraction of the con stitution. Nearly one hundred thousand legal voters ol Kansas a majority of 10,j02 of all tbe votes oast elected Judge l'cters to represent them, llut the governor and his adjutant-general wbo constitutes, no doubt, the "other State officers" mention edarc so distressed in mind and tortured in spirit about it that they have sent to Washington a foraial protest. As the governor and his adjutant-general appear to have developed a very ardent de votion to the constitution and laws of the State, aud aie sitting up nights devising ways and means to prevent Congiess from countenancing any infraction of them, it may not be out of place to direct their at tention to tho following section of the con stitution of Kansas: "The manufacture and sale of intoxicat ing liquors shall be forever prohibited iu this State, except for medical, scientific and mechanical purposes." This constitutional provision was supple mented by the enactment of a stringent law, providing penalties lor its violation. The governor and his 'other State officers"" meaning his adjutant-general, for no oth er State officer signed that "protest" took a solemn oath to respect and support tho constitution and laws of Kansa. It would be much more creditable to them if they would devote some of their time, energy and influence to the duty of cntorclngthese provisions of our constitution and laws which are entirely within their jurisdiction rather than to destress themselves over a technical and doubtful Infraction of a con stitutional provision by the action of Con. grcss. The governor ami his "olhcrSlatc officer," while straining at a gnat arc swal lowing a very large camel. They are at tempting to defeat by a quibble the will of the people, fairly expressed In the election of Judge l'eters, while at the same time they arc neglecting a plain duty near at hand. They are distressing themselves about a shadowy infraction of the consti tution away off at Washington, while ig noring and encouraging the substance or constitution-smashing and law-breaking at home. Champion. UNA ABROAD. Chicago, December 7th, 1SS3. To the Editor of the Eaglt. Never 111 the experience of your corres pondent, which extends over a period of well, it doesn't matter bow many years, women generally arc indefinite as to figures which betray their age have the streets of this great, enterprising city seemed more full of lifo and activity. Turn which way wc will, there arc throngs ol people rush ing in every direction, at almost any hour of tho day, aud naturally, tbe query arises, "where do all these people come Irom?" State street, the liroadway of Chicago, Is like a vast panorama, and n few days ago, securing a good post or observation, at the imminent I isk or being jostled out or my position, 1 determined to enjoy the"show" In a leisurely manner. Though lacking the charm of novelty, these street scenes can never cease to attract mc. Matinees in stifling halls, where God's glorious sun light Is carefully excluded the "subdued" light from gas being preferred may have their devotees, but give mc a drama in the opou air a little smoky though it may be where natural characters arc unconscious ly playing their part. A rcslle9s, sway ing, surging sea of humanity, ah! what a study. Stately matrons, elegantly attired, pass up the marble steps of a "first class" dry-goods store. They are or the "crcme do la crcme." A little further down tbe street, an immense stock r goods or every variety draws patrons from all ranks and classes. Silvery-haired and feeble grand pas pass Into the basement, where are found all manner of toys and trinkets dear to tho hearts of the little folks. On the up per floors, mothers and grandmas probably find pretty things to combine the useful and ornamental iu the toilets of the girls, and if I cau read aright, many oftlicru coin ing out with great parcels will be glad to be rid ol the bore or "shopping," and pass It to tho girls afore mentioned. Of course, rrom my ccrner, I can't sec what purchases are made, but cau do n good deal of guess ing. Somo of the young men going Into a large jewelry store opposite, look to the right, then to the left, as if fearful of being pursued. It is easy to guess their errand and the cause of their embarrassment. Young ladles seem to like going alono to make their purchases, tbclr motive Is quite apparent. There 1 a pretty blonde has dropped her parcel.aud the paper has burst, displaying a yes, it js a smoking cap. Weil, I hope It is ror somebody who is old and too confirmed a lover or tho weed to mend. It would be too bad to give that cap to a young man. It is so pretty he'd want to wear it all tho time, and 'twould make him bald, ror It is so warm. How some ol the men dodge through the crowd! I vvoudcr if they have learucd that some women have sharp elbows? Men and women, Utile and big, pretty and plain the women, I mean, who ever heard of a pretty" man? all trying to get there first. Only tbe young folks can afford to take time to look about tbem. Dainty misses in "Mother Hubbard" cloaks, with fair young faces peeping out from under the brims or those guant fancies called "Kate Greena way" bonnets, almost make one wish to be young again. Tiny midgets of misses, in zephyr hoods unit fleecy cloaks, prattling merrily and "blppety-hopplng" along, throw out a temptation to kidnap, but a wholesome fear or the law Is a restraining power. What food ror reflection one can gather In a few minutes spent In watching pass ers-by. How the expression of a face will linger in the memory, and tbe tone of some strange voice sound in the ear for many days. My next study will be In some ol the es tablishments that are calling out tbe crowds, of whom I've been writing. II in the rush, I am cot wholly extinguished, I may tie heard from again. Uka.

Wichita, Decembers, 1883. Ta the Editor of tt ConmovieeaUJk .- You go over Kansas In all its parts, tbls glorious year ol 1SS3, and each locality you visit seems to be exceptionally prosperous ; each town with a boom of its i-wn. Yet there arc few, If any places la Kansas, which exhibit so largely tbls feature as does Wichita. Its streets are crowded with loaded wagons, and wheat and corn overcrowd the capacity of Its many eleva tors. Tbe bridge over tbe Arkansas river Is crossed by a thousand teams a day ; one day lately a count Was made, aud the num ber reached thirteen hundred. Its hun dred restaurants show rrom tbe streets ta bles filled with eating farmers. Its old time frame rows of one-story buildings are everywhere broken in upon by new brick blocks, or two and three stories. Its hotels arc crowded full. Its sidewalks on Doug las avenue and Main street are thronged. Its ftreet railway, two miles Iongand more, seems to have a profitable patronage. Ky tbe way, Mr. Uartzell tells me tbat an ex tension or little more than another mile will be made In tbe spring. This will take the track to his park, which is a truly beau tiful spot. It lies, almost surrounded by water, at the junction of tbe Little River with tbe Arkansas. Along one tide ol the park, the first-named forms a sheet or wa ter not equaled Iu the State. A mile stretch, straight, deep and wide; such another place tor boating is not to be round in the Wot. Tbe park has a fine track ror speed ing. Mr. Uartzell showed mc its qualities behind his black pacing stallion,.Sam Haz ard, record, 2:18. The amount of freight received over the three railroads coming into Wichita from the cast is away beyond the capacity of a tender foot to realize even to believe. Forty to filty carloads of merchandise, coal and lumber arc received and unloaded daily ; nor do the cars return empty, for the grain men want them all. The city has settled down to a satlslac tory daily use ol lis water works and of its street railway, but has not yet become accustomed to its latest Institution thegas works. The gas has now been in use but a few days, and the gaslitters and plumbers arc raising Ned everywhere putting it into buildings. Prosperity, push, boom on all hands; no small part or it due to the work going on in extending railroads beyond. The A.,T. .t S. F. extension has track laid fourteen miles west, with prospect of regular train to Kingman by February. The Fort Scott t Wichita has bridge material on the hank of the Arkansas, and about ten dajs hence Will be pushing it line towards Anthony. All this Is one side of the picture. New comers will see the oilier side as well, but it is so familiar to periodical visitors like mc as to fall out or mind. Wichita has no natural beauty. It lies spread out on fiat sand, skirted on the river side with some natural growth limber. Industry and taste have added shade H ees, fruit trees, slirun bcry, very line residences, etc, still the foundation alwavi. will tie Hal sand. Its churches arc many, some of them very line; the same 1. true of its saloons. A POOR AUTHORITY. It appears from an iutcrview with Rev. D. N. Utter, published ill the Chicago Trib une, that he obtained ino-t of bis alleged faets he embodied in his article on "Old Osawatomie ltrown" Irom George W Itrown, who publMied the Lawrence Jlir ald of Freedom many years ago. Dr. Utter quotes a very poor authority. George W ltrown was known in Kansas as a man of violent prejudices, given lo drawing facts Irom his hates. He hated old John llrown lutcnscly. "Old Osawatomie" was a man of extraordinary courage ; George W. was known as a man or equally extraordinary cowardice. Old John was a radical; Geo. W. was a constitutional conservative. Old John was an enthusiast and fanatic; Geo. W. was cautious, timid, insincere anil cal culating. Tho tno men entertained a cor dial distrust ami dislike for each other, and Geo. W's. bitterness was such that he would believe aud circulate as true any story be ever heard to the discredit of "Old Osawatomie.' Dr. Uttet could not have quoted a more prejudiced and untrust worthy authority concerning old John llrown than George W .Champion. PETITION FOR A SOLDIERS' HOME. The petition previously mentioned iu tho dispatches as being prepared asking Con gress to establish u Soldiers' Home in Kan sas, has been completed and was forwarded to Senator Plumb. It contains 20,000 names and is handsomely bound, making n book as largo as Webster's dictionary. Public l'rintcr Hounds and his foreman set all the type for the president's message, read all the proof, and took the number of copies required in advance on a prool press. All this was done at tbe Soldiers' Home with the purpose or preventing the news paper men from stealing the message. Mr. Hounds had not set type since he was a boy, but he did the job like a veteran. At it again. Just as soon as the Democ racy gets a show of regaining control of the government they begin to show their hand. Some of tho-cx-'lavc holders ol Tex as are preparing to make a demand on the government for the value of their emanci pated slaves. Tho men who murdered McMillcan at Emporia, a short time since, have been dis covered in the peron of J. E. Tierce. A lad about fifteen years old named Elmer Heed, vvhasc home is in Emporia, tells the whole story. They are both iu jail. President Arthur advises Congress to abolish legislative governmcut in Utah and to establish a commission authorized to ad minister justice and enforce whatever leg islation Congress may itself provide for the government or that territory. Wc have no grudge against Alrica, and TCt we cannot lnrhcar the sweet hope that Dave Payne will give special attention to that portion of the president's message which sets forth the alluring features of the Congo valley. Emporia Sent. The Atchison Champion states that John A. Martin, secretary of the Itepublican Na tional Convention, originally presented to the committee tbe change iu National con vention representation for which Scuator Frye is now receiving credit.
