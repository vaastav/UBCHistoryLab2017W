Does the President recommend that Con gress shall pass a new direot tax law, applica ble to corporation and ohurch property only? It would scarcely seem that any sane man could a3k Congress to widen the scope of the direct tax and yet here arc the plain words in a document addressed, not to State Legislatures, but to Congress: I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation, ex empting only the last renting place of the dead, and, possibly, with proper restrictions, church edifices. If this suggestion were adopted by the body to which it is made, the three subjects of Fed- j eral taxation would be a new trio: whiskey, tobacco and cburcbes. The collectors of in ternal revenue might be called tj apply his whiskey gauge to ohurch seats, and a new meter be required to test the number of at tendants, Of course no loyal citiicn would attend church until a United States stamp was placed on the cborch door. When a similar matter is proposed by Gov. Kemper to the State Legislature it merits calm and grave consideration ; but when it is made the subject of a communication from the President to Congress, it is a grotesque illus tration of how little the Chief Executive knows of the Constitution of his country. The Richmond News says of the paragraphs devoted, by Geo. Grant in his Message, to the subject of religion in the public schools: "The 'Hght controversy that exists on that topic in > oountry at large, is uusufflcient to afford is for a canvass in more than one or two "? if in so many, aud though the President * shapes his expressions to meet the ?'1 sects, they will profit him nothing.

In accepting the re-election President Garrett made a brief ad dress to the Board, in which he spoke of the sound condition ot all the Company's interests, and the prospect that even in the depressed condition of business the road will coDtinue to command a large and remunerative truffle. The Loodon Times heartily applauds the tone of the President's Message in regard to the Cuban and Spanish questions, and argues that this country would be fully justified in in terfering to put a stop to the existing condition of affairs. ____________

A meeting of coal operators, representing over one hundred collieries, was held in Phila delphia yesterday, at which it was resolved to suspend operations from December 18th to Jan uary 22d. It is said a further suspension will then take place to Mtftch 1st, or until naviga tion opens. It is reported that twelve persons who bold claims against St. Bonifacius Church have taken preliminary steps to bring suits against Archbishop Wood, to recover the sums loaned to the fund for the construction of the church edifice. These suits grow out of the late diffi culty in the congregation in which its former pastor, ex-Priest John W. Gcrdemann, figured conspicuously. Secretary Chandler on Tuesday issued an or der that in future no payment shall be made, nor shall any claim be considered or approved by the Indian Office or the department, for services rendered for or in behalf of any tribe or band of Indians in procurement of legisla tion from Congress or any State Legislature, and he wishes it to be understood that he deems the regularly appointed Indian Agent, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior fully competent to de fend the rights of the Indians iu all respects without the intervention of other parties. Postmaster of the House of Repre sentatives. The Washington Republican says: "Captain Steuart has received not less than five hundred applications tor the fourteen places in his gift, and yesterday he had quite two hundred Utters yet unopened for the want of time. Being naturally geuerous and willing to please every oue, his mind, like that of the Doorkeeper's, is wrought up to a high pitch ot excitomoDi, aod he vows he would never have sought the place had he imagined one half the trouble it is really giviDg him. Io compliance with the personal request of Captain Steuart, it is stated on his authority that ao article in an evening cotemporary headed 'Bouncing 'Em' is untrue. He says he uever made the remark attributed to him in the article, and that from the old force iu the post offiee he has received nothing but respeot and the kindest assistance, and he teels very much hurt that an uukind. ungenerous remark should be attributed to-him. Of his fourteen appointments he has tilled eight, as follows: Assistant, Edgar Snowden, editor of the Ah xandria Gazette; Messengers, George VV. Rook, his own friend ; HeoryCook, by Sen; tors Withers and Johut>t>o, of Vir ginia; Richard Allen, by Mr. Goode, of V ir ginia; G. W. Kennedy, by Mr. Harris, oi Virginia; R. C. Glass, by Mr. Goode; A. W. C. Nowlin, by Mr. Cabell, and Wm II. Robinson, by Geo. Terry, ol Virginia. These appoint ments are all from Virgin'a, and are choior selections, in the main, from the late Confed erate army, aod ou being sworn in, took the modified oath. There are six more appoint ments to be ujadi\ The Maryland delegation, headed by Mr. O'Brien, asked for oue yester day, but they were informed by Capt. Steuurt that the Virginia delegation had taken the matter of appointments pretty much out of his hands " The Baltimore Sun says: "The Postmaster of the House made to-day the following additional appointment as mes senger : VV. II. Robinson, of Virginia. "The Maryland delegation, beaded by Mr. O'Brien, called on the Postmaster lo-day and proffered a requet-t that one or more of bis ap pointments should be assigned to Maryland. The Postmaster replied that the Virginia dele gation had taken the matter out of his hand.-, and his appointments Wire subject to their re vision, but if any vacanoy occurred he would be happy to give it to Maryland. Subsequently the Missouri delegation called on the Post master and proffert d a similar rcqu- st for their State and received the same answer. These facts were communicated to members from other States, and caused considerable dissatis faction, which was not directed, however, against the Postmaster, but rather against the Virginia delegation." The Washington Tribune says: "Mr. Stcuart, the new Postmaster of the House, has been somewhat annoyed by the story about his 'bouncing' the old employees of the House post office, and has thought the canard worthy of a denial. He says he was most couiteously received by the old offioers, aod that no proffer of services was made, but that at his request the old employees cheer fully consented to remain for a time and in struct their successors in the details of their duties." The article alluded to was published in the Washington Star of yesterday afternoon, and is as follows: ^ " 'Bouncing 'Em.'?A day or two ago Mr. Sti uart, the new Postmaster of the House of Representatives, visited the office aod was couiteously received by Mr. Sherwood, the re tiring officer. The latter informed the former of the details of the offiee, aod stated that ail the force under him expected to be turned out. 'But,' said Mr. Sherwood, 'I would advise you to retain the present working force a week or so. uotil your new men are made thoroughly acquainted with details.' Mr. Steuart enter tained the proposition for a minute; then turn ing on bis heel he replied: 'No, sir; do, sir, I'll bounce them all. I'll bouuee them all im mediately.' Yesterday be commenced the 'bouncing' process by appointing Edgar Suow den, editor of the Alexandria Gazette, as his assistant. The following messengers were also appointed: George W. Roek, of Alexandria; Henry Cook, son-io-lav? of Senat >r With ers ; George W. Kennedy, Richard Allen. Mr. Glass and A. VV. C. Nowlin, late of the Lynoh burg Republican." 

LETTER FROM RICHMOND. Newspaper Changes?Speculation as to the Senatorial Contest? Popular ity ot the Cowhide in Richmond? The Disappointed Ones?Northern Visitors' Opinion oi' Virginia?Pay ing OIK, Ac., Ac. [Ocrrrspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] Richmond, Dec. 8.?To-morrow morning I understand the Whig will change hands and come out with a new staff. 1 am told that MUj. N. B. Meade will be the editor-in chief. He will be assisted by Mr. A. P. Bonnet, late of the Enquirer, and 0. Maurico Smith, o*q., who has beeu ou the Whig for some years, aud the Veterau editor, Alexander Moscly. Mr. Win. C. Elaiu will he the city editor, and Willie Archer reporter. Both of tilie latter have filled the same position on the Whig years ajjo. Col. Wyatt M. Elliott, of llock iDgham, has purchased the controlling intercft in the paper. Mr. John Graeme, who has oo equal id the South as financial editor, will con tinue to fill that place ou the Whig, as he has done heretofore. The Senatorial oontost will begin in a few days I understand. 1 do not think that ex Gov. Letcher will be as stroog as his friends believe, lie comes from a quarter of the couo try which is not, strictly speaking, in the Val ley, or the We>t, or the Southwest, or Tide I water, and therolore 1 do not think that he i will oommaod the united strength of either i sootioo named. 1 firmly believe that Major John W. Daniel, of Lynchburg, would cer tainly gvt the place if he were Jour or five years older. 1 have talked with several mem bers, and they urge the foolish objection that he is too young. They acknowledge that he is a risiug mau; that he has oue of the most brilliaut miods in the State; that he has a manuer both captivating and majestic. They say he is a rising man, aud yet they say he is too youog. 1 think he will staDd a good chance notwithstanding these objections. The cowhide is getting popular here. This morning Pleasant Finch, a young man from Henrico couuty, eowhided Heory Bessler, a member of the firm of Franklin Davis & Co., of this city. It seems that Finch was some time ago employed by Davis & Co., and had a misunderstanding with Bessler and left. Mon day evening he was arrested on a complaiot from Bessler, charging him with obtaining goods uuder false pretences from Davis & Co. He was taken before the police court, yester day, aud honorably discharged. This morning he procured two cowhides and lashed them to gether so as to make one good oue. He then waited ou a srroc t. corncr for Bossier,and about nine o'clock that gentlemau came that way. Finch made for him at oncc, and gave him a severe whipping. He ucarly wore the cowhide out, and throwing that away he took bis fists aud gave the offending party a specimen of his "kuock-downs." He is a much larger mau than Bessler. Bystanders looked at the affair but did uot undertake to disturb the parties, doubtless thinking it was an epi.-oio in the Johnson aud lmbodeu wraugle. It was only when Bessler said he had enough of that fun that Finch stopped. Bessler has, 1 un derstand, placed the matter iu the haud of Capt. Geo. D. Wise. Of course the disappointment among the candidates for the Superinteodeucy of the Pen itentiary, Peniteutiary Storekeeper,and others, is great. To-day more sad an<i solemn looking men wure seen in the Capital than I have ever seen before. They neither asked any oue to driok with them, nor took aDy drinks. I am, at ieasr, glad that it is over. Now we have the greatest of al'?the Senatorial coutest. When that is over the Legislature will adjonrn for the Christmas ho iday, and then when they come back there will be some work done. Theu the Legislature will iutere?t us some. The gas men from the North, who were here a few d iys sioce, went home and gave glorious accounts ot the coal fields of Virginia, and the bo?pitality of the Virginia people. Major N. 11. llochkiss, who saw tbem says they say they never saw people like the Vir gioiaus, or such a couutry as Virginia. There were lots of candidates from Rich mond for positions in the Capitol at Washing ton, but so far 1 have not heard of any success tul man in that connection who couid put his hand on his heart and say proudly, "I am a Richmouder." To-day the pay master's car of the C. & 0. R. R. leaves on a trip up the road with a pile of stamps to pay off the employees ot the oom paoy. This is the first lime for months that aoy money has been paid out to tho employees who so much need it. Hereafter they will be paid off regularly I am told. Mueh mouey will change hands on the Sena torial cleetion. I uuderstaud the pool busiuess will be regularly opened on this occasion. The Senate Committee ou Contested Elec tions is doing its work honestly, and whatever their decision may be it may be relied od as just. Strongbow. The New Crusade. The Methodist preachers aud the Methodist S inday School Union held a joint meeting on Monday last in tho Temple Methodist Episco pal Church, Boston. After devotional exer cises, Professor Wm. Wells spoke on the sub ject of "Bismarck and the Papacy." In con ceding he warned the people of the United States of the danger which is threatening them and thoir free institutions from the papacy. Bishop Gilbert Haven, in accordance with an invitation extended by the preachers' meet ing a fortnight ago, addressed the audience on the condition ot the South. Lie said that there was one class of people in the South who had bccu rccogoized as a nationality by the Pope, and they would welcome his followers to these shores; but the race freed by the people of the North will never strike a blow against constitutional liberty. Bishop Haven said that there is to be a tremendous polttioal battle this year, beginning with the election of a demo cratic Speaker of the national House of Repre sentatives. He said that the ministers of Bos ton are iu the field of battle; their words are reported, and the Southern papers comment on them. The question is, "Shall the North ern people rule tuo nation?" "Shall the Puri tan or the cavalier be the ruler?" Shall Bos ton or Charleston be the centre?" The Meth odist Episcopal Church is the only ioftttu tion in the South to-day that represents the American natioD. You must, he said, stand by your church. There are in the South nearly 300,000 mem bers of the Methodist Episoopal Church who know what they believe just as well as the peo ple of New England, and bettor. They appre ciate libeity and those who gave it to them; they never will be betraye'rs, and let the peo ple of the North never betray them. The mal contents of the South know that t'uey were de feated by one man; that man is President Grant, and if the people throw him over at the command of politicians they will rue it. Pray, brethren, that President Grant may be elected. Pray for the true people of the South, and you will find that thus yuu will be able to keep dowu the kindred threateniug powers, the slave power and the power ol the papacy. There is no clue to the whereabouts of Tweed* Nomination of state Officers by the Conservative Caucus. A. caucus of the Conservative members of both houses of the General Assembly was held oo Tuesday uight at the hall of the House of Delegates, for the purpose of nominating State officers. Senator Qucseoberry was called to the chair. After a discussion, in which Gov. Smith aod Mr Armstrong urged an investigation into the alleged corruptions, the business ot the caucus was proceeded with. Mr. Coghill uominated Mr. win. F. Taylor for Auditor of Public Accounts. On motion of Mr. Brooks, Mr. Taylor was nominated by acclamation. Mr. Mathew uomiuated Gen. Asa Rogers for Second Auditor. Mr. Brooks nominated Mr. A. Q. Holladay for Second Auditor. Senator Eubauk seconded the nomination of Geo. Rogers. The roll had been callcd half way through when Mr. Popharn, by request of Mr. Ll jlia day, withdrew Mr. Holladay'a name, aud the nomination of General Rogers was made uuaui mous. R. M. T. Huuter, Treasurer; S. 11. Bov kin, Register ot the Land Office; James Mc Donald, Secretary ot the Commonwealth, aud R. f. Walker, Superintendent of Public Print ing, were nominated without opposition, aud by acclamation. For Superintendent of the Penitentiary, Messrs. John R. nuoo, of Clarke oouuty; H. C. Jones, of ilanover, and the pre sent officer, Col. George f. Strother, of Cul peper, were placed in nomination. fore the vote was taken the names of Messrs. Nuun aud Jones were withdrawn, and Colonel Strother unauimously re elected. For the Register of the Land Office and Su perinteudent of Public Buildings, liie present incumbent, Major Samuel ii. Boykin, was nominated aud unanimously re-eh oted. For the office of General Agent aud Store keeper ot the Penitentiary, the tic lit was a lonn and close one, r< quiring a sixth ballot. The nominees were Messrs'. Nathan C. Taliaferro, the present incumbent, Thos. W. Spindle, of Montgomery, Frauk Chamberlayne, William L ivenstein, r. W. JNowland aud Mr. Pluu kct. On the fourth ballot Mr. L.ivenstein, alter making a fine ruu, was withdrawn. Upon the sixth ballot the names of all the contestants had beeu dropped except those of Mr. Taliaferro and Mr. Spindle. The sixth ballot resulted, Taliaferro, 6'J ; Spiudlc, 63. ? Under the rule of the caucus, which requir ed a majority of all the Conservative members of both houses (71) to make a nomination, there was still no selection. It was so an nounced, when five members changed their votes from Spindle to Taliaferro, giving him 74 votes, whereupon the nomiuiuion ot Mr. Taliaferro was made unanimous. All the Alexandria representatives voted for Taliaferro. The caucus then adjourned. [Communicated. 1 dislike a newspaper controversy aud shall uot allow myself to be iuvolvod iu one beyond the range of this communication. The articlc under the caption of ,lS?">me con sideraiions for Virgiuiaus. which you did me the favor to publish, and which has incurred the displeasure aud provoked the rather cap tious criticism of my trieud "11.," was promp ted out by auy remcmbraoce of deadly teuds and animosities, nor even sufferings of the past; not by any partisan rancor; not by auy sectional prejudices, and least of all, not by any inclination to wouud the feelings of native born Virginians. Believing that no good but only evil would result from retaining and fosteriug the old feel ings of estrangement consequent from the war, I long since buried the hatchet of strife aud re solved thenceforth to devote the remainder of my years to oonciliatiou aud praotical rccon struction within the borders of your grand old State, to which I Lave become strongly at tached, and for whose future in every move ment, work and enterprise directed to her res toration and elevatiuu, physically, meutully aud morally 1 feel an iuterest as earnest aud abiding, I venture say, as does my friend "H.," or any other native and to the manor boro, however sensitive they may feel to a lit tle wholesome advice which will not do the best of us any harm. Because I am here from another Stat.; I do not consider a justifiable reason for quarrelling with everybody aua con demning every peculiarity of the people around me, just as I do out believe iu the silly heresy entertained by a great many folks?fuil as many in the North as in the South that the only place tit to live in is that just where oue happeus to be boro. 1 have established my home here, not corn pulsorily, but of choice, andiu the fu'ure must necessarily have more or less intercourse with Virginians, and it would be sheer folly for me to wilfully and unnecessarily incur their en mity by needlessly warring against their natu ral prejudices, but at the same time 1 shall claim for myself the right to fairly disouss every subjeot fit and proper for discussion. And here i would just remind my friend "H." that the opinions set foith in my former com munication, and which he has taken excep tious to, apparently because I am only au ad opted citizen, though I assure him no "carpet bagger," are Bhared by very mauy of the. most intelligent natives in our community, who w-'uld no less gladly hail than mys-jll the com ing of the day when the hereditary indolence, pride of ancestry, and apathy to useful enter prises of every kind might no more exist, have in the traditions of the past. And in rliis con nection X am glad to see that our Governor enjoins the people to more industrious habits, and counsels them to produce more aud speud less if they wish to realize their dreams ol prosperity. In this, as well as in many other parts of bis message, he gives evidenoe < f rightly comprehending the situation of things. Well, dow for the "fat men shuw>" and "clam bakes," which are cited as offsets to "tournaments" by my friend. As to the first of these inst tutions it is not a fact that they are peculiar to the North. Within the last few years they have had a general range in all the States. "Clam bakes" are a New Eog land peculiarity, but I have yet to learn that they are obstacles in the way of any of the great enterprises which go to make up prosper ous comoiuuities. I did not cite "ttuna ments" as being "demoralizing" in the seusc "H." understand?. It was not within the range of my article to deal with them iu that particular. 1 meant that our young men, and old men too, and our young and old women, with the gr^at needs of their prostrate State coDStar tly demaudiog their energies in the promotion ot all the elevating and useful iu dustries, they had no time to squander on such fooleries. The tournament is oue of the many barbarous relics which have come dowo to us from an age. and an institution which always degraded honest labor and fostered all the sil liest as well as w.ckedest ambitions. A great many m >re people in this enlightoned age be side a "Plain Farmer" are of the opiuiun, and do cot hesitate to express it, even at the risk of incuring the insinuation of a lack of "mod e.-ty," that it is a little too late iu the day to revive the customs oi the times of chivalry. As much would I denouuee their introduction in Massachusetts as in Virginia. But there is another way of looking at this thing. Id New England the people with commendable habits ot industry and a holy contempt of profligacy have already midc their long and successful strides iu the march of progress. They have eDricbed tbeir lands and made them produr I stony and roekbound though they are, fifty aad a hundred fold; have planted them tar and wide w th orchards, and decked them with the most sightly and comfortable farm houses iu the world. They have projected and carried out their great schemes ot utilizing all the means which God and uature have put in their hands. They have sit into operation all the great industries whioh have at length given them immense factories, ship yards, railroads, excellent turnpikes, and bridges, flourishing towus and cities, and handsome edifices of learning, from which go out without stint to every nook aud corner of the land the seeds of wholesome knowledge and intelligence. So that now, in their prosperity, and having no ureat State debt hanging over them they oan affo"rd to indulge in a "clam bake" now aud (hen, and nobody need call them to account. I But we in Virginia have all this work ot iui j trovemcDt yet to accomplish, and a heavy debt pressing upon us, therefore it behooves us to lot "touriiameuts" and their kiodred cu>toms ?o to the dogs uutil we shall have paid our debts, got rich, auc} improved our State. So much tor "tournaments." In regard to the cause of the present condi tion of things within our borders, 1 have only to say thai 1 still maintain that Virginians are mainly r< sponsible for the evils ihey so much bewail. Governor Kemper in his last message says: "On national government built firm and deep on the 1'ound ition of constitutional liberty was the best over devised by the wisdom of man." So say I?so I said when driven from Virginia because I would not take up arms against it, and so said all the people of the North when they organized their armies to sustain it. Well, if wo had the "best government in the world Virginia surely committed a great wrong when she made war against it, aud like the wrath of Achilles to Greece opened the "spring of woes unnumbered-' in their midst, and destroyed with their own hands the capiwl which "ti" says, and which I say too, we ought now to have to assist in developing our bound less natural resources. 1 should not have made the foregoing allusi ns h&d 1 not been so com pelled by a challenge to answer tne question of the responsibility for the troubles. 1 have quoted the eloquent tribute of our Gov ernor to the good government founded by Washington, Jetferaon and their wis* compa triots, and in the same connection it is certainly a cheering aud encouraging omen to hoar him as eloquently calling the people to again unite with the people of their sister States in support ing and perpotuating it. My object in these blessed days of peace is not to quarrel and indulge in useless criminations about the pas!, but to contribute my humbie ef forts to the great work of reparation. In this work 1 am willing to ooperate with my old foetnen in all enterprises and works for the prood of thfl old "common wealth" as earnest ly as if we had nover boon arrayed in deadly hostility. The war is over. JNo army with its dragon folds encompasses our beautiful hills and valleys, desolating our farms and loaving in its wasted track the smoking ruins of towns, villages and happy homesteads. Tranquility reigns in ail our borders, and none are molested iu their rights nor made afraid. Virtually we aro beginning the world anew, and it is the great duty of us all if we want to make gn at strides in the march of pro gress *.o begin right. Untiring industry in every department of labor?frugality, cc morny and severe retrenchment in all unnecessary expenses ?these and only tlieso are the groat appliances by which the desired work is to bo accomplish ed, and while we wield these potent instrument alities, we must not forget the great duty of cul tivating feelings of amity and conciliating all the animosities wi eh havo grown out of the past, and harmoni/.'ng all the social elements and directing them to the achievement of high purpo es. Tnus shall wo go on prospering and to pros per until wo shall surely solve the vnxed ques tion and realiz > all the blessings of "reconstruc tion in good old Virginia 1 have dready extended this communication further than 1 intended in the beginning. To have been loss brief I could n?>t have fully an swered my friend "H'1 and vindicated myself. And now thank you, Mr. Editor, for y ur in du gonce. 1 promise that I shall n >t renew the controversy. A Plain Farmer. Colling wood, Va. Extension* of tub 0. & 0. Canal.?A meeting of the c.t i u.s of We^tcroport, Md., was held on the Oth iust., to take aetiou iu re gard to the extension of the Chesapeake aud Ohio Caual to the mouth of Savaee river. Owen lliordan, esq., was chosen President, aud Gi'O. W. Sheetz, Secretary. lion. P. Hamill, of Garrett county, was present and addressed th/ in eiiug allowing from stitistics ihe rapidly increasing revenue of the Canal over railway transportation of coal, aud that the extension to the coal fields has become a necessity in order to carry our coal to market at a low rate of freight t) compete I w tli other coals. The exteusi.tu to this poiut will give to the Canal atnut 300,000 tons ad ditioual per anuum, aud the cro.-> cut t? Bal timore will p-:r ourcoal into the Baltimore mar ket at ab.iui TO ets per t)u loss than the rail way can do, which will direct the whole trade to Baltimore,whereas a considerable portiou uow goes through Pennsylvania over the Pennsyl vaoia llnlroad to New York aud Philadelphia. Mr. llamill lias spent a great deal of time aud labor duriug the past year iu the iuterest of this much-needed improvement. The following irontlemen, P. llamill, G. \V. Kildow, Owen Hnrdan, T. Fuller, James Hughes, J. S. Jamison and John M. Kelly, were appiintnl a committee to invite the triends of the extension throughout the State to meet the eitiz us at a general meeting to be bold here Thursday, December 10, to make arrangements to have the matter brought be fore the Legislature. House Committees.?The Washington cor respondent of the Baltimore Gazette says: The Military Committee, as well as that on Naval Affairs, will probably go to Southern men, Eppa Hunton, of Virginia, having been a member of the former duriog the last Coo gres-\ aud Whitibome, of Tennessee, of the latter. There is a disposition, however, to carp at this on the part of a few.

The general interpretation given to that por tion of the President's message wherein he HUggeatH some better method of verifying claims iigainsM the Government than :it present exists through the Court of Claims is that he will meet Congress half way in abolishing the Court as it now exists.
