The governor has otlered a reward of $300 lor the apprehension and conviction of the murderer, in addition to the $200 of. It-red by the mayor of Junction City. There is a good deal of mystery conneet- eu w iin ine muraer. "mat a man could be shot down within forty feetof a public house of entertainment before hardly any of its inmates had retired, without any. body therein hearing the report of a tire arm, cr having any knowledge of the uiumer uuiu eigm or ten nours alter it occurred, is indeed surprising. It is gallin?, too, to think that the murder- in grape, as in apples and pears, a sum. nier, fall or winter. Many of the thick skinned kinds, as Diana, catavba and others of the later ripening kinds will keep several weeks under proper condi tions. Why is the walnut not used more in ornamental planting? Principally, I am told, because it is so slow ol growth, but largely I think because to make a satis factory growth it requires care, which the majority of our people are not will ling to give these trees. Observing a flue row of beautiful trees, perhaps 200 in number, on the farm of Mr. F. Work man, some 5 or 0 miles southwest of the city, I could not but compare the result of the luxuriant growth of these walnuts with the occasional sickly, stunted speci men seen in the city lots. In and about town trees must suffer to be hide-bound and retarded in their growth to al low a little blue gross to be raised. How much more sensible would it be if the trees were first well established before attempting to raise grass in a yard. No trees will respond more freely to good, kind treatment than the walnut, and in Kansas they begin to bear at about 7 years of age. A lot of nuts I had ship ped from here to Hutchinson in the fall of 1870, are reported in the Gardner's Monthly, as having produced fruit quite freely in 1878, and these trees of Mr. Workman's were, 3 years ago, quite full of nuts. Our Kansas people are, as a rule, too impatient for results to succeed in prop, erly ornamenting their grounds and streets. Unless a tree grows very rapidly it is of no value, and is pushed aside for cot ton woods, poplars, soft maples, et id oiiine genu. And such results as they obtain. In their haste to get a tree quickly, they get none at all, for In ten or twelve years, when their planting should begin to show, the worms have riddled the trees and they are all dead or dying. L pon every occasion, I have during the last six years cautioned the people of Emporia and Lyon county against this fault, lioth by voice and pen, with, I am very happy to say, some considerable degree of success. More of the hardier, although some what slower growing trees are being sought for and set, such as elm, ash, er should escape, during these days of I uoney locust, etc. I have great faith in railroads and telegraphs. On Saturday two strangers who had been camped in the woods south of the Henderson bridge since Thanksgiving day, were arrested dy sherilf Kiehl and marshal Cullinan on suspicion of being connected with the murder, but after a brief examina tion they were released. Thev were heavily armed, but they satisfied their capiors mat tuey were hunters from .Missouri. A suspicious looking charac ter was arrested at Emporia that answer er tuo description ot the supposed mur derer, and deputy sheriff Klehl went there to see him, but he was not the man wanted.

None of the Indians returned to the agency till Saturday, but seemed to be engaged in conducting a wild and fierce meeting at uuray's. A man was sent from the agency to Ouray's camp with feed for the horses of the Indians, and discovered from the noise ou the inside that the Indians were greatly excited, and that the greater part were oeuecKea with leathers and war paint, and he was so frightened that he turned back and did not deliver the hay.
