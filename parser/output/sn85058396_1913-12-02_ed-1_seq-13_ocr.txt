WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS IN BACK PANEL DECORATION. Following as a logical outgrowth of the back trimming effects which have inundated the entire fashion world these last few month3 comes the vogue of the back panel decoration, which is right now on a decided way of prominence and favor Perhaps one special reason of its popularity is the wld rauge of oppor tunity It offers to bring into play all sorts and kinds of handsome and ef fective dress materials It does not have to follow the color or material scheme of the dress any more than doeB the tunic or panier, and yet It i is quite as striking and distingue a mode of trimming Wider and more varied is the as sortment of panels being ehown these days Hand painted panels and pan els of metal fabrics, panels of elab orately brocaded Roods, and panels edged with stunningly dyed furs which either match or contrast with the dress material shown are dis played in the most exclusive shops From the simplest afternoon frock of serge and silk to the most elaborate evening creation of black Chantiih and jel thpse panels are to be seen As for their length, there is no uoi forraity as far as that is concerned Some of the panels drop to the bot tom of the gown, while others barelj reach below the waist line and yet still Insist on being designated by the name of back panel The most popular length, however, is that of the throe-quarter panel, which comes down to the knee9 In the back, some times ending In a point and sometimes squaring off abrupt h The tassel fringe on the edge of Hie panel is a novelty which so far has only been shown on some of the ex treme models. From all indications however, there seems no reason for believing this special style of trim roing will not become popular in time It allows of such an infinite varietv of styles and fancies that it is bound to appeal to the heart of every normal, clothes loving woman. One charming evening frock of white chiffon and charmeuse boasted a narrow back panel which fell from the edge of the low neck quite to the hem of the skirt and was caught down at the belt by a huge Japanese bow, "mousrae," they call It of vivid s r let satin This same panel was edg ed with tiny red rosebuds, a bit of a rhinestone sparkling in the heart of each bud Roses edged th" ?mall puffpd shoulder sleeves and also the mousme bow Panels have even made their way into the most exclusive negligees of the season. One wine red chiffon negligee splashed with handsomely brocaded gold roses had a tln panel dropping from the neck down and fastened at the belt line by a huge amber satin butterfly bow Some of the smartest shirtwaists this fall are of washable material, but are quite unstarched. An exaggera ted limpness In all Hues of dress is ttill In vogue Lace top shoes with patent leather ramp? and showing a lining of slik inderneath the heavy lace, to match Ihe costume worn, are extremely mod lab just now They are one of the best examples to show the excessive , qie to w hich lace Is brought these present days I I

MAY AMEND THE BANKING ACT New Currency Bill May Neces-' sitate Changes in Present National Law. Washington, Dec 2 Heiore con gress completes the proposed tur rency legislation it may find It nec essary to amend the national banking act, especially If the house and the president, agree to the senate com mlttee's proposal to guarantee bank deposits. Bank deposit guarantee treasury officials prefer 'insurance" to "guar antee" Is looked upon with favor bv the officers of the comptroller of thp currency Officials declare that deposit in surance to be effective must be ac companied by changes In the power ol the comptroller so that he shall be given more latitude In tho curing ol sick banks. Under the present law the comptroller can only close n Shakj bank peremptorily or place It in the hands of a receiver. In many cases the comptroller finds a bank solvent and In fairly good con ditlon but Its management is faulty To close such an Institution under the proposed law would mean an un necessary drain on the guarantee fund. Officials believe an enlargement ol the comptrollers power giving him authority to replace the management with men of better financial Juug mcnt would prevent many failures and strengthen the guarantee clause. Guarantee Is favored by trodBUn officials because of a bel'ef among many depositors In national banks that because the Institution is II censed by the federal government Its depositors cannot lose. oo
