The first miesageot President Harrison was r-*ad in both bcuscs of Congress on Tuesday. It is well written but thoroughly Republican in its tone. It first reviews our foreign relations and recognizes the importance of the Pan-Ameri can Conference with the representatives of thirty-three nations. A treaty with G:cal Britain enlarging the list of extraditable offences is recommended. The recognition of the new republic of Brazil is said to be deferred until the people of that country have given their complete as sent thereto. The Pres'deut says that a general condi tion ofprosperiiy prevails within our borders, promising a succctsful season to the merchant and manufacturer and general employment of our working people. He estimates tbal the receipts over expen- ' dilures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1801, will be over forty three million dollars or even more. He calls the attention of Con gress especially to this fad, as showing the necessity of reducing the receipts of the i treasury to the needs of the government. He goes oyer much the same ground taken hy i President Cleveland, with this difference.— | President Harrison suggests a revision of the 1 tariff by which its inequalities may be reme- i died but its protective features maintained.— | To accomplish this he advocates higher tariff i duties on some articles, to prevent their im portation and thereby decrease the amount j annually collected by the Government, lie j does not recommend any reduction whatever ' in the war taxes still paid on the necessaries j of life by the people of Ibis country. President Cleveland, on the other hand, re- | commended such a revision and tquluizalloii | of the tariff as would reduce the cost of living i without materially impairing the profits of our manufacturers or prevent them from competing with foreign-made goods. President Harrison recommends the put ting on the free list classes of articles not made in this country and the removal of the tax on tobacco and on whisky used in the arts. This is merely a repetition of the Chica go Republican platform, demanding free whisky and tobacco, rather than cheaper clothing and tin. His views on the silver question are rather misty and calculated to give offence to no one. fie is somewhat indisposed to any considera ble increase in the present rale of coinage, and thinks favorably of Secretary Windom’s plan to hold silver in bulk in the treasury rather than coin, Hie conversion of the silver into coin being expensive, and the coin not need ed for circulation. He urges large appropriations for coast de fences. He recommends that protection lie given to federal officials and witnesses in federal courts. He alleges that the colored population in parts of the country—meaning especially the Southern Stales—"is deprived of any (flee live exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights." He asserts that the general government has the power to take the whole direction and control of the election of members of the House of Repre sentatives. This is a dangerous doctrine and will lie resisted to the utmost hy a united Democratic parly. It would utterly destroy the rights of Slates to control their own af fairs, and result in the end iu substituting a tyrannical supervision of elections hy federal officials, prolcced hy bayonets, which would restore the worst evils of the reconstruction period, and destroy that freedom for which the blood of revolutionary patriots was shed. It is, doubtless, a favorite scheme of Presi dent Harrison hy which the Republican party may he kept in power indefinitely hy the negro voters of the South. The message also advocates the payment of subsidies to foreign sleamship lines, rather than encouragement to other countries to deal with us hy reason of the cheapness of the goods we have to offer them. Taken altogether, it is the expression of u partisan, looking iu all things to the perpe tuation of power in the hands of bis own parly and differs widely from the patriotic and unselfish utterances of President Cleve land. *♦ ♦ ♦ The Organization of Congress. The 51st Congress assembled at noon on Monday, Hon. Thomas B Reed, Republican, of Maine, having been elected Speaker. The Democrats cast their votes for Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky. Vice President Mor ton presided over the Senate. Edward A. McPherson, of Pennsylvania, wjis elected Clerk of the House ; A. J. Holmes, of lowa, Sergeanwu-arms, C, A. Adams, of Maryland, Doorkeeper; James L. Wheat, of Wisconsin, Postmaster. The Republican programme was carried out without a break until the lime came to elect a chaplain. Rev. Charles B. Ramsdell was the choice of the Republicans. The Democrats nominated Rev. Mr. Milhurn, Hie blind preacher, who lias been chaplain of the House for many years. A sufficient number of Republicans broke away from the caucus resolutions ami uniting with the Democrats elected him. The office pays fOOO a year and requires about five minutes’ attendance on the days when Congress is in session. This fact shows by.what a slight tenure the Republicans hold the House, and does not argue well for their success in carrying political schemes through the House against the powerful Democratic minority. Contrary to expectations the new Demo* cratic members were sworn iu without oppo sition. In Hie drawing for scats Hon. Herman Slump was fortunate enougli to secure a seat lu the second row, in front of the speaker. The Democratic caucus of the membeis of the House endorsed the principles of tariff re form, as embraced iu President Cleveland’s message and in the St. Louis Democratic platform, pledging themselves to renew and continue the contest for a reduction of the war taxes begun and prosecuted hy the Democrats in former Congresses. Very little work will probably he done be fore the Christmas holidays. —A great fire occurred in Boston, Mass., on Thanksgiving Day, involving a loss of from six millions to eight millions of dollars. The fire raged for six hoars and burned over two acres of ground covered with splendid busi ness buildings. The district burned over is near that of the great fire of 1872. It is some what remarkable that the fire originated in a new stone building, which was supposed to have been fire-proof, hut which burned like tinder, though a driving rain storm was pre vailing. .. ■■— ♦ -♦ —Gov. Jackson has recalled his proclamat ion declaring Hog Island the properly of Mary, la , and Gov. Lee, of Virginia, has invited him to take an oyster stew with him and talk over the disputed territory.
