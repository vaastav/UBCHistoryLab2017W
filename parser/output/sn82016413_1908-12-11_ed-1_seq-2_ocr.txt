WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 10. Tho House nnd Senate have ex pressed' resentment against that portion of the President's Message relat ing to the Secret Service Hill ns amended tnst session by Congress. That portion of tho messago dealing with the Secret Service, in part, was: "Last year an amendment was Incorporated In the measure provid ing for the 8ecrct Service, which provided that there should bo no detail from the Secret Service and no transfer therefrom. It Is not too much to say that this amendment hns been of benefit only, nnd could be of benefit only, to the criminal classes. If deliberately Introduced for tho purposo of diminishing the effectiveness of war ngalnst crime, It could not havo been better devised to this end. strlctlon operates only to the ndvantago of the criminal, of tho wrong doer. The chief nrgumont In favor of the provision was that the Congress men did not, themselves wish to bo Investigated by Secret Service men. Very little ot such Investigation has been done In the past; but It Is true that the work of the Bocret Service agents was partly responsible for tho Indictment nnd conviction ot a Senator nnd n Congressman for land frauds In Oregon. I do not believe that It Is In the public Interest to protect criminals In any branch of the public service, and exnetly ns we havo again and again during tho past seven years prosecuted and con victed such criminals who wcro In the executive branch of tho Govern ment, so. In my belief, we should bo given ample means to prosecute them If found In the legislative branch. Hut If this Is not considered desirable a special exception could be made In the Inw prohibiting the use of the Secret Service force In Investigating momhers of the Congress. It would be far better to do this than to do what nctiially was done, and strive to prevent, or at least to hamper, cffectlvo action against crimi nals by tho executive branch ot tho Government."

PORT TOWNSEND Arrhed Dec. 10: Fr 8 p. Laenncc, from Kaluilul, G1M0RE TELLS OF. 'FUTURE OF COLLEGE Opportunity To Develop Institution On High Ideals Tho alms afld Iho opportunities of Iho College of Hawaii lo stand its n unique. Institution among those of tho UnlteJ Slates ns n specialist In trop ical research, was tliu subject of nn intcrculng address dcllveied this noon nt tho Commercial Club by Professor Gllmore, tho head of the College, nt a luncheon given In his honor. Professor Gllmoro was Introduced by Jns. Wakefield, who simko of tlu) great benefit which Hnwnll would de rive from the Collego of Hawaii. "I recognize this collego ns jour In stitution," said Professor Gllnton-, "and It Is thcreforo fitting that I should speak to you of Its plans." Ho went on to say that thero wus but llttlo to say about tho proxem work of tho college, but ho would spesk of tho plans for the future, such as ho hoped It would be. Tho law by whlcli tho Institution was established was ono ot tho greatest landmarks of (diicntiou. It had enabled the estab lishment of a largo number of colleges, which wero of a different typo from UiOHo provident nt the time at which tho act was passed. Ho read sovcrnl portions of the act, calling attcutlor to the fact that Iho aim wno not tc tench agriculture nnd mechanic arts alone, but also all subjects which wcio related thereto, oven other scientific and classical studies wero not exclud ed. It provided for a liberal education based on thoso practical subjects. After dwelling on tho manner In which funds wcro dcrhed for these colleges, especially that of Hawaii, I'rofcsbor Gllmore stntcd that tho money could not. be expended for the purelinse of land or tho erection or ro pair of buildings, and It was therefore up to tho Territory to provide for such. Tho Territory had already made boiii.' appropriations but tho appropriation for buildings hail not been HiilUcleiit, and a building for Iho cngluecil'ig de partment was now needed. Tho College had certain Ideals. Fli't that tho Collego must bo of dliect service to Iho community. In some countlcB people studied for .scholar ships. In others for culture and In oth ers fo,- Hervlce. Tho latter was the American Ideal. A second Ideal was that nil subjects which men took up lor nn honorable living, had an educa tional value, and tho development must 1)0 along theso lines. Still an other Ideal w.is that to fun-Mi facil ities t' give Instruction of am- iliai rcter which i.-.lglit be In dcm.iiid. nnd 19 cnour.igu rpwiaicli. For II.? l.illur Ideal 'ho institution in Manoa would bo csp'jclally valuable. , Tho Collego would buvo on oppor tunity in supplement tho wnw dono by tho Institutions of tho mainland, hygo Ing especially Into tropical activities. "I liuvo noticed Hint many people aro calling this Institution a collego u' igrlculture," continued Professor Gil more, "I caro not what jou call It, but 1 should llko to call attention to tho fact that It Is more than a college gnf agriculture. As a matter of fuet wo tffer four courscB leading lo n degree Agilculture, engineering, domestic sci ence and general education. "Wo uro hoping that shortly w-. f,hall bo on our permanent slto In Ma noa vnllcj-. "As you know, wo nro now located In temporary structures In tliu tear of tho Hli'li school building. These struc tures .lie mi built that Ihey can bo moved to the permanent slto Just as toon ns tho Legislature upproprlnten iho money for tho erection of tho per jmanont structures. They will bo usod us auxiliary biilldinga then. "I bolloo, In tho planning of this collego, n broad view should ho taken of Iho matter. I bollevo that plans should bo adopted now for tho entire plant, ro that any building elected In years to comu may bo constructed on F plan adopted now.
