Foreign Advertising Representative THE AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION^ Urges Loan For Armenia and Inde pendence For Philippines. President Wilson in his message to Congress last week among other important recommendations urged a loan for Armenia and independence for the Philippines. Covering these subjects the President said: “In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the United States, I earnestly suggest that the congress authorize the treasury of the United States to make to the struggling government ot Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the allied governments during the war; and I would also suggest that it would be desirable to provide in the legislation itself that the ex penditure of the money should be under the supervision of a commis sion, or at least a commissioner, from the United States, in order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan a further tempting op portunity.” “Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the Philippine Islands have succeeded in maintaining a stable government since the last action of the congress in their behalf, and have thus ful filled the condition set by the con gress as precedent to a consideration of granting independence to the islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the independence which they so honorably covet.” o Representative Charles P. Coady, of the Third Maryland Congression al District, appeared before the House Appropriations Committee, at Washington, last week, and urged the establishment of a vast ammuni tion plant at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Mr. Coady pointed out that such a plan would result in a vast saving for the War Department, in addition to the great convenience of having powder manufactured near w c ere much of it will be used in the test ing of guns. It was contended by Mr. Coady that Congress should make provis ion for the sale of several powder factories now located in various sec tions of the country, and consolidate all their activities into one plain to be located at Aberdeen. o Congress is considering the iiist legislative proposal made by the women of America since universal suffrage was granted. Not only have the women done the unprece dented thing of asking for a rela tively insignificant appropriation— only $4,000,000 —but they have pointed out how that. $4,000,000 can be of as much or more benefit to the American nation as any other $4,000,000 in the whole Federal budget of $4,000,000,000. Briefly, the women ask tlyit the Federal Government, in co-operation with the States of the Union, shall educate young mothers in the ma ternity period so that they will not only have the proper knowledge of hygiene before and after the birth of their children but in needy cases nurses and physicians shall be ready to come to their aid instantly. o i A number of Cecil residents who were lured to the cities by the high wage offer, during the war period when the demand for labor was at high pressure, are drifting back to our county. Factories and mills are closing down and a season of depression is setting in that is grad ually spreading throughout the land, portending dire distress oefore conditions settle back to anything like normal. o There is almost a general disre gard of the law that requires ve hicles of every description to carry lights after nightfall, and steps are being taken to rigidly enforce this law throughout the State. 1:' you neglect to carry a light on your car riage or wagon at night, you are liable to a minimum fine of 

SO.OO. o A man injures himself every time he wrongs another. Foreign Advertising Representative " j THE AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION ! A Real Christmas Present. The holiday season with its joys and its problems is upon us. What shall we do to add to the happiness of the occasion? Each one of us would like not only to wisn our friends a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, but to give them one. We cannot do this by means of ill-considered presents. Thought less gifts cause the January ash can to bulge with debris. Only when our gifts have lasting meaning do they carry the true message of good will which is the spirit of real giv ing. We can give happiness and con tentment and safety for the future as well as pleasure for the moment. Such gifts are within reach of all. They are to be found in the Savings Securities of the United States Gov ernment. From the 25 cent Thrift Stamp to the SIOOO Treasury Sav ings Certificate, they will carry with them not only the greetings of the season but happiness for years to come. In presenting the child a card with one thrift stamp affixed, you bestow not only a present but a habit which will grow in value as the days pass, for he will wish to fill the card. That little gift will have grown wonderfully before another Christmas comes around, and the recipient will be on the way to a life of independence. In recommending these lasting gifts, the Savings Division of the Treasury does not suggest that a single American curtail his Christ mas giving. It suggests only that he broaden it to include this present which will bring future well-being to those he loves. Thrift Stamps, Savings Stamps and Treasury Savings Certificates will be on sale throughout the year 1921. In continuing the sale of Government Savings Securities, the Government is giving the opportun ity to every man, woman and child in the land through the coming year to enjoy the happiness, pros perity and contentment which is found in financial independence and security for the future. A v ♦ Wliat The Census Shows. The census show that majority of this country’s people live in cities of over 2,500 inhabitants. It is an un healthy situation, and shows clearly enough that the high cost of living brings no advantage to the actual producer of food. Working farm ers are going to the cities because it pays better to work in a factory than on the farm. The cause of this is plain. In spite of the decline in agricultural population, rural land values are increasing. They have reached and passed the point beyond which profitable production can be carried on. The farmer can not pay the exorbitant prices de manded for farm land and make enough to make a decent living for himself after paying interest on the investment, taxes on all he produces and consumes, and extortionate prices to transportation and other monopolies. Until that situation will be remedied, until the cause of the trouble shall be removed, the tendency to go from farm to city will probably continue even though city workers have more than their share of hardship and trouble. The remedy is first of all to force the monopolists to let go who are hold ing valuable farm lands unused. This can be done by taxing land values enough to make holding without use unprofitable. Then all taxes on labor products should be abolished. These two steps will force down the price of land and re duce the cost of living and of pro duction. The same measures ap plied to cities and mining regions will have similar results to wo:kers there. It will put an end to all the monopolies that rest on control of natural resources or public highways and profit from the obstruction to industry created by taxes on labor. This remedy should have been ap plied long Legislators have long been urged by Single Taxers to do it and have long been told what their failure to heed is c >stiug the country. The legislators have scoffed in reply. They may scoff again. But they cannot scofi away the results of their refusal. They may apply, as they have on other THE!

Good habits may be formed is easily as bad ones. The earliei ve begin the formation of good health '.labits, the more powerful will they become, and the less room will there be for the formation of bad ones. The child, therefore, is more easily taught to acquire good habits, and is best reached through the great agency oi our school systems. It is here that we should start forming good habiti for the coming generation of fathers, mothers and future citizens. The child, as a rule, has a vivid im agination and delights in play. These two characteristics have been utilized to an exceptional degree In the na tion-wide Modern Health Crusade movement, which was started by tht National Tuberculosis Association in 1915. The method of teaching good health habits has been so arranged that It not only interests the child, but provides the teacher with the means of putting into use the rules of health and hygiene which are too often taught and not practiced. The child who practices good health hab its will make his influence felt in the home and community. These habits are: Brush teeth in the morning and be fore retiring. Wash hands before each meal; keep neck and ears clean. Take a full bath more than once a week. Play out In the open. Keep unclean things out of mouth. Keep good standing and sitting po sitions. Do not spit on the sidewalk or floor Use an individual drinking cup. Drink plenty of water and milk. Do not eat or drink when overheated. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits. The Modern Health Crusade move ment has passed the experimental stage. It has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective health movements ever organized. It has shown such wonderful results that even business concerns are feeling its effect and endorsing the movement. The ultimate aim is to have such a system of health instruction included in the curriculum of every school. The Crusade work of the Maryland Association is under the direction oi one who thoroughly understands school work. It has been Introduced into over two hundred public schools in Maryland, having an enrollment of over one hundred thousand pupils Health propaganda has been carried on by lectures, motion pictures and poster exhibits. Community enter tainments demonstrating good health habits have been given. Crusade tour naments have been carried on in co operation with the Children’s Play ground Association during the vaca tion months. A service departmeni for teachers has been maintained where they may send for suggestion! in health teaching. o- Good Advice.

THE DOUBLE-BARBED CROSS tThe double-barred cross, the international emblem of the fight against tuberculo sis, has been copyrighted oy the National Tuberculosis Association for the benefit of its own organization, and of the eleven hundred affiliated State and local associations. The double-barred cross was first adopted as the international emblem of the fight against tuberculosis at a conference in Paris in 1902. It was suggested by Dr. G. Serciron and is adopted from the Croix de Lorraine, which in turn dates back to the orig inal Greek two-arm cross. In 1906 the cross was adopted by the National Tuberculosis Association as its offi cial emblem. Later it was standard ized as to proportions. It has been used by all of the anti tuberculosis agencies throughout the country as their official trademark. Some questionable agencies and con cerns have been using the emblem and the National Tuberculosis Asso ciation has therefore protected it by copyright, so that hereafter it will mean the organized movement against tuberculosis and only that. "The double-barred cross stands for the control and limination of tuber culosis,” says Dr. Charles J. Hatfield, thd Managing Director of the National Tuberculosis Association. “In this sign, with organized community effort, tuberculosis will become practically unknown, instead of one of the most dreadful disease scourges of the ages as it is today.” o CHRISTMAS GREEN HUNTERS. State Law Protects Land Owners. At this season of the year there is much damage to private property by Christmas green hunters, particular ly in the vicinity of cities and towns. To protect owners from such de predators, a law was enacted by the Legislature of 1918 (Chapter 179) which makes it a misdemeanor for anyone, without the written consent or personal direction of the owner to cut or injure any trees or shrub bery 1 on the lands or premises of another, subject to a fine of from $5.00 to $25.00, or imprisonment from thirty to ninety days, or both, upon conviction before a Justice of the Peace or other court of proper jurisdiction. Rigid enforcement of this law is needed for the protection of trees and shrubbery, not only along the roadsides, but the protection of grounds and woodlands of private owners with the County police offi cers is needed to stop the abuses this law is designed to correct. o The Trumbull-Vanderpoel Elec tric Manufacturing Company, of Bantam, Conn., has been purchased by a syndicate consisting of Ralph K. Mason, formerly of Havre de Grace, and other prominent men of Connecticut. Mr. Mason, who re cently invented a safety eloc*rical switch, has been elected president. The company is one of the largest electrical manufacturing concerns in New England. o How To Be Heathy.
