7 J 1 Ehf palladium. Speed, mt Umm. O. P. nr. We publish ia another part of ur paper, a brief " report of a peech made by Hon. 0. P. Morton, in Indianapolis a few creuings since. We endorse it as sound Republican gospel as the truth of oar Republican fath ers. It is a manly, noble vindication of the principles upon which our government was based and which must be maintained, if our free institutions are to be perpetuated through cctning time. We ask for it the candid pe roral and examination of ery reader. without regard to political or party predi .1 ctions. It is tbe American piauoru., . which every consistent friend of freedom must stand, whether he a "native to the maner born," or ha sought our country from foreign lands, as the home of freedom and equality. The doctrine and sentiments in it enun ciated are the tame we have ever advocated, and which we now believe will be acted up on in the forth-coming administration. As inch we commend it to every reader. It contains nothing new, but is the same old truths we have so often heard before, but which have seldom been proclaimed in plainer or mora forcible language.

It carries with it its own : refutation. It exposes to the most casual reader its inconsistencies and sophistry. The most indifferent observer of the past history of the slavery agitation, willdiscov-, cr its falsehoods and false denunciations. ' While he boasts that in every case where an effort has been made to reclaim a fugiiive, where the power of the government has been exercised, has been successful, he calls upon the free Slates to repeal their laws which are said to interfere with the reclaim ation of fugitives from service. We are willing for the sake of peace that Congress shall give the South a fugitive slave law, ' which shall place the slave upon an rqual footing with other property; but we are op posed to the present law, because it is un-, equal. Under its provisions a colored per- . son may be arrested, taken before a com missioner, who is paid a large fee for conv ic ting tiiin ot alavery. a. -very nvegi aum if he acquits him.

But a negro, or the man charg ed with being a negro, though he may have been born of free parents and never having been in a slave State in his life, is subject to be cariicd into slavery with less formality and less means of securing justice, than a dog may be reclaimed. The personal liber ty bills of which Mr. Buchanan complains, in their most objectionable features, are not nail so oDnoxious to jjstice as is ibe fugitive ' slave law. We trust they will not be repeal- j ed until tLe fugiiive slave- law is amended,! and the threat of disunion withdrawn. f j -"WWa Tkalrf y-Firet Congress. Congress convened in its second session of the 31st Congress, on Monday last. The committees of the first session were contin ued. On Tuesday the President's message was read, and ordered to be printed. On Wednesday, in the Senate Mr. Hale moved to reconsider the vote to print the President's message, and made a speech ex posing the flagrant inconsistencies contain ed in the message. Mr. I verso u said the withdrawing States disclaim any further al legiance. We intend to go out of the Union before the 4tb of March next pea ceably if we can, forcibly if we must. Five States will go out and Louisiana and Arkansas soon call conventions. Mr. Wig fall said he thought the President would precipitate the measure he intends to avoid. Mr. Salisbury, of Delaware, said his State having been the first to come into the Union would be the last to leave it. In the House, the Homestead BUI was taken up and passed by 138 to 76. In the House, so much of the President's message as refers to secession, was referred to a select committee of one from each State, The Speaker appointed the following com mittee: - Thomas Corwin, of Ohio, Chairman.

The Monday. j Mr. Irerson in the course of bis speech in the Senate, referring to the refusal of the Governor of Texas to call an extra session' of the Legislature, said: And though there , . . , oc-.rT ia a. oCtr in the Lone Star btate Ot leXSS in . m. the person of the Governor, wno will not ,, . i . . l i - tL,,,, wt the nub- I aJ v sea "- J lie sentiment is so 6trong that even her Governor may be over-ridden; and if he will not yield to that public sentiment, some Texan Brutus may arise to rid his country of this hoary-headed traitor. Great sensa tion. He further said, referring to the probabil ities of war: There will be no war. The North, governed by such far-seeing states men as the Senator from New York, Mr. Seward, will see the futility of this. He concluded as follows: War is inevita ble; let the South take can ; kt the war come, and we will meat the Senator from New Hampshire, and all the myrmidons of ' .

XW The "results" ol the recent elec tion, are 6uuimed up by our neighbor to be: the suspension of banks, olJ mercantile houses breaking, and general distrust pro duced everywhere ! and then comes the crushing question: "How was it in 1840?" Why, neighbor, you know it was pretty much the same as now, for this reason: The Democratic administration of Mr. Van Bu ten, by its mismanagement, extravagance, corruption, and rascality, brought the coun try to the verge of bankruptcy and ruin, just like the present Democratic adminis tration of James Buchanan has done. The action of the people in '40 and '60, bear as striking a resemblance, as does the profliga cy and misrule of the Van and Buck dy nasties they hurled both from power and place weighed them and found them wanting. The similarity between the ac tion of the democratic" papers of '40 and '60, is also as like as two peas'-endeavoring to throw the responsibility of their own par ty's blundering, reckless and dishonest pol icy, on the shoulders of their political op ponents, with the full knowledge staring their editois in their faces, that the Whig administration of '40 was not in power more t,)au ooe monthf and conse4.Uenily, could " no. ,ll)Ve br0Uiht a5out the bankruptcy anJ ruin prevaiiir,g at Ulat per od . and that RepuM;can administration of Mr. Lin co,Uf has no, and Wl not bave he o years, until trom and after the 4th of March next. "How was it in 1840?" Why, Gen. Harrison, fell a victim to "Democratic" as lamination it is believed by many that he was poisoned. God grant that Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin, may not share the snme fate, in order that the lust after power may be further perpetuated in the bands of a party whose 'democratic' lea ders stop at nothing, however meau or monstrous, to gain their ends! sr-The yield ef the Fremont gold mines for the past two actks. was 32.500 A commit- tee of the citiieus of I'exaj ptitioneJ Gv.
