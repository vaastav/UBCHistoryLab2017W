Kennedy, pastor of the Associate Reformed Cnurcbln Abbeville, last Sunday night took for bis subject "Honesty," begin nn unniai dishonesty of D1Q| WUU UUUIUIVUV w? WW speech, where one thing was said when something else was the truth, and In proceedlog on hlB way he toufched upon various other ins of dishonesty. Tbe pollllolan who raised his head above tbe common level was a target for the evil minded, while In fact tbe politician was no doubt aa loniat as others. In his referenoe to dishonesty In blgb plaoee, be referred, pmong. other things, to tbe candal6 in insurance circles which the press baa recently brought to light. He thought these corporations held trusts which were sacred; that the funds of families should be scrupulously guarded, and be was astonished .at tbe evidences of unfaithfulness. He thought, as cburcbmen, as citizens and as , neighbors the duty of common honesty was ever present. Qnnaaiv nf anppoh and honesty of action is necessary with or among Christians. A man might be an honest man and not be a Christian, but be could not be a Christian and not be an honest man. Mr. Kennedy has felicity of expression and wisdom in the selection of subjects. He preaches the practical or the temporal side of the holy scriptures wherein man Is taught duty to his fellow man as well as obligation to the Author or our being. We must live I olean lives, and serve Him with ardent seal. And then, when the end comes, placing our whole trust and confidence In Him, we may hopeftlJy lie down in that great sleep which men. call death. As Jor the science of theology the wisest vnnw little and the re-tof us are not especial ly interested Id speculations about which ibe preacher himself is ignorant. Mr. Kennedy does not attempt to lift the veil or u discover to as the secrets of Him who hJ. urroanded Himself as with a pavincgr darkness. The temporal side of tlbj^ (b(^ however, makes It perfectly plain tagr we should aJ far as possible, se??" M and pnreness of living. All that, mornw' Kennedy preaches every S? and on last Sunday night KjT,?Ji J ? of as miserable* ?inneryu?fL h a D 8* ^ are .trailing with th^*10* ttte 8lrlv* ^ ing for the ? **./ ^ # nbera, Qr ex&ct D *?-"> any of Its utterances. 5 preaotier'exoei,t ln ?p?ESJ "" "" J. .nd.cu <?'" OOmptLlM u. whole r ??mPanl?s whose oondnct Is now be.?Vjrev,ewed ot coo?e received Jusl V ' r'. Itls tbe preacber)s seeming respect f '?e insurance business at which we are |r yrlsed. We think that any great corpora t<<n which teaches the people bow to evade < .nelr Jost debts, and seeks to Induce the people to pat their money where creditors oan t not get it, exercises a demoralizing lnflaenoe( and lnstllis Into them a principle wblcb is at arlaocer with tbe objeots and tbe teaching of tbe preacher's sermon. If tbe insurance companies bold out tibe Idea tbat It Is honorable and bonest for tbe policy bolder to take oat a policy In tbe name of a member of bis family, Instead of tbe name of bis creditors, oan tbe act be claimed to be bonest? It sucb policy is Issued for tbe purpose of defeating tbe claims of creditors, and If money tbat should go to pay debts, is spent on life insur* anoe, is tbe act eltber lawful or bonest ? Tbe laws of tbe country forbid debtors from dliposlng of tbelr property in order to evade tbe payment of tbelr debt*.' If, therefore, a debtor buys property with tbe money wblcb should go to tbe payment of bis debts, tbe courts would declare the contract Illegal and tbe property would be taken to pay bla debtf. If an Insolvent debtor tries to enrlob bis finally at the expense or bis creditors, does anybody doubt that tbe Courts would do wltb tbe policy aa It would do wltb property that Justly belongs to creditors? l^tt be true tbat tbe companies teacb that method of defrauding creditors, and area party to sucb contracts, are not tbe companies corrupting tbe steams at its very fountain bead ? If tbe bead officers teacb any snob doctrine aa tbe cheating of oredltors, Is i It anrprlalng that they would cheat people who enter Into contracts against the law ? A man who expects equity must himself have cleen bands. If tbe companies connive at unfair dealing by their customers, Is it not pretty oertain tbat the judgeous may be on tbeir guard ? If. tbe companies enoourage debtors in cbeatlng their creditors, Is it reasonable to expect tbe companies to be honest and faithfnl to their truths T There may be honest companies, and to sudb we would exteud our confidence, but In tbat variety of Insurance companies tbat teaches dishonesty we have very little confidence, and should not be surprised If tbey should steal the money of their dupes. s M ^ Good Men, All. On last Friday tbe Press and Banner bad the pleasure of greeting Hon. ApguetlneT. Bmytbet>f Charleston, Hon. Alex C. King of Atlanta. Ga.,and Mr. tiranvllle Beal of Cat. tioun Falls.
