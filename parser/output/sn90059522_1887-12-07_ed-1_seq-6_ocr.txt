Testimony Taken in the Case of the Sylvester Girl's Alleged As sailant. Special to the Globe. Buffalo, Minn., Dec. o.— The court room was filled to its utmost capacity this morning with spectators who had come from near and far to get a glimpse of Lou Murray, who is charged with attempting to outrage Mary Sylvester j on the SOth day of August last, in Min neapolis. Many of the spectators pres ent were loungers and witnesses from ! Minneapolis. About 11 o'clock Mary- Sylvester, the complainant in the case. appeared ii; the court room. She looked very feeble, and was only able to move with the assistance of her physician. Dr. S. S. Kilvington, who remained at j her side during the whole day. At 11:1.. j Murray appeared in charge the sheriff. lie was seated at the lawyer's desk ! about fifteen feet from the complainant, | and when she saw him she fainted i away, and it was some time before the • court was able to continue, lt was the j first time that she had seen him since \ his arrest, and the shock was too much. Precisely at 11:30 Judge Hicks opened court, and the work of empanneiing the jury began and continued till noon, when the court adjourned till 1:45. Messrs. Wendell and Cochran, who had been appointed attorneys for the pris- t oner by the judge were on hand at 1:4... aad together with County Attorney Davis the week of empanneiing the jury continued. At _>__". twelve men had lieen secured who had never read an account of the affair iv any papers or had heard any conversa tion in regard to it. A recess of thirty minutes was taken in order to allow the defendant's attorneys to prepare some affidavits. After the recess Dr. 8. S. Kilvington was called for the state. He testified as to the mangled condition in which he found the complainant, in the alley in the rear of the building, 112 Third street south, from which she is supposed to have jumped. He also tes tified to his conversation with the pris oner, in which he said that Murray wanted to < AIIIIV the ROB-. RACK to the room from which she had jumped, but when he demanded that she should be taken to the rooms at 253 First avenue south, Murray became ex cited and nervous, and would have es caped had not John DeLong l»een there to help him. After she had been car ried to the rooms at 253 First avenue, he made an examination and found that her limbs were badly broken and she was in gie.it pain. He asked for some chloroform, and Murray at once jumped for the door and said. "1 will get it." "Had not Mr. DeLong been present he would undoubtedly have escaped.'' con tinued Dr. Kilvington. John De Long. who was the first man, who heard the cries and moans of the unfortunate girl and went to her assistance, testified to the mangled con dition in which he found her in the alley. He also corroborated the testi mony of Dr. Kilvington iv regard to Murray's trying to escape. He said that he went with Murray to the drug store to get the chloroform, and that Murray would have tied had an opportunity been given him. Dr. Freeman was the third witness to take the stand. He said he was summoned by Dr. Kilvington at a late hour and made an ex amination of complainant. He found that her limbs were badly mangled and that she was suffer ing extreme pain from internal injuries. The court then took a recess of an hour. The evening session was called at 7:30. Miss Mary Sylvester, the complainant in the case, told a pitiful story, substan tially the same as appeared in the Globe at the time of the assault. She was very feeble and coul I hardly speak loud enough to lie heard. The court adjourned at 8 o'clock until to-morrow morning, when the remaining witnesses will be examined. A Miser Murdered.

SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: WEDNESDAY : MORNING DECEMBER 7, 1887. —TWELVE PAGES. THE NATION'S NEEDS. Continued From First Page. haps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he must add a consider able sum thereto to meet a further in- crease in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool seemed so profitable, an increase in price sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool-raising is compared with all the farmers in the country, and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered: when it is made apparent that, in the case ot a large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the pres ent tariff on wool is illusory and, above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff ;_*._.-. !-•---• BECOMES A 111 'IlIiKX upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young aud old. and that it constitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man. woman ami child in the land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of the in creased cost to the consumer of our home manufactures resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not over looked that competition among our do mestic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their prod uct below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this competition is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which have for their object the manipu lation of the supply and price of com modities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration in the operation of these selfish schemes. If. however, in the absence of such combination, a healthy and free competition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home pro duction below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and if, with such reduced price, its man ufacture continue to thrive, it is entirely evident that one thing has been discov ered which should lie carefully scru tinized in an effort to reduce taxation. The necessity of combination to main tain the price of any commodity to the tariff point, furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity, and that such prices are remunerative, and lower prices pro duced by competition prove the same thine. Thus, where either of these conditions exist, a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction of taxation. THE COXSIDEUATIOXS which have l»een presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to en force an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the reduction of our custom duties, and, at the same time, to emphasize a suggestion that in accom plishing this purpose *_-_ may discharge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of such con siderations be, with any degree of fair ness, regarded as evidence of unfriend liness toward our manufacturing inter ests or of any lack of appreciation of their value and importance. These in terests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. But if in the emergency that presses upon us our manufacturers are asked to surrender something -for the public good and avert disaster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages al ready afforded, should lead them to willing . co-operation. No demand is made that they shall forego all the ben efits of governmental regard : but they cannot fail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self interest and safety, when they are re minded of the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present con dition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our manufactures than to other important enterprises. Oppor tunity for sale. careful and deliberate re formis now offered: and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The difficulty of attend ing a wise and fair revision of our tariff is not under estimated. It will require on the part of the congress great labor and care, and especially a broad and rational contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and regardless of the welfare of the en tire country. tMiKi: on; ritESEXT laws more than 4,000 articles are subject to duty, Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures and many are hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A considerable re duction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no fea tures of hardship; tint the necessaries of life, used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduc tion of the duties imposed upon raw material used in manufactures or its free importation is of course an import ant factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries: it would not only relievo them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on such mate rial, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such pro duct as compensation to our manufac turers for the present price of raw mate rial could be accordingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue, it is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious affect upon our manufacturers. On the con trary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their wares .by free mate rial. Thus our people might have the opportunity of extending their sales be yond the limits of home consumption. saving them from the depression, inter ruption in business, and loss caused by a glutted domestic market, and afford ing their employes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus imperatively pre sented for solution should lie approached in a spirit higher than partisanship, and considered in the light of that re gard for 

PATRIOTIC PVTY which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a con fiding people. But the obligation to de clared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political par ties now represented in the govern ment have, by repeated and authorita tive declarations, condemned the condi tion of our laws which permits the col lection from- the people of unneces sary -revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correction; and neither as cit izens uor partisans are our coun trymen in a mood to condone the delib erate violation of these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets, lt is a condition which con fronts us, not a theory. Relief from this condition may involve a light re duction of the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be contemplated. The ques tion of free trade is absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent claim made in cer tain quarters that all efforts to save the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders, is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the __>>ople is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economi cal operation of the government, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in -the treas ury through the perversion of govern mental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our in dustries without danger to the opportu nity for remunerative labor which our workingmen need, and with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsistence and increas ing the measure of their comforts. TIIE CONSTITVTIO**. PROVIDES that the president "shall, from time to time, give to the congress information of the state of the Union." lt has been the custom of the executive, in compli ance with this provision, to annually exhibit to the congress, at the opening of its session the general condition of the country, and to detail with some particularity* the operations of the "dif ferent executive departments. It would be especially agreeable to follow, this course at the present time, and to call attention to the valuable accomplish ments of these departments during the last fiscal year; but 1 am so milch aim pressed with the paramount importance of the subject to which this communica tion lias thus far been devoted that I shall forego the addition of any other topic, and only urge upon your, imme diate consideration the "state of the Union." as shown in the present condi tion of our treasury, and our general fiscal conclstion, upon which, every ele ment of our safety and prosperity de pends. " y .' The reports of the heads of depart ments, which will be submitted, contain full and explicit information touching the transactions of the business intrust ed to them, and such recommendations relating to legislation in the public in terest as they deem advisable. 1 ask for these reports and recommendations the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the govern ment. There are otlier subjects not embraced iv the departmental reports demanding legislative consideration and which I should be glad to submit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous mes sages, and as to them I beg leave to re peat prior recommendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the department of state, a brief history of the transactions of that important department, together with other matters which it may here after be deemed essential to commend to the attention of congress, may fur nish the occasion for a future commu nication.

ISST. NEW YOKK. General Approval Manifested— The Message Considered States manlike aud Opportune. Special to the Globe. Nkw York, Dec. Mayor Hewitt said to-day after he had read the presi dent's message: "1 think he is very wise in confining its subject to the financial question. He grasps the fact that the surplus in the treasury is dangerous, both to our business inter ests and to the political morality of con gress. He points out clearly that it can only be reduced by increased expendi tures or the reduction of taxation. The latter is. of course, the only statesman like method. He proposes tariff re duction, substantially upon the raw material of industry. This is the policy which I recommended in 1883 and every year subsequently in bills which I introduced or in .speeches which I made upon the floor. A tax upon raw materials is an obstacle to the growth of business. The reduction of the tax enlarges the fund for the payment of wages, and therefore it ~j& in the interest of workingmen that raw material should " not.;. s be taxed. Ido not think it quite so neces sary to take off the taxes on manufact ured products, because domestic com petition may be relied on to give to the consumer the benefit of the reduction on tax upon raw material. Demagogues may use the reduction on manufactured products as an argument why the wages of the workingmen must necessarily be reduced to correspond with the reduced duties. There is nothing in this argu ment, and we might very well follow the example followed by Great Britain, which freed all th c raw materials of in dustry from taxation long before it abol ished the duties on the manufactured products. 1 regard the gem r.il propo sitions of the message as tteiyv clearly and forcibly stated, although I do not think the wage earners are forced to part with any considerable portion of their earnings in consequence of the high rates of duty on what they buy. The cost of living in this country is at the present time lower than hi any civil ized country. Ido not believe that the higher rate of wages paid in this coun try is due to the tariff. High wages come from superior natural re sounces. and a tariff may be necessary, therefore, in consequence of these higher wages in order that par ticular branches of industry may exist, It is a simple question of the distribu tion of labor in the several kinds of in dustries. Under the natural system men will employ themselves in that which pays best, Under the artificial system they will engage in every branch of Industry which can pay an equal rate of wages. 1 believe in a diversified in dustry, especially in a country like ours, anil 1 think we can afford to 

MAKE SOME SACRIFICES to secure it. In other words, that the compensation which we get in the steady employment of men. and in the improved civilization, more than balance the increased cost. But whether this view is sound or not, we are a manufac turing people, and I fully concur with the president's recommendation that no legislation ought to be had that will tend to restrict the area of our industries, and 1 think that the necessary reduction in taxation can be made, not only with out disturbing the favorable condition of industry, but with a decided benefit to ever, branch which has established itself in this country." In commenting on the president's message to congress, the Commercial Advertiser (Hep.) says: "Its a plain, trunk, definite proposition, and comes like a fresh breeze in a sultry sky. It sweeps away cant, lifts up a banner and challenges to combat. It will have a de cisive weight in the future ot parties and of legislation." The Post (Ind.) says: "The message is the most courageous document that has been sent from the executive man sion since the close of the war. It will compel public discussion in congress. lt will supply parties with an issue that they have long needed. We have no doubt the president's party will sustain him." The Evening Sun (Dem.) says; "It does not often happen that a president's message takes so little space to say so much of consequence." The Sun. how ever. does not commit itself to approval or disapproval of the president's recom mendations, but simply states what they The Mail and Express (Rep.) says: "The president has framed the issue for next year's campaign. He has taken a courageous stand and we sincerely trust his party will uphold him. 'He has put the Democrats fairly on the free trade platform. The Republican party has nothing to complain of. Neither working men nor manufacturers will deceived by glittering generalities. The next campaign will lie. battle between protection and free trade, with chances largely in favor of the Republicans.'' The World iDem.) says: "The presi dent has championed the cause of the long over-burdened taxpayers, and he has supplied his party with what it has long lacked, an issue" and a leader." detailed comments. The Times in its editorial on the pres ident's message will say: "Mr. Cleve land has done an act of statesmanship in the best sense. Recognizing a great duty he has performed it with courage, with firmness and at the right time. And he has performed it so that every honest man must see that it is an honest act. Judged by an ordinary standard of political expediency, the president's act is inexpedient. He has forced upon his party an issue as to which the party is divided, and so divided that unless the minority yield it can defeat the will of the majority. He has done this on the eve of a national contest in which a con siderable number of men of Influence in the party have been urging him to avoid this issue, and threatening him and the party with disaster if he did not avoid it. On the other hand, there • is nothing -;-.- in this issue, thus presented, by which Mr. Cleveland conld hope to draw from the Republican party any votes. Nor this alone, for if the protectionist faction in the Democratic party carry out their own desires, or do what they have continually,; declared that they would do, Mr. Cleveland Iras done the one thing by which he could imperil the prospect of his own renomination. lt places Mr. Cleveland far above any of the leaders to whom the Republican party has of late lent a hearing, and above most of the leaders of his own party." Tiie Sun will say: "It is not a com monplace document, for it is simple, in telligible and coherent; and the quality of brevity is chiefly due to the fact that all other topics of national interest are dismissed in a lump or postponed as inconsequential in the pres ence of one problem of su preme importance— the question of tariff revision. He declares that the theoreti cal question as between protection and free trade is "entirely irrelevant;" and yet the most striking and interesting part of the message is devoted to pre cisely that sort of an argument with which any free trade representative in congress, or the author of any free trade text book of political economy, would begin an attack upon the theory of protection. This, we say, is the most notable fact about the message. Mr. Cleveland has never before in a public paper taken sides squarely upon this question. He has done so now in a man ner that leaves room for no mis understanding. It is a bold thing to do, and the president de serves credit for the plainness of his speech. Nobody can accuse him of hedging, or haggling, or jug gling with words, so far does he go upon the familiar lines of the free trade speeches in congress or elsewhere, that we find him betrayed here and there.no doubt unconsciously, into an exhibition of slight irritation against American manufacturers as a class, almost as if they were conspirators and public ene mies." The Herald will say: "The message is an able, conservative and statesman like document, which, unlike many other message^, will be read by the people and discussed by them. We are glad to see that he favors free wool, which would give greatly increased and per manent prosperity to our great woolen industry, and enable our manufactur ers in other branches at the same time to dispose of- large quantities of their products in wool-producing countries to the immediate benefit of workmen in al most all branches of American manu factures. The message will not please extremists of either side, free traders at protectionists. it will, we believe, please and satisfy the people at large, and it puts upon both parties in con gress the solemn duty to relieve the country from a most serious clanger." 

CINCINNATI. How the Papers of Porkapolis View the White House Deliver ance. Cincinnati, 0., Dec. The En quirer will say to-morrow, editorially: "The brevity of the President's mes sage is one of the commanding features of that interesting document. The lumber which usually burdens * the annual communications from the White house is absent in this case, and Mr. Cleveland has set up a model of con ciseness that ought to be flamed and hung mi in the library of the Executive mansion as a mentor for future presi dents. He has allowed the reports of the various departments to speak for themselves, and has secured a general reading of what lie has to say on his own account. There can scarcely be a mis take as to what the president means. However widely some members of his own party may differ with him, they cannot accuse him of circumlocution or obscurity, lie presents arguments which are familiar to students of the tariff question, but in more explicit terms than our politic and cautious pub lic men ordinarily employ. His message will command more attention than doc uments usually do. His earnestness on the subject is a comforting augury of his intention to approve any bur ad justment of the revenues that congress may propose, even if it is not in full agreement with the plans which he out lines.". The Commercial Gazette will say: "President Cleveland's message is a free trade deliverance out and out, through and through, without any mit igating conditions. There is an excess of revenue. No doubt about that. It should be diminished. This is a point upon which there is and can be no dis pute. But how does President Cleve land propose to reduce the rev enue? The president and the party he represents are free traders. They want the internal reve nue system, which is a war measure. maintained in order that an argument in favor of free trade may be presented, in order that American industries may be oppressed by reducing the duty on foreign productions. This is the argu ment of the president, and of his party, so far as he has a party at his back, in a nutshell. President Cleveland, how ever, has made the issue between free trade and protection. 'This is accepted. Now let us see what the outcome will be." 

SOME ENGLISH VIEWS. What the Great London Journals Have to Say. By Cable to the Globe. Loxdox. Dec. ('.—The synopsis of President Cleveland's message to con gress, which was cabled here and pub lished in this afternoon's papers, was read with a great deal of interest. The message which is regarded generally as very important, is warmly indorsed by fair traders, while free traders assert that it marks a long stride toward the goal of universal free trade. The con census of opinion is that should con gress adopt the suggestions so unequivocally made by Mr. Cleveland the first effect would be beneficial to a large Dumber of English industries, though after a time an adjustment would necessarily take place which would inevitably work to the detriment of some others. " On the whole the re commendations set forth are regarded as sound. though one or two of the news papers profess to think otherwise. The St. James Gazette speaks of the action as a remarkably sudden and altogether surprising move, and in support of its criticisms of the message quotes Lord Overstone's assertion that the commerce of England would receive its first crush ing blow when free trade should be adopted in the United States. Compe tition with free trade in America, the Gazette says, was what Lord Over-tone seemed most to dread, and his fears were spread and are still entertained by many leading financiers and merchants of the day. The Morning Post, commenting on President Cleveland's message, says: "The message will produce a profound sensation in Europe.as well as America, and will strengthen the free traders' cause throughout the world." The Daily News says: "Seldom lias an American president had a more im portant or impressive lesson to teach. The fact is that although President Cleveland makes a pretence of shutting his eyes to it. the policy of protection has been reduced to a practical and the oretical absurdity." The Times says: "Xo message on record is more remarkable for a bold, outspoken disclosure of a novel policy hitherto discussed or ignored by both parties. It is still more remarkable that Mr. Cleveland has the courage to confront the serried phalanx of protec tionists on the eve of a contest for the presidency. So far as England is con cerned, it is questionable, what ever the impulse resulting from the removal of the burdens on American industry, whether Amer ica will not confront us in formid able rivalry in both home and foreign markets. We have confidence, however, in the laws by which, when trade is free, every nation discovers the fittest work and turns its advantage to best ac count." The Chronicle says: "It is many years since such an important and suggestive message has been sent to congress. If I- the policy of • President Cleveland is r adopted its effect on the trade . of the i world cannot fail tojbe immense." *; .yy_y Judge Rea in Chicago. ; Chicago, Dec.

Auei'df.ex, Dak., Dec. 6.— Mayor Mills at the council meeting last night revoked the appointment of J. H. Hauser, the city attorney, on the charge of incompetency.
