The directors of the Marlon Republican Club have set a good example'by pledging It te support a primary election law, and the committee to" promote the matter ls an excellent one. The abolition of the army canteen ls a plain triumph of sentiment over common sense. It will result In the substitution of a much greater evil for the one which the sentimentalists have been warring against. If those representatives who voted the canteen out of the army bill Imagine that they will be less severely denounced by the Inconsequential element of political prohi bitionists they are doomed to disappoint ment. The Chicago Tribune Is satisfied that the people of the "West are auspicious of the word ."subsidy;" It, therefore, urges Re publicans 'to defeat the ghlp-subsldy bill. It says to Congress: "Beware of the sub sidy bill.", m Sooner or later the movement In this State for the better government of small cities on a uniform basis Is sure to suc ceed, and It will be another evidence of Indiana's progressiveness In municipal and local government reform. Those who claim to have all the ofllclal eturcis of the election of President make ".he popular vote 13.SS3.913, which is ess than in 1S05. The aggregate vote was imaller In the new England States and In lli "the . States of the South, with the ex ception' of Kentucky and Texas. Whatever,, näybe-the motive of.the ln dlr(4i Gas-'Company . In warning con sumetiSagatnsJ ite danger arising from the chijrigpsfln'pfrFSTire, or whether the Com pany could Temedy the matter or not, the fact-remains that it is a source of great danger and the warning should be heeded. The United States consul at Capo Town, James G. . Stowe, says that all the talk about burning Boer farmhouses 13 bun comb, as. the' only houses destroyed are thoso from which shots are fired at the British or those which are being used to shelter Boer soldiers. This is the state ment of a man who Is entitled to greater credence than Mr. Kruger. It ls now said that China may offset the claims of, ihe powers for indemnity by making counter cla!m3 for property and lives destroyed by the recent punitive ex peditions. As these expeditions were made since the Boxer war closed and solely for revenge it A by no means certain that a Chinese claim for Indemnity on account of them would not be equitable. The debates In both branches of the Brit ish Parliament, Thursday, show that when It comes to partisan bitterness In speech any American legislative body is more mod erate. Never has a man In a recent Ameri can Congress been so venomously assailed as was Mr. Chamberlain In the House of Commons. Most Americans are willing to admit that the British surpass us In epi thet. An insanity expert testified before the Industrial commission at Washington that 50 per cent, of all the patients In the hos pitals and Insane asylums of New York were aliens, and that similar conditions prevailed in all the large cities of the coun try. From this he argued in favor of more restrictive legislation to keep out pauper and Insane Immigrants. If the statement Is true It furnishes a strong argument In that direction. Two years ago the city of Haverhill, a Massachusetts shoe town, elected John G. Chase, a Socialist, mayor. A year ago he was re-elected with a City Council of the same stripe. Last Tuesday, after an excit ing campaign. Mr. Chase and his Council, were defeated by the Republican candidate by a decided majority. Two years were enough. Socialism la an excellent theory, but so long as human nature is what It is It seems difficult to put it Into operation. The prompt passage of the army bill by tho House recall the struggle over the rules which put the control of legislation In the h-inds of the majority. For sev eral years ifore the election of Thomas B. Reed as speaker in 1SS3 a handful of filibusters could prevent legislation by dilatory motions. There were struggles xxhlQh lasted dayi and ended la victory. for the minority. When parties were even ly divided the refusal of members present to answer to roll : calls'-prevented action. Mr. Reed and .h! associates, with a slen der .majority, were confronted by thfs evil practice. While the I teed rules were '-"being planned he, as speaker, was confronted by "no quorum" upon an Important ques tion. Thereupon he procoeded to count a quorum. It was a now proceeding, at which the minority protested with vehe mence, but his party friends, some timor ously, sustained the Reed ruling. From that time to this members have been un able to break a quorum If present In their seats by refusing to answer at roll call or In a division. The rules swept away all the devices of dilatory motions and gave the majority the power to decide what measures shall bo first considered and to limit the period of debate. What ever may be said of Mr. Reed now, the high honor belongs to him of leading in the establishing of a reform by which the House became a legislating as well as a deliberative body. The succeeding Dem ocratic houses practically adopted the rules known as Reed's. TOE 

FUTURE OF CUI1A. Now that a convention of Cubans Is con sidering a constitution the question of the relation of Cuba to the United States Is be ing discussed. .The resolution of Congress, passed In April,' 180S, pledges the United States to remain in Cuba until a stable government, republican in form, ls estab lished by the people. Unless Congress shall take some action the President will be the Judge of the fitness of Cuba for an inde pendent government and the date when It shall be recognized. In an article in the December Forum, Mr. Rodriguez, a native of Cuba, shows that the historical policy of the United States in respect to Cuba has linked the destiny of the island with that of the United States. In 1S59 the com mittee of the Senate on foreign relations came to the conclusion that "independence could only be. nominal and can never be maintained In fact, so that, sooner or later, it would either falp under some protec torate or be annexed to the United States." There is every reason in the situation of the island why It should be a part of the United States. Havana is the key to the Gulf of Mexico. Naturally, the United States should hold that key. Cuba's trade naturally seeks the United States. More and mpre its Industries are coming under the control of Americans. The danger of absolute Independence for Cuba is that It will become involved in some intrigue or dissension which will be a pretext for some European power to ex tend a protectorate over the island. It will be Impossible for Cuba to maintain foreign representatives In the principal capitals or to maintain a navy, for the sufficient rea son that 1,600,000 people cannot afford such expenditures. Yet some of the leaders have been talking of warships. If Cuba is given absolute independence, so as to conduct foreign relations and make treaties, any nation in Europe will have Just the same right to make special treaties as the United States would have. This should not be, for the reason that this nation has given many valuable lives and expended hun dreds of millions of dollars to rid Cubans of the Spanish yoke. Without our as sistance they would yet be under the heel of Spain. -For what we-Jvave done we have claims upon Cuba so great that whatever favor any government is to have in the way of trade belongs to us. We have such claims that Cuba should not be permitted to accept the protectorate of any govern ment, thus holding the key to The Gulf of Mexico and the proposed isthmian canal. The United States would not have permit ted such a transfer before we delivered the Cubans cut of the hands of their op pressor. We are In a position now to say that it shall not be done. It has been asserted, with how much truth we know not, that the policy which the President is -considering is to give the island 'sabsWutefc6ntrc& Its .local gov- ernment, 'hile t its r-elauons ' with . foreign nations; .shall "be -managed' -at Havana . , . ... through the United. Stales.. ' This means that Cuba would receive the protection of the United States and could not be in terfered with by any other power. Two or three papers have cried out against this proposition in vehement protest. They as sume that Cuba has the right to full in dependence, meaning that Cubans shall be absolutely independent o5 the United States. Now, It Is very doubtful if the Cubans are qualified for self-government. All the experience most Cubans have had with anything like government has been during the past two years. Most people believe that the period of teaching has not been long enough to warrant the United States In giving the Cubans absolute Inde pendence. Many believe that, after a few years, Cuba will be annexed o the United States. For these, and other reasons, many Americans are disposed to look with favor upon a proposition to exercise a national supervision over the foreign intercourse of Cuba, ' THE 

REINSTATEMENT OF GEN ERAL BAG AX. The Sentinel makes the following com ment on the Eagan case: The restoration of Eagan Is In keeping with the corruption of the present adminis tration. It is idle to talk about ths "good ness" of McKinley when the hero of the canned beef scandal is restored to duty, with penalties remitted, and immediately placed on the retired list. On Its face the action ls as rotten as the canned beef. This is a gross misrepresentation of facts. and does great Injustice to a brave soldier who has served his country well. The only sense in which General Eagan is "the hero of the canned beef scandal" is that he was acquitted by a military court of any Inten tional wrong or of anything reflecting on his official Integrity. The court found that no such thing as "embalmed beef," as Gen eral Miles called it, or chemically treated beef, was furnished the army. It reported that "no refrigerated beef furnished by contractors and issued to the troops during the war with Spain was subjected to or treated with chemicals by the contractors or those In their employ." The report said further that "the court removes all respon sibility from the packers, and declares the meat furnished by them to have been of the same quality as that supplied to the market In general." It pronounced the quality of the canned beef satisfactory, but It criticised and censured Commissary Gen eral Eagan for having made such large purchases of an untried and unknown ar ticle of food that failed to stand sea trans portation and a hot climate. Barring the error of Judgment In buying too great a quantity of this food, the court exonerated General Eagan of all charges or suspicion of wrongdoing. The court consisted of two major generals, one brigadier general and six civilians of high standing. The court-martial of General Eagan was not for alleged corruption or malfeasance In office, but for the personalities and vio lent 'language he used: before the Investi gating, committee in replying to the charge made by Major General Miles that certain kinds of beef had been furnished to the army "under pretense of an experiment," In answering this charge General Eagan used very Intemperate language towards the general of the army, .and for that he was court-martialed. A brave and honest man. who has served his country long and faithfully, and who has not been guilty of any Intentional wrong, may be forgiven If a fiery tongue leads him to use strong lan guage In repelling what he deems a cruel charge. General Eagan's offense was nat ural, but under army regulations unpar donable. A court-martial was necessary, and It found him guilty of "conduct unbe coming an officer and a gentleman, and conduct to the prejudice of good, order and military discipline." The only penalty pre scribed for this offense ls dismissal from the service, but in this case the court-martial asked that executive clemency be ex ercised, and under this recommendation the President announced, in view of Gen eral Eagan's gallant conduct in battle and the mitigating circumstances of the case, the sentence would be commuted to suspen sion from, rank and duty for six jears. Now, after nearly two years of such sus penslonthe President has remitted the un expired portion of the sentence, restored him to rank and placed him on the retired list, as he is entitled to be after, thirty years' service. In all this there has been nothing to reflect on General Eagan's in tegrity. At the worst he was guilty only of an error of Judgment and an outburst of temper, and to a high-spirited soldier two years' suspension from rank and duty Is sufficient punishment for that. .Every American with a spark of magnanimity in his makeup should be glad that the gal lant old veteran has had his disabilities re moved. To speak of the action of the Pres ident as "In keeping with the corruption of the present administration" shows incur able malignity. e It might occur to Mr. Towne, while he sits a few days in the chair of the late Senator Davis, that he might have occu pied It for a term or two if he had not made the mistake of assuming that he knew more than the Republican party in 1S06 and becoming a 16-to-l advocate. But he came to the conclusion that the country was ripe for that heresy, and went with It. The moral Is that a man must be abler than any one who has appeared in recent years to know more than the whole Repub lican party. Official reports show that the Hessian fly, so fatal to wheat crops, has appeared in every winter-wheat State east of the Rocky mountains. In most sections the season has been favorable for the growth of wheat. In seme States tne growth has been so luxuriant that farmers have turned their stock Into the wheat. . Prior to last year the fly did little damage to wheat in this country. Last year the pest was more numerous and destructive. This season the pupa of the fly Is present in quantities sufficient to cause solicitude. J. PIerpont Morgan, the banker, and Wil liam Rockefeller," another millionaire, both sat on a Jury in New York a few days ago. In a trial between two scrubwomen, In which the verdict was $50 damages. They are not professional Jurors.

"THE REPUBLIC IS DEAD!' And, Worse Yet, Gamaliel Bradford Will Do Nothing for It. Springfield (Mass.) Union. We have some very startling news to communicate to our readers, but the Amer ican people are so engrossed Is attending strictly to business and they seem to have so much business to attend to that this terrible Intelligence may not create the widespread consternation and alarm which it otherwise would. But we have it on the authority of Mister Gamaliel Bradford, of Boston (excuse these sobs), that the "Re public is dead!" And the able echo of his wisdom in this community, the anti-Republican, alludes to this as the "second year of tho empire." We desire to break it to you gently, but it Is even worse than that. Just read what Mr. Bradford says; "I am so convinced that tho Republic ls dead that I shall not attempt to do anything more for it!" It is bad enough In all reason to have it so suddenly sprung upon us that the Re public Is dead, and to hear that an "em pire" has already been established In Its nlaee. but to be told In this cold and cruel manner that Gam. Bradford "will not at tempt to do anything more ror it!" ls simply crushing. It is appalling to think that the man who has, almost unaided and alone, according to his own best knowledge and belief, sustained tne Jiepuoiic through all the dangers of the past, should now get crumnv and absquatulate. e could en dure such a comparative trifle as the death of the Republic, but to have Gam. quit on account of defeat, like any ordinary chump. ls too dreadful to contemplate, when he knows well enough that if he would write a couple- of columns for the Transcript, which no one would read but himself, he cculd "save the country" Just as easy as rolling off a log. It really seems unkind. and we have not felt so bad about anything since we lost a collar button. SBSSSSSBaBBBaSSSSSSMSSBBBSSSSSnSSSSSSSBBSSMSBSBBSst No Cnnne for t-umlllnc San Francisco Chronicle.

Admiral George Brown left for home this afternoon. George Elliott, county clerk, and Floyd Woods left for home, via Philadelphia, this afternoon. Senator Fairbanks's committee on public buildings and grounds had a meeting to day, but the only, matter discussed was a fireproof hall of records here, something badly needed, and that was not finally acted upon. The late Col. John S. Williams, who was burled in Lafayette yesterday, had many friends In Washington. His brother, Gen. George B. Williams, and sister, Mrs. John E. Bates, reside, here.

MEASURES. mil to Prohibit Polygamy Introduced by Mr. Tnyler, of Ohio. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Representative Tayler, of Ohio, who was prominently iden tified in the movement to exclude Brigham Roberts, of Utah, from a -eat in Congress, to-day introduced a measure Intended to bring about federal prohibition of polyg amy. It proposes a constitutional amend ment for uniform laws on marriage and divorce. Mr. Tayler says, however, that his aim goes considerably beyond a mere uniformity of such .laws, and is expressly designed to reach polygamy, and put an enu to it. He regards this form of remedy as the most effective and far-reaching. Tho measure wa3 introduced after conference of those Interested In the subject, and, although Mr. Tayler ls not on ths judiciary committee, which will have charge of the measure, it was deemed desirable to have him present the matter and direct the ac tive movement which will begin in its be half.

PORTO RICO'S COMMISSIONER. No Provision Made for Admitting? Htm to the Floor of the Home. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. The commis sioner from Porto Rico, M. Degetau, re cently eiected by the people of the island to represent them in Congress, and In Washington generalis-. Is expected at the House of Representatives in a few days, and a large amount of mall Is being held for him by the House of Representatives. Representative Cooper, chairman of the insular committee, will make him at home in the quarters of that committee. His status on tho floor Is somewhat In doubt. He is aeslgnated in the law as a "resident ccmmlsfloner," and Is to receive a salary of $5,000 annually. On filing his credentials with the State Department he is to receive official recognition . by all . departments. Thtre Is r.o provision for his admission to the floor of the House, or for participation in debates, similar to the provisions for delegates from TerrUerf. it U expected, however, that hs will adxtJs and assist committees concernlcsT Porto XUean legis lation, and sttps may b taken to admit him to the floor. A peculiar question has arisen as .to whether Mr. Degetau will be a commission er at once, or comes in like the newly elected members of Congress, on March 4 next. The lw provided for an election in Porto Rtw. last month, and every two years thereafter, the apparent Intention being to have the commissioner begin his service with members of Congress on the succeeding March 4. But there is no pro vision postponing the term to March 4, ;and he probably will be entitled to official rec ognition and salary as soon as he reports. A 

POLITICAL SIARE'S NEST. Representative Jett Slaking Unwar ranted Charjres of Discrimination. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. 4 WASHINGTON, Dec. -Representative Jett, of Illinois, a Democrat, thinks he has discovered discrimination on the part of the Postoffice Department In 'establishing rural free delivery routes against districts represented by Democrats and in favor of those represented by Republicans. He says he has secured but nine rural free delivery routes in his district, as . against sixty es tablished and fifteen more ordered in the adjoining district, .represented by Mr. Ro denburg. Republican. Rodenburg had a hard fight for re-election, and, as a matter of fact, was defeated by a rank Democrat Populist. It ls alleged the Postoffice De partment established all these sixty routes in his district during the campaign in a vain effort to , save him. Representative Jett is preparing a resolution that he will Introduce next week calling on the post master general for information as to the principle on which these rural free deliv ery districts are established. He thinks the plan of discriminating In favor of Repub licans, or, rather, districts represented by Republicans, which is alleged to have been adopted by former First Assistant Post master General Heath, ls still in existence, lie will doubtless find that nothing of the sort exists and he has simply discovered a political mare's nest. ONLY 9320,002,000. Estimated Cost of a Deep Watervray from Chicago to the Atlantic. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-The complete report of the deep waterways commission was sent to the House of Representatives to-day. by Secretary Root. The project be fore the commission is one of vast magni tude, for a deep waterway and routes be tween the great lakes and Atlantic tide water. The estimated cost of a twenty-one-foot waterway Is given at $206,358,000, and of a thirty-foot waterway at $317,284,- 600. An additional amendment is made for deepening the harbors at Chicago and Du luth, making the total aggregate for the thirty-foot channel of $326,902,000. The cost of annual maintenance of the twenty-one-foot waterway is given at $2,343.47S, and of the thirty-foot waterway $2,930,308. The most favorable route, the commission states, for a thirty-foot waterway from the lakes to the sea ls "from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, via Lasalle and Leweston, and from Lake Ontario to the Hudson river, via Oswego and the Mohawk valley, and that the same route is practically as possible as any for the twenty-one-foot waterway." It is also pointed out by the commission that- this route is entirely in our own country. The report is signed by Lieutenant Colonel Raymond and Messrs. Alfred Noble and George Y. Wisner, con stituting the commission. Second-Class Mall Matter. WASHINGTON. Deo. 7. The report of the third- assistantv postmaster general shows that the total receipts from all sources of postal revenue during the year amounted to $102,334, 579, while the expendi tures reached $107,740,267. The value of the total number of pieces of stamped paper Issued to postmasters was $97,687,771, a net increase over the Issue of tho previous year of $7,536,111. The report says that the most of the abuse of the second-class of mail matter have been eliminated or cur tailed, but urges legislation on "book seri als," "premiums for subscriptions" and the "return of unsold matter to news agents. " It is also asked that Congress be urged to pass an act consolidating the third and fourth classes of mall matter. Recommendation is made that the sum of $30,000 be appropriated for the Issuance free to the public of a pamphlet contain ing postal information for reference. mr 9 Cnt in Revenue Too Deep. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-The Cabinet to day discussed the House bill revising the war revenue act, which proposes a cut of about $40,000,000 in the revenues. There is no dlff erenco of opinion among the mem bers of the administration on this subject, all thinking that the cut ls too deep and agreeing that It would be unwise In the extreme to make the cut greater than o.ooo, ooo.

The Military Academy appropriation bill will be taken up by the House committee on military affairs next Tuesdaj'. At that time, also, it is said, the resolution nsklng the secretary of war to investigate the al leged hazing of Cadet Booz, at West Point, will be favorably reported. The House committee on naval affairs has complimented the acting chairman of the committee, Representativa Foss. of Illinois, by unalnmously selecting him to the important chairmanship of that com mittee, made vacant by the recent resigna tion of Mr. Boutelle, of Maine. Representative Mondell, of Wyoming, has received a petition from A. N. Kepolka and A., B. Lowenstlne, of Hawaii, stating that tho. election of the Hawaiian delegate, Wil cox, was irregular.

In relation to the lynching Ii La Salle county, Texas, on Oct. 5, 1S95, of Florentine Suaste, a Mexican citizen, the President, lit a special message sent to the Senate yesterday, recommends that the Mexican government be paid $2,000 for the heirs of the victim. The recommendation is made from motives of humanity, and "without reference to the question of liability of the government of the United States." Senator Hawley, chairman of the Senate committee on military affairs, says his committee will have its first sitting fcr consideration of the army bill next Mon day morning at 10:30 o'clock. He added It was not the purpose of the Senate to grant a conference if the House should ask it on the bill as it now stands, and that he did not believe It to be the purpose of the House to ask a conference.

They would have swelled the total immigration to 514,257 had they traveled in the steerage.

Elwell, of the Fore river works of Massachusetts; the Moran Broth ers, of Seattle; President Taylor and Mr. Tarbett, of the RIsden Shipbuilding Com pany; John Dialogue, of Camden, and a number of others identified with shipbuild ing.

Th-s notable feature was the attempt on the part of the younger and smaller concerns to break the lines of the old organizations, which have constructed all of the heavy vessels of the new navy up to this time. While It ls not possible at this moment to forecast results accurately, there are indi cations that in at least one instance and perhaps two Instances, these attempts will be attended .with some degree of success, for It looks as though some of the work will be bestowed on the Fore River Com pany, which appears for the first time as -a bidder for constructing armored ships. Tho Pacific coast, too, presents a likely candidate in the Morans' bid. Because of changes made in the specifications by the bidders, tho general tendency of which Is to reduce considerably the equipment of the ships, it Is not possible yet to te'l which of the bids are actually the lowesc As read they are as follows: Armored Cruisers. Union Iron Works, San Francisco One sheathed and coppered, $3,800,000; one with out sheathing, $3.750.000; another under same conditions, $3,750,000, making two in all.
