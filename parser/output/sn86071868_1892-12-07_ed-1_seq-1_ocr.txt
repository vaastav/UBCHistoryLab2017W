WASHINGTON, Doc. 0 ?Presidont Har? rison submitted his message to Congress to day. The mossago contains a largo amount of statistics in favor of pro? tection and also deals with other ques? tions of tho day in a vory thorough manner. Tho message opens as fol lows: "In submitting my annual message to Congri ss I havo great satisfaction in being able to say that tho general con? ditions affecting tho commercial and in? dustrial interests of tho United States aro in tho greatost dogreo favorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with thoao of tho most favored period in tho history of tho country will, I be licve, show that so high a degreo of prosperity and so general a di?Vrenco of tho comforts of lifo were never bofore enjoyed by our people. "The total wealth of the country in 1800 was Sil?. 15!),010,003. In 1S90 It amounted to 802,010,000,000, an increase of 287 per cent The total mileage of railways in tho United States in 1800 was 30,020. In 1800 it was 107,741, an increase of 448 per cent., and it is esti? mated that there will bo about 4,000 miles of track added by tho close of the year 1893. Tho otllcial roturns of tho eleventh census and those of tho tenth census for soventy-Qvo leading cities furnish the basis for tho following com? parison i: "In I860 the capital Invested in manu fucturiv.g was 81,232,839,070. In 1890 tho capital invested in manufacturing was 82,1)00,735,SSI In 1SS0 the number of employes was 1,130,388. In 1890 tho number of employes was 2,3.11,134. In 1880 the wages earned were $501,905, 708. In 1890 tho wages oarnod wero 61,231,170.454. In 1880 the value of the product was.52,711,579,890, In 1890 tho value of tho product was S4.860.2S0 s:i7. cl am informed by the superintendent of tho census that tun omission of cer? tain industries in 1SS0, which wero in? cluded in 1800, accounts in part for tho remarkable increase thus shown- Hut, I aftor making full allowance for differ j enco of method and deducting the re turns for all industries not included in tho census of 1880, there remain in tho reports from tbeso seventy flvo cities an incroaso in tho capital employed of SI,522,745,004; in tho valuo of tho pro? duct of $2,024,236,106; in tho wages earned of $077,t43,92'.), and In tho num? ber of wage earners employed of 850, 029. Tho wage earnings not only show ? an increased aggregate, but an increase per capita from $380 in 1SS0 to $:.17 in 18*.)(), or 41.71 per cent. "The now industrial plants estab? lished since October C, 1890, and up to Octobor 22, 1892, as partially reported in tho American Economist, number 345, and tho extension of existing plants 128; tho now capital invested amounts to 840,449,050, and tho number of addi? tional employes to 37,285. "Tho 'Textile World" for July, 1S92, states that during the first Six months of the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of which forty are cotton mills, for.y-cight knitting mills, twenty-six woolen mills, llfteen silk mills, four plush mills and two linen mills. Of the forty cotton mills twenty one havo been built in tho Southern States. Mr. A. li. Shepp< rson, of tbo Now York Cotton Exobaoge, estimates the number of working opindles in tho United Statoa on September I, 1892, at 15,200,000. an incroaso of 000,000 over tho year 1801. Tho consumption of ot ton by American mills, in 1801, was 2,300,000 bales and in 1892 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 

ISS.OOO bales. "From tho year ISO'.) to 1SP2 inclusive there has been an increase in the con? sumption of cotton in Europe of i)2 per cent whilo during the same period \ti" increased consumption in thi United J States has been about 150 por cent. Tho report of Ira Aver, special agonl of tho Treasury Department, shows that at the date of September 30, 1892, tnero were thirty-two companies manu factoring tin and tin plate in the United Slates and fourtoen companies building new works for such manufacture. Tho estimated investmi nl in buildings and plants at tho cio.-e of tho fiscal year June 30, 1893, if existing conditions were to bo continued, was 8500,000 and tho estimated rato of production 2i!U, 600,000 pounds per annum. Tho actual production for tho quarter ending Sep? tember 30. 1S92, was 10.053,725 pounds. Labor Commissioner Peck, who main such a sensation during tho campaign, is quoted to show the incroaso of wage.',, as is also the report of tho commissioner of Massachusetts. The Prosidont gives statistics in regard to the production of pig iron and bessomer steel. Tho pro d notion of bessern er steel rails for the past six months of 1892 was 772,436 grosB tons, as against 702.080 gross tons during tho last six months of tho year 1891 

FOHKIOK TRADE AND KXI'ORTS. The message shows an increase in the value of our foreign trade for the past final year of $28,280,004. Tho average annual value of our im? ports and exports of merchandise for the ton fiscal years prior to 1891 was 81,457,322,019. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1892 exceeds this annual average value by $400.353,591, an increase of 27.47 per cont The value of our exports during tho fiscal year 1892 reached the h ghost figure in tho history of tho (lovornraont, amounting to $1,( 30.278,148. exceeding by $145,797,338 tho exports of 1891, and ? xceeding tho valuo of tho imports by $202,875,006. THE COAST TI1ADK. "In our coastwise trade a most encour OAN* E. VA., WEDNESDAY aging development is in progress, there having boon in the last four years an in? crease of 10 per cent. In internal com meree tho statistics show that no such period of prosperity has over boforo ex? isted." Tho President quotes from an array of figures to show the amount of freight carried on tho great lakes, and makes a comparison between tho foreign trado of London and Liverpool and that pass? ing through tho Detroit rivor. "There never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or when wages were as high, whether meas? ured by tho currency in which thoy aro paid or by tboir power to supply tho necossaries and comforts of lifo." 

THIS KAUM PRODUCTS. The ngricltural Meld is reviewed and figures quoted showing tho incroaso in farn-. products sinco 1800. ,-lf any urn discontented with their state hnro, if any believe that wages or prices, their returns for honest toil, aro inadequate they should not fail to re member that tbero is no othor country in the world whoro the condition that seem to thorn hard would not be ac? cepted as highly prosperous. Tho En? glish agriculturist would be glad to exebanzo tho roturns of his labor for tuoso of the American fartnor and tho Manchester workmen their wages for those of thoir fellows at Fall Rivor." TA HI F r REV E X U E. "It is not my purposo to renew tho argument in favor of a protective tariff. Tho result ol tho recent election must bo accopted as having introduced a now policy. Wo must assume that the pres? ent tariff, constructed upon tho lines o' protection, is to bo ropealed, and that ibere is to bo substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference to revenue; that no duty is to bo higher because tho increase will koop open an American mill or keep up the wages of American workmen, but that in every caso such a rate of duty is to bo imposed as will bring to the treasury of the United States tho largest returns of rovenuo. Trio contest bus not boon be? tween schedules, but between princi? ples, and it would be offensive to sug? gest that the prevailing party will not carry into legislation the principles ad? vocated by it, and the pledges given u the people. "The tariff bills passed by the Dohm? of Representatives at, the last session were, as 1 BUppose, oven in the opinion of their promoters Inadequate r.nd justi? fied only by tho fact that tho Senate and House of Representatives were not in accord and that u general revision could not therefore bo undertaken. 'I recommend that tho whole subject of tariif revision be left to the incoming Congress. It is a matter of regret that this werk must be delayed for at least tbroo months for tho threat of great tariff changes introduces so much un? certainty that an amount not easily estimated of business inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result." Tho President hero devotes a largo amount of spaco to tho benefits of a pro? tective tariff and the evil effects that he fears will follow changes in the law. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. * "Our relations with tho other nations are now undisturbod by anysorious con? troversy. The complicated and threat? ening differences with Germany and England relating to Samoan affairs, with England in relation to tho seal fisheries in the Hering sea, and with Chili, growing out of the Baltimore af? fair, have boen adjusted. "Especial care has boen taken to secure markets for farm products in order to rolievo that great underlying industry of tho depression which tho lack of an adequate- firelgn market for our surplus ofton brings. An opening has also been made for manufactured products that will undoubtedly, if that policy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. The full benelits of theso arrangements c innot bo realized Instantly- Now linos of trade aro to bo opened. Tho commercial travolor must survey tho field. The manufacturer must adapt his goods to the new markets and facilities for exchange must bo established. This work has been well begun by our morcuants and manufacturers having out -red the new fields with courage and enterprise." The President:- reviews the Bering sea controversy, and relates the progress that has been made towatds its settle? ment. Me also discusses the canal con? troversy witli Canada and the efforts to make a reciprocal treaty, attributing the failure of the latter to the fact thai Canada could make no trade concessions in fnvor of America to the disadvantage of tbo mother country. He suofjosts that a radical revision of trade relations with Canada should be made and says: ' Our relations must continuo to bo inti mate, and they should bo friendly. I rpgrot to say, however, that in ruanr of tho controversies, notably thoso as to tho fisheries on the Atlantic, tho sealing interest on the Pacific and tho canal 'oils our negotiations with Great Britian have continuously boen thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriondly objections and protests from Canada. "In tbomatter of canal tolls our treaty rights were totally disregarded It is hardly too rr uch to say that the Cana? dian Pacific and othor railway lines, which parallel our northern boundary, are sustained by commerce having either its origin or terminus, or both, in the United States. Canadian railroads com? pete with thoso of the United States for our traffic and without tho restraints of our interstate commerce act. Theli cars pass almost without detention into and out of t ur territory. "Our interchanges upon lines of land transportation should not be put uuon a different basis, and our entire indepen? dence of Canadian canals and of tho St. Lawrence as an outlet to tho sea, secured by thn construction of an Amer? ican canal around the fall of Niagara and the opening of 'hin communication between tho Great Lake*- and one of our own sea ports We should not hesitate to avail ourselves ol our great natural trado advantages " The mossage ?p'aks of the manner in which American missionaries bavo

"The Congress has been already ad? vised that tho invitations of this Gov orumont for tho assembling of a:, inter? national monetary conference to consider the question of an enlarged use of silver were accepted by the nations to which they were addressed. Tho conference assembled at l.rustels on the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration of this great question. I havo not doubted, and have taken occa? sion to express that belief, as well in the invitations issued for this confer? ence as in my public messages, that tho free coinage of silver upon an agreed international ratio would greatly pro? mote the interests of our people and equally thoso of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may be accomplished by tho conference. "If any temporary check or delay in? tervenes I boilevo that very soon com? mercial conditiors will compel the now reluctant governments to unite with us in this movement to secure tho enlarge? ment of the volumes of coined money needed for tho transaction of the bus iness of the world " CONDITION or TUR TREASURY*. "Tho report of tho Secretary of the Treasury will attract especial interest in view of tho many misleading state? ments that havo been made as to the state of tho public revenues. Three preliminary faots should not only bo stated but emphasized before looking Into details: First, that the public debt ha9 been reduced since March 4, ISxJO, 8850,074,300 and the annual interest charge of 811,685,400. Second, that there has been paid out for pensions during this administration up to No vombi-r 1, 1SC2, SI33,504,17S 70, an 8N oess of 8114,460,886 00 over the sum ex? pended during the period from March 1, 1885, to March 1, 1SSS; and third, that under the exlshting taritf up to December 1, about 893,ooo,ooo of revo nuo which would have been collected upon imported sugars, if tho duty had been maintained, has gono into tho pockets of the people and not in'.o tho public treasury as before. '?If there are any who still think that the surplus should havo been kept out of circulation by hoarding it in tho treasury, or deposited in favored banks without iuiorest, while the Government continued to pay to tht6o very banks interests upon the bonds deposited as security for the deposits, or who think that tho extended pension legislation was a public robbery, or that the duties upon sugar should havo been main? tained, I am content to leave the argu? ment where it now rests, while we wait to see whether these criticisms will take the form of legiilation. "Tho revenues for tho fiscal year, endinir June 30, 1803, from ail sources were 512.1,808,260.33 and tho expendi? tures for a 1 purposes were 541.1,053, 80(5 .10, leaving a balance 0180,014,453.66. There wero paid during the year upon the public debt 510.570,407.08. The surplus in tho Treasury and the bond redemption fund passed by tho act of .July 14. lS'.'O, to tho general fund fur? nished in largo part tho cash available and used for tho payments made upon the public dobt. Compared with the year 1801 our receipts from customs duties fell off 542.060,241 OS, while our receipts from internal revenue increased SS,234,823 13, leaving tho net loss of revenue from tbeso principal 6ourcoa ?S'13,7S4,417 05. The not loss of revenue from all sources was 832,075,072 81. ?'Tho revenues, estimated and actual, for tho fiscal year ending dune 30, 1803, are placed by the Secretary at 8403,336, 350 44 and the expenditures at $401, 330,350 44, showing a surplus of receipts over i xpendituros of 82,000,000. The cash balance in the Treasury at the end of tho flsc il vear, it is estimated, will bo 830,002.377 03." REPORTS OP TIIK SECRETARIES. Tho President quotes from the reports of tho Postmaster-General in regard to the Increasi in the number of postollicos during the year and the increase in rev? enue f rom the same. Tho President a'.so refers to tho ro port of trie Secretary of tho Navy as exhibiting great progress In tho con? struction of the new navy When the present Secretary entered upon bis duties only three modern steel vessels wero in remruis^ion. Tho vessels since put in commission and to bo put in commission during tho winter will make a total of nineteen during his administration of tho de? partment. During the current year ten war vessels and throe navy tugs havo been launched and during the four years twenty five vessels will have been launched. Two other lar?e ships and a torpedo boat are under contract and trio work upon them will advance rapidly an I the four monitors are waiting only the arrival of their armors, wbiob nave been unexpectedly delayed or they would havu been before this in com m ission. Contracts have been let during this administration under the appropriations for the increase of the navy, including new vessels and their appurtenances to the amonnt of 835,000,000, and there ban been expended during the same period for labor at tho navy yards upon similar work S3.000.000. Tho President speaks of the increased work in tho Intorlor Department and pays a trlbuto to Secretary Noble and bis assistants. The work of tho land office is gone into and tho different land schemes explainod. Tho Indian ques? tion is discussed and a uniform sot of text books recommended for tho na? tional schools. Tno Prosldont roiterates the assortion made in a former message that tho care of the disabled voterans of tho late war is a matter of national concern and duty. It is estimated that the maximum ex? penditures for pensions will bo reached June 30, 1894. Uncle Jerry Rusk and his agricultural department receive a good deal of atton tion, tho President going into the work >rgs of tho dopartmont very thoroughly : nd quoting figures quite freolv- The lecent cholora scarce Is also mentioned und the quarantine regulations upheld.

"To tho Ilonorahlo President and Coun? cil of tho City of Roanoke. ''IiKXTi.kmkx: I beg to recommend to your honorable body to reconsider the resolution passed November it*, award? ing the contract for the lighting of the city by electricity to VV. fl. MacKay A: Co.. for tho following roasons: "Tho n solution as passed, should it becomo a law, is a virtual acceptance of the hid of W. rl. MacKay A Co., as ten? dered. This bid, while it is tho lowest offered, 1 regard as quite defective in regard to details, specifications, etc. It has been said that thoso matters of de? tail could bo covered by coin-rant. Lf tho resolution, as stated above, should bo approved, then no new matter could be introduced except by tho sanction and approval of tho said YV. 11. MaoKay A Co. Thoro are several important points in tho bid of Maclvay ?b Co. which, if accepted, would not, I believe, inure to the benefit of tho city. "I do not deem it nocos-ary to discuss theso at this time. 1 would suggest that if this resolution bo reconsidered that the cotnrcitteo on lights, or suoh a ' comtniOteo as you may think proper take up the question at once and confer with MacKay A Co. and see if such an agreement can be arrived at that will bo satisfactory to all parties in interest. I am informed by MacKay SiCo., that they will meet the city on any fair and equitable ground. I desiro to seo the city lighted by electricity at tho earliest moment possible, but tho interests of tho city should bo fully protected at tho same time. Respectfully submitted, "11. S.

Mr. Dupuy olfered as an amend? ment that the mayor bo requested to ro turn the resolutions with or without his approval. Tho substitute vas lost by a voto of nino to eight. Tho original question then came up and the commun? ication was roforred to the committee on lights. A second communication was read from tho mayor, asking that no more contracts bo awarded or money expended until tho city work now being executed was completed. A communication was read from the board of public works, stating that no ordinance had been provided for tho burial of paupers who died outside of the almshouso. Neither was thore an ordinance providing for burial oxponses of paupers. Tho matter was reforred to tho ordinance committee Tho board of public works stated that no building permits had been issued for tho month of November. The report of tho firo hoard was road j asking that Council confirm tho olee tic n of tho oillcers for tho ensuing year. Tho report was received and tho otllceirs confirmed. A communication was re? ceived from the Junior Hose Company asking the city to orect a new building for them as their present quarters woro too small. The communication was re? ferred to the public property committee. A motion prevailed that an ordinance be draftod to establish grades on all streets that had boon graded and ma? cadamized. Tho finance oommlttOG, after malring a thorough investigation of tho city finances,submitted a lengthy report of the money paid out and urged that the board of public works use the strictest economy in the expenditure of money for street work. The street committee, in view of tbo IInances of the city being a little short, presented a report that all street work and sidewalks, where tho abutting prop? erty owners have the entile cost to pay and where the owners had not had a hearing up to Decomb?r <i. tho work should tie slopped. Mr. Crablll offered j a substitute that as the money would be paid by the abutting property owners I within ninety days tho work of laying the hocrd side-walks should he allowed to go on. Thesubst tuto was carried A communication was reoelved from the Fidelity Loan and Trust Company asking that Council give tbotl) an option for fifteen days on city bonds amounting to 8(5,000 at 101 S;. On motion of Mr. McClelland tho otfor was rejected. The street committee otlorod a recom? mendation that whenever permission was granted to orect telephone or tele? graph poles it shall bo the duty of the company which erects them to specify to the street committee the number and sizos of poles to be erected, and that a liconse for the satno shall bo issued by the board of public works and a license fee of St becharged (or each poloerected.
