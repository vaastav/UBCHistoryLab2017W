What better than that some of our surplus should be sent abroad to help .carry the starving millions through the winter? - In deed, this would also seem to be an appropriate time for) a movement at home similar to that tme during the war, when the slogan was "buy, a bale of cotton." Perhaps it might be called the Tat a bite of mush" movement With eggs and . bther breakfast dishes selling at prices out of proportion to the cost of cornmeal, the north may yet come to' find this middle) western product as useful as it'has been, in the soth for a hundred years. ' It is not exact to say that the people of Europe are not familiar, with corn, nor is it necessary, to say . that starving people" must . take what is offered them. The encyclopedias - jtate that large quantities of this cereal have been consumed in southern and eastern Europe and in the Orient, but that it is little knon to northern Europe, In gome of these dis tricts it is grown, and v it is imported into, others from America. i As far back as the late 40s, at the time of the potato blight in Ireland, the city of 'Balti- 'more lent a shipload of coj-n to relieve th famine. At first the strange product was re- garded with suspicion, but the eventual con clusion was that if Americans could eat it, i Irishmen could, too.' The trial was so success ful that shipload after shipload was subsequent ly sent for,' and , "stirabout," as the dish is known there, is one of the principal articles of diet in the island to. this day. , ; Jfebraskam wilf remember that back in the WsvcoVn was extremely plentifund painfully cheap. At the same time there was a famine in Italy. Sterling Morton, who was then secre ' tary of agriculture, sent a shipment of corn afyroad, . with men to demonstrate its uses. Italy is today one of the largest importers of corn from America. i Th suggestion of Walter S. Jardine that part of the food supplies to be sent abroad through American relief agencies be made up of corn is one that is practical in all points. Congressman Reavis has also brought thia mat ter to the attention of Herbert Hoovernand no , doubt proper consideration will be given to the proposal. ' ' ria districts "where corn is not "generally known, the methods of cooking it can be easily acquired. Hunger will be satisfied, for corn ranks high in comparison with other cereal grains as food for man. A permanent market for export cornj would be built up at the same time, to the mutual advantage of the farmers fcf the middle west and the people of Europe. Omaha's Enterprising Negroes. An item In The Bee is commended to the fspecial attention of all its readers. It tells of Ihe election of officers of the Colored Com mercial club. This should serve to impress on all the fact that the negroes of Omaha are not $Vot the type who so frequently figure ' in police court records, whose lives are given to rap shooting or jazz dancing. As a matter of teal truth, this element is the lesser part of the fcolored population of the city, both in num- ; Iters and importance. The others, intelligent, educated, industrious, enterprising negroej, sel dom are, heard frorn, because they go about their town business, attend to the affairs entrusted to them, and carry o in the sober way that makes for good citizenship. In the list of officers of tht club is presented and the organization is not a new affair, buf has long passed the.experi menfal stageare names that many business i men will reeognke as those of responsible, capable citizens; preachers, doctors and lawyers - are also included, ample evidence of the quality of life that reallydoes mark the advancement of the colored race and its contribution to the" population and growth of the city, ""The Colored Commercial club" not only denotes the aspiration pi its members but the established (act that it represents substantial men "and women whose presence in the community is not a menace or a matter for regret. With its present roster of officers and committee chairmen, it should go forward to bettef service, not only 'for the eol pred people but .for Omaha. , 11 Greet Nationalism Run Mad. )'- There is a touch of the medieval about the Qrecian political situation. The enthusiasm over the impending return of King Constantine when with less effort a republican form of gov " ernment might be established may well amaze onlooker in America." In face of the warning of the great powers pf Europe, the British re fusal pf credit, and the French proposal to en . epurage'the "Turks to wret back Smyrna from y Greece, this people persist in their strange de vption not only to tlie form of monarchy, but , ffj - the monarch wUo was deposed by allied pj-essure during the war as being too friendly with Germany; y I It is npt siirpri.ing that the preeks shoujd "resent the attempt of the allies to 'dictate who sjiould rule th,em, but it !s patrlotfsm run mad ' ' for them to insist on being ruled by a king whose necesslon quite probablywill mean the , disslut'on of the . extensive empire that , was warded ' Greece after the war. - '. '; .The idva'tif. monarchy has not been killed by the war, and, it is questionable if democracy m the r Ik. u ol ripublicauim has made much headway, It, is true that the people of Greece went through thfl formality of olecting their king, but still the office is hereditary md the choice once made can be altered only by revo lution. , , , President's Message to -Congress. ( , No bitterness is noted in the message to congress from the president whose policies and party hatr been so utterly repudiated by the voters. Tfie utterance 'of Woodrow Wil son, addressing the, body just' cpnvened for its closing session at Washington is entirely devoid of the tragic, " On the contrary van un. usual dignity characterizes the document; Its monitory aspeetwust commend itself because of the sincerity of the expression, 7he con clusion will be that it was Woodrow Wilson's head and not, his heart that , led him into a course where the" people declined to . follow him. The president's advice to congress fcV lows lines that, were anticipated, dealing with modifications -of the revenue law, alterations in the form of " taxation, care for certain ad ministrative features, independence for the Philippines and assistance for Armenia taking first place. All of these will be given con sideration by . congress, although with, due re gard to the approaching change in administra tion holds equally a change in the major policy. oi the government.

DECEMBER 8, 1920,- J Juit Between HoutfcWives. -7 , Confessinlg an abysmal and oerliaos renre- Jiensible ignorance, as to the ethics, etiquette, amenitiej or what not. that shduld subsist, sur round or chlracterize the relations between reigning First tadjrof tlje Land and her, pros pective successor, we' want to corrtmefld the ac tion pf Mrs.-Edith Boiling "Wilson in showing Mrs. Florence Kling' Harding ovex the place and giving her iorae advance tips as to the housekeeping details." This was a neighborly act, Mrs; Wilson expects to move out about March next, and Mrs. Hardjng will then move in. It is, therefore, only a reasonable exhi bition of graiiousness that the one should afford h other an opportunity to get a little know ledge "If the menage and be thus enabled to jay some plans as to where she is goirig to put things, and how to arrange the furniture and all that. Men know very little pbout such mat ters, but the women .folks will appreciate it. One of trie traditions of the White House has been that each occupant on retiring leave something to be added to the equipment, a dinner, service, some ' furniture or the like. A result of this has been that from time to time the mistress of the establishment on assuming sway has to evict a lot of junk accumulated from' preceding administrations. Mrs. Wilson did this, and Mrs. Harding probably will, but the succession of memories" will never be broken. The comforting fact is that fewjf any of the women who have presided over the presidential mansion ever have sought to impose the dead hand of their role on the one who comes after. Another angle of the affair must strike Amer icans!. While the Wilsons and the Hardings are as far apart as the poles politically, they are yet American citizens, and can therefore be good friends. This redeeming trait of our national life was anticipated by the witty Irishman who long" ago wrote of the Dublinese'that they were i Fightin' like divils for conciliation, And hatin' each other for the love of God. So long as the White House can be handed from one presidential family to another, accom panied by the good wishes of the retiring First Lady of the Land to the incoming mistress of the mansion, all will b well with America so far as the perpetuity of our institutions is con cerned.

Those In the second line were having their blood pressures taken with an apparatus which registered on an upright pole standing ten feet above the ground. I presume the man was given his blood pressure and also was informed as to the blood pressure proper for men of his age. To my mind this mob, eager to have these two tests. Is an illustration of the interest in personal hygiene. Every man in the line had some curiosity to know whether he was overweight or underweight. From the looks of the crowd I imagine the lunch rooms in the vicinity were a little less crowded that day and most of the patrons who came over from tho lobby of the city hall ordered "an apple unci a toothpick.' How ever brief a time they stayed on short rations something was gained by putting the thought of overweight in the back part of their heads. Likewise with the blood pressure bunch. A blood pressure taken under the circumstances is only of limited value. But I dare say most of the men who were told that their blood pressures were far from the normal for their weight had the subject in vestigated further, The whole signi ficance of blood pressure Is not settled as yet.

To the Editor of The Bee: Glad to notice the other day that The Bee took exceptions to a statement by Mr. Shroyer that tha farmers would turn to bolshevlsm 1 they were not at once handed a big fat turkey on a golden platter. It seems to me that the politicians and the newspa pers have been vying with each other as to who could shout the loudest and prate the most about the "poor farmer going broke," in the meanwhile forgetting that there are merchants, manufacturers and some other people feeling the effects of declining prices and stagnation of business just as much as are the farmers. While we know and realise that the farmer is not getting for his grain and live' stock what he did during" the last few years, every thinking person knows that he prof ited by the ascending prices a few years ago in the same manner as did the others, and they were en titled to it, and so that now it would seem, only logical that they share with others the burden of the tie- Hclining prices without any special I legislation or favors' not accorded the other fellow.

The found out 30 years ago that populism did not pay, anfl so are not likely to pin much faith . en Townleyism." -; Jn reference to the above Item from your editorial column please bear in mind that the Nebraska farmers of SO years ago used populism as the vehicle to get out from under ,a con dition which was very comparable to that which is oppressing them to-, day. When they got what they went after populism,, which was simply an early day manifestation of the present "Nonpartisan leaguism," was thrown overboard, as I have no doubt the modern vehicle will be, when the farmers ef this and other states have taught the greedy, gov ernment-protected thieves, that there Is limit to the impositions that will submit to. Personally, I do not approve of the Nonpartisan league and think that If the farmers of the state would devote the same thought, energy and money which they are putting into Townleyism toward per fecting a state and nationwide or ganization of their farmers unions snd co-operative associations, they would net only accomplish more for them selves, but would achieve a more permanent and- compelling protee tor of their interests. But Townleylpm and thq Non partisan league seems to be to the farmer the handiest tool to use for his purpose. And you leather chair artists who sit snugly in the cities would be considerably startled if you cquld get out Into the country and learn first-hand the extent to which Townleyism has already got its grip on the farmers of this state. And I havo no doubt that what applies to Nebraska applies to other neigh boring states as well, for the con ditions there are practically the same as here. The poor, down-trodden railroads, big manufacturers, and various other interests can set up a large ''squawk" the minute their toes are pinched and the government rushes valiantly to their rescue with untold millions And the "farmer, In his simplicity" gets it In the neck. ' But bear In mind that Just because the f"ner is not so loud and Insistent with his "squawk" is no eign that he isn t doing anything. "8tlU watars run deep,'' and some of these days tha greedy robbers of the farmer and the powers that allow them to prey upon him are going to bo awakened, or put permanently to eleep. by an ex plosion that will blow , their snug ness so far that It never will i get back.
