ETHTOR. WEDXESDAT ItiQRXlNG, 1IEC. 6, 1882. Congress President's Message. Congress met on Monday and about the only buoinesa transacted was the reading of the President's Message. This document is very highly com mended by the press of the country. We have neither time nor ppace to give it this week, but will endeavor to lay it before our readers in the form of a supplement next week. And bow the English have a new cause for complaint against Turkey. It seems that it has been discovered that the Turkish soldiers aro carrying on a large contraband trade of tobacco. It would be altogether too bad if the sol diers should beat the English tax gath erers out of a little cash by their sly tricks. The necessity for a special session of the U. S. Senate after the 4th of March next lies in this fuct : That as the term of office of David Davis, who is now the President of the Senate, will ex pire on that day, unless the Senate is called together and elects a successor, there would be no one to act as Presi dent of the United States in the event of President Arthur's death. The debt statement shows the exact reduction of the public liability during November to be $5,534,542. The cash in the treasury is the comfortable little sum of $287,867,113 The government is still able to meet its obligations, and therefore has no reason to be at all anxious for the future. As every one of ns is interested to a greater or less extent in these euperbundant millions, all naturally watch the monthly figures closely and in their minds hold our representatives to a strict accounta bility. Derrick. The Philadelphia Times thinks that there will no longer be any uncertain ty as to the meaning of the phrase "a tariff for revenue only" should Demo cratic advocates succeed in incorpo rating it into the law. It would mean the American market flooded with for eign products, and the American man ufacturers and producers of all grades unable to compete, except by reducing wages to the foreign level. It would mean no new industries springing up, and one after another of the old ones, especially those of recent growth, suc cumbing under the stress of foreign competition, and yet this is the teast to which the Times invited the people of this country previous tj the elec tion. "The ignorance of the editor of the Republican is proverbial." Com monweallh. And the prevarications (not to call them by a plainer name) of the manager of the Commonwealth are legion. He said that it was "now demonstrated beyond a doubt that the next Congress will contain ten or twelve Greenback Congressmen," and we asked him to name one besides Patton and Crumm, who were princi pally elected by Democrats and Re publicans respectively, and would vote with those parties right along, where upon ho took his penholder and after stirring up the debris, found that out in Iowa a poor disgruntled Democrat Greenback fuBioniet bad been elected over Updegraff, Republican, by a mis erable majority. To show what part the Greenbackers played in that elec tion, it is only necessary to give the vote in Updegraff's district, (which Jasper says has "hertofore given about 6000 Republican majority" and which is nearly three thousand of a prevari cation,) at the last Congressional elec tion, in 1880 ; it was as follows : Re publicaus 17,359, Democrats 13,968, Greenbackers 2,193. Don't it look just a little bit absurd to see the latter party claiming a victory in the face of such figures?" Again; he claims the election of Begole, Govornor of Mich igan, as a Greenback victory, when in reality that party had but 34,895 votes in 1880, when it polled its biggest vote, against 131,597 Deraocratio ; pretty hard run, arn't you? And yet the Commonwealth manager does not scruple to asserts that "there will be tea or twelve Greenback Congress men in the next Congress." Now Jas per, the editor of the Republican may be very ignorant, but Le always makes an honest endeavor to get as near the truth as possible, and won't auj don't btve to resort to lying to bolster up Lis party. ,t.

WKSK, - Beginning of the Harvest. It is to bo expected that parties who took great interest in the election of Pattison and a democratic congress will deny that the fear of tho advent of that party into power has caused the stagnation in the manufacture of steel rails. Indeed, it would not be surprising to find tho inauguration of an absolute free trade policy followed by a stout assertion that the resultant destruction ot the iron interest had nothing whatever to do with it. The Pittsburgh Dispatch which labored so efliciently in the Pattison viucyard, has published several interviews with manufacturers of steel rails, for tho purpose of explaining awBy the reduc tion of prices in that branch of indus try. Mr. E. F. Ilartfield, president of the Lackawaca Iron and Coal com pany, says: "The question of tariff has nothing whatever to do with it." The same gentleman in the same in terview when asked : "Has an antic ipated reduction of tho tariff on steel rails anything to do with the present low prices?" replied : "Only so far as causing railroad companies to hold back from buyiag, in the hope of get ting lower prices if tho tariff is re duced." Here we have the whole truth con firmed by one who is tr)ing his best to hide it. How could a democratic success affect the price of a protected product except to induce buyers to hold off for lower prices in the hope that the tariff on that product would be reduced by the success? The pro fessions of democratic sympathy with a tariff for protection are not believed by anybody. That complete demo cratic control of all branches of the national government would be followed by such an adjustment of the duties on imports as would beggar every home industry which needs protection, is firmly believed by every intelligent American citizen, as well as by free trade Europe. It is because of this that democratic campaigns have been supplied by British gold, a plan considered by them to be so much more honorable than contributions by American office holders. We felt this in the Tilden campaign, and the plethoric pockets of the democratic bosses, in the late campaign in this State, makes it a reasonable supposi tion that the hand ot the Free Trade League scattered its British gold even within the limits of Crawford county. The Philadelphia North American, one of whose owners, as the indepen dent candidate for Congressman-at-Large, helped elect a democrat to that office, gives the following frank opinion of the result of democratic success : : "Should the worst happen, the misfortune will be largely attributable to the success which the democrats achieved at the late election. Of course the fact that the democrats have been placed in power is not the only reason why the companies men tioned are thinking about stopping work. Several causes have combined to lay upon them the necessity of suspension. What alarms manufac turers more than the skrinkage of the demand and the decrease of prices is the fact that a Congress has just been elected which is hostile to the mainte nance of the tariff, and that (he as cendancy of the Democratic party is the signal for an assault upon the sys tem whoso protection alone the manu facture of steel rails in the United States can be carried on." In this connection it will be of in terest to the laboring man, irrespect ive of politics, to know that the presi-' dent of the Lackowana Iron and Coal Co., in the interview from which we have quoted above, says of the cheap ening of Bteel rails : "It is true that the present cost of production to us is over $40 per ton, but wo hope to get lower by some reduction in wages and the cheapening of materials." We do not know that the wages of steel work ers is excessively high just now, but rather incline to the opinion that it is already too low.'but, as the manu facturer cannot pay more for making an article than he can sell it for, the price he gets for it must control the price he is able to pay for materials, labor, Ac. This brings the question of the tariff home to the laboring man. It touches him in the tenderest spot. It appeals to him by tho mouths of bis wife and children. It is pro tection and plenty against free trade and fenury.Meadville Republican. Simon Wetz, Millersville, Pa., says: "Of all medicines I have ever taken none did me as much good as Brown's Iron Bitters." For good fresh Goods cheap go to LIaslet & Sox Feb. 1, '82. The exports of wheat and flour from t!ie Atlantic ports in the week ending November 22 were equal to 17,000,000 bushels of wheat against about 14,500, 000 in the preceding week. The pros pects aro favorable for an increasing foreign market for wheat in view of the material reduction in the area of the 1883 wheat cron in Endand. Pri- ces in this; country are advancing and the demand will very much increase business prospects generally iu the ce u n try. Jlarnsb urg Telegraph, If two-cent postage is to be a success in this country it will not he made so by introducing canned fruits, potted meats, dried prunes and other grocers' supplies into the mails. Next we ex pect to hear of bottled beer, Hoofland's Bitters and Winslow's Soothing Syrup going through at so much a pound. The mail system is primarily for the distribution of intelligence, and every step beyond ought to be taken caq tiously. Noth'ug but injury can nccrue to our postal service by introducing the business of express companies into it. If the Government chooses to or ganize a national system of expressago for small packages, that is a wholly different question, but that it should open its mails to the transportation from Portland Maine, to Portland, Oregon, at 16 cents a pound, of all sorts of provisions that can bo canned, is a prostitution of the service, and can only retard its progress. llarrisburg Telegraph.
