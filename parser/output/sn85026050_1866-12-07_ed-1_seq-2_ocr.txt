J. H. GREENE, ) Fremont, 0., Friday, Dec. 7, 1866. MEETING OF CONGRESS. V- The second session of the Thirty-Ninth Congress Assembled last Monday, and : an organization of both ' Houses was effected the same day. The Message of the President was delivered on Tuesday. The subject of regulating and . limiting the pardoning power as exercised by the Ex ecutive is about the only important topic yet discussed. AVe shall give each week a summary of the proceedings. THE 

MESSAGE. We print this week the annual message to Congress of the President of the Uni ted States. It is of moderate length, therefore every one will be likely to read it The document is tame and dreary, scarcely rising to common-place. It in dulges in no bravado, and has no salient . points. The greater portion is devoted to the reconstruction question, and is made up of diluted doses of "bit policy." It entirely ignores the verdict of the . people rendered with euch unanimity in the late elections, that guaranties for the future shall be given by the rebellious states be fore their political rehabilitation and insists upon their immediate and unqualified re ' storation. This is a touch of Rip Van . Winkleism in politics that is more amus ing than otherwise, in the light of the fact t'lat the eople have buried "my olicy beyond the hope of resurrection under the overwhelming weight of their votes ' The rest of the message consists of a not very lucid summa.j of the Mexican and Fenian questions, with incidental allu sions to our foreign relations, and a syn opsis of the reports of the Heads of De- ' partments. Take it altogether, and the message is a tame afterpiece to the roaring farce which the President performed while swinging around the circle." 

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR. The report of the Secretary of War Kuows that few volunteers now remain in the service, and they are being discharged . as rapidly as they can be replaced by reg ular troops. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained, and, from th9 disbanded volunteers stand ing ready to respond to the national call, large armies can be rapidly organized. equipped, andjeoncentrated. ' Fortifies- tions on the coast and frontier have receiv ed, or are being prepared for more powei . ful armaments; lake surveys and harlor aud river improvements are in . course of energetic prosecution. Preparations have been made for the payment of the add! tional bounties authorized during the re cent session of Congress, under such reg . ulations as will protect the Governiiieti from fraud, and secure to the- honorably discharged soldier the well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. " More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical . apparatus; and forty-one national ceme ' teries, containing the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, have already been estab lished. ' The total estimate of military appropriations is $25,105,609. REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GEN. The expenditures of this Department during the past year have exceeded the receipts $265,093, a very small deficiency, The mail service has been extended in the South rapidly, and will soon afford-the people there the' facilities enjoyed before the war. An arrangement has been made with the Post Oflice Department of Great Britain which contemplates a reduction of international letter postage to one-half the existing rates. On the 30th of Juno hist. there were in operation 6,930 mail routes, with an aggregate length of 180,921 mjles, and au aggregate annual cost of $8,410,' 184. The length of railroad routes is 32, 092 miles; steamboat routes 14,346 milesT REPORT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY. The naval force at this time consists of two hundred and seventy-eight vessels, armed with two thousand three hundred aud fifty-one guns. Of these, one hun dred and htteen vessels, carrying one thousand and twenty-nine guns, are commission, distributed chietly among seven sjnaJrous. The number of men in service is thirteen thousand six hundred. The expenditures of the department for the fiscal year ending 30th of June !last were $43,324,526, and the estimate for the coining year amount to $23,5G8,436. LIBERATED ROME. The Frenchtroops have been withdrawn from Rome, and are now on their home ward march. Victor Emanuel will estab lish the capital of the Kingdom of Italy at the Eternal City. The Pope is thus left without temporal power. . It may be that he will accept the offer of the Queen of Spain, and remove his headquarters to that country where further troubles will overtake him, as eveu there the sway of Catholic monarchy is rapidly drawing. to a close. LIBERATED ROME. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. Since the beneficent homestead law has been in operation, the revenue derived by the Government from the sale of publ lands has not amounted to much, com paratively. During the last fiscal year, 4, 629,312 acres have been disposed of of which 1,892,516 acres were entered under the homestead act. ARREST OF JOHN H. SURRAT. The cable telegrams announce the re- - arrest in Egypt of John 1L Surrat, one of the participators in the assassination tragedy. Sometime ago' he Was discover ed and arrested in the ranks of the Papal army in Rome, but escaped and fW to Ep-vot He will le forwarded to the . United States as soon as possible. The President's Message, or a summary of it, was telegraphed to Europe and pub- li-ihod in the Lon'don and Paris papers

The States themselves had been asked to take part in tne hiirh function of amending the Constitution. andof thus tauctioniug the extinction of Afri- can slavery is one C the legitimate results ol our intcmtcine ttruggie. ADMISSION OF CONGRESSMEN FROM THE REBEL. STATES. Having .i.roirresed thus far, , the Executive Denartineut found that it had accomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its con- stituiionai auiooruy. iuinK, "w, jn remained to be done oeiore ine worxoi rostpra- tion could be completed, and that was the ad- mission to Coneress of loval Senators and Rep. rexentatives from the otates wnose peopie Had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General Government. This questiendevolved upon the respective Houses, which, by the con stitution, are madet the judges of . tie election, returns, and .qualifications of their own mem bers; and its consideration at once engaged the attention of Congress. ' ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE. In the meant'me, the Executive Department no other plau having been proposed by Oon. prpKS continued its ett rts In perfect, as tar as nraclieihle, the rosier itinn of the proper re'a. tions between the c tizens of the respective S tatcf, and the r ederal Uovernmenl, t-xteud- ing, from time to time, as tbe public interest seeniefl to rcquiic, t. le ptu cisi, rKvenur, biiu pou.l systems of the couutry. With the advice and conseut of the Senate, the necessary officers were appointed, and appropriations made by Congress for the pay mcnt of I heir saieries. The propositions toainend tho Federal Constitution, so ax to nreveut the exutencc of slavery within the United Stales or any place subject to their jurisdiction, was ra'i'iod by tbe requisite num ber of States; nd on the liMi day of Decem ber. 1665. it wasoffc ally declared to lave be come valid as a part, of the Constitution of the United States.

Congress, however, vet hesitated to admit any of these mates torf presentation; and it was not until towards The close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was trade in fnvor of Tennessee, by the admisssion of her Senators and licpresenlauves.

It is true, it has been assumed that the exis tence of these States was terminated by the re bellious-acts of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection having been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be considered merely as con quered territories. Tbe Legislative, Executive and Judicial Departments of tbe Government have, however, with great distinctness and uni form consistency, refused tosanctiouan assump tion fo incompatible with the nature ot our re i i: ...' ...a .i. ...r,,j DUDlidiD Biricui .iiu i.ivu mn uiuicaou unirvw Ir .i Tionmriinniiimt lt.tJtinn Ul lire - . ..g...auu .f r.

At Uie very commencement of the rebellion, each house declared, with a unanimity as remarka ble as it was significant, that the war was not "waged, upon our part in any spirit of oppres sion, nor for any purpose of conquest or .subju gation, n r purpose ol overthrowing or inter fering with the rights of established institu tions ofihoH Slates, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, aud to preserve the r '.v. -n.i, a.. ;, ..oi; j Union with allthe dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects'.' we:e "accomplished the waroughttocca.se." Iu some instances, Sen ators, were periuitled to Contiuue their legisla tive functions, wnue in oilier instances nepre- aentative were elected and admitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, and were to maintain that right by force . ii .., o.... i i arms.

It is a question worthy of your consideration, wnemerour iawe upon this subject are adequate to the prevention or punishmeut of the crime thus meditated. MEXICAN AFFAIRS. In the month of April last, as Congress if aware, a friendly arrangement was mane be tween the Emperor of trarce anil tne i resi dent of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary mili tary forces. This withdrawal was to be effect ed in three detachments, the first of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico in Novem ber, now past, the second in March, next, and the third and last in November, 1867. Imme diately upon the completion of the evacuation, the French uovernment was to assume me ramc attitude of non-intervention, in regard to Mex ico, as is held by the Government of the. Uni ted States. Repeated assurances have been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he would complete tne prom is eutim tion within the time mentioned, or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the proceed ines tho contemplated would produce a crisif of great political interest in the Republic ol Mexico. J he newiy-appoiniea juimuier y, un united States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent forward, on the 9th day of November last, to assume his proper functions as Minister Pleni potentiary of the United States to that Repub lic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant General of the Army oi me United States, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the United Slates in TP- establishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the Republic ol Deenlv interested in the cause of lib- ertv and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part w eiereise wmwrn uiuucnm ..: possessed for the restoration and permanent es tablishment in that country of a domestic and rannhlican form of government. i' . . , i -. r nr .. : ouch was me conamon pi auans m itsnm w Mexico, when, on the 22.1 of November last, of ficial information was received from Paris that the Emperor of France had some time before dee ded not to withdraw a detachment of his fnrrps in the month of November past, accord inir tn entrapment, but that this decisiori was made with the purpose of withdrawing the whole of those iorces in ine ensuing .npnug. Of this determination, however, the United States had not received any notice or informa tion: and. so soon- as the information wa re ceived by the Government, care was taken to make known US dissent to tne x-mperor ui France. - T can m.l f.iriro the hone that France will re ?er the suhiect. and adopt some resolution in recant to the evacuation oi inex'co wnicn . . - ... , i will conform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and meet the just expec nf ih United States. The oarers re- latino to the suhiect will be laid before you. It is believed that, with tne evacuation ot mtxic" by the expeditionary forces, bo subject tor se rinns differences between Fmnre and the Uni ted States would remain. The expressions of the Emperor and people ot France warrant a hope that the trad tionary friendshipbetweeo tne IWO Countries migufc 1U i.uni,vex. uwi ,n. " ed and permanently restored. INTERNAL INDEMNITY. A claim of a citizen of the United Sta'es for indemnity for spoliations committted on the hiirh seas bv the French authorities, in the ex ercise of a belligerent power against Mexico, has been met by the Government ol franco witn a nrnnnaition to defer settlement until a mutual convention for the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects ol notn countries, ansinc outpf the r cent wars on the continent, shall be agreed upon by the two countries, lhe suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but it helnnirs to Conerets to direct the manner in 1 1 1 ' InJ.mnilD k.

THE ANGLO-REBEL PIRATES. It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made towards an adjustment of the difference between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of tbe depredations upon our national commerce and other tn spas ses committed during our civil war. by British snbieetH. in violation of international law and treat v oblieations. The delay, however, may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation ot Great Kntain. An entire change of ministry occurred in that ronntry during the last session of Parliament. The attention oi the new ministry was caiiea to the subject at an early day, and there is some r ... , . l i i i i reason to expect mat it win now ue cunsiuerea in a becoming and friendly spirit. The impor tance of an early disposition of the question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever might be the wishes of the two Governments, it is mani fest that good-will and friendship between the two countries cannot be estaoiisnea until a re. ciprocity, in the practice of good faith and neu triality should be restored between the repec THE FENIANS. of On the 6th of June last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military expedition and en terprise arrainst the British North Ameaican Colonies was projected and attempted to be carried on within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, in obedience to tbe obli ration imposed upon the Executive by the Con stitution, to see that the laws are faithfully exe cuted, all citizens were warned, by proclama tion, against taking part in or aiding such on lawful nroceedines, and the proper civil, mili tarv and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement the laws. The expedition failed, but it has not been without its ramful consequences, Some nf nnr citizens who. it was alleged, were enga. ged in the expeditim, were captured, and have been brougnt to iri8l,a turn capi'tu uui-uie, m the Province of Uanada. Judgment an sentence of death have been pronounced against some, whileotherg have been acquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of government, tba severitv of civil punishment for misguided per sons who have engaged in revolutionary at. temnts which have disastrously failed, is un seuud and unwise, such representations hav heen made to tbe British Government, in lie. half of the convicted persons, as, being sustained bv an enliehtened and humane judgement, will, it is honed, induce in their cases an exercise c.leinencv and a judicious amnesty to all wh were engaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the .Government to defend citizens of the United States on trial for capital offences in Canada, and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted in the courts of the United Statest against those who took part in tbe expedition, has been directed. T have regarded the expedition as not only political in its nature, but as also in a great measure foreign from the United States in its causes, character, and objects. The attempt was understood to be made in sympathy witn an insurgent paity in Ireland, and, by striking a Rritish Province on this Continent, w designated to aid in obtaining redress for poli ical jrrievances which, it was assnmcd, the peo. pie of Ireland had suffered at the hands of the British Government during a period of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were ehieflv natives of that country, some of whom had. while others had not, become citizens thn United States untler our general laws naturalization. , Complaints of misgovernment Ireland continually engage the attention tho British nation, and so great an agitation nnw nrevailiner in Ireland that the British Gov ernmc.nt have deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeat corpus in that country. These circumstances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have enter tained in regard to an expedition expressly pro. hihiied bv our neutrality laws. So long ai tbose remain upon our statute hooks, they should be faithfully executed, and if they oper ate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively, Uon greFS alone can apply the remedy, by thei modification or repeal. RIGHTS OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS. in of 1 to by The Government has claimed for all persons not convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation and a choice of new national allegiance. Mo of the European States have dissented from th principle, and have claimed a right to hold such ot their suojecis as uav lumiigmicu io anc been natnralized in the Uni'ed States, andaf'er wards returned on transient visits to their na. tive countries, to the performances of military service in like manner as resilient subjects. Comnlaints arising from the claim in this re spect made by foreign States, ha ve heretofore . .. e . l.i . i. TV - been matters ot cuniriTojr iiwtn ine uni ted States and some of the European Powers, and the irritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question increased during the war in which Prusia, Italy aud Austria were re cently engaged. While great Britain has never acknowledged the right of expatriation, she has not practically - insisted upon it, France has been equally forbcarine; ami Prussia has pro posed a compromise, which, althongh evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to be a favorable time for an assertion by Con press of the principle, so long maintained by thc Executive Department, that naturalization by one State fully exempts the native-horn subject of any other Slate from the performance of ruil litary service tinder any foreign government, long as he does not voluntarily renounce rights and benefits.
