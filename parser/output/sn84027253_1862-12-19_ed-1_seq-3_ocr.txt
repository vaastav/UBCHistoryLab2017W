We understand that only fifteen were rejected. This is a good showing for a regi ment composed exclusively of men over forty -five years of age. jgrWe learn that the Branch of the State Bank, at this place, have reduced the rate of discount from 10 to 8 per cent per annum.— Our citizens will thereby enjoy better facili ties than the bankers of Chicago afford their customers—the lowest rate there for first "l*" paper being 10 per cent. The Tax-Law and tiie Farmers.—FANNERS will be interested in knowing that they are liable to pay a tax of 30 cents per head for all the beef cattle they slaughter for sale, and tax of 5 cents per head on sheep, and 10 cents a head on ho^s the}' slaughter for sale, provided the number of sheep or hogs exceeds twenty head. Camp Strong Deserted.—Our camp now present5 the appearance of having been evac uated, a great majority of the members of the 37th having been permitted to visit their families. For the past day or two, every train leaving the city has been filled with these patriotic men. They will return after the holidays, refreshed and improved by the short respite from military duty, and with pleasant memories of the happy days spent by them during the interval, with loved ones at home. ygyTho following decisions by the Com missioner of Internal Revenue, in relation to slaughter houses, will be of interest to per sons engaged in the business 1. Any person or firm buying a place where the business of slaughtering cattle is carried on, must be held responsible for the returns required by section 7& and 79 of the excise law. 2. If at such places parties are permitted to slaughter animals named in the said sections, by such permission they become the agents or employees of the owner for that particular purpose but the principle is alone responsi ble for duties levied upon animals so slaugh tered Christmas is coming. So is New Years. So is St. Valentine's day. So is the end of the war.— Courier. Yes, all these days are sure to arrive. The end of the war, however, will not come until a few of the snapping, snarling, ungrateful curs who have been fed at the public expense nearly all their lives, and who have come to look upon themselves a public necessities, (of which fact, however, the public are not ap prised,) are placed in as convenient spot," where their howlings can no longer be heard. Of course we do not refer to the editor of the Courier, as he has proven his loyalty in many instances besides, he would not accept of an office if one was offered him. Bloody Encounter.—A correspondent from Cairo, signing himself K. A. G.," closes an interesting letter as follows, showing how the 35th Iowa spilled blood first: ",The quarters of our regiment are not as good as the ones we left at Camp Strong but they are comfortable. They seemed to be in possession of a battalion of rats, on our arriv al, and what is still worse, they seem deter mined to keep possession of them, and will evacuate on no terms whatever. We are in the habit of sleeping with our bayonets by our sides, to resist the attack generally made upon us about midnight, when we are having bright dreams of home—of friends we leave behind but we are soon brought from the Tjright dream land by a squad of rats running over our faces, eager to steal the soldier's last cracker. Then begins the deadly conflict. Our bayonets are seized—a charge made upon them—and such dying squeals is a warning to all honest house rats! Thus you see how the bloody 35th are -engaged. Such daring deeds—such valor— displayed, can hardly be equalled in the an nals of history." We hope to hear from K. A. G." often. He wields a ready pen, and will always give us the humorous side of camp life. His let ter, from which the above is an extract, would have been published in full had not our col umns been crowded this morning. pr Decisions on the Revenue Laws are getting "plenty and demand light." We quote some of the latest, for the benefit of whom it may concern: Licensed bankers, as well as incorporated banks, may draw and sell their own drafts on their surplus funds accumulated in the ordi nary course of business, in other places, with out a broker's license, as their selling of such drafts is not dealing in the exchange relating to money within the meaning of the law, sub ject to the qualification that incorporated banks and licensed banks must have the licenses of brokers if they do the business of a broker, as described in the law. Publishers of printed books, magazines, pamphlets, newspapers, reviews, and all other similar publications, are liable to assessment as dealers. If the sales of a publisher are to those who buy to sell again, or if this part of hi'a business is considerable, so that he pro cures stock and arranges his business with ffAyeace to such sales, he should be classed a wholesale dealer, even though a portion of his Miles is to those who buy for their own uae.

Being presont at Oauip Strong, near your city, on the 11th inst., I had the pleasure of witnessing the presentation of a beautiful sword and sash to Geo. W. Kincaid, Colonel of the 37th Regiment Iowa Volunteers— known as the Gray-Heard regiment. The sword was presented by Capt. E. A. M. Swasey, of Company C, on behalf of the offi cers of the regiment, in an appropriate speech. The Captain, turning to the Colonel, said: Sir 1 am entrusted with this sword —with us an emblem of power to be pre scnted to you, in behalf of the line officers of the 37th regiment, which you have the honor to command. It is a free-will offering, for the many acts of kindness you have rendered to them and the venerable and patriotic men under their command. We entrust it to you, sir, to be used in the defense of our National rights, and against all enemies to our glorious Union, let them rise from whatever source they may. We have implicit confidence in your courage and ability, and that in your hands it will never be disgraced or surren dered. And when, amid the din of battle and conflict of war, we behold this beautiful sword raised above the enveloping smoke, we shall know that our commander is there, guiding us in the path of duty—to victory or death! In conclusion, sir, please accept this beau tiful sword, as a token of respect and, when its mission shall have been accomplished, re turn it to its scabbard, and keep it as a s icrcd relic in your family, to commemorate this eventful day, and the esteem of the Gray Beard regiment." The Colonel responded, in substance as follows Fellow-Soldiers: If I had been born an orator, and had practiced speaking all my life, I should feel myself utterly unable to make a speech on this occasion. The kindness and consideration manifested under the cir cumstances completely overwhelm me. I have often, through the course of my life, been the recipient of honors, conferred on tne by my fellow-citizens, all of which I consider as nothing when compared to the honor conferred on me by the Governor, about three months since, when he author ized inc to raise this regiment. Yes, fellow soldiers, the Governor not only gave me a commission to raise the regiment, but he gave me the extraordinary authority to appoint its officers. And now, my fellow soldiers, I am proud to say, that, with the assistance of those officers whom you elected, I have made a selection, whom, I believe, after some eight weeks intercourse with them, are not excelled by any. And I will further say, that, the whole regiment is composed of material which, in my opinion, is superior to any that has here tofore been raised in the State and when I say that, I say a great deal for Iowa soldiers stand second to none in the world. Fellow-soldiers, while our respected Captain was speaking, I felt so overwhelmed with the extraordinary kindness conferred that I could say nothing but thank you but I feel now as though I ought to say a little more.— it has been said that a barking dog never bites." Therefore, I shall not say what I will do with this beautiful sword, but I shall tell you what I will not do I will never yield nor give it up while there is strength in this arm to retain it. And, further, I will say, that no officer shall be asked to go further than where he can see this sword in advance —I shall require no officer to advance so far that he will have to look back over his shoulders to see it. "And now I will say the word, though it may seem weak. It does not seem to convey the full power of my feelings: Brother officers, I thank you The sash, which was the gift of the Ser geants of the regiment, was presented by Sergeant John Bostater, of Company F, in a few appropriate remarks, which were warmly responded to by the Colonel. Permit me to say, in conclusion, that I have had the opportunity, during the last twelve months, of witnessing the evolutions of many regiments, both of this and other States, and I am compelled to give the meed of praise to this. The men have certainly attained com mendable proficiency in the elementary tactics of military science, and under the supervision of their excellent drill-master (Capt. Palmer), they will not be surpassed by any regiment that has gone from the States. A Spectator. [Tor th* Journal.] U. §. Commissioners lor Iowa. Editor Journal :—I presume you will be willing to publish the followingiiotice, for the benefit of the public: notice. The public is hereby informed that the fol lowing persons have been appointed, by the Circuit Court, to be United States Commis sioners for the State of Iowa—viz: J. L. Harvey, Esq., of Dubuque J. N. Rogers, Esq., of Davenport H. B. Ten Eyck, Esq., of Keokuk C. W. Slagle, Esq., of Fairfield *, Steph. Sibley, Esq., of Desmoines D. C. Bloomer, Esq., of Council Bluffs^ I W. G. Woodward, of Muscatine. W. G. Woodward, v: Clerk of Circuit Ct. U. S. The Democratic Melting? Mood. The worthy gentleman who remained im perturbable while the whole congregation were melted to tears,and who, when inquired of concerning his invidious retention, replied that he belonged to another parish, was a striking type of our Democratic cotempora ries in the country's affliction. In all the slaughter of Northern soldiers, and in the systematic murder of loyal men in the South, thev remained as calm as if they belonged to another parish. It is only when rebels are hurt, as in tha case of the shooting of bush whackers by Gen. McNeil, that their sympa thies are touched. One would suppose by their grief over this affair that this was the first shedding of blood in this war. A reader of Democratic journals will look in vain in them for any sympathy or indignation for the slaughter of Northern s ldiers, or the murder of Southern loyal men. This is because they regard themselves as belonging to another parish. The following instance, related in the report of Lieut.-Col. Thompson of the 5th Cavalry, Missouri State militia, dated Harrisonville, Nov. 25, 1862, shows the kind of treatment which has been regularly practiced by the rebels towards the Missouri militia, whom they bare refused to treat as prisoners of war: "Another of Col. Catherwood's men, at the burning of the train, was brought up from near the Osage this evening. He was one ef the prisoners who failed to make their escape. All three of them were taken out together to be sbot. The other two wero killed dead, but this man was shot through the mouth and neck, and both eyes shot out, the ball passing through one eye, through the bridge of the nose, and into the other eye. He was left for dead, and afterward picked up by a farmer. He is a horrid spectacle to behold." We do not expect that instances of this kind will touch the feelings of Democratic journals, nor will even reach their oolumns. They belong to another parish. But when bushwhackers suffer a slight retaliation, they howl like professional weepers at an oriental funeral and they are ready to back tha inso lence of Jeff Davis, who, after hundreds of the Missouri prisoners have been shot in cold blood by his men, demands the delivery of Gen. McNiel, for his comparatively mi nute retaliation on men who, on the rule practised by the rebels, deserved death as guerrillas, and whose case was aggravated by their bushwhacking after thev had been released on parol.—Cincinnati Gazette.

NUMBER VIII. Holly Springs,Miss., Dec. 10,1862. Last Friday morning, Dec. 5th, opened as wintry in appearance as any Northern man seeking a warmer climate in the "sunny South" need care to see, and, as is usual in such cases with regard to everything con nected with military matters, it brought an order for our department to move forthwith to La Grange,Tennessee so we packed our traps aboard the cars in the storm and bade adieu to Corinth. Notwithstanding the fact that the Memphis and Charleston railroad runs direct from one point to the other, we were compelled to run North to Jackson and there take the Mississippi Central ioad, via Bolivar and Grand Junction, on account of the bridges having been destroyed on the first mentioned road by the rebels, which made the distance to be traveled between the two places more than double what it would have been could we have taken the direct route. Every little Wayside station had its piles of cotton bales ready for shipment. At Jack son and Bolivar the quantity seemed to be very great, but of course I had no means of knowing how it compares with the shipments of former seasons, when there was no war We halted for a few minutes at Medow station, where about forty of Captain Ben. Beach's company killed a number of gueril las, last summer, nearly equal to their entire force, and kept them at bay until reinforce ments arrived. I think I hazard nothing in asserting that if the gallant Ben. and his company had been stationed at Henderson, at the time of the raid on that place, men tioned in my last letter, the rebels would have found the capture of the garrison and destruc tion of the cotton far more difficult to accom plish. Upon our arrival at La Grange, about dusk in the evening, we learned that our destination had been changed and that we were to pro ceed to this place. As there would be no tram until next day, we would have to remain over night there. Accordingly our company, about sixty in number, took possession of a hotel building, which had been evacuated by its former proprietor, bearing the somewhat high sounding name of the Gait House. Wrapped in our blankets we rested well on the floor, being the first night your corres pondent had passed under a house roof in two months. Saturday morning we boarded the same train and returned to Grand Junction, where ire had the pleasure (1) of walking and stand ii (o move, uiit cloven o'clock at night, almost rationless, owing to some oversight or mis management of the dolt whom misfortune had placed temporarily at the head of affairs with us. Our long and tedious delay, however, like all things pertaining to this mundane sphere, hail an end, and at three o'clock on Sunday morning we were landed at the depot of this beautiful little city. But more of this anon. We are without news, known to be reliable from the fronf, but have understood that the rjbil army is bearing olf towards Columbus, while Grant is in their rear and Sherman has possession of Grenada. E. THE NEW-YORK TRIBUNE. 1863. The Nbw Yobk Tribune, fir«Mssued 1841, now in its twenty-second ytnr, has ob tained ii larger and more widely diffused cir culation than any other newspaper ever pub lished in America. Though it has suffered, in common with other journals, from the vol unteering and departure of tens of thousands of its patrons to serve in the War for the Union, its circulation on this 6th December, 1862, is as follows: Daily 50,125 Semi- Weekly 17,250 Weekly 148,000 Aggregate 215,375 Preeminently a journal of News and Lite rature, Tiie Tbibusii: his political convictions, which are well characterized by the single word Republican. It is Republican in its hearly adhesion to the great truth thatJ"God has made of one blood all nations of men"— Republican in its assertion of the equal and inalienable rights of a'l men to "lifd, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"—Republican in its steadfast, earnest, defiant hostility (o every scheme and effort of the Slave Power, from the Annexation of Texas to the great Rebellion, to grasp the empire of the New World and wield the resources of cur country for its own aggrandizement—Republican in its antagon ism to the aristocrats and despots of the Old World, who fondly hail in the perils and ca lamities suddenly thrust upon us by their American counterpart the overthrow and ruin of the Model Republic—Republican in its hope and its trust, its I'aith and effort, that this atrocious Reb llion must result in the signal overthrow of its plotters, and the firm establishment of equal rights and equal laws throughout the whole extent of our cou: try, wherein Liberty and Union shall indeed be "one and inseparable" henceforth and for ever. The Tribune devotes attention in calmer times, mid to some extent in these, to Educa tion, Temperance, Agriculture, inventions, and whatever else may minister to the spir itual a'ld material progress and well being of mankind but for the present its energies and its columns are .nainly devoted to the invigo ration and success of thu War for the Union. I s sp cial correspondents accompany every considerable army and report every impor tant incident of that great struggle which we trust is soon to result in the signal and con clusive triumph of the National arms and in the restoration of Peace and Thrift to our dis tracted, bleeding country. We believe that no otherwise can a fuller or more accurate view of the progress and character of this mo mentous conflict I obtained than through the regular perusal of our columns. And we earnestly solicit the co-opcration of all friends of the National cause, which we regard and uphold as that of Universal humanity, to aid us in extending its circulation.

Departed this life, on the 22.1 day of November, 1362, at the General Hospital, Annapolis, Md fcer*£ant* Msjor Lyman (J. Loomh, of tlio Second Iowa Cavalry— aged 25 years, 9 months and 22 days. Mr. Looinls was a native of Connecticut'—born in Winsted, Litchfield county. He removed, with his mother and sister, a few years since, to Muscatine oonuty, Iowa, ttbero he was living at the time ho heard and answerod his country's call to aid in the suppres sion of the southern rebellion. He enlisted Sopt. 14th, 1801. The following May he was taken ptUonor, near Boonoville, Miss,, from whioli place lie was conveyed to Mobile, Ala., whoro ho was confined one month in pris on. Ho was then taken to Macon, Ga where he was placed for nearly four months in close confinement.— Here he was sick six weeks* He was then taken to Riohmondt and paroled. He arrived at Anuapolis, Md., Oct. 19th, and was carried Into the General Hospital at that place, where, in a few woeks, he died. He was the only son of hia mother, upon whose de» oliuing years his death has catt a shadow. He was an affectionate son and brother, {in both of which relations he was a support and comfort. And not only In the little home circla will he bo missed, bnt his loss will be sadly felt by distant friends and relatives, as well as by all who knew him lu his own neighborhood—where be was much beloved, Mr. Loomis was a Christian. During the great re ligious awakening so generul throughout thts country a few years since, he was brought to a knowledge of the truth as It Is in Jesuu, when he made a public pro fession of his faith. Theie being no Church in the neighborhood at that time, he, with others, mostly sub* jects of the late revivals, were orgauized by the Pres* bytory of Cedar into a Church called the Cedar Val ley Church," and by a unanimous vote of the mem* hers he was ehosen to be one of Its ruling eldurs. IIU death will be a loss to this little Church. Thus did he serve Loth the Ohureh and his eonntry—laying down hi* life for the latter* L'o was at his post In the faith ful discharge of his duty when his Heavenly Master called him. There wa* one circumstance that Hdded poignancy to the affliction caused by his death. He had been ex pected home—appeared to be fast recovering—and it was thought that in a day or two ho could saiely travel on his Journey homeward. His mother and sister were anxiously expocting him by every train. Thanksgiv iog day, shortly after the train arrived, a kuock was heard at the door it was almost cenUdently believed ho had come but it proved to be one bringing letters containing the tidings of his death. The bittemesv of tho disappointment muy be better imagined than des cribed. Though he had apparently been itnproviug in health while at the hospital, he wad seized with a sud den relapse, and in a few hours his spirit took its de parture for another aud, we trust, a better world another victim of this deplorable war. With a vigorous constitution, enjoying uninterrupted health up to the time of his imprisonment, h?s pros pect of long life was most Mattering,—a life of nsefnl ness, both as a citizen and as a member and office bearer in the Church of his Savior, whom he loved.— But lie, who appoints the boundaries of our habitation and does all things well, though clonds and darkness are 'round about His purposes, has seen fit to remove him, as we believe, to the joys of His presence, as well as to a hisrher sphere of usefulness in this great mora' ompire—and to His will wo reverondly bow.

A steady stream of gas is emitted from the top of tbe perforated cone about two iocbes in length, which will bear as much wind and agitation as the street gas and far more than any other light ever before attached to A A N A The ligt'.t is of the same briHIarcy as that of tbe or dinary coal gas and emits no more odor or smoke when lighted. It is well known that heretofore, to produce without a chimney any considerable light from these oils has baffled the inventive genius of the age. This burner can be at once regulated for a night lamp or *ick cham ber, so as to burn twelve hours and net consume Haifa Tablespoon* ul of Oil. Theae, then, are its characteristics: 1—It gives three times the light of any other wick lamp. 2—It will bear carrying around the house, up stairs and down, in the most rapid manner. 8—There are no chimneys broken, as none are used. 4—It is all right, and no family will long be without one, For sale at wholesale and retail by OILLAWAY & BRO Nor Zt» lM2-diwtf Weed's Block.
