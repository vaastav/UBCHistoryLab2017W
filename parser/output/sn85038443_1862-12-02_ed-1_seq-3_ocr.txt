ITS 9 0 uu STAR AND CHRONICLE. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow ctiuen of the Senate and Houm of Rfpraen- Utitvrs : Siuce your last annual assembling another year of health aud houutd ul harvest has passed. And while it had not pleased itjo Almighty to bices us witti a rctut a ot peace, we can but press on, guided by the best li&ht lie gives us, trust ing that iu liis own good time, and wire way all Will Vet Well. ihe coiicripondcnce touching foreign aifaiis wliii.li has taken place during tbe last year is herewith submitted, iu virtual compliance with a request tu that effect, made by tbe House ot Uepftwcntttives near the close ot the last ses sion ol Congress. ll the condition of our relations with other nations kt lf Kratifviug than it baa usual 1 been ai former periods, it is certaiuly more satisfactory thau a uatiouso uu happily detract edw wo are, might reasonably have appro heuded lu tbe month ot June last ibt-re were some grounds to expect that the maritime pow ers which, at the org inning ot our domestic dilhcuiuee, o unwisely and unnecessarily, an we think, recognised the insurgents ait a bellig erent, would soou recede froiu tbat positiuu, wutcb now proved only lent injurious to thein selv m tliau to oui own country. But tbe tem po ary reverses wliiih alter wards befell tbe national arms, and which wele exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delate 1 that act of simple justice '1 he civil war, which baa setadii ally changed, fr to- uiouieut, the occupations and habit ul the American people ba necessarily disturbed the social cou utiou, aud Mflccted very deeply th prosperity ol the nations with which w have carried uu a conmieice that baa been steadily increasing throughout a period of hall a century, it has, at the satue time, excited political atubittoijs aud apprehensions which hav produced a proiound agitatiou throughout tbe civilized world, lu this unusual agitation we have tur borne tioiu taking pait in any con troversy bet we. u lou iu stales, aud between parties or lacuous iu such slates. We have at tempted no ptopagandisiu, aud acknowledged no revolution, but we have left to everv na tion tne exclusive conduct aud management of its own allairs Our struggle ha been, of couiie, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits, than to lis sup posed, aud otteu exaggerated effects and couse- queuces resulting to those nations themselves. ever Unless, complaint on the part of this government, even it it were just, would cer tainly be uuwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the sup precision ot ike slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion ot Hpecial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it, on the rt of her Majesty's government baa been maiKi a wun a leaious respect ior uie aumoruy of the United States, aud the rights ol tueu moral aud loal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the aboli tion of tbe state dues has been carried into full effect, under the act of Congress for that pur pose. A blockade of three thousand mites of sea coast could not be established, aud vigorously euiorced, iu a season of great commercial ac tivity, like tbe presi-nt, without committing occasional mistakes, and lb Dieting uuuten tional injuries Uuu foreign nations aud their subjects. A civil war occur ting in a country where foreigners rehide anl carry on trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complainui of the Violation of neutral rights. Ad such collisions tend to excite miiiapprehen siou, and pubstbly to produce mutual reclama tions between nations which hare a common inteiet in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cabcs of thse kinds 1 have, so tar at pokoitde, heard aud r. dressed couipUiuls which nave been presented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a Urge and augmenting num ber ol doubt iui cases upon which the govern ment is unable to agree With the gu venue ut whotte protection ir di-rnauded by the claimants. There uv, moreover, maoycases in which the Lulled niaUb, or their citizens, sutler wrongs from the naval ot military authorities of for eign nation, whieh the governments of those siau-s are not at ouce prt pared to redress. 1 have piopused to some of the foreign states, inteiesUxl, mutual conventions to examine and adjust such compUints. ibis proposition hak been matleeKpeciadytoGieut Britain, to France, to .Sjmuu, uLd to fiubbia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been tor mady adopted I deem it my dutj to recoommend an a(pro-r prim i on in l Lilt ot the owners ol the Noi we gtau bark A.liuual P. lordeubkiold, which ves sel was, iu My, Ihtil, prevented by the com mauder of the blockading force otit Cbarhston trom Jeaiiu that port with cargo, notwith standiug t himi'ar oiivilege had, before, been ffrantrd to au fnghnh vemel. 1 have directed the Secretry ol Mate to cause the paM-rs in the case to be commuuicoted to the proper committees. Applications have been made to me by many free Ameiicuis of Atrican descent to lavor their emigtatiuD, with a view to such colowixatiitu as wan ouutr in plated in rncent mtM ot Congress. Other parlies at home at d abroad - some from iiitcrtfcted motives, others upon patriotic con siderations, and still others liihiicuced by pull anthropic sentimeuts have suggested siniil r measures, while, on the other hand, several of uus bpautKh Amernao republics have protested agt imt the sending of Mi h colonies to their "-pwtive temtorries. I 'nd- r these cutum stanos, I have declined to move any such colony iu any state, without fit obtaining the cuuNeniot it goveri.ment, with an agreement h its part to receive aud protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen ; and I have at the same time, ottered to the several states wiuauxi within the tropics, or having colonies theie, to negotiate with tiiem subject to the dvice and cuum of the Senate, to favor the voluntary wnigrath ot persons of that class to 2Pfc,?lUw lmit" i.

I believe, however opinion among them, in this respect, is im proving; and that, ere long, there dl be an JKmmed, and considerable migration to both tEJ Dtmutnc8' Uom be United but, iu new conimctcial treaty between the Ty9, r' r.

A commercial aod coiisolur treaty has been nvotiatd, snbject'to the Senate's consent, with Liberia ; and a similar negotiation is now nl ing with tne republic ol uayti. A coiwtderilil iuipmvemeut of the national oommerce is ex pected to result from thiwe measures. Our relations with Great Uritaiu, Frain-e, Sp.dn, Fortutral, KiiHriia, l'nibHia, IVnumik isweden, Austria, the Netberlaudo, Italy, borne, xiid the other Kuropean States, remaiu undid t orbed. Very favorable relations alno continue to be maintained witb Tarkey, Morocco, Chiua, aud Jaiian. During tbe last yAr there bas imt only I en no change of our previous relations with the independent hlatee ot our own continent, but, more friendly sentiments than have beret- ton existed, are tteheved to be entertained by thiMV ueigbbors, whOM satety aud progress are s intimately connected with our owu. I his state ment especially applies to Uexico, Nicatitgtia, Cota tiica, Honduras, rem aud Ohill. The commission under the onuvt-ntioii witli the republic of New Greuatia closed its sessiou, without having audited and pjsned upou. alt the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the conven tion, that it may tie able to do more complete justice. Tbe joint coin mission between the United States and tbe republic of Cobta liica bas completed its labors aud submitted its re- prot. X have favored the protect tor connecting the Lmted States with burope by an Atlantic tele graph, aud a similar project to extend the tele graph to San rrancisco, to connect by a l acilu telegraph with the line which is being extended across the liussian empire. lh 1 err i tones ot the Lmited States, witli unimportant exceptions, have reniained undid turbed by the civil war; aud they are exhibit ing such evidence ol prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organised as Mates, aud be Constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union. The Immense miueral resources of some of; these Territories ought to be developed as rap idly as possible. Every step iu that direction would have a tendency to improve the rcveuue ot the government, and diminish the butdeun of the people. It is worthy of your 6erious consideration whether someextraoidinary niea sures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective, Is a scientific exploration ot the mineral regions iu thoie Territories, with a view to the publication of its results at hom and in foreign countries results which cannot iaii to be ausnicious. The condition of the finances will claim your most diluent consideration, ihe vast exteu ditures incident to the military and naval op erations required for the suppression of the rebellion, have thitherto been met with a promptitude, aud certainty, unusual in similar circumstances : and the nublio credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, aud the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field, demand your best reflections as to the best modes ot providing the necebsary rev enue, without injury to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor. the suspension ot specie payments vf the banks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large usus of Lmted Stato- notes unavoidable, iu no other way could the payment ot the troops, and the satisfaction ot other just demands, be so economically, or so well provided for. the judicious legibUtion of Congress, Securing the recti vabuity of these notes for loans and internal duties, and nutkiag them a legal teuder for other debts, has made them universal currency ; and has satinutd, partially, at least, and for the time, the long felt want ot an uniform circulating medium. saving thereby to the people, uumeuse sums in discounts aud exchange. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned, should ever lm kept In view, fluctuations in the value ol curreucv are always injurious, and to reduce these fluc tuations to the lowest possible point will alwa be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Con vertibflty, prompt and certain convertibility lutocom, is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard againnt them ; aud ii is extremely doubtful whether a circulation ol Lmted stales notes, pavable in coin, and sum ciently large for the wants of the jMjopk, can be permanently, usefully and safely main tained. is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wauts can tw in ade, aud the great advantages of a safe and uniloTui curreucy s- cured r 1 know ot none which promises o certain results, and is at the same time, so unobiectiou able, as the organization of banking associa tions, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations the government might furnish circulating notes. on the securiry of United states bonds detooi ted in Lhc treasury, these notes, prepared uu der the supervision of proper otuceis, being uniform in appearance and .security, aud con vertible always into coin, would at ouce pro tect labor against the evils ol a vicious curren cy, aud facilitate commerce by cheap and sale exchanges. . A moderate reservation from the interest on the bunds would compensate the t'uitod htates for tbe preparation and distribution of ihe notes, and a general Bupervumu ot the HVKteux aud would lighten the burden of that part ot the public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover, would be gTeatly un proved, and the negotiation of new loans great ly facilitated by the steady market demand lor government bonds which the adopliou of the proposea system wouiu create. it is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight in my judg ment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible ail existing interests, by the opportunity offered to existing Institutions to reorganise under the act, substituting only the secured uniform na tional circulation, for the local and various cir culation, secured snd unsecured, now issued by them.

I purp ise having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject. The military rind commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan canal, and improving the Illinois river, i presented iu the report of Col ouel Webster to the Secretary of War, ami now transmitted to (mgrtss 1 respectively ask attention to it. To carry out the provisions of the act of Con gress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the Uuited states U I) organized. 'Hie tVmmissinner informs me that within the eriod of a ft w mouths this department has established au extensive system ol correspond elit e and exchanges, both at home aud abroad. which promises to eitect highly beuetictal r results in the development of a con eel knowl- cdr of receut improve uientb in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics o. the several States. Also that it will soon be prepared to distri bute target seeds, cereals, plauts aud cuttings. and has already established, and libcally dif fused, mtkh valuable information in antieitia- tion of a more elaborated report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valua ble tints iu chemical science now in progress iu the laboratory. Tbe creation of this dot artment was for the more immediate Ik-neb t of a large class of our most valuable citizens ; and I trust tbat tu liU-ral ttasis ii(tou which it has been organized will uot only meet your approbation, but that it will realiiM.at no distaut day, all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, and hecniue the fruitful source ot advantage to all our people. On ihe twenty second day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In acconlunce with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph ot that paper, 1 now re rtjtcctlully recall your attention to what may be called " compensaU-d emancipation." A nation may be said tucomt st of it territory. its people, and lis laws. Tbe t- riitory is the only part which is ot certain durability. "One generation passeth away, and auuther genera tioncometh, but the earth abideth forever." It is of the first importance to daily consider, and estimate, this ever enduring part. 1 bat portion ol the earth's surface which is owned and in habited by the people of the United States, i well adapted to be the home of one national family ; aud it is not well adapted for two, or mure. Its vast extent, aud its variety ot cli mate and productions, are of advantage, in this age, for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence, nave urougnt uiese, to be an ad vantaaeous oombiDaUuti for oo united people In the mauicural address 1 briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy tor tne differences ol tne people ot the two sections. 1 did so in langutge which 1 cannot impruve, and which therefore 1 beg to repeat : "One section of our couutry believes slavery is runt, aud ought to be extended, while tbi other believes it to be wrong, mnd ougbt not to extended. I his is the only substantial dispute, ihe fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, aud the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where ihe moral sense of the people imperfectly supporut the law itself. The great body of the letple abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over iu ech. Ibis, 1 think, canuot be perfectly cured ; and it would be worse in both cases, after the rtt-paiatiou of the sections, thau before. The foreign slave trade, now imperii ctly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction iu oue section ; while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. "I'hysicalty speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot leinove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall be tween them. A husband and wife may be di vorced, aud go out of the presence and beyond the reac h of each other; but the different pans ot our country canuot do this. They cannot but remaiu face to face; and intercourse, either ami cable or hostile, must continue between them, fs it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous, or more satisfactory, after separation thau before t Can aliens make trea ties, easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens, tnou laws can auioug friends t Suppose yon go to war, you cannot tight always, and when, alter much loss ou both sides, and no gain ou either, you cease tightiug, the identical old question, as to leims of intercourse, are agaiu upou you." i here is no line straight or crooked, suitable for a national bouudary, upou which to divide. 1 race through, from east to west, upon the Hue between the free aud sUve country, aud we shill hud a little more than one third of its length are rivc-rs, easy to be crossed, and popu lated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides ; while neatly all its remaining length, are merely surveyor's lines, over which people may walk back aud forth without any cousciousneps ot their presence. No part of this hue can b-i made any.moredifficult to pass, by writing it down on paper, or parchment, as a national boundary, ihe fact of separation, if it comes, givts up, on the part of the st ce iling sectitsa, the fugitive slave clause, aloug witu all other constitutional obUgatious upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stimulation would ever be made to take its place. liut there is another dithculty . The great in terior legion, bounded east by the Alleghauies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky moan tains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, aud which includes part of Virginia, part of leunessee, an ot neuiucay, unio, luuiaaa, Michigan, Wisconsin. Illinois, Missouri, Kan sas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota. Nebraska, and part of Colorado, al ready has above ten millious of people, and will have titty millions witbtu hity years, u uot prevented by any political folly or mistake. It coutaius more than one-third of the country owned by the United States certainly more thau one million of square miles. One-half as populous as Massachusetts alteady Is, It would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speakiug, it is the great body of ihe republic, ihe other Prts are but marginal bottlers to it. the maguiuceut region sloping west from the ttocky mountains to the Pacific, beiug tbe .lee pest, as also tbe ncbest, lo undeveloped resource. lu the production of provisions, grains. grasses, and all which proceed from them, this aod this yield hetmr eropw M wfw great interior regiou Is naturally one of tbe most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion ot the regiou which has, as yet, been brought iuto cultiva tion, aud also the large and rapidly incrcaniug amouut ot us products, aud we ahali be over whelmed with the magnitude ot the prospect preseuted. And yet this region ha uo sea coast, toUib.es no ocean any where. As put ot one natlou, its people uow find, aud may tor ever hod their way to Europe by Mew Vork, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, aud to Asia by Sau Francisco. But separate our couiiuou country into two nations, as de- sigaed by the present rxbeUiun, aua every mau ol this gieat interior regiou is thereby cut eft trom some one oi uioie ol these outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embar lusoinK and ouerous trade regulations. Anil this is tiue, u fur ever a dividing, or bouudary line, may be fixed, f lace it between tne uow tree aud slave couutiy, or place it south ol Kentucky, or north ol Ohio, and still tbe tiuth remains, tnat none south ot it, can irudc to any port or place uortn ol it, aud none uorth ot it cau trade to any port or place south of it, except upou terms dictated by a govern ment loreiMU to them, 'these outlets, east. west and south, are indispensable to the well beiiuc ol the people inhibiting, aud to inhabit. all this vast interior regiou. Whck of the three may be the best, is no proper question. Ail. aie better thau either : aud all, ot right, belong to the people, aud to their successors lorever. true to themselves, they win uot ask where a line ol separation shall be, but will Vow, rather, that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested iu there communications to, ami tn rough them, to the Kreat outside world, ihey too, and each ol tuem, must have access to this fcgypt of the Went, without pay lug lolls at the crossing of any national buundaiy.

Without slavery, Uie leheiliou could never have existed ; without slavery it could not continue Among tne Iriends ol the l uiori there is great liveratty ol seutimeut, and oi policy iu regard to slavery, and the Africau race among us, Some would perpetuate slavery, some would abolish it suddenly, aud without conieusatiou; some would abolirh it gradually, aud with couiensaUoa ; some would remove the freed people trom us, and some would retain them with us ; and there aie yel other minor diversi ties. Because ot these diversities, we waste much strength in struggles amoug ourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize, ! and act together. 'Ibis would be cuniprornixu i i but it would be compiomiM) among the friends, j aud not with the enemies of the Uuiun. Ibese aiticles aie in tended to embody a pian of such miitualconcessious. If thepianshail be adopted, it te ar-sumed that emancipation will follow, at least, in Several of the Slates. As to ihe first article, the main poiuts are: first, the emancipation, seconuly, tne length ot time tor consummating it thirty seven years ; and thirdly, the compensation. Ihe emancipation will be unsatisfactory to tbe advocates of perpetual slavery ; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisiaclion. The time spares both races from tbe evils of sudden derangement in tact, from the necessity of any derangement while most of thote whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure, will have passed away before its Consummation, they will never see it. Another class will nail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time, i bey wui feel that it gives too lutie to the now living slaves, but it really gives them much. It saves them from the va ifraut destituuou which must largely attend immediate emancipation iu localities where their numbers are very great ; aud it gives ihe inspiring assurance tbat their pusteiity snail ne iree forever. 1 he man leaves to each v tate, choosing to act under it. to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees, extending over uw wuoie or auy part of the period ; aud it obligee no two States to proceed alike. It also provides for compen sation, aud generally, the mode of making it. ibis, It would seem, must turtner mitigate tne J pd ArpYea!$TOt) Wool. .ftOti.JSO iissatistactiou of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to re ceive. the compensation. LMubtiess some of those who are to pay, aud not to receive, will object. Yet the measure is both just an 1 eco nomical. In a certain sense, the ut ration ot slaves is the destruction of property property acquired by desu nt, or by purchase, the same as auy other property. It is uo lens tiue tor having been oiten said. that the people ot the sou u are not Hiure re sponsible tor Uie original in Induction of this property, than are the people ol the ortb ; aud when it is remembered hoW Unhesitatingly we all u.-e cotton and sugar, aud sh ire the profits os dealing iu them, it m y not besre to say that the south has been more responsible thau the north, lor its continuance, ii, then, for a common objict, this properly is t j be aac lihurd, Is it not just that it be d.Hie at a com mon charge t Aud it, with less money, or money mitre easily paid, we cau pieserve the begems ot the Union by this means, ti au we cau by the war aloue, is it uot also economical to do it Let us consider it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensate d emaucipatiou was proposed last March, aud consider whether, u siiat ineasuie had ben promptly accepted, by even some of the slave Mates, the same sum would not have done more to close Uie war than has beeu otherwise dune. If so, the measure would save money, and, in that view, would be a piudent and ecu uomical measure. Certainly u is uot setsy to pay Bumttwuj as it is to pay mMntty, bjt it is easier to pay a tate sum thau it is to pay a larger oue. Aud it is easier to pay any sum when we are able thau it is to oay it before we are able. Tut war rcvums laige sums, and requites them at once. ihe aggregate sum necessary lor compensated emancipation, ol course, would b laie. But it would require no ready casu ; nor tne bonds even, auy taster ihau the emaucipatiou pro fesses, this might uot, and probably would 'not, close befure tne end ot tne tnuiy seveu years. At that time we snail probably h .ve a huudted millions ol people to siiare the burden, iustead of thirty-one millions, as uow. Aud uot only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue ior a long lime niter that period, as rapidly as before ; because our territory will not have become full. 1 do uot state this inconsiderately. At Uie same ratio ot iucrease whicu we have maintained, on an aveiage, from our first ntU.nal censure, lu Yl'JQ. until that ot lttu, we snould, iu l'JWt have a population of lO-i.-US.-llo.

Were our territory as lmiunl a are tne Britisn isles, very certainly our poulatiou could uot expand as stated, instead of receiv ing the foreign born, as now, we tOioutd be compelled to send part of toe uttivo born away. But such is not our couditnn. We have two millions mue nunorea and sixty-three thousand square miles. Kurope bas three millions aud eight hundred tnousaud, with a population averaging seventy tuiee and oue third persous to the square mile.
