JI ??? ??^???V1^? ??? * PROHIBITION I Georgia State Senate lingham THE VOTE WIS 26 to 14 Opposing Sides Battled Fiercely For Victory?Opponents of Bill Applaud Result. After a debate lasting three days the Willingham state prohibition bill was ir> nonrtria R.nfito "Fridft'V afternoon. The result proved exactly as the opponents of the measure had predicted. The failure of the bill to receive the 17 votes which were accorded it was due < to the absence of three of its supporters, Senators Greene, Morrison and ; Thompson. A surprise was sprung by the oppo- , ? neuts of the bill in an amendment ; Friday morning to the amendment by ; Mr. Terrell, providing for submitting the bill to the people. The new amendment restricted the vote to the 22 counties to be affected by the bill. It was adopted by a vote of 21 to 18. As amended the Terrell amendment was 3 lost by a vote of 26 to 14. The amend- i npent having been killed, the original ] ball was then accorde? a like fate by ] i the same vote. 'The opponents of the bill filled the < senate chamber with their glad shonts, { but it was noticed that the people in the gallery received the verdict with a I i death-like silence. ! The voting began at 1:30 p. m. and 1 the various roll calls consumed an : hour, a great many senators rising to i explain their votes. * a numoer 01 interesting argumeuis were made daring the morning and were followed with the same close attention that has marked the entire debate. On the ballot which was to determine the fate of the measure but one senator explained his vote. This was Senator Underwood, of the thirtysecond. He voted against the passage of the bill and gave as his reason for so doing that as the bill stood he believed it was against the principles of . democracy. The consideration of the several amendments offered to the original bill occasioned the only break in the monotony of the debate of the day and consumed some little time. A mild sensation grew out of the introduction of the amendment to the Terrell amendment by Senator Bedding designed to prohibit the 115 dry counties in the state from voting on the bill if it was passed with the amendment of the senator from the thirty-sixth leaving the measure to a vote of the people of the state. This was presented shortly after the convening of the senate and was read merely for information and held over 1o be acted upon after the argument had been concluded in conformity with the agreement entered into at the bemnninff nf t,Vi? contflst. o???O " ?~ When argument closed at 1:30 i o'clock the previous question ."was called by Senator Fouche and the amendments came up to be acted upon. a An attack was immedietely made t upon the Bedding amendment by the ^ friends of the Willingham bill, Sera- ^ tor Bunn denouncing it as a dodge to ^ kill the bill. Senator Dickerson took ^ the the same stand and the contest at this point assumed a more interesting ^ aspect than at any time since the fate T of the prohibition measure had been in the hands of the upper house. t Despite this, however, the Redding amendment was adopted by a vote of a 21 to 18, and then when the Terrell j amendment, as amended, came up for t consideration, eleven senators rose ^ when their names were called to ex. * plain their votes. By a vote 26 to 14 the amendment of the senator from the thirty-sixth, as amended, was lost. ? Then, being denuded of amend* ments and in the shape it had been passed in the house, the bill was put T upon its passage. The aye and noe $ vote was called, and amid intense si- v lence forty senators cast their votes as T the secretary read each man's name. 3 When the result had been declared a and thA defeat of the measure t>ro- n ' ' * 1 TO CHANGE TAXING SYSTEM.

INTERESTING SESSION OF HOUSE. The house of representatives spent most of the session Friday morning in the discussion of the joint resolution to pay the $3,100 expenses of the tax commission. It developed that there was considerable opposition and some of tne members jave vent to their feelings. The consideration was resumed in the committee of the whole, house. . Speaker Little took the floor in defense of the action of commission in sitting beyond the limit of thirty day? is provided in the resolution. Several members who were opposed to the :ax measure contended that it was a nere matter of right and justice that ;he whole expenses should be paid, in amendment by Mr. Willingham of Monroe to redeuce the amount to 51,840 was voted down. The bill was then reported back to :he house favorably, and was passed ?y a votte of 95 to 19. It was ordered mmediately trasmitted to the senate. A bill by Mr. Morris, of Cobb, to illow judges to render judgments at he appearance term of uncondi:ional contracts in writing where there was io defense, and open accounts where here is an affidavit that the same is rue, where no plea is filed, passed the louse by a vote of 88 to 36. This will save the creditor six nonths time in the superior courts in collecting these contracts where there s no contest. Under the present law hey must go over to the second term cefore judgment can be rendered. The bill by Mr. Slaton, of Fulton, o require all claims agaiust municicalities to be presented for payment >efore suit can be filed, was passed. A resolution by Mr. Reid, of Taliaerro, for the relief of the sureties of i. T. Edwards, late tax collector of Taliaferro county, was also passed.

FUMES SWEEP AUGUSTA. i Nearly Half a Hundred Business Houses Destroyed,With Losses Aggregating $1,000,000. Augusta, Ga., had another big fire 1 Sunday morning, and on the same block where th& big fire of six months j ago occurred. I Last summer's fire destroyed from 1 Seventh street to Dorr's building, and ; Sunday's fire began at Dorr's and swept the rest of the block to the Arlington hotel, ana went across i Eighth street to Schneider's store on the corner. It has been impracticable to get at | losses in any authoritative and accu: rate way. Every insurance company | represented in Augusta is represented j in the fire. The largest losses, esti' mated, were:. i j Dorr,building ana stock,$20,000; J. B. White, building, $60,000: J. B. ! White, stock, $350,000; Arlington hoj tel, building, $100,000; Masonic Hall j building, $25,000; Louis Schaul, jew! elrv, etc., $10,000. Besides these twenty-one other firms were burned out with losses ranging from $500 to $6,000. It was the worst fire that Augusta has had in years. The old Central hotel property that has so often had raging fires on both sides of it, was the center of the blaze Sunday morning, and the historic old building has been razed to the ground. Nothing i remains but the front wall on Broad street with its empty and smoke-begrimed windows. The Masonic nail nas oniy xne ironi wall left standing to mark its site, and but a fragment of the outside walls of the Arlington hotel on tho front and ' on Jackson street mark the place where Augusta's best hotel stood. In three hours a million dollars worth of property in the very heart of the city was converted into ashes. It is a rather notable fact that all the great fires of the past twenty years have occurred within two blocks of Arlington hotel corner, three of them on the same block, on the same side of the street. Sunday morning's great fire?the greatest the city has known in fifty years?began in J. B. "White'S big dry goods house?the nearest approach Augusta had to a big modern department store. The origin of the fire is unknown. redd is lvnocext. Confession of the Negro Fuller Is Not Believed. A Macon dispatch says: Sheriff Westcott places no reliance in the alleged confession of Allen Fuller that Alfred Redd killed Mrs. Pottle while he, Fuller, looked on. Redd will be released. The case against Fuller was made almost perfect by the finding of the hand satchel which Mrs. Pottle car- j ried. A search of the Fuller premises was made and in the house another satchel was found, inside of which was the missing satchel. The scissors, since the coroner's jury investigation, have been positively identified as the property of Mr3. Pottle. They were found on Jt'uller wnen ne was arresiea. The sheriff has been quietly hard at work oil the case and has collected a mass of evidence. He will not dis- j close all he knows until the trial. TWO VICE ADMIRALTIES May B? Created to Settlo the Sehley-Samp?on Controversy. A special to The New York Herald from Washington says: President McKinley during an interview with Senator Wellington, expressed himself in favor of reviving the grade of vice admiral in the intererest of Rear Admiral Sampson and Rear Admiral Schley. He believes that this is the simplest solution of the whole Sampson-Schley controversy, and it is expected that Senator Wellington will introduce a bill in a few days providing for the appointment of two vice admirals without specifying names. Holding Down Insurance Companies. Under the Spanish regime in Cuba the fire insurance companies of the United States were obliged to make a deposit of $25,000. Since the American occupation $75,000 has been demanded, and, in spite of a vigorous protest, the order still stands.

The controversy between the church people and the commissioner is growing very acrimonious, growing out of the whisky and saloon closing question. SKATERS GO 1)0 tYN.

It was to a large extent the feature of ! the day's session. ' The first speaker was Overstreet, ' Republican, who introduced the bill, and Maddox followed in an argument lasting over an hour. Aside from the i reference to the Republican record the Georgian discussed the bill on the fol- , lowing six propositions: "First, this bill is a scheme to legal- i lZiC I'llO autuuiltj buuu iiCIO VG9U uou&y ed by the treasurers of the United States in attempting to put this country on a gold basis without authority of law. "Second, it is a scheme to take from the people one-half of its money cf fiual redemption and to make the same worthless.. "Third, it is a bit 1 to change and alter the contracts of the people without %their consent by making their obligations, which have heretofore since the organization of the government, been payable in coin or both gold and silver payable in gold only. "Fourth, it is a scheme, to contract the currency at the will of the bankers. "Fifth, it is a scheme to adopt the j gold standard for the benefit of the bauks without making themselves * liable in any waj to furnish the gold to sustain it. "Sixth, it is a scheme for the advantage of about three hundred thousand people holding stock in national banks and to disadvantage of all the J rest." 1 The debate will cover a wide range ! and some stormy incidents are expected. Twenty-two Democrats will 1 speak against the bill. ' Representative Overstreat, in open- 1 ing, said: i "Notwithstanding there have been < occasions when serious doubt clouded i the situation and produced grave fears < lest the entire fabric of oui monetary system might be seriously shaken, yet i it is to *he credit of the government t that every dollar of our money in cir- 1 culation is absolutely sound and un- t questioned. This condition has led * many people into the erroneous belief that there was no need for legislation and that the best the government could do would be to let the subject alone. "Such people are not familiar with the frequent pledges of the government to maintain the parity of our money, declaring by congressional acts the honest purpose of the government to faithfully and surely guarantee full parity of all money in circulation. The present parity depends entirely upon such declarations and guarantees, but its maintenance rests with the judgment or caprice cf the I secretary of the treasnry who, by a single order directing the use of silver in the discharge of our obligations may completely destroy the parity and shift the standard to the metal so used. "It seems far better to attempt a proper regulation of the question by a clear and permanent statute rather I than depend upon occasional declara' tions by the government of its intention. It is far better to end the matter by a public law, whieh shall be plain and unequivocal, rather than rely upon proposals of what may or ' shall be done at some future date, or leave so dangerous an option within the control of one man, whether he be the president or his financial advisor." e

The statistician of the department of agriculture at Washington, reports 3,900,000 bales as the probable cotton production for the Uhited States for 1899-1900. This estimate is based npon a larger number of both general and special reports than has ever before been received by the department in connection with a cotton crop. While weather conditions during the past thirty days have been favorable to whatever picking remained to be done, so that the general condition of the crop is slightly better thau one month ago, continued investigations leave absolutely no doubt that the crop is even smaller than was indicated in either of the statistician's previous reports. The report shows acreage in the principal cotton growing states to have been as follows: North Carolina, 1,311,708; South Carolina,2,353,213; Georgia, 3,535,205; Alabama, 3,003,176; Texas, 6,991,901; Mississippi, 2,900,298; Louisiana, 1,281,691; Arkansas, 1,876,167; Tennessee, 896,722; Oklahoma, 215,893; Indian Territory, 311,906; sundry, 286, 112, making a total of 24,967,29o. The production in gross bales -was is follows: North Carolina, 629,620; South Carolina, 1,035,414, Georgia, 1,378,731; Alabama, 1,176,042; Mississippi, 1,247,128; Louisiana, 717,747; Texas, 1,363,103; Arkansas, 919.469, Tennessee, 322,820; Oklahoma, 109,026; Inlian Territory, 207,838; sundry, 82,291, makiug a total of 11,189,205 bales, an increase of 291,348 bales Dver the preceeding year. Of the total jrop, 11,121,414 bales were upland, iveraging 515 pounds per bale, gross weight, and 67,791 were Sea Island, iveraging 390 pounds per bale. The iverage production per acre was .448 :>f a bale. The total value of the crop, estimatjd on the basis of the average prices luring the first six months of the cotion year at the various larg& markets nearest to the different centers of proluction, was $305,467,041, the average price per pound being 5.27 cents for lpland and 14 cents for Sea Island. ROUT WAS DISASTROUS.. ? Further Details of Gen. Gatacre's Repulse Bjr the Boers. Later details received at London egarding the disaster to General jatacre's column show that but for nagnificent work of the British artilery the disaster would have been far nore extensive, as the incessant Boer ihell fire in the midst of the repulsed nfantry ultimately led to disorder svhich only escaped developing into a out through the batteries of artillery >ccupying successive positions coverng the retreat,thus drawing a portion )f the Boers' galling fire. Apparently the British were set an mpossible task and were treacherously juided. After a trying march and being tinder arms lb hours, they at;acked the wrong part of the Boer portion, where the hill was impregnable and the burghers were estimated ;o number 6,000 men instead of 2,500, is the spies had reported. There is little in the story to mitigate the intense humiliation occasioned by the episode which was ilmost an exact counterpart of the batto of Nichols-Nek. The war office Fas besieged with, anxious relatives, ind the successive editions of news>apers were eagerly scanned. Men ind women were equally persistent in bleading for information, but the auhorities either do not posse ss any or ire not prepared to publish it at pres:nt. The affair has caused the most debressing influence everywhere, not eijepting the stock exchange, where, ;onsols were at the lowest price in nany years, and South African securiies slumped, not so much on account >f the military reverse which is notrerievable, but owing to the proound apprehension as' to effect. No great surprise would now be felt if General Gatacre's reverse resulted in Bape Colony becoming aflame from snd to end. It is just two months since the [ ransvaal ultimatum was delivered, ftne battles have been fought and the British have lost 566 killed, 2,027 rounded and 1,977 missing or prisontrs. REESE OUT OF JAIL. Sires S3,OOO Bond and Goes back to His Old Tricks. John P. Reese, national executive ommitteeman of the United Mine Vorkers, who has been in jail at Ft.

DCDirnnrAN HA [ftDfTY Km 111*1 UlfLflVrtM ilinoVIMl A 1W Mjww Qoebel Is Still Game But la Advirci By His Friends to Abide the Result. A special from Frankfort, Ky., ?ay?: At 9:45 o'clock Saturday morning the election certificate of William S. Taylor was signed by the election commissioners and he was declared to be governor-elect of Kentucky. The official figures of the vote filed with Secretary of State Finley are: Taylor, 193,714; Goebel, 191,331; Taylor's plurality, 2,383. The operation, which ended for the time being at least, the bitterly fought gubernatorial contest, was conducted in- the simplest manner. The majority opinion of Commissioners Pryor and Ellis and the minority opinion of Commissioner Poyntz, which were issued Saturday morning, were not read as was the orignal intention. The three commissioners walked first to the office of the clerk of the state supreme court where they filed two opinions. They then passed into the office of the secretary of state. Clerk Chenault, of the board of commissioners, read the figures showing that the Republican candidates for offices on the state ticket had received the larg est number of votes and then certificates of election were signed at once, that of Mr. Taylor being first on the list. All Republican candidates for state offices were then furnished with commissions by Governor Bradley. Goebel seems to take his defeat philosophically. He had been advised by many friends who supported him with vigor to let the Republicans have the offices without further contest as the keeping alive of the political feeling would do an infinite harm. Mr. Taylor was modest and reticent as usual. "I expected it, of course," said he, "I knew that if the commissioners went by the law and the evidence they could do nothing else than decide the way they have done." Commissioner Poyntz declined to sign the Republican certificates of election, saying that he stood by the opinion that he had rendered, and could not consistently do so. He consented to sign the certificates of the railroad commissioners, however. The official returns developed the peculiar fact that 10,000 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans did not know how to vote the Australian ballot, as both Goebel and Taylor ran ahead of other men on their respective tickets 10,000 votes; and John Young Brown, while receiving only 12,000 ran 2,000 ahead ef his ticket. It seems that 22,000 voters thought that by marking the name of thft candidate for covernor thev were voting the entire ticket of their choice. LAWYERS ARE INNOCENT. Committee Say* Grand Jury Presentments Were Scandalous. Without foundation, improper, untrue and .scandalous is the verdict of the special committee of the Atlanta Bar association on the arraignment of the grand jury and Foreman Joseph H. Johnson. The report of the committee was submitted at a meeting of the association Saturday morning in the superior court room, and was eagerly listened to by as many lawyers and citizens as the room would hold. The committee admitted that there were some unworthy members of the bar in the city, but stated that their number was so few as not to warrant the special presentment and the manner in which it was made. Foreman Johnson, who was seen after tho meeting, said: "I utter a loud cry for help from the ethical members of the Atlanta Bar association."

According to a Washington speoial , there is a highly interesting story go- 1 ing the rounds of the inner Republican circles to the effect that President ( McKinley is anxious to see Tom Reed 1 named as his running mate for 1900. ' While the death of Yice President Mo- * bart is very recent, it is natural that 1 there should have already been a good deal of talk about the Republican nom- * inee for the vice presidency, and it is ' said the president, in talking with ' some of his closest associates, has ^ sounded them as to the availability of 1 the late speaker. } i MRS.

A Columbia dispatch says: Sensational charges have been made by Cora Jenkins, fifteen years old, against Professor J. C. Meares, of the South Carolina Institute for tjie deaf, dumb and blind, at Cedar Springs. The girl went from the asylum to the home of Dr. Meares a year ago. She was a pretty girl and was adopted by the professor and his wife. She has now become a mother and is in the county poor house. Professor Meares is a noted educator of the blipd and has been in the institute for a number of years. The case has been turned over to the grand jury. The girl is said to have refused offers to compromise. * The Dispensary Fund. After months and months of work I the comptroller general has finally succeeded in getting reports from all of the counties so that he could distribute the dispensary fund turned over for distribution this year among the public schools of the state. It was thought that there would be practically no school in the state which would not show that it had received $75, or had been open for threh months. Such was not the case, and owing to the bungling construction of the recent act many counties received three times as much money as they re coived from the direct distribution. The ijgures made up bj the comptroller general are as follows: Amount less than $3 per capita received in certain counties from three mills and polls to be paid from dispensary funds: Abbeville $ 1,269 31 Berkeley 2,209 12 Chester 2,510 81 Chesterfield 3,282 63 Colleton.'. 935 41 Darlington 660 84 Edgefield 1,180 89 Fairfield 4,419 03 Florence 2,447 42 Georgetown 2,174 59 Greenville 3,599 07 Horry . 8,071 59 Kershaw 787 01 Lancaster 5,22* 42 Lexington 2,342 45 Marion 2,018 26 Marlboro 717 88 Newberry 275 83 Oconee 1,288 42 Orangeburg 7,139 72 Pickens 3,460 05 Saluda 2,694 38 Spartanburg 924 19 Sumter 746 95 Union 121 41 Williamsburg 3,138 84 York 3,559 52 Totals t'7,204 35 It may be stated that after the deficiency account has been paid the various counties each school child in the state received, on acco'ut of the dispensary, a little over 15 cents, or, to be exact, 15,75272. ** Why Not? mi . -vr 3 n - . irk. xne news aau tuuner r?iuur&B. mills in Sonth Carolina have proved as snccessfnl as those in Georgia, and their success, too, has proved that southern men and South Carolina men know "how to run" such enterprises to the best advantage. There is no reason why South Carolina should not get from $75 to $100 for every bale it grows, instead of $25 to $40 for the raw material. The same suggestive j and stimulative remark applies to every county in the state. That county is sound asleep to its opportunity and interest, surely, which is content to sell its crop year after year for onefourth to one-third of its ready value. Wealth is not so won. No county should cease from^effort until it has within its borders at least enough spindles to spin every bale of cotton within its borders.' Local Option Proposed. A Columbia special says: There will be one overshadowing question before me approaching session of jthe legislature, the solution of the liquor problem. The great scheme of Senator rillman to relieve the people from the burdens of taxation and to improve the morals of the citizens seem doomed. The best friends of the dispensary are turning against it. Bepeated scandals in the state board and con;inuing bloodshed, together with less partisan bitterness, has borne fruit Senator Lewis Appelt,of Clarendon, ?leader of the reformers or Tillman 'action in the legislature, and until the ast few months an earnest advocate of ihe system of state dispensaries, has prepared a Dill wnose mam matures will probably become law. It prorides that at the next general election ;he following questions shall be subnitted to the qnalliiied electors in tach county: 1. The question of prolibition. 2. The question of county lispensary. 3. The question of li;ense under the constitution. The penalty for disposing of liquor mlawfully in counties where the maority vote is for prohibition is fixed at lot less than three nor more than welve months' imprisonment or a fine >f not less than $100 nor more than 5500. Half of the fine goes to the inormer. There is no other provision or encouraging detection of lawbreakirs. Where the majority vote is for a dis>ensary, a board consisting of the iounty supervisor, the foreman of the jrand jury and one taxpaying citizen * * "> ' - iv. ? I o De seieciea dj uih majrui ul vuo i :ounty seat, shall have control of all ts affairs. They will each receive $3 )er day for not more than three days n each month. The board shall orjanize the connty dispensary, buy all he liquors used and select the dis)enser, who is required to give bond n the penal sum of $5,000 for the faithul and honest performance of his duies. Where the counties vote for "license" a board selected in the same way as that for the dispensary counties shall have charge. No licenses shall be granted except in towns and cities. In towns of less than 5,000 inhabitants, the application must be accompanied by a peti- * % tion from the majority of the freehold voters in said town; in larger towns a majority of voters in the ward in which the saloon is to be located most make petition. The license must be not less than $600 nor more,, than $1,200 a year, half going to the mnnioipality and half to the county for th6 public schools. Liquor cannot be | sold in quantities of less than one-half I pint, nor be drunk on the premises where sold; nor be sold to minors, 1;| nor persons in the habit of becoming - v|| intoxicated. A fine of not less ^n $300 or imprisonment for not less than .three months will be the penalty for the violation of any of these regula* What BranchTille People Think. A number of Branchville people vrent up to Orangeburg in attendance upon the preliminary trial of Warren, the alleged express robber. Some of ."'-I <* L.l.-.f it.. til em express tne arm oexiex iu ura ***- .sston nocence of the accused, while others . claim that he is guilty. Of course the accused had so statement to make, so that from his stand-\ point nothing will be made public at ' this time. His brother expressed him- Jf!j self before the hearing as being anxious to know what the express officials had against the accused, as he seemed to have a very slight idea of what the testimony would be. > Franchise Granted*. Without a single dissenting vote'the ||? city council of Charleston, at a special M meeting last Friday night, adopted the 'M report of the joint committee on streets fi and railroads, by which the Chatta- S nooga, Augusta and Charleston Air I Line railway is given a franchise' to 1 build into Charleston. The reportsfirst approved by members of the two . J| committees and the corporation cohn-j sel, was read and when the questshn j was called it was adopted by counml jS by unanimous vote. The franchise is fashioned practically on the lines ask- -j ed by the company and with it is the ' right to construct tracks from the city boundary, through the streets named, . M and down to the terminal property, || where the Seaboard station will be || erected. After this granting of the , franchise, however, the railroad com- m mittee was instructed to look into the matter of an alternate route, but this -|j| does not affect the franchise as it" ; Just what steps are to follow this action has not been stated, but it appears from the grant of right* by ' yg the Charleston city council that the . active occupancy of the franchise voted; must begin within sixty days.

UWMV?- ww w ?? ? *** Warren Bound Over. The preliminary hearing in the case J of the state against Bartow Warren,, who is charged by the Southern Express company'8 officials and detectives with having committed the daring ex- 4 press robberry near Branchville on the first day of the present month, was j. fl held by Magistrate'Charles P. Branson , 'M at Orangeburg the past week, and m ter a lengthy investigation, the magis- 1 ;1 trate decided to hold the defendant for trial. The bail was fixed at $800. Messrs. Raysor k Summers appear- .^1 ed for the prosecution, in behalf of the express company, while General James S. Izlar and Messrs. Henry H. Branson and William C. Wolf appear- 5 ed in behalf of the defendant. The witnesses for the prosecution , ^ were rigidly cross-examined by Gem I Izlar, the direct examination being I conducted by Mr. Raysor. This Mill Prospers. A meeting of the directors of the -|| Laurens cotton mill was held the past ;|| week. Stephen M. Greene was elected ija to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Mr. J. H. Simpson. A semi-annual dividend of 4 per cent, payable Janu-Qi ary 1, was declared. Among the directors present was William M. Bird, of Charleston. Some northern capitalists who were present expressed iViamoalraa AS dpliffhtfid With the COU- . ^ bUPUiovi v vw ?0 dition of the Laurens mill. The mill has 38,400 spindles and is capitalized J at only $350,000.

A little more than a month ago J. B. . Douthit, state liquor commissioner, > was dismissed under disgrace by the '} board of control by a vote of 3 to 2. There was talk by the majority of | having criminal proceedings begun by the attorney general. The charges were selling contraband liquor and changing labels of goods sent from M the dispensary, making it sell for more than it was worth at that time. Douthit was allowed fifteen minutes | to clear himself. Douthit employed ?? counsel and obtained an order from Judge Alkrich directing the board to give him a trial. After several postponements, occasioned by the wound*- -'l ing of Mr. J. Dudley Haselden at Sellers, the board met at Columbia a few ;| days ago to try the case. Mr. Haselden was one of the majority who ousted Douthit. At a secret meeting he offered resolutions with- Si drawing the charges and referred the matter to the legislature. The board would not agree to this, and when the case was called, without takjpg testi- 11 mony, the board, by a vote of 3 to 1, Haselden standing alone, vindicated Douthit, who retains his position. v a||n The inference of tne exinonuMi; action is that that those who followed Mr. Haselden formerly, since the breastplate revevelations have decided that it is good politics to go* the oppo* 7 ? :?
