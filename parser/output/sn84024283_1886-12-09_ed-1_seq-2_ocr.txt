The steamship Westerland, which arrived from Antwerp i yesterday morning, experienced very i heavy weather. On November 27th the I vessel encountered a violent hurricane. A f huge sea broke over the bows, staving in J the turtle back and killing two steerage ; passengers and four seamen. The pas- sengers killed were Max Frank and Gabo j Livadieri. Twenty seamen and passengers were injured more or less severely. Captain Randel, of the Westerland, was seen at the office of the Red Star Line. He said: "The .accident is unaccountable. There was a good sea running, but I did not regard it as anything dangerous. Un der the turtle-back there was assembled at the time groups of sailors and passengers. Suddenly one of the waves rushed toward the ship assuming the form of a towering column of water. Whether a cross sea or not, there seems to be no satisfactory explanation. The mass of water swept toward the thip with im posing grandeur, and as it struck the vessel shook as though a mere toy. When the great column broke over the deck there were screams of distress, and the vessel was I for a moment submerged. When the flood i had nassed. a name nrevailed. The thick i iron beams and plates of the turtle back were broken. Underneath the wreckage ! was a distressing sight. The shock killed j four sailors. They were crushed in a j shocking manner. Near them lay two pas- sengers. fatally injured, and scattered i about the decks were twenty more j persons more or less hurt, some j very seriously. No more waves came on i board. That night the bodies of the four j dead sailors were given sailors' burials, j The next day the two passengers died, and they, too, were buried at sea." It is believed the other injured persons will recover. Every thing possible has been done for their comfort. Charged With Swindling. Pittsburgh, Pa., Dee. 3. The Pennsyl- 1 vania Natural Gas Company yesterday en ! tered suit against B. Raffertv and Wm. j Hewing for f 110.000 damages. Theeomplain- manager of that company prior to April 6, 1SS6. procured payment from the company to Ewing of $1 10,000 for purchases and losses of certain gas lands representing th expense of thirty dollars per acre, whereas it did not actually exceed sev- enty-five cents per acre: and it is further alleged that the defendants in the transac tions above mentioned, conspired to de fraud and deceive the plaintiff company, wherefore they place their damages at the full sum paid by the jl Attempt to Barn a City. ? TiyptE, Tex., Dec 2 This city narrow ly escaped destruction by incendiaries night before last. Tuesday afternoon a man named Barton informed the offi cials of the existence of a plot to burn the city. A special force was summoned and the city put under the closest watch. At half-past seven the incendiaries ap peared and poured oil on the wall of Will iams' saloon, in the rear, and applied the match. When the flames leaped up, Special Officer McMahon demanded the surrender of James Nash, the man who applied the match. Nash fled and Mc Mahon fired, killing him instactly. -Th ether conspirators e-apec.. I THE NAVY. Xmportant Features of Secretary Whitney's Report. The Department's Experience In Banding Ci-nlsers How Money Ha Beea Used Resume of the Past Tear's Operation. Washington, Dec 4. The annual report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 18S6 was made public to-day, and from it the following extracts, bearing on subjects of general Inter est, are made. The report has the following on the subject of the . additional msw cruisers: - The experience of the department in its first attempt at the creation of modern vessels of war has been such as to excite the greatest concern and disappointment. An examination of the facts with reference to them demon strated that an entirely new departure was necessary in undertaking further similar con struction. The one characteristic which an un armored cruiser must possess is great speed. This is determined by the function which she is expected to perform in modern warfare. She is a "commerce destroyer." She must be able to escape from ironclads and outran. so as to overhaul, mer chantmen. If slower than ironclads she could not keep the sea, and if slower than merchant men she might as well stay in port. This di vision of ships by the functions which they are expected to perform is one of the things which has come about of recent years. When it be came impossible to concentrate in one ship both the greatest speed, strongest armament, and the highest defensive power, without reaching a tonnage displacement wholly out of the question, the division into classes, ac cording to the functions which they were ex pected to perform, came about. Unarmed cruisers have become a distinct class, and the characteristic absolutely indispensable to this class is very great speed. When the Dolphin, Boston, Atlanta and Chi cago were projected, and the contracts for their construction entered into, it was well known what speed ought to be attained and what weight and character of machinery per ton of displacement was necessary to obtain it. Com mercial vessels had at that time attained speeds ranging between sixteen and niniieen knots, and cruisers were being built in other countries, or had already been built, attaining the same speed. The Dolphin and the Atlanta having both been completed, and having had trial trips, it is possible to compare them in their results with similar vessels built contemporaneously elsewhere. The Dolphin, of 1,500 tons displace ment, can be compared with the Alacrity and Surprise, English dispatch vessels of 1,400 tons each, and the Milan, a French di6patch vessel of 1.550 tons, all built contemporaneously. The Dolphin was designed for 2.300 indicated horse power, the Alacrity and Surprise each 3.000 and the Milan 3,900. The highest mean horse-power developed upon trial was. in the case of the Dolphin, less than 2,300, of the Alacrity, 3,173; of the Surprise, 8,079; of the Milan, 4,132. The hie-hest sneed of th TWilnhin. rsnlt.inff fmm j several trials, was 15.11 knots, running light; of j the Alacrity, 17.95 knots; of the Surprise, 17.8 knots: of the Milan, 18.4 knots. The Atlanta, the sister ship to the Boston, can be compared with the Esmeralda, the Gir anni Bausan and the Mersey. All three wre built in England; the Esmeralda for Chili, the Giovanni Bausan for Italy and the Mersey for the English Government. The At lanta is of 3,000 tons displacement; the Esmer alda. 2,9-3); the Giovanni Bausan, 3.0CS, and the Mersey, 3,550. The Atlanta was designed to attain an indicated horse-power of 3,500, the Esmeralda and the Giovanni Bausan each 5,- 500, and the Mersey 6,000. The trials had of the Atlanta indicate that her engines will develop less than 3,500 horse-power, while the Esmer alda developed 6,000, the Giovanni Bausan 6, 680, and the Mersey 6,626. The maximum speed of the Atlanta will be less than 15 knots, while that of the Esmeralda was 1S.C8 knots, the i Giovanni Bausan 17.5 knots; the Mersey 17.5 knots. 1 These facts are stated without any intention of locating responsibility or blame upon any i person. It is impossible to ascertain where it i should be placed. But they indicate a simple abandonment on the part of the department of any attempt to reach the conditions which -: should have been attained and the failure on ; the part of the contractor to reach the limited results expected by the department. In con- : sidcring the matter of constructing ; the additional vessels authorized by i Congress in March, 1SS5, it was decided by the j department to exhaust every efTort to avail i itself of the most advanced thought and knowledge attained by our own and other countries upon the subject. The machinery of naval vessels is entirely different in character from that of merchant ships: and as no modern war vessels have been for many years built in : this country by our Government, up to the time i of those just referred to, it seems probable, on j comparing results attained by the department i in its first effort with those reached in other j countries, that important advances had been ' made elsewhere in the methods of attaining great speed and power which it had become necessary for us to utilize. For twenty years the principal market ir modern war vessels has been England. Russia, Germany, Italy, Chili, Brazil, Japan have all procured in the English market war vessels reckoned among the best in their respective fleets. Great ef forts have been made in most of these coun tries to develop ship construction at home, but not without first availing of the latest products attainable elsewhere as a basis upon which to build their own subsequent improvements and developments. THE SEW ARJfOR-CLADS. Congress, at its recent session, authorized the construction of two iron-clads of about 6, 000 tons each. The subject has been referred to the bureaus of construction, steam engineer ing, equipment and recruiting and ordnance to take the necessary steps to prepare plans for the letting. The department has also deemed it wise to offer to all approved naval architects and ship builders an opportunity to compete with the work of the department in the design for these new ships, and the sum of (15,000 has been offered as compensation for any accepted design for either of the vessels, the working drawings to be the subject of subsequent agree ment. There are many distinguished architects who, ot late years, have had much greater ex perience in new work than the liberality of onr government has made it possible for our own to enjoy, and in starting upon the creation of a new navy the department has no embar rassment in desiring to avail of the best talent anywhere to be found in placing the new work upon a par with the best of other countries, from which point it is entirely safe to predict that the ingenuity and talent of our own countrymen will suffice to keep us in j the front rank for future work. " I No time will thus be lost, even if no designs are submitted or accepted, for the process of preparing neccessary plans is going on simul taneously in the department. , THB ABHOR AND GC3TS FOR THK MONITORS AND THE ARMOR-CLADS. ! Congress also authorized the President, in his i discretion, to direct the completion of the double-turreted monitors, and made provision " with reference to the armor as follows : 1 That the armor used in constructing said armored vessels and for completing said mon j itors shall be of the best obtainable quality, 1 and of domestic manufacture, provided con 1 tracts for furnishing the same in a reasonable - time, at a reasonable price, and of the required quality can be made with responsible parties. Such armor shall be accepted only after pass ing such tests as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy and inserted in the contracts.- - In construing the statute for the purpose of ascertaining what, within the view of Congress, should be construed a "reasonable time,", it was deemed to necessarily imply such a time as would be required to perfect ia this country aa additional plant adequate to the creation of the product desired, inasmuch as modern armor, either of steel or compound, able to stand the tests which would be prescribed, has not, up to the present time, been made in the United States, and for a fair competition ia its manu facture a "reasonable time" would be the time necessary to be takes by a manufacturer to pro vide himself with the necessary plant to produce the article required. A shorter time would necessarily preclude the possibility of obtain ing the same ia the United States. No steel ! manufacturer in the United States, with his ' present plant, would enter into m contract to 3e . liver armor guaranteed to stand the tests, based upon the tests of armor in use abroad, which the oureaa or ordnance would prescribe.
