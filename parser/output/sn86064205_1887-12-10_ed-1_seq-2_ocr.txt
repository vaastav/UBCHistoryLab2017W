bona fide settlers at from S2 to S4 an acre on thirty years time at a low rate of interest A niGn tariff is as the internal revenue much a war tax as Mk Cleveland has knocked all the DOlitical sideshows in the head Mr Blaines mistake is In supposing that the ideas of the few will attract the support of the many France is coming around to the proper place She has just elected a President who is an engineer by profession Pueblo is about to absorb the business of Denver and the Denver Republican is calling loudly upon Its people to wake up and be adoing Editor Harris of the Austin Dispatch threw himself into the breach and wrote the Governor a letter pointing out with esp2rt precision the defects in the state capitol The Argentine R public offers to give about 100000 annually to subsidize a monthly mail ship between that country and this If we could meet this generous offer with qusl liberality we would scon have a trade built up with Buenos Ayres of considerable magnitude Nohody can frame Ingalls for wanting to be President of tie United Sates He ia already president of the American Houpe of Lord and it is very natural for him to wnttc boss the commoners To Johx Sherman private end confi dential James G Blaine is in the race lor the Republican nomination for Presi dent despite t November eltctions As the reelection of Mr Cleveland is a fore gone conclusion you might as well grace fully aid Blaiae to putting on his political winding sheet The architects who have been investi gating the state capitol building have not made their report and an acxlous public wonders why If there was nothing wrong they should have said so at once and i there is any defects they should drop a hint now and then to give the public a foretasted it urn Mr Blaine wants the tariff protective that eastern manufacturers may profit by the tax wrung from western and southern producers and then wiun a big treasury surplus is thus accumulated Mr Blaine wants to spend the money in Atlantic forti fications that will provide work and dis tribute the cash in the east The west and the south can rea d in Mr Blaines criticism of Mr Cleveland whose candi date the Maine statppman would be The Gazette has been favored with the annual rpport ol John C Branner Pn D State Geologist of Arkansas It shows that our neighbor is fully alive to the necessity of developing her resources and while the report contains only the preliminary outlines of the work to be ac complished it is commended to the con sideration of Texas legislators who are aDxious to see the resources of their state made known Mrs Augu8ta Evans Wilson racks back at her critics in the Tuscaloosa Gazette The Montgomery Advertiser children uneducated persons and ne groes that cannot apDreclate the sublime idiocy of a book written in a language practically foreign to seventenths of the people of the country are roundly belabored No body would object to Mrs Wilsons book if she furnished a stepladder to enable readers to reach the height of its very learned absurdity Thk New York Tribune has girded up its loins anew and is at work demolishing everything Democratic about the Fiftieth Congress The arguments put forward by the Tribune like those of several other leading Repub ican journals are well woithy perusal Scientists tell us that only by studying the infinitely small can we learn to know the infinitely great and as there are questions of infinite great ness to be learned by thepeople of this couotry the Tribunes arguments are well worthy perusal Mr Blaine wants the tax on tobacco removed in the hope of catching the Old Dominion tobacco growers The grow ers of tooacco do not pay the tax but the consumers of tobacco do pay the tax If tobacco is a neces6gry to the working mass as Mr Blaine claims what about the wife and the children of the working man who do not use tobacco but who do need woolen goods and what about the workingman who does not use tobacco Whisky and tobacco are not necessary to life clothing and hats and plows and bagging and iron ties are necessary to life and to the work of the people Mr Blaine talks of the workingman snd the manufacturing nabob clips his coupons and smiles Mayor Roche of Chicago is receiving a great deal of applause from certain sec tions because he refused to grant the an archists sympathizers permission to meet in one of the parks unless they agreed not to carry red fitgs or drink beer The Mayor means well doHbtless but his ar bitrary action will have a bad effect He has no power and no authority to pre scribe what people shall drink or how much nor can he say what colored flags they must carry If carrying red flags is contrary to law those guilty of carrying them should be punished as tho law directs The anarchy preached by the Chicago reds is no worse than the despot ism which says under what conditions alone people may exercise their rights The precautions taken by the Mayor of Chicago show a craven fear of the an archists unworthy a great city THE LAW TO BE 

ENFOBGED The unpleasant notoriety givenSan Antonio through the persistent violations of the Sanday law by the saloonkeepers of that city is to be deplored as it adds fuel to the fire of misrepresentation of the state Justices of the peace and juries who arrogate to themselves the power to pass upon and annul the laws of the land andthrowthemselvesbetweenmalefactors and the prison do not stand out as exam ples of Texan intelligence or virtue The determination of AttorneyGeneral Hogg to enforce the law at all hazards even though it become necessary to call in the state troops is to be commended and en couraged not only because it is his plain duty to see the law enforced but because by defining the bounds of the lawdefjing territory the remainder of the state will be absolved from any participation in or sympathy for the anarchial conduct of the Alamo City The Attorney General means what he says and THE GAZETTE EOET WITH TEXAS SATURDAY DECEMBER 10 h Â° lays down the law towit The Sunday reduced the tariff must be rednced ocd iiws must be enforced even if state troops J it is cot improbable that the internal rev have to be called to assist the local au thorities Behind the AttorneyGeneral standG the whole power of the state and also a strong public sentiment which is lawa aiding While it is doubtless true teat San Antonio is dominated by foreign born citizens who have not yet learned to relish Texas sentiments and while it is true that every people should be per mitted to conduct their affairs in such a manner as will be most agreeable to themselves it is equally true that citi zens of Texas should either obey Texas laws and respict her institutions or re main beyond her lmits and that when laws are openly and dtfiintly violated by thOEe claiming to be citizens of the state and for the reason that such laws ere not in harmony with foreign sentiments Texas pride should urge our state offi cers to rebuke such contumacy by a sirict enforcement of the law Oa Sunday March C 188G the Alamo was wrenched from the infant hand of Texas it is to be hoped that AttorneyGenwal Hogg with the strong arm of the state behind him will again reclaim it TO EAST

represented Let Texas demonstrate ia this meetisg its earnestness in this matter BLAINES MESSAGE President Clevelands message was given to the counry and the country read it and was satisfied Almost imme diately thereafter wouldbe President James G Blaine came to the front with a message everything but official in which he undertakes to demolish the arguments advanced in the Presidents message Mr Blaine though undoubtedly an able disputant and as well equipped for po litical discussion as any man in public life does not meet argument altogether with argument but cleverly inteijects a volume of sentiment as he goes along and always where it will do the most good England he assures us looks with great favor upon the free trade ten dencies of President Cleveland and is preparing for an enormous trade in fabrics with this country under the benefi cent influence of a lower tariff This is to arouse the manufacturers of the coun try and rally them to his standard He favors the construction of fortifica tions to indicate his loDg boasted strong foreign policy and ingratiate himself into the good graces of the Irish of New York who are always ready to applaud opposition to foreign nations which means to England In this Mr Blaine has shown a master hand While Mr Cleveland has been unapproachable on the subject Mr Bayard high in the councils of the administration has been by some charged with being the Ameri can representative of English capitalists and of offensive snobbery Mr Blaine wants to accentuate not only his sympa thy with Irish sentiment but his American individualism which Is sure to elicit the good will of the growing American sentiment that we see mani festing itself in the outcroppings of modified Knownothingism under rious names He favors the peal of the t3x on tobacco and will be a strong card with in that very doubtful state Virginia a remarkable coincide ce when va re this him As Mr Blaines interview was coming from New York advocating the repeal of the in ternal revenue tax on tobacco the Democratic Legislature of Virginia was telegraphing the national representatives of that state instructing them to work for a similar subject Here is one Instance where a Democratic state refused to be guided by the policy outlined by a Demo cratic President The tax on whisky Mr Blaine desires to see remain and with much plausibility he argues with the Prohibitionists ia so able and apparently sincere a manner as to convince the not too skeptical that he was one of them His views on the wool question are hand in hand with the National Woolgrowers Association now in session in Washing ton that is viewing with alarm the impending destruction of their interests There is not s vulnerable point in Mr Clevelands armor that the man fromMaine has not assailed and some of them with success The sea coast cities are all given liberal quantities of taffy relative to defenses the labor element in the usual way and with the very proper and truthful addition that tobacco is the poor mans necessity and that labor pays the tax imposed upon this product which is only partially true Taken all in all Mr Blaines interview is more catchy and popular than Mr Clevelands message For Temporary use it is a better electioneering document It is of course certain that for every defection from the Demo cratic ranks on account of revenue or tariff there will be an acquisition for the same reasons The question however to be settled by the people is plain and simple and Mr Cleveland has taken the view of it that will find the most advocates The surplus must be enue tax on tobacco will also be reduced as a compromise One thing Blames pronunciamento has done however has been to brush away from his path all op position to a nomination by the Republi can convention tSf TUB 

POOL AND TEXAS The railroads of Texas should not un derstand the present movement to do something in behalf of the state to be the outgrowth of hostiliy to the railroads of the state but at the same timp the rail roads should appreciate the earnestness of the people in this matter aad symp thiza with it to the extent of such friend ly interest as will tend to a cooperation based upon the full discharge of obliga tions resting on both people and railroad The people of Texas are painfully aware of the fact that no immisration worthy tue name has come into the sute since 18S3 they are not oblivious of tne hlghting irfluences of the drouth of 1885 and 1880 and of the great depres sion in the cattle industry beginning in ISSi they know that deep water on the Texas coast and a land law that will simplify the acquirement of public lands are needed factors in the states development The people know that railroads cannot unaided do all TexaB needs to have done for it but they do know that the railroads of Texas haul people across Texas to California at a lefs rate of fare than the same railroads will transport people into Tex s and they know further that Texas railroads will carry people out of Texas at e less rate than they will bring people into Texas and they also know that for the past six months more people have been carried out than have been brought into the state The people have an intelligent appre hension of all the facts bearing on the esse and now they are ripe for action that shall be based on co operation o5 railroads and people They do not feel encouraged to expend any more money in advertising the state to those who are offered cheaper rates to travel through Texas to other states than to come to Texss they want the railroads to aid in some movement that will build up Texas and if the pool stands in the way and sets itself up as an obstacle the people want the pool busted The people recall the first message of Governor Ross to the Twentieth Legisla ture in which he so folly discussed the traffic arrangements of railroads by which the reads divided the profits upon some mutually agreed basis and put practical end to the competition which the people soueht and thought to provide by liberal donations municipal and pri vate The people are recalling also this suggestion of Governor Ross to the Legis lature I respectfully suggest to your honorable bodies the pronrleiy of enacting that hereaf er pooling r combinations bctwe n railroads and other con mon carr era shall be deem d unlaw ful and If any offi c gent eeivant or em ploye thereof shall en er into or execute any agreement of that character or shall operate or assist in opcating a r ilnad under such agree ment or i ha 1 tnowlngly aid or assist in the operation of arailroad under such arangem nt he 6hal be deemed guilty of a felony and be Imprisoned in the penitentiary for a proper erm of years If the railroads cannot or wili not aid in the movement because of pool obliga tions the roads must certainly see that such refusal for such cause will tend to crystalize public sentiment in favor of such law recommended by Governor Ross The Gazette is not unaware of the public advantages and benefits claimed for the pool but if such benefits are to be purchased at thp cost of all hope of legitimate competition and of the cooperation of railroads and peo ple in an effort calcula ted to promote the interests of both then the plea of the people for cooperation it may be expected will become a de mand for some legal enactment that will insure competition It is for the rail roads to demonstrate whether a traffic arrangement or pool is the iripnd or enemy of Texas The Sngnr Tnat St Loui3 GlobeDemocrat The sugar trust it is reporced has gone into actual operation The buying out and closing of small refineries hes begun and it is reasonable to suppose that the business wili scon be ia few and strong hands The sugar market is firm just now with the probability that it will be firmer a month or two hence It is per haps well that this combine has gone to work now rather than six months later Congress will soon be in session and if the gentlemen at the head of the scheme push prices up as they are ex pected to do legislation will be Invoked to stamp out the conspiracy A big con test between thp trusts and the people is inevitable If 3000 or 4000 individuals
