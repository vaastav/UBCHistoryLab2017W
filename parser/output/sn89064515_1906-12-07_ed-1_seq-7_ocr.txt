Thrss MeDonough County (III.) Banks Close Their Doors. Peoria, 111., Dec. 1.—Three banking Institutions in MeDonough county, conducted by C. V. Chandler of Ma­ comb, have been closed. The banks are: The Bank of Macomb, conducted by C. V. Chandler & Co., having deposits of $450,000 and capitalized at $50,000 the Chandler & Imes bank at Colches­ ter, capitalized at $25,000, having de­ posits of $200,000, and the Chandler & Smith bank of Bardolph, capitalized at $25,000, with $60,000 in deposits. The money has been invested in MeDonough county real estate. The Immediate cause of the suspension is given as a lack of ready cash. The Macomb bank was responsible for the payment of the bonds of the Macomb and Western Illinois Electric railway and when the bondholders demanded their money they badly embarrassed the three banks. The liabilities are upwards of $700, 000. ELEVEN PULAJANES KILLED. Chief of Band Escapes, but His Cap­ ture Is Certain* Manila, Dec. 1.—»A force of con­ stabulary under command of Major Murphy surprised the camp of Pablo, chief of the Pulajanes on the Island of Bamar, at daylight Nov. SO. Eleven of the Pulajanes were killed, the chief's son and nine of the band were wound­ ed. Chief Pablo himself esoaped, but his wife and daughter were captured. Clothing, arms and papers found were destroyed, together with the camp. The capture of Chief Pablo is consid­ ered the question of only a few days. There is now only one other chief at large and plans have been arranged to capture or kill him. Governor Curry of Samar wires that the breaking up of Chief Pablo's band signalizes the death knell of Pulajanism in the isl­ and. TEN DEAD. MANY HURT FATAL FIRE IN CROWDED SALVA­ TION ARMY LODGINGHOUSE AT ST. LOU 18. St. Louis, Nov. 29.—The Lighthouse hotel, a three story structure on the northwest corner of Ninth and Market streets, utilized as a Salvation Army barracks, was damaged by fire early In the day when probably 500 home­ less men were lodged within it. Ten lost their lives and probably thirty-five were injured, about half that number being seriously injured, some not being expected to live. Eight were burned to death and two died from injuries received from jumping from upper windows. Two others of those who jumped are lying uncon­ scious at the city hospital and are not expected to recover. The fire started on the third floor and swept through the whole building rapidly. The men fought at windows to secure lifelines and slide to the street, but so great was the frenzy with which the lines were seized and held that they were of no avail and those who could not escape by the stairway leaped from the windows. A large number of those who jumped were caught in nets, but many jumped before the nets were stretched and were Injured. There was but one stairway and the panic stricken men surged down this stairway to the' street only to find the door locked. A Jam resulted and probably a great loss of life would have occurred had not firemen promptly burst the door open, permitting the frenzied men to pour out into the street. PURCHASED FROM VANDERBILT. Big Block of Chesapeake and Ohio Stock Changes Hands. New York, Dec. 3.—Kuhn, Loeb & Co. of this city have purchased the 155,000 shares of Chesapeake and Ohio stock which has been held by the Pennsylvania Railroad company. An. nouncement to this effect was made at the firm's office here, but they de­ clined to give any details of the trans­ action. It is understood, however, that the stock was purchased for the Van: derbilt Interests, which now control a considerable amount of Chesapeake and Ohio stock. COAL FAMINE IN NEVADA. Great Suffering Follows in Wake of Severe Storm. Reno, Nev., Dec. 1.—Unless the fuel famine In Nevada Is broken imme­ diately suffering and sickness and perhaps death will follow in the wake of the storm which has raged for the past two days in Southern Nevada. Coal cannot be obtained in Goldfield or Tonopah and wood is bringing ex­ orbitant prices. Ties and telephone poles are being burned. The fuel famine extends over the entire state and even in this city coal cannot be purchased. FOILED BANDIT SUICIDES. /ries to Steal $6,000 From Bendenda (Kan.) Bank. Bendenda.

PEASANTS STARVING CONGRESS AT WORK MILLIONS OF RUSSIANS IN THE VOLGA DISTRICT IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. Crops In Seven Provinces Are a Total Failure and in Twenty Others the Harvests Are Very Poor—Estimated That Seventy-five Million Dollars I Wiii Be Needed to Relieve the Distress. St. Petersburg, Dec. 3.—Princes Lvoff and Orbeliani, the representa­ tives of the Moscow zemstvo famine relief organization, who have Just re­ turned from the stricken districts, have furnished the Associated Press with the following facts regarding the conditions in the famine provinces: 1 The crops in the seven provinces of Samara, Saratov, Sembirsk, Kazan, Penza, Tambov and Ufa were practi caliy total failures. In twenty prov-1 laces the harvests were very poor.' About 20,000,000 people will need as­ sistance for from four to ten months to stave off starvation until the new crops are available. Though affecting 18,000,000 persons the destitution is far less intense than it was in 1891. In some regions the inhabitants have been suffering from starvation for ten years, passible crops having been gath­ ered in only two of the ten years. Prince Lvoff believes the government estimate of $50,000,000 for famine re­ lief is inadequate. The Moscow zemst­ vo relief organization calculates that 175,000,000 and possibly more will be necessary. Though the conditions in the famine regions are now distressing far worse may be expected in January. The zemstvo organization funds will then be exhausted and the relief commit­ tees will be compelled to cease their efforts for the starving peasants. Prince Lvoff complained that the local offl-• cials, for political reasons, are inter­ fering with the establishment of soup kitchens and the rendering of medical assistance. He reported cases where petty func-' tionaries prohibited assistance being given to famine sufferers. Epidemics of hunger, typhus and scurvy, which usually began In February, already have appeared In three provinces— Tulla, Kazan and Samara. MUST REMAIN IN JAIL 8UPREME COURT DECIDES THE HABEAS CORPUS CASES OF MOYER AND OTHERS. "Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme court of the United States has de­ cided the habeas corpus cases of Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, the representatives of the Western Fed­ eration of Miners who are now held In prison In Idaho on the charge of com-! plicity in the murder of former Gov ernor Steunenberg, adversely to the men. The opinion was by Justice Har­ lan. The effect of the decision will be to continue to hold the men in con-1 flnement for trial in Idaho. 1 HEINZE'S GENEROSITY. Donates $100,000 to Depositors of De­ funct Bank. Butte, Mont., Dec. 1.—Receiver Wil son of the wrecked Aetna bank of Butte has announced that he received a check from Augustus Heinze for $100,000. Mr. Heinze formerly was president1 of the bank, but withdrew in 1903. Believing, however, that many depos­ itors had not known of his withdrawal, although it was widely advertised at the time, and that through confidence in his reputation many of his friends may have lost their money, Mr. Hteinze says in his letter to Mr. Wilson he contributes $100,000 towards the bank's assets and forwards his check for that amount. The contribution should increase the bank's assets 50 per cent.

President Sends Long List of Ap­ pointments to the Senate and Sev­ eral Resolutions of Inquiry Are In­ troduced Regarding the Discharge of Colored Soldiers of the Twenty- fifth Infantry. Washington, Dec. 4.—The Fifty ninth congress began its last session at noon. It took the senate fifteen minutes to arrange its preliminaries and the house an hour. The senate received from ll-esident Roosevelt a long list of appointments for its con­ firmation, and in an executive session of nineteen minutes decided that as the ncminations had been received be­ fore the body had been organized for­ mally to make no confirmations until the president's annual message had been received and the session fairly started. Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania and Foraker of Ohio came forward with resolutions of Inquiry regarding the discharge of the negro troops of the Twenty-fifth Infantry. One was addressed to the president and the oth­ er to the secretary of war. After the ripple of surprise had passed and Vice President Fairbanks, had suggested that it was unusual to transact any business until the president's message had been received, the resolutions "went over" by unanimous consent. Senator Dupont of Delaware took the oath of office. The opening of the two houses was witnessed by an animated throng, which filled the galleries to their ca­ pacity. Hundreds went away disap­ pointed in not gaining admission to witness the session of either senate or house. Not in years has a larger number of members-elect of the lower house of congress presented themselves at the speaker's desk to take the oath of of­ fice. Death has been unusually active among the membership during the closing days of the last session and the beginning of the present and Chap­ lain Couden feelingly called the atten­ tion of the body to the work of the grim reaper during the months since adjournment. Mann Appointed to Succeed Hitt. Speaker Cannon appointed Repre­ sentative James R. Mann of Illinois as a member of the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institute, vice Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, deceased. The galleries of the house were crowded at au early hour. The ab­ sence of flowers from the desks of the members was much commented on, but the order of the speaker prohibit­ ing the floral display was generally commended for its good sense. A similar rule was made in the senate two years ago. The routine work of the house Inci­ dent to the opening day was quickly dispatched, the roll call showing near­ ly 300 members present. Representative Bourke Coekran of New York, who recently married Miss Ide, was the subject of hearty laugh­ ter when his personal request that he be permitted to absent himself for an indefinite period on account of busi­ ness was laid before the house by the speaker. After the appointment of the usual committee to wait upon the president and inform him that the house was organized and ready to receive any communication he might desire to make of interest to the public service, the house adjourned out of respect to the memory of the deceased members. No bills were introduced in the sen­ ate. In the house there was 38 public measures and 350 of a private charac­ ter. TWO
