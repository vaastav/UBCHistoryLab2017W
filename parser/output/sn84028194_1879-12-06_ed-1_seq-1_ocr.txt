THE NATION. Animal Message of the President to Congress. Congratulates tlie Country on the Success of Ee-suinption. Recommends the Suspen sion of the Silver Dollar Coinage. of Leal Tenders, Civil Service Reform The Indian Prob lem Poiysramy Foreign Affairs. Et. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Repre sentatives; The members of the Forty-sixth Concrrees have assembled in their first regular session, under circumstances calling tor mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of Na tional prosperity wnicn we now enjoy. The most interesting events which nave occur red in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the Government directly affecting the business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on the successful execu tion of the resumption act At the time fixed In view of the facts that during a considerable genod. the Government of Great 15 n tain has een dealing with administrative nroblems and abuses, in various particulars analogous to those presented in this country, ana that in recent years the measures adopted were understood to nave been effective and in every respect highly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elabo rate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and tall of the parliamentary patronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elec tions. It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are com petitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have, with great advan tage, been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its prepara tion, and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the ex penses of the Commission, has been postponed ; until the present time. It is herewith trans mitted to Congress. While the reform measures of another Govern ment are of no authority for us. thev are enti tled to influence, to the extent to which their in trinsic wisdom, and their adaptation to our in stitutions and social life, may commend them to.our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concern ing the defects and abuses in our civil adminis tration remains unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan-spoils system of appointment to office and of office tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the message of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been minted ont and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are j i j.i . i i tt-:j i tne neaitnv existence or erreat Kf at nniM fn KinnA inevitable and essential in a tree State. . . . , . . . . . .

The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exenange for notes nas Deen very large. The excess of the precious metals depos ited or exchanged for United States notes over the amonnt of United States notes redeemed is about 40,000,000. THE RKSUMPTION.OF SPECIE PAYMENTS has been followed by a very great revival of busi ness. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are ena bled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and pioduction. The in creasing foreign demand for oar manufactures and agricultural products nas caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last to Novem ber 15, to the amount of about 59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the Govern ment bearing only four per cent, interest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to nv off all the National debt which was re. deemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually dv tne process or re funding the debt, since March 1, 1877, is Vll.fJi 177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums. and the number or our citizens now holding tne public securities is much greater than ever be fore. The amount of the National debt which matures within less than two years is &792.M1.- 700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing six per cent, interest. At is Deiievea tnat this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of four ner cent, bonds . and. bv the re duction of interest which will thus be effected, about eleven million of dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by tne united States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session.

When the neoDle have aooroved a nolicv at a National election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and of the advisers who, in accordance with our political institu tions. Bhould be consulted, in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, is indispen sable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official du ties. Very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the same, whatever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a conse quence, it follows that their tenure of office should not depend on the prevalence of any poli cy or the supremacy of any party, but should be determined oy their capacity to serve the people must useiuiiy. quite irrespective or partisan in terests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also nrevail in the ap pointment, discipline and removal of these sub ordinates. The authority of appointment and removal iB not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised in the puLlic interest, un der all the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for public par-poses. Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public service of his country. The only just ground of discrimina tion is tne measure ot cnaracter ana capacity he has to make that service most useful to the neo Dle. ExceDt in cases where, noon just and rec ognized principles, as upon the theory of pen sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as re wards for past services, their bestowal npon anv theory which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing pow er is held. In tne light of these principles, it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequate meanB.esoeciallv for every denartment. and Ihtoa aumimstrative omce. wnere personal discrim ination on the oart of its head ib not nracticahle. for ascertaining those qualifications to which ap pointments ana removals Bnouia nave rererencc.

The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the gen eral application of similar rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers, in the city of New York especially, bear decided testi mony to tne utility or open competitive exami nations, in their respective offices, showing that "these examinations. n.nd t.he excellent, mmliti. cations or those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon of the military commanders of the two Nations on each side of the Rio Grande, under the in strnctions of their respective Governments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly most destructive, have now almost who'lv ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to crossing tne border, witnout encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. The third installment of the award against Mexico, under the Claims Commission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of the act of Con gress providing for the same. The satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexi co, and an increased contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that country.

The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to November 1. 1879, was $5,770,404.12, of which $ 1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that neriod $4.- 674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year do not exceed the nrotior- tion for these four months, there will remain un expended, at the end of the year, $477,359.30 of the current appropriations.

That institution re flects credit upon the Nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present location would not only be conducive to the health of its officers and professors, but would greatly in crease its usefulness. THE APPROPRIATION FOB JUDICIAL EXPENSES, which has heretofore been made for the Depart ment of J ustice, in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was made for the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process or for the discharge of other duties; ana, since June 30, these officers have the persons previously in the service, and partic- assumed a new and important aspect, and is now continued the performance of their duties' ularly upon those aspiring to promotion.

It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship on their pan wui see tnat tne early prosecution or such a work will largely inure to the benefit not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that should the work be undertaken under the protective auspices of the United States, and upon satis- without compensation from the Govern ment, taking upon themselves the necessary 111- utiays, as well as rendering their own services. In only a lew unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the process of the united states railed by reason or the absence ox the requisite anbronriation. This course of offi cial conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their habitants of that Territory to the fall extent of the Executive power. Bat it would be un wise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused re sources, will be found more exposed to the repe tition of each attempts as happened this year, when the surrounding States are more densely settled, and the westward movement of oar popu lation looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory In its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore folly approve of the ad vice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual -title in fee, instead of their present tribal ownership In common, and to consider in what manner the bal ance of their lands may be disposed of by the Gov ernment for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure for them selves the value of their possessions, and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetu ate the present state of things in the Territory. Ihe question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the decision of that question, then In prospect, "would arrest farther agitation on this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect a Don the service as well as the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote in the House of Representatives.

There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments, and nai political activity, on the part of those thus ap- Sointed, wnicn not only interferes with the due ischarge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections.

Reasons of justice and public policy, quite analogous to those which forbid the use of offi cial power for the oppression of the private citi zen, impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies, for party purposes, upon the salaries of officers is highly demoraliz ing to the public service and discreditable to the country.

The market value or tne silver aonar Derag uniform ly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at rar with each other if both are coined without limit.

THE RETIREMENT FROM CIRCUIATION OF UNITED STATES NOTES. with the capacity of legal-tender in private con tracts, is a step to be taken in our progress to ward a safe and stable enrrencv. which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Gov ernment, and the interest and security of the oeoole. It is mv hrm conviction that the issue of leeral-tender naner monev based whollv unon the authority and credit of the Government, ex cept in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles.

THE ELECTIONS OlT THE FAST YEAR. though occupied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attended them all over the country new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of tne conntry towaras a more general and com nlete establishment, at whatever cost, of nniver. sal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics ot politi cal concern demand great attention from our neonle. both in the snhere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, tnat no itism If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the arnointment. and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him. it wouia seem ciear tnat a wise and jUHt method of ascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It has long since become impossible, in the great offices, for those having the duty of nomination and ap pointment to personally examine into the indi vidual qualifications of more than a small pro portion of those seeking office; and. with the en largement of the civil service that proportion must continue to become less. In the earlier vears of the Government the subordinate offices were so few in numVer that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and just exercise ox liic appuiutuig power. A large and responsible part of the duty of re storing the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests npon the President, and it is my yutijuDC iiu uu nuati xa niuuiu uijt yunci lAf ou- vance such prudent and gradual measures of re form as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exer cise of authority it is in the power of the Execu tive to do much to promote such a reform. But it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent support among tne people, fieiorma which challenge the generally accepted theories of parties, and demand changes in the methods of departments, are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles, and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors ot their adversaries. nvery worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his nountrv. but the neonle themnelven far more than their officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical and vigorous administration. Bv laws enacted in 1853 and 1855. and now in substance incoroorated in the Revised Statutes. the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades in the great departments was condemned, and exami nations, as to capacity, to be con ducted bv denartmental hoards nf ex aminers, were nrovided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. These stat utes are a decision bv Congress that examina tions of some sort, as to attainments and capaci ty, are essential to the well-being of the public service. The important questions since the en actment of these laws have been as to the char acter of the examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common rierht and merit, were to control the access to the ex aminations. In practice, these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons general ly ,who might wish to be examined. Official favor itism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates yery difficult to resist. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell be low that which the public interest demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a svstem which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common supervision or um- f us ion. inconsistency and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public inter ests. A further and more radical change was ob viously required. In the annual message of December. 1870. mv predecessor declared that there is no dutj which so much embarrasses the Executive anc heads of Denartments as that of aoDointments nor is there any such arduous and thankless la bor imnosed on Senators and Renresentatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, free as anv other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officer, it is a gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the pub lic funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or pnblic em ployment the protection with which a great and emigntenea nation snouia guara tnose wno are laitmui in its service. OUR 

RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still nnsettled questions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime nrovinces and the action of nrovineial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American nshermen. The umtea otates minister in ixrauon nas neen in structed to present a demand for 8 U 5,306.02, in view of the damages received by American citi zens at Fortune Bav on the 6th of Jannarv. 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration Dy the British Government, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion ot the necessary prelimi nary examinations, the subject of onr participa tion in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government with a view to an earlv and nermanent settlement of the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted Dy tne treaty or Washington.

Some correspondence has also occurred with regara to tne rescue ana Bavins ox iixe anu prop erty unon the lakes, which has resulted in im portant modifications of the previous regula tions of the Dominion Government on the sub ject in the interest of humanity and commerce.

The conditions imnosed. before allowing this con nection with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any exist ing or future lines of marine cable,and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire equality of rights to our Government and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the United States winch mav be projected and accomplished by our citizens.

The report was transmitted to congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the fol lowing favorable comment npon the labors of the Commission: i sustaiiieu oy congress, have no doubt the rules can, after the ex nerience trained, be so improved and en forced as to still more materially benefit lc service and relieve the executive, of Congress, and the heads of Depai lood a ,rfc- mentn. from influences prejudicial to good ad ministration.

If any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens they Bhould receive it promptly; and whatever may have been received by this Government in excess of strictly just demands, should in some form be returned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs.

The third article nf the treatv with Knnnia nf March 3-1, 1867, by which Alaska was ceded to the united states, provides that the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and nrn- tected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subjected to auch laws and regulations as the united oiates may rrom time to time adopt in recard to the aboriginal tribes nf that ennntrv. Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people, require that some or ganized form of government over the Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of nersons charered with common-law offences, nnch as assault, robbery, and murder, and no magis trate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not nnlv among the original inhabitants, but among citi zens of the United States and other countries. who have engaged in mining, fishing, and other business operations within the Territory.

He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending Bach legislation as will authorize the establishment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line of the armv. exclusive of the 3,463 men required for detached duty, and, there- tore, not available xor service in tne neiu. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the dUposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reser v&tinnn. which, thoucrh verv valuable in them. selves, have been rendered useless for military purposes Dy the advance of civilization and set tlement. He unites with the Uuartermaster-ueneral m recommending that an appropriation be made f nr the construction nf a chean and nerf ectlv fire-proof building for the sate storage of a vast amount of monev accounts, vouchers, claims. and other valuable records now in the Quartermaster-General's office, and exposed to great risk of total destruction by fire. He also recommends, in conformity witn tne views of the Judge-Advocate General, some de f.lfLTOtnrv legislation in reference to the militarv statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion. , . In these several recommendations 1 concur. The Kecretarv nf War further reports that the work for the improvement of the South Pass of the MississiDm River, nnder contract with Mr. I n I.'.. .1.. 1..

Tha nARfc vMr has been one nf almost unbroken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this Government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will prove permanently success ful.

NAVY shows continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditures of the year ending 30. 1879, including Bpecino appropriations timated tor by the uepartment, were q 710.09. The exnenses chargeable to the VI er deducting the amount of these specific appro priations, were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject tn a reduction nf $'283,725.99 that amount bav in been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17.

As no general election for members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of little practical importance.

In the courts of manv of the circuits, also, the hnsi. ness has increased to such an extent that the de lay ot justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arin. mg from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of questions of a public character.

THE 

REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER OENKRAT. bears testimony to the general revival of busi ness throughout the country. The receipts of the Postomce Department for the fiscal year enaea dune au, i, were $au,uu,9SZ-t, V7b4.4bD.91 more than the revenues ot the di mg year. The amount realized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes and postal cards, was Tib4.4bD.9l more than in the preced ing year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures ot the department were $33, 449.899.45, of which the Bum of $376,461.63 wai paid on kabilities incurred in preceding vears. The expenditures during the year were $801, 209,77 less than in the preceding year. This re duction is to be attributed mainly to the opera tion of the law passed Jnne 17, 1878, changing tne compensation ot .Postmasters from a com mission on the value of stamps sold, to a com mission on stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the Treasury on ap propriations in addition to the revenues of the Department was $3,021,454.93, being $2,276,197.86 less than in the preceding vear. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at S39 .929 .900. and the receipts from all sources at $32,219,000, leav ing a deficiency to be appropriated for, oat of the Treasury, ox ,Yiu,aw. The relations of the Department with railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstand ing the general reduction by Congress of their compensation, bv the aDDroDriation for special facilities, and the railway Post-office lines -have been greatly extended, especially in the South ern States. The interests of the railway-mail service and of the public would be greatly pro moted, and the expenditures cot dd be more readily controlled by the classification of the employes of the railway-mail service as recom mended by the Postmaster General, the appro priation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made in gress. The Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of the law regulating the increase or compensation for increased service and in creased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for. proposals for such in creased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the com merce of the country from the enactment of a general law authorizing contracts with Ameri can built steamers, carrying the American flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United States and ports of the West Indies and Hnnth America, and a fixed maximum Drice per mile, the amount to be expended being regu lated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the domestic star service. The arrangement made bv the Postmaster General and Secretary of the Treasury for the b: collection of duty upon books received in the mail from foreign countries, has proved so satis factory in its practical operation tnat tne recom mendatinn is now made that Congress shall ex tend the nrovisions of the act of March 3. 1879. under which this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in tne mails xrom xoreign countries.

The efforts made by THK DKPABTKKITV OF THK IKTIRIOR to arrest the depredations on the timber lands of ' the United States have been continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in the courts oi the unitea states; outers nave Deen set tled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of the prosecutions and settlements turned into the Treasury, far exceed In amonnt the sum appropriated by Congress for l ms purpose, a more important result, nowever, consists in the fact that the destruction of our pub lic forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, haB been greatly reduced In extent, and it improbable that if the present policy is vig orously punsueu aiiu siuucieui pnivuuuu vu uiai end is made by Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in the Territories where timber for the daily requirements of the population cannot,undet the present state of the law, be otherwise obtained. . I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Con gress to the recommendation made by the Secre tary of the Interior, that a law be enacted en abling the Government to sell timber from the puDiic lanas witnout conveying tnejee, wnere such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to con form to domestic wants and business requirements while at the same time guarding against a sweep in? destruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law appears to become a more pressing ne cessity every day. my recommenuauons in lonner messaires are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of , THK DEPARTMENT OF AGBICULTURK. Agriculture is the leading Interest and the per manent industry of our people. It is to the abun dance of agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely in creased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed fu recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We most look -for its continued mate-1 tenance to tne same suosumaai resource, mere is no branch of Industry In which labor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields such Increased production In comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which thee encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy ; but, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of Immense sums annually that might be ' saved through well-directed efforts by the Govern ment to promote this vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture is an earnest of what may be expected with Increased appropria tions for the several purposes indicated in the re port of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the Department upon a footing whl-.h will enable it to prosecute more effectively the object for which it is established. Appropriations are needed for a mora complete laboratory, for the establishment of a veterinary ei vision, ana a envision oi iorestry, ana ior an in crease of force. The requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report of the Commissioner under -the head of the immediate necessities of the Department, will not Involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now unaertaKe in tne interests oi agriculture. At is gratifying to learn irom THK

No more fundamental responsi bility rests upon Congress than that of clevis ing appropriate measures of financial aid to edu cation, supplemental to local action in the States ' and Territories, ana in tne mstrict oi uoiumoia.

Measures In ac cordance WHO tnis traaitionai policy xor tne ior- . ther benefit of all these Interests, and the exten sion of the same advantages to every portion of the country, it is hoped, will receive your favors ble consideration. To preserve and perpetuate the National litera ture should be among the foremost cares of the National Legislature. The library gathered at the Capitol still remains unprovided with any suitable accommodations for its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the collection, increased as it is by the deposits made nnder the law of copyngnt, oy aomestic ana xoreign ex changes, and by the scientific library of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building accom modations which shall ,. be at once ade quate and fire-proof. The location of such a public building, which should provide for the pressing necessities of the present, and for the vast increase of the Nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to the discretion of Congress. It. is earnestly recom mended aa a measure which should unite all suffrages, and whioh should no longer be de layed. The Joint Commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876, for the purpose of su pervising and directing the completion of the WASHINGTON NATION All MONUMENT, of whioh Commission the President is a member, . has given careful attention to this aaoject, and already the strengthening of the foun dation has so far progressed as to in sure the entire snooesa ot this part ox the work. A massive layer of 'masonry has been introduced below the original foundation, widening the base, increasing tne stability of the structure, and rendering it possible to carry the sbait to completion, it is earnestly recom mended that suoh further appropriations be made for the continued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national monument at an earxy oay.

The "Indian policy" sketched in the report of the cecretary of the In terior, the object oi wnicn is to maxe noerai pro vision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indian npon farm-lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certMin number of vears. and when their wants are thus proviaea ior, to aispose oy saie ox tne lands on tneir reservations not occupieu ami useu hv t.hnm a fnnd to he formed out of the Droceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of the expenses now pro vided for oy annnai appropriations, must com mend itelf as iust and beneficial to the Indians. and as also calculated to remove those obstruc tions which the existence of large, reservations presents to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the Government to ive Indians a title In lee, lnauenaoie ior twenty ive years, to the farm-lands assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation made in my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfac tory proof of having, by their own labor, supported their families fnr a number of vears. and wno are willing to detach themselves from their tribal rela tions, to tne oenent oi tne nomesieau act, auu tu grant them patents containing the same provision of inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of sending a number of Indian add to the adjacent lands and parka now owned by the United States a large and valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and will also, as an incidental result secure the permanent improvement of the river for the purposes of navigation. The Constitution having invested iongress with supreme and exclusive . jurisdiction over the lnstnot or uoiumoia, i citi zens must ot necessity loo it to jongresa alone for all needful legislation affecting their interests; and as the territory of ttus ms trict U the common property of the people of the United States, who. equally with its resident cit izens, are interested in the prosperity of their capital, I cannot doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voioe of the oountry in any measure yon may adopt for this purpose. I also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the pnblic schools of this , District, as exhibited in the report of the Com missioners. W hile the number of pupils is rap idly increasing, no adequate provision exists for a corresponding increase of school aocommoda--tion, and the Commission era are without the means to meet this urgent need. A number of the buUdings now used for school purposes are rented, and are, in important particulars, nn snited for the purpose. The cause of popular education in the District of Columbia is surely entitled to the same consideration at the hands of the National Government as in the several States and Territories, to which munificent grants of the publio lands have been , made for the endowment ox sonoois ana miiwwwm.
