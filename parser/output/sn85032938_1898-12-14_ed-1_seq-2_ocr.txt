L. Murray, for the sheriff's office of Maricopa couu ty. This congress could uot do a more popular thing thau to provide for the construction of the Nicaragua canal. The antis should not overlook one verv important fact; this country will not have tD keep the Philip pines, unless it wishes to do so. Mes-irs. Kee and Cbappell, who were formerly interested in tho Last Chance mine, near here, are in the big milk trust recently formed in Chicago, of which Farmor Joseph Leiter is a central figure. There is wisdom enough and com mon sene enough in the United States to settle satisfactorily far more difficult problems than are likely to arise in connection with the Philippines. The attitude towards the Philip pines, taken by President McKinley, in his message to congress, is not only that of a patriot, but that of a careful, count-the-cost, look-before- you-jump president. That it is the correct one, there can bo no doubt. Secretary Alger says in his annual report, of the war: "Ihis great achievement ;an not be credited to individuals; it belongs to the nation. Tt was accomplished through the in telligence and patriotism of all who served from the commander-in-chief to the private in tho ranks." Count Itsu, a Japanese nineteen years old, nas taken up n:3 aooue with the family of Col. W. J. Bryan at Lmcoln. and they cannot get rid of him. A custom preyalent in Japan allows a young man to solect a god father, and this count, who is very wealthy, selected Bryan. A Loudon telegram says that tbe press of that city express satisfac tion at President McKinley's mes sage to congress, with the exception of the allusion to the Nicaraguan canal, which to the minds of the editors does uot show a sufficient ap preciation of the British treaty rights. It ought to bo a consolation to those who are inclined to entertain doubts about our acquiriug the Phil ippines, that there are half aNdozeu nations which would gladly take them off our hands, at a big profit. Nations, like individuals, do not hanker after the possession of unde sirable property. Those dons find it pretty hard work for them to accept the inevit able of tho recent war. If they had taken two or three reefs in their pride, and had not put on such haughty airs prior to the opening of hostilities, they would find them selves in very much bettor condition now. Tho recommendation of the presi dent, in his message, to increase the regular army to 100,000 men, will meet with the approval of the pro gressive Americans, iuo new con ditions, resulting from the 3uban war, will require fully that uumber r f men, and he recommends that the volunteer army bo discharged as soon as tho regulars are recruited up to that, number. The volunteers, or the majority of them, are more than auxious to get out of the service, as their enlistment was for the purpose of fightiug aud not for garrison duty. ww j neaiTiiiurin of the bath depends largely on vltau'i.... of the bath tub.

The Crowned King mining com- Sany declared its regular monthly ividend on December 6. Crowo and Moutroso have leased the Bedrock mine in Peeples valley, also the Yarnell mill and have both in operation, making a success of both. Captain J. W. Lind, a veteran miner, is developing some excellent claims in French gulch near Placer itas. He has good ore from the grass roots down, some of it going as high as $100 per ton in gold. The Zonia mining company is tho name of a corporation which is oper ating in a very quiet way iu French Gulch, about twolvo miles from Kirkland station. So quietly have they gone about their work that their presence thero has been known to but few in the county outside of the immediate vicinity of them, al though they have been at work for nearly four months. They have se cured control by purchase and op tion of about twenty claims, and are already at work grading a site for a smelter aud for a new hoist, and are building a wagon road, erect ingoffi-,compauie8 of artiHery. An TELEfiRAPH NEWS Special to JoUBM.VL-lll.NEB.l HOW IT STARTED. Washington, Dec. 13. Senator Kyle.of South Dakota, is responsible for the story that a sale of the Phil ippines is in contemplation. The sonator had just come from the White House, whon he suggested a sale as a way out of the Philippine problem. Ho mentioned that he had beard Japan was willing to give $200,000,000 for the archipelago. As the senator was fresh from the pres ence of tho president, his suggestion of a sale was given undue import ance.

So far as known Colorado miners aer the first to seek the hidden treas ures supposed to be stored away in the Philippine islands. Joe Dyer, a veteran Colorado miner and pros pector of Cripple creek, and Chief Engineer Gonzales, late of tho Terror, United States navy, have formed a partnership and will op erate in Luzon district. Gonzales was formerly of the Philippine is lands, aud is confident of finding a fortune under Under States govern ment. Dyer just recently returned from Manila, where he went as a volunteer, but was afterward mus tered out. He bolieves Uncle Sam's new possessions to contain untold mineral wealth. Other miners will go later if reports continue good. The Jocknal-Miner has been in formed that Ralph Dillon, who re cently went to Scotland for tho purpose of placing some copper properties near Jerome has been successful and that he is now on his way home. The property is said to have been sold to a wealthy Scotch syndicate. Mr. Dillon retains an in torest iu the property and is to bo resident manager. The development of a pay body of mineral in this group means much to Jerome as part of the town is built on the sur face ground of the claims.

The conclusion of the coroner's jury, which held an inquest Decem ber 12 over the body of Engineer . ri. wade, who met bis death at the collision north of Prescott on Saturday last, is accurate and iusti fied by the evidence adduced before it, in so far as it states that the col lisiou was caused by the negligence of the conductor and the engineer oi tne extra, That part oi it whieh attributes negligence and blame to Train Dispatcher F. L. Parriott was not an unnatural conclusion for the jury to reach, the members thereof supposedly not being practical rail road men. The testimony through out from everybody, particularly Mr. Atkinson, the conductor of the shins and armv reservations and ' extra, was to the effect that the leer- posts by formal order, has been re- j ular train over the P. & E. road stored to favor bv an order of Secre-', bound for Prescott, known as No. . .

No change in the directors or officials of the company is to be made at tbe present time and the principal work of the meeting will be to discuss the matters connected with the Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Wade, each of them being furnished with cards and knowing the (schedule of that train That which misled the jury, as we think, was that after the train dis patcherhad given the conductor of the extra train his orders in writing to run between Prescott and Ash Fork, and the conductor had hand ed a copy of that order to Engineer Wade, some of the cars which were to form this extra train then stand ing on the mam track and in such a position as to have prevented the arrival of the regular train, which has the right of way over the track, the dispatcher did say to the con ductor substantially, "Want you to hurry up and get out of here." To a man not acquainted with railroad phraseology and the rules of the company that would seem to mean that the conductor and engineer were instructed to hurry up and start on their journey, whereas to a railroad man, who knew the rules of the company gave the regular train the right of way over the track, and who likewise knew from his card the exact time at which it was due, that language simply meant that thev were to hurry up. form their train and get their cars off the main track and out of the way of regular sched ule train. It did not either require or auth orize them to leave the railroad yard on their journey and they did not so understand iL The facts pro duced were, that immediately after the collision and as soon as Mr. At kinson saw the conductor of the other train and was asked by him what he was doing there, said, "Why, we simply overlooked you." j-uus ii win do seen, as before stated, that while the conclusion of tho jury is a natural one. it uniustlv reflects upon Mr. Parriott, as he did aim said notning that was unusual and he omitted nothing that his duty required.
