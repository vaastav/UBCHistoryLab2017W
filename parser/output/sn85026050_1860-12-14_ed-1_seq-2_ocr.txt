Indiana Banks Thrown Out. Indianapols of the 10th, says, the bankers of that city, had, on that day thrown out the following Free Banks of the state: Brookville Bauk.Brokville; Bank of Syra cuse, Syracuse; Bank of Indiana, Michigan City; Indiana ReserTe Bank, Kokomo; Fayette coun ty Bank; Bank of Connersrille; Iloosier Bank, Logansport. So look out. Obtaining their Rights. A certain class of politicians at the South who profess to be Union men, say that they shall en deavor "to obtain their rights in the Union I" What rights? Have they not just as many rights now as they have ever had in tho Government? Have any rights been taken from them that they have heretofore enjoyed? or does any one pro pose to interfere with any rights they now pos sees? We suspect there is a spice of the doma gogue adhering even to them. If not, why do they not come out manfully like the Republi cans, and say "the Union must and shall be pre eerved, and that every State shall have supreme control over her own domestic institutions, with cut the interference of any other State or States?1 A straight-forward, manly action is what is now wanted on the part of all "Union men." If lightning does not strike every Republican that may attempt to give the South more power than she now has under the Constitution, the people will. So stand from under. Conciliation. They have a queer way of conciliating the bad feeling on the prrt of tho South against the North in sonic of the Southern States. For in stance, at Memphis the other day the "Vigi lence Committee in that city came across a man from Ohio, whom they immediately took into custody, headed him up in a barrel, and then rolled the barrel down the bank into the Mississippi, and that was the lust of him. No other charge was brought against the man than .that he was from the ".North." Again, boats puwing down the Mississippi, known to belong to the Free States, the slave drivers along the shore amuse themselves by .' firing into the windows of the cabin with flieir rifles. All along the river strangers are asked where they are from, and if they say "North," they are ordered forthwith to leave. Slavery is producing a worse despotism in the Southern States, than prevails in any -country in the World. An American can travel through any country in Europe with safe ty, and even through the wilds of Arabia and Africa, bat here, in the land of his birth, where a common language prevails, if born North of Mason and Dixon's line, it is all his life is worth to venture into any of the Slave States of this Union. And yet we find men in the North who are in favor of permitting the Slave holders, who do not exceed 50O,UO0 all told, but a few more than there are voters in Ohio, to go into our free Territories wuh uioir ut'groes, aim to luusexieua this system of despotism. And it is expected that Republicans will assist in some new Com promise whereby slavery will be strengthened, .ana ine Aona numuiaiea ana uisgracea. "Democratic money," is becoming more plcn ty every day. All the Illinois' solvent banks are 15 per cent discount, and a number of the Indiana and other Western States, ditto. This Is caused by the fact that the notes of these bonks are principally secured by Stocks of Dem i ocratic States, and as they are threatening to go out of the Union, of course their Stocks are be coming comparatively worthless. . J ho more "Democratic money" comes in vogue, the less will the farmers receive for their Wheat, Corn, Oat, Pork, etc. Sandusky county alone will lose thousands of dollars on produce this year, all of which is caused by the acts of the Demo cratic party. ' A Washington telegram has this interef- 4ing information : r- -"Members from Virginia. Maryland, and sever 1 from Kentucky, boldly declare that nothing short of a disbanding of taa Republican party can arrest a ibaaolution (he Union.

' The Homestead Hill. A wi last session at Congress n Home stead Bill, which did ''not ' directly -donate the public lands, but required a payment of 10 for 160 acres, was reported by the Com tnittee on Agriculture, and referred to tbe Committee of the Whole. The motion was made to reconsider tbe vote, which mo tion was pot. disposed , of before adjourn , On Monday last, at the opening of the session, Mr. Grow, of Pa., called up Ibis mo tion,' On Wednesday, it motion to lay Mr. Crow's motion 00 tbe table wss lost, (53 gainst 125, and the rote was reconsidered. After slight discussion the bill passed 133 to 78.

The &cw York Tribune, in an article speaking of those timid Republicans who are o terribly frightonod at the threats of the secessionists that they propone to back down and make another compromise with the South, and to thus destroy the e fleet of our triumph, says they had better re read and ponder some encouraging passages in the speeches made by Gov. Seward dur ing bis Western lour last Fall. As a spe- cimen of the clear ring of those golden gems, wo give a soon exiraci ifora nis speech at St. Paul. We give the italics as printed in the 'Evening Journal Tracts.' "Fellow citizens, either in one way or the other, whether you agree with me in at tributing it to the interpotition of Divine Providence or not, thte battle hat been fought, thit victory hat been toon.

For the fret time in the history of the Republic the Slave Tower has not even the power to terrify or alarm the Freemen to as to make him submit, and scheme, and coincide, and compromise. It rails now with a feeble voice, as it thundered in our ears for tweuty or thirty years past. With a fcoblo and muttering voice they cry out that they will tear the Union to pieces.

And what is more, tbo temper of this extract is the tem per of tho great body of tho Republican party. Gentlemen who forget this will probably bo reminded of it hereafter. Senator Wade. Tho Correspondent of tho Cincinnati Commercial, reports Senator Wade as chaf ing like a lion under tho talk of conciliation and compromise. We copy tho following : "lie savs, "if the President denied the right of secession, why didn't he hold his tongue and quietly transfer troopstoCharles- ton, where, if it should hnve proved neces sary, he could have used the m without dis turbing the nation ? It would have been merely changing the soldier's boardinp;- hnilftfk. And if Amilh (!urnlinft Karl Iw.on iiiouijitrvcr ight have been given which she would hnve readily com prehonded." Ho is bitter npon tho course of tho South toward Northern men in hor jurisdiction, saving that "if the British should bang a Yankee because he is a Yan kee, thcro would bo war in two hours; but tho South hangs scores of mon, and they beg us to conciliate them." Ho is willing todo every thing that is right, but will sub mit to nothing wrong. V lion secession comes up in tho Senate, "Old Ben Wada" will "talk out in meetin." Electoral College of Ohio. Tho Ohio Electors met at Columbus on Wednesday, of last week, as the law directs, and organized by appointing Wm. K. Up ham of tho Second Congressional District, as Chairman, and II. S. Brady of the Tenth District as.Sccretary. Thereupon, Hon. J, M. Root, and Fred. Hassaurek, were ap pointed tollers; and tho votes of all tbe Electors wero cast for Lincoln and Hamlin. Joseph Ankcny of tho Fifteenth District was selected as Messenger, to bear the re turns to Washington, and tho Collogo ad journed sine die. Report the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior has made a full and interesting report. Of the Pub lic Lands 12,000,033 acres have been dis posed of, 3,077,610 being sold for cash, yielding 12,021,425; 2,605,022 have been absorbed under the railroad grants, and the rest in bounty land warrants and the swamp grants. Over a million of dollars havo been expended in the payments of pensions during tbe last year.

Tbe Balti more Patriot says that no such major or regiment belongs ia tbo city. Gov. Seward's Criticism. Gov. Seward haa the credit of the most pun gent and concentrated criticism mado on the Prenident's late Heaaage. He is reported to have said: " " Tie ' President has established two things that a State mav aot secede, unless it wanU to; and, in cww of seouwum, it would be the duty of tbe riemdeut to enforce toe laws 11 bo body ob jected." . The Louisville Courier pronounces the Pres ident's reniarka about the immediate peril of ser vile insurrection, "an unpardonable mistake." The Courier says: "Mr. Buchanan knows nothing himself of the practical workings of slavery, aud has been de ceived into the axMertion which equally exagger ates the bad conduct of the North and the weak ness of the South." ' " : Scene in the Senate. The Cincinnati Commercials tolegraph, correspondent gives a scone in the Senate as follows : Washinotoh, Deo. 6. ; On motion concerning the rofcrence of the President's message, Lnne, of Oregon, made an apology for tbo dissolution of the Union, saying it must dissolve unless the rights of llio South are further guaranteed. Hale of New Hampshire said the logic of tb is controversy was war or submission. TIia minnrifv imiiuI aulimil Irt tliA mninrito Uomnda nohtjRl Rnd ,poko miAJx i,RV. ,nR consulted anybody ; he spoke for liini self only, and one little State.' "Wo must look this matter straight in tbe face .Drown, of Miss., desired to know if Hale presented the issue of war or Submission. Hale said it must lead to that, lie made no threat. Brown replied slornly : "Wo will not sub mit, and if it is war, lot it come on, and God show the right. Iverson of Georgia was quiet at first, but haughty in the end. He accepted the Presidents declaration that secession is rev olution. "The Statos understand thoy do it at tho poril of consequence. lie did not believe it would lead to war, but if it does tho South is preparing to welcome its enemios with bloody hands to hospitnblo graves. He hoped there would bo no war; that wo would live 10 peaco, Tho South would regard the North among the most favored of nations, and so treat hor, but to remain in the Union she would not. No power on earth could prevent her withdrawal. The repeal of all the personal liberty bills in tho North would bo in vain. "True" they aro obnoxious, but wo care noth ing for their practical operation. l?ut wo know their existence snows tlio tocling ot the people. They indicate two distinct civilizations. Tho hatred of tho North for tho South is as deep as bell, and I tell my brethren on the floor that there is no love lost between us. Two hostile nations oc cupy this -oor. We are enemies, iiiey did not come across this floor to extend to us ordinary civilities yesterday, nor did we go to them. We are hostile, lho atato I represent accepts the issue of war or submission." Wo will not submit, 1 tell the gentlemen Carolina will not go alone. Florida, Ala bama, Mississippi and Georgia will all be out by January 16tb, ncvor to return; and in less than twelve months nfter our gov ernment will bo in operation, Arkansas and Louisiana will follow. One thing only pre vents Texas that is her Governor and if ho docs not yield to tho overwhelming pub- he sentiment somo loxan lirutus will reach his heart and rid the world of a vilo and hoary-headed traitor." Mr. Ivcrson discarded nil shams, saying that lho election of Lincoln was no cause for secession, but the South would not be governed by tho North, and intended to go out while sho had strength, not wait till she was too weak. Douglas snt scowling in his seat; South ern men looked cool. Tho Northern men were calm and collected. Crittenden was profoundly moved, and tho galleries were astounded. Jeff. Dnvis, in a quick, decisive way, said he camo as a Senator of the United States. While there is yet no dec- '" rfltlon ' 'Tnr acfamstjL no states ot wuicn we are tho mere embassadors, lie woiild dis charge his duty as Senator, and would say nothing on the subject. Wigfall talked Sonators out of their seats, but ho said ono good thing. Ho said that ho disagreed with Hale; that Senator said the President's message was noither one thing nor the other. Wigfall thought it both ono thing and the other. Saulsbury, of Delaware, made an earnest and eloquent plea for tho Union, which was received with thunders of applause in tho galleries. Ho said Delaware was tho first to go into tho Union and would bo tho last to go out. She would use all her power to preserve the Uniop. The disunion speeches were received in profound siloncc. Let the South Look Out for Its Cotton. The Paris Moniteur publishes a report to tho Emperor by M. Gtieti Menevillo, on the result of the works undertaken by the Em peror's orders for introducing into France and Algeria tho breeding of a silkworm, procured from China, producing a very strong silky matter, which fur ages past has been used to mako ft material tor tho clothing of the poorer clashes in that coun try. Ihe experiment has been exceedingly successful, and the reporter is sanguine of tbe now silkworm producing, in the course of a few years, suflicieut silk to furnish the clothing of the working classes of Franco, to tho exclusion of cotton, which now forms the staple of the apparel of tho working population. Let Louisiana Look Out for her Sugar. A compiled statement of Mr. R. Chain pomier of tbe sugar crop of Louisiana shows that "the total product of that State, from 1834 to 1858 inclusive, a period of twenty-five years, was 4,014,709 hogsheads, valued at $248,139,260; and that of this quantity the Atlantic ports took 1,485,653 hogsheads, and tho Western States 2,314, 454 hogsheads." It should bo remomberod that the sugar crop of Louisiana is fully protected by a duty on foreign sugars of twenty-four por cent., and should she secede, her great crop would bo brought into direct competition with- the sugar crop of tho Wost India islands, with which sho never yet has been able to compete without such protection. Under such circumstances, can she afford to sacrifice, by secession, such great and im portant interests, and lay her plantations waste at the "beck and bid" of South Carolina! N. T. Post.

This is an unprece dented achievement, ' From Washington. Washington, Dec. 10. There now seems no doubt but that Mr. Coob has resigned tho Secretaryship of the Treasury. His frionds say ho will prepare I to go to Georgia on lhursday, he being n candidalo for member of tho State Conven tion, which is to assemble on tho 7th of January. Ho did not attend the throe last Cabinet meetings. Washington, Dec. 11. Mr. Branch, of N. C, has doclinod tho Secretaryship of the Tronsury. Uon. bcott has prepared a plnn for tho adjustment between tho North and South, which the Comtiulloo of J htrtv-lhree do- sire to havo heforo them. The Committee organized to-day the members from Ar kansas Horxlaand South Carolina declining to appear. Mr. Houston, of Alabama, nrgod prompt action, and freely expressed tho opinion that tho committee might ndrpt a roamrt which will restore Union feeling at the bo 11 tli and nvcrt secession. The com mittee nfter organizing, adjourned until to-morrow. 1 The Times' Washington correspondence says: Mr. I rescott, bearer of the Presidents Message to South Carolina, was also charged with the duty of consulting tho Stato au thoritfos as to their purposes after the or dinance of secession was passed. Ho re turned last ovening, and reports everything quiet, and no danger of a collision with the Federal Government. To day tho arrangement is perfected, and things remain in statu quo until after the commissioners shall have failed to arrange for a peaceable separation. Secretary Thompson will soon follow Mr. Cobb. Ho entered his ofllco to-day, but did nothing moro than to look over a fow letters on his table. Secretary Cobb has at last resigned, but his successor has not yet been nominated, although rumor says differently. One report is that Mr. Gulhrio has been named, and another that Mr. Unit takes the Tronsury, and Hon. L. O. R. Branch takes the Post Ofllco Department. Slill another rumor is that Mr. Schcll goes into the Cab inet. A messenger from South Carolina ar rived to-day, bringing the vole of that Stato for President for tho ensuing four years. Ho delivered the vote and drew the pny for his services. Tho Herald's correspondence says: Mr Buchanan has tendered tho office of Sec retary of the Treasury to Mr. Guthrie, ex Secretary of tho Treasury under President Pierce, and he has accepted by telegraph. My authority is of so high a character that I cannot doubt the report. The World says, it seems accredited that P. M. General Holt will bo transferred to tho Treasury, and Mr. King, now First As sistant, will bo made P. M. General. Eins tus Corning is also named ns tho successor of Cobb. Messrs. Miles, Bonham, and McQueen called upon tho President to-day, niui had a long consultation with him in regard to tho secession of South Cnrolinn, and tho terms upon which she will go out of the Union. Tho business of lho Treasury was entirely suspended to-day, as the President did not commission Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cobb's assis tant, to fill the office temporarily, as before. 1 Ins omision is considered significant. . Roverdy Johnson, who has just returned from California, declares himself for Union, at all hazards nnd against all opposition. lho Post Oilico Commit teoot the House met this morning to consider an Overland Mail bill, submitted to them by Mr. Colfax, Lnnirman.

The bill is to bo ro- partcd to the House this week. lho secretary of tho jtaw, Mr. loucey, was to-day requested by tho President to act as Secretary of the Treasury, in addi tion to his present duties, until a succossor to Mr. Cobb shall bo appointed. Mr. Cobb formally took leave of the President. Tho interview being pleasant and of a private character. Tho House Union Committee held their first meeting to-day and organized. The Democrats from the Northwest have had several conferences relative to the pros- ent condition of political affairs. They generally take the position set forth in Messrs. McClernand and Vallandigham's speeches yesterday, viz that the Union can not bo dissolved peaceably; that the North weot will under no circumstances consent to be cut off from tho Gulf of Mexico, and the city of Now Orleans; and that the Government, whatever may be its faults, is of inestimable value. Tbe leading idea is a central govern ment, embracing the middle, western, and border slave Stales, but depending for its consummation upon future circumstances. Lieut. Lien; bcott will arrive bero to-morrow. The bill which passed the House yesterday authorizing ten million of Treas ury notes, gives power to the becretary of tho Treasury to sell thorn at the market rates, as the wants of the Government may require; the bids to bo invited by a notice of ten days. No Prater for Rbolliom. Alluding to the prayer offered by Rev. C. P. Gadston, at Charleston, on raising the Palmetto flag, a correspondent of the New York Courier and Enquirer relates tho following: 'When young I lived in Hartford at the lime of the Hartford Convention and the prayer of Mr. Gadston reminded me of tbe Kev. Philander Chase, whowas Presby ter of Christ Church at that lime. The first act of the convention was the appoint ment of a committee to wait on the clergy of the city, inviting them to pray with the convention alternately. They called on Drs. Strong and Flint, and tho Baptist cler gyman, who answered affirmatively. And then they called on Mr. Chase. To appre ciate his answer you should have seen tbe man rising, with his gigantic form, with a head like Gabriel's. He said: "Be pleased to bear my respects to the President of the convention, and say to him tho Church has furnished me with no form of prayer countenancing rebellion."- 1 bis man became Bishop of Ohio aud Illi pois, and founded two colleges." The Kansas Troubles. The Chicago Trihiino says it has been informed on good authority that Capt. Montgomery has not been away from his farm, except on peaceful errands, for a year, and that all dituibances in Southern Kan sas, whatever they havo amounted to, were committed by Jonuisoii, and sixteen men as sociated with him, nnd that thoir move ments had been confined to tho summary arrest and execution of three of the kidnap pers and desperadoes. The special Kansas correspondent of tho N. Y. Tribune confirms this view. Tho old fogy Judge Willinms fled precipitately, on thn first intimation of possible danger to his.jinlicial bones. See what a picture this coi respondent draws of the official. Tho Courts of ibis iinhocilo old fogy aro a mockery of injustice. God pity the peo ple that ho is sent to rule over. Tho law yers know his weak points and unmitigated egotism, and stroko him on the back, nnd flatter him, and ono that can do it host gaines his case, whether ho has juslico on his sido or not. Wyandot County used to bo included in his district, but suffering un der the galling yoke of his imbecility, and tho great uncertainty of sooing juslico ad ministered in his Court, they petitioned and lobbied the Legislature, and got trans ferred to Judge Pottil's district a first-rnte Judge, and I hope Lincolon will keep him in ns long as wo are in Territorial vassalage; also tho name of Judgo Elmore; but this old fogy Williams is the greatest nuisance in the Territory, except tho U. S. Pre emption law, which is the greatest of all nuisnncs. Williams's Court puts mc in mind of tho rich old farmer out West, whose daughters all married drunken, worth less husbands. Ho said tho devil owed him a great debt, and had paid him all off in sons-in-lnw. Buchanan owed South Kan sas a grent. debt, aud has paid it off in a District Judgo. A Domestic View of Secession. The Now York Times gives an extract from a private letter from a lady in South Carolina to her uncle in New York. The letter says: I shudder for the wives and mothers, sis ters and babes of South Carolina, as I con template the immediate future of the Stato. You noccl not bo surprised at any timo to see mo and the children in your midst, for no argument could indnco me to remain hero longer than I should bo compelled to, if tho worst should como to lho worst. Wo tretnblo in our own homos in antici pation and expectnncj' or what is liable to burst forth nt any moment, a negro insur rection. Not a night passes that we do not, only securely lock our held servants 111 their quarters, but our most loved and val ued bouse servants, who in ordinary times wo would trust to any extent, arc watched and guarded against with all tho scrutiny and caro wo possess. Our planters and owners of slnvo property do not allow our servants to havo any intercourse with eacli other, nnd tho negroes aro confined strictly to tho premises where they belong. We aro all obliged to increase onr force of overseers to prevent too free intercourse even among our own servants. Tho negroes feel and notice these now new restraints, and naturally ask "Why is this? But it is unnecessary for them to ask the question, for they all comprehend tho causo as well ns we who own them. They have' already learned enough to give them an idea of what is goin on in the State'and nation, and this knowledge they have not gained from Abolitionists as some suppose but from the conversation of their owners indirectily held in their presence. They havo already hoard of Lincoln's election, and have heard also that he is for giving them their liberty, and you may imagine tho result. My husband has but a few servants I believo but thirty-one all told still I feel, (Hnd so does he) that thcro aio thirty-one too many in such times as these. Ho would sell them immediately, if it were possible, but lho truth is he could realize nothing for them at present, or nt most not even half their real value. Slaves aro a drug in lho market. Now, one word ns to tho military of tho Stato, to protect us against an insurrection. I presume, with the exception of Charles ton, nnd perhaps a fow largo towns, that the remainder of the Stale is situated very much as wo are here; and I will givo you an idea of how woll prepared we are to re sist a mob. Upon our place of about 1,200 acres wo hnve: of whites, ninlos husband, two overseers and my son f 18 years; total, four; females self and cousin, littlo Lucy and ono of tho overseers wife four; of whom only four at most are capable of bear ing arms to offset which wo havo at least seventeen field hands sturdy young ne groes besides the -female servants. And this is a fair representation of tho forco upon our plantations. Considering such a state of facts, do you blame me for desiring to absent myself, my husband nnd children from the Stato f North and South-The Difference Practically Set Forth. In the Sixth avenue is a grocer who is doing a good business by attending to his own affairs; and who, regularly as tho elect ion comos around, votes lho republican tick et. One of his customers, a native of the sunniest part of tho sunny South, where tho Palmetto waves and persimmons aro tho commonest product, but who is a resi dent of this city, was in his establishment a few days since. The conversation was upon tho late election and its results; when the latter, after some declaration, proceeded to consign the President elect, tho Republi can party, and each aud every member of it, to that undiscovered country recently and specially brought to public attention by "galorious Dick Bustoed," in his cele brated Staten Island baranguo. The grocer withstiodhis farrago for somo lime, but finally his pHtience wax exhausted. Stepping out before his counter, he address ed tho oilier: "Mr. A., suppose that I, a Republican, as you know, should be now in your native City of Charleston, and should make use of such language, and express sentiments as adverse to secession and seces sionists, as you do to the Republican party, what would those who heard me do to me!" "Cut your heart out, hang yon to the nearest lamp post, and serve you right," an swered this scion of "the finest chivalry in ibo world." "Woll," replied tho grocer, "we are not. so blood-thirsty up hero at tho North. We only kick our insullers off our premises." Suiting tho action to tho word, ho seized Mr. A. by the collar, whirled him round so as to face the door, and applied the ener getic t a tergo, forcibly ejecting him from the premises, and illustrating the difference between Northern aud Southern customs. jv. r.

Pay your Debts. The Mahoning Gazette says a timely word, ns follows: "In these times of financial depression, every man who hns tbe money, or can raise it in any way, should promptly liquidate his obliya tiniis. To refuse or neglect to do so nt any time, would be wrong, but now such neglect or refusal is a double or inexcusable wrong. One dollar set in motion may pay fifty times that amount of debt in a very few days. Again we say, pay your obligations, and, above all, don't forget to liquidate that little stun due to tho newspaper man, who gives you such wholesome advice, VTild game is abundant. We have noticed a number of deer in market within the past two weeks. They tiro bought and shipped to the New York market. It is said that wild turkeys are quite liunierous in the woods north and west of Fremont. Tho C jim Company are setting up street lamp 1 Front street. posts on 1 There is a bill before 1 lie Georgia Legislature fining any Georgian $0,000 who shall sell a bale of cotton to any one north of Mason k Dixon's line, An exchange saysr "A little incident trnns- lired some weeks ngo, at one of our Frankfort lutein, which is woi thy of notice. "A little girl entered the bar-room, and in pitiful tones told the keeper that her mother had sent her there to get eight cents. 'Eight cents,' said the keep er. 'Yes, sir.' 'What does your mother want with eight, cental I don t owe her anything. 'Well,1 said the child, 'father spends all his imm ey for rum, aud we have had nothing to cat to day. Mother wants to buy a loaf of bread.' A loafer remarked to the bar-keeper to "Kick the brat out.' No, said tho keeer, I'll give her the money and if the father comes back again I'll kick him out.
