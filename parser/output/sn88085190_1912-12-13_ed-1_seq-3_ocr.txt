IN STREET APPAREL Much Importance Attached to Outdoor Costume. Draped Effects Are Accorded the Most Popularity by the Leading De signers—Waist Line a Matter of Individual Choice. NEW YORK. —Just now and tor another month to come the prin cipal interest in clothes centers around street apparel, and cer tainly is an important feature in dress to appear well gowned in pub lic but the smart dresser never neg lects the frocks to be worn in the house, for she realizes how telling it Is to be becomingly and distinctively gowned in one's own Home, writes Laura R. Seiple in the Chicago Rec ord-Herald. Therefore the first con siderations in dress are the street costumes and the evening gowns, and after these difficult problems are ac complished, then attention can be turned to fascinating house gowns. This does not mean the matinee or negligee, but the tea gown, which to day finds quite as elaborate and every whit as expensive, if not more so, than the fashionable dinner gown, and often in many respects it is very similar. Many of the world's renowned de signers have gone over to draped ef fects for street wear; indeed few of the European houses have turned out anything but draped styles of one kind or another. And in many of the great establishments the normal waist line and even the elongated waist line re ceives much attention, but the raised waist line is by no means discarded, and many sumptuous models are Bhown with decidedly short waist. On street rostumes the ceinture is in dicated by a false girdle or belt, which in many instances furnished the deco rative feature of the coat. All sorts of original ideas are thus expressed, and with excellent results. Sometimes the lengthened waist line is suggested in the same way. White Velvet for the Street. One of the handsomest street cos tumes brought out by one of New York's importers who has copied and idealized a large number of exclusive models, is a gown very simple in line, yet superlatively gorgeous, being made as it is of wnite velvet. The silhouette of the model is similar to those which have been familiar during the past year, cut straight back, the left side closes over the right in a rounded corner, leaving the slightly plaited underskirt in view at the bot tom. Ornato white buttons set with a single brilliant hold the corner in place. In the front a cleverly arrang ed white satin sash starting from un der the front of the Medici collar and falling down the left front of coat and skirt to the knee. The scarf is held flat by rtraps of velvet and small but tons. Indications point to an unprecedent ed year of velvet. Velvets of all kiDds are popular, but the brocades and embossed patterns are the novelties most prized, and lovely effects are be ing developed with them. The em bossed velvet designs on chiffon or messaline or on metallic gauze are particularly beautiful and lend them selves charmingly to drapery effects. A great deal is being done with black velvet embossed on cloth of gold and blue on cloth of silver. Some won derfully gorgeous gowns in these su perb brocades, combined with plain velvet are being exhibited at the smart houses, and so well are the em bossed fabrics taking that it is al most impossible to obtain even short lengths of the choice patterns in the Bhops. One-Tone Effects Popular. Taupe one-tone effects are extreme ly popular in these delectable mate rials, and some of the smartest after noon gowns are developed in taupe t embossed messaline madeup *ith plain taupe velvet or satin and Heved by' cascades of lovely soft The various taupe shades are isingly effective and generally tooming. but often relieving colors ■c employed with taupe, certain !2des of red or old rose being the successful.

All the shades of brown are sought except those in intensely dark dyes' Navy blue is always smart, but un less it is in some soft material the ef fect is apt to be hard and old, and this is the case with whipcord and serge. A lovely new tone called mole brown is attractive in all the modish woolen stuffs, and there are some very charming models in such color and materials.

In the same exhibit with this ex cellent model was another gown worthy of mention. This was In a beautiful shade of brown and was fashioned of heavy chiffon and moire. There was a full underskirt of the chiffon having a drapery of the supple lustrous moire forming the lower part of the skirt and running up at the left front to the high waist line. This treatment allowed the underskirt of full chiffon showing in a sort of pan nier at the left side, while on the right side the chiffon was draped. The sides of the bodice and sleeves were of chiffon and the moire was employ ed in the plain bodice front. A line of dark fur trimmed the sleeves, neck and bottom of the skirt. Three-Plece Suits. As the season advances more inter est is shown in three-piece suits, says the Dry Goods Economist, especially styles which show a coat made of vel vet or novelty cloth and the dress de veloped in broadcloth, pfcau de souris, zibeline or similar materials.

TAFT PRAISES DIPLOMACY Message to Congress Denies Aims Are Purely Material. Washington, D. C—A note of warn ing to European powers which by in direct means continue to discriminate against American trade; a strong ap peal to the congress to uplift the great foreign policies of America above mere questions of partisanship; a triumphant vindication of the diplo macy of the administration, which is characterized as that of "dollars ver sus bullets"; a masterful pride in the enormous expansion of American trade as a result of the foreign poli cies t f his administration; and an ear nest appeal for joint action by con gress and the executive to open new markets for American industries— these are the more striking features of President Taft's fourth annual mes sage sent to congress Tuesday. The message is the first of a series of such communications which he will send to congress in the early days of the session, and deals entirely with the foreign relations of the United States. Beginning with the usual re ference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the President adds that these have been strengthened by "a greater insistence upon justice to American citizens, or interests, wherever it may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other relations." For the first time in its history, says the president, the State depart ment has obtained substantially the most-favored-nation treatment from all of the countries of the world. Therefore, he says that it is only nat ural that competitive countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning: "If in some instances the measures taken by them to meet it are not en tirely equitable, a remedy should be found." To this end, the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the government instead of imposing the full maximum rates of duty against discriminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to the maximum of 25 per cent. "Flat tariffs are out of date," says the president. "Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, irrespective of the treatment from them received. It is very necessary that the American gov ernment should be equipped with weapons of negotiation and adapted to modern economic conditions." The State department, "an archaic and inadequate machine" at the be ginning of this administration, the president says, has become a new or ganization, with highly specialized bu reaus and experts dealing with every phase of American trade and diplo macy. 

PEACE PROTOCOL IS SIGNED Greece Alone Refuses to Comply— Quarrels With Bulgars. London—A Vienna dispatch to the Daily Telegraph says that official quarters there have received informa tion that dissensions between the Greeks and Bulgarians have become serious and that 250 Greeks were killed when 3000 of their troops at tempted forcibly to occupy the town of Serres, which was already occupied by Bulgarians. London —The protocol arranging an armistice was signed late Wednesday by the Turkish and Bulgarian dele gates, the latter representing also Servia and Montenegro.

Prior to this there had been a long sitting of the Turkish council of ministers to consider fresh proposals submitted by the allies. Apparently the Greek delegate did not sign the protocol. At present nothing is known definitely on this point or of the terms of the armistice as revised. Germany Wants Aerial Fleet. London —Reports that India is giv- ing Great Britain 12 warships, accord ing to the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express, is responsible for the remarkable proposal of Germany, abandoning her effort to control the sea for an attempt to win supremacy of the air. The National Zeitung pro poses a fleet of a hundred Zeppelins, divided into 25 squadrons of four each, which, while the cost is only as much as one dreadnaught, could eventually destroy England's fleet. The proposal is endorsed throughout Germany. Russian Must Not Help Chinese. St. Petersburg—The plans of Avia tor Kusminski to open a flying school in Pekin to teach the art of aviation to Chinese army officers were halted by an order from the Russian govern ment warning Kusminski that .he will be prosecuted for treason unless he leaves Pekin at once. With a clash between Russia and China imminent over the possession of outer Mongolia, Kusminski's act was regarded as most daring. Times' Home Dedicated. Los Angeles—The new Times build ing, the $500,000 turreted structure of steel, marble and granite erected on the site of the old building which was blown up with dynamite October 1, 1910, was dedicated formally Wednes day. 

TARIFF QUESTION IS POSTPONED President Would Leave Issue for New Congress. Greater Navy Advised—Autonomy for Philippines Opposed— Currency Reform. FEATURES OF MESSAGE. President Taft's principal recom mendations in his message to con gress were: The plan of currency reform out lined by the monetary commission. Amendment of the law to lessen the penalty when corporations inad vertently disobey the corporation tax law. Congressional approval of plan of army reorganization prepared by the war college last spring. The passage of the military pay bill increasing compensation to mil itia in the field. Citizenship without statehood for Porto Rico. Regualtion of water'power grants so that navigable streams might be improved by water power com panies. Elevation of Colonel Goethals, builder of the Panama canal, to a major generalship. A return to the policy of two bat tleships a year by the appropria tions for three battleships this year. Authority to the United States Supreme court to make rules of pro cedure in common law cases in Fed eral court to expedite and lessen the cost of litigation. He disapproves the following: Autonomy and independence in eight years for the Philippines. Amendment of the Sherman anti trust law. The president made no recom mendations for tariff revision, say ing he would leave that subject to the incoming congress. Washington, D. C—President Taft will make no further effort to have congress reduce the tariff. In a "gen eral" message to congress the presi dent clearly indicated his intention of leaving further tariff revision to Wil son and the congress just elected. "Now that a new congress has been elected on a platform of tariff for rev enue only rather than a protective tar iff and is to revise the tariff on that basis," said the president, "it is need less for me to occupy the time of con gress with arguments or recommenda tions in favor of a protective tariff." This message, the second submitted by the president since the present ses sion began, will be his last of a gen eral character. It dealt with every department of the government except the State department, recommended much of the legislation which the president previously had urged upon the attention of congress, and took up and discussed at length several sub jects comparatively new. Rayner Leaves Million. Baltimore —The value of the estate of the late Senator Rayner will ap proximate $1,000,000. This will be shown when the senator's will is filed next week for probate.

PENSIONS ARE PAID DIRECT New System of Indorsements Will Do Away With Vouchers. Washington, D. C.—The new sys tem of paying all persons on the Fed eral pension rolls direct from Wash ington instead of through the 18 pen sion agencies is being inaugurated by the pension bureau. Checks are being sent to 300,000 pensioners in the sec tions heretofore covered by the agen cies at Augusta, Ga.; Boston, Colum bus,, Detroit, Washington and San Francisco. The personnel of the agencies at Indianapolis, Knoxville, Louisville, New York, Philadelphia and Topeka, which have completed their November payments soon will be brought into Washington, the first of the agency transfers to the pension bureau.

The pensioner also must show to the indorsers his certificates, the number of which must tally with the certificate number on the checks. The new system obviates the necessity of receipts from the pensioners. THIS STUDENT LIVES CHEAP Freshman Working at College Gets Fat on 85 Cents a Week. Ithaca, N.

TREASURER URGES REFORM Foresees Deficit of $22,556,023 By June 30,1914. "Unreasoned and Unscientific" Banking and Currency System Responsible for Panics. Washington, D. C—Strongly urging radical reform of the "unreasoned and unscientific banking and currency sys tem of the United States," Franklin MacVeagh, secretary of the treasury, freely warns congress in his annual re port that the Federal government, as long as the present scheme exists, will be exclusively responsible for the com mercial, industrial and social disasters which flow from panics, and attack directly or indirectly every home in the nation. He outlined his idea of the necessary general provisions of an adequate relief measure, such as should bring the banks into organized co-operation and provide for a central agency, through which they could work together, free of political or trust control. The secretary foresees a deficit of $22,556,023, exclusive of Panama canal expenditures, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914. In cluding the canal expenses, the deficit is estimated at $52,730,455. The es timated receipts for that year are $710,000,000, while the ordinary ap propriations are estimated at $732, --556,023, and the canal expenditures at $30,174,432. These estimates are based upon present laws. For the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1913, MacVeagh estimates that there will be a surplus of $40, --200,000, exclusive of Panama canal expenditures, and a deficit of $1,800, --000, including the canal transactions. He estimates receipts for this year at $711,000,000, and ordinary disburse ments at $670,000,000.

LAW WOULD CONTROL DRESS California Senator Proposes Curb ing Extravagance. Sacramento — The United High School Students' federation of Califor nia had better send a strong lobby to Sacramento beginning January 6, and also send along representatives of the union of education and dress prepared to spend from three to four months in the capitol to watch the legislature and Ernest S. Birdsall, senator from Placer county. Senator Birdsall does not like boys' silken hose and dainty patent leather ties. He does not like the girls' mode of skirts, picture hats and matinee attire. Senator Birdsall's plan is to intro duce a bill in the next legislature reg ulating the dress of high school stu dents. He will aim to make the style of dress worn by girls and boys in Cal ifornia high schools uniform in cut and material. The bill will provide that goods in the girls' skirts, coats and waists shall be of the same material for all the girl students. Their hats are to be of a standard price. Their stockings and their shoes shall be uniform. Costly picture hats, high-heeled shoes and attractive silk stockings must go. The girls of the poorer fam ilies will not be made to feel the dif ference in dress distinction. Assay Offices Are Issue. Washington, D. C—The fight over Western assay offices is to be renewed at this session, the house committee on appropriations having stricken from the legislative bill reported all appropriations for assay offices except those at Seattle, Deadwood and New York.

If the house does not, the senate will restore the appropriations and thereby keep the offices open. Dr. Sun Vat San Is Coming. Sea£tle—lnstructions were received from Washington, D. C, by the local customs and immigration officers to prepare for the early arrival at this port of Dr. Sun Vat San, formerly provisional president of the Chinese republic, and other Chinese dignitaries who are expected here soon.
