PhO e4 Line 3. J. W. Sliv«-r. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Executive's Principal Recommenda­ tions to Congress. Washington, Dec. 4.—In his mes lage to congress President Roosevelt makes' the following recommenda­ tions: He recommends national incorpora­ tion or federal licensing as a means of regulating interstate commerce. The anti-trust law, he says, should be made more effective, so that it would prevent combinations that are harmful to the general public. As excellent examples of extended federal activity the results of the pure food act are cited. Special attention is called to the condition of the currency laws of the country. He declares that a greater elasticity in currency is needed and as a remedy repeats his suggestion of two years ago that the banks be allowed to issue notes equal In amount to a specified portion of their capital, which shall Tae taxed so high that they shall be driven back when no longer absolutely necessary and cov­ ered as congress shall provide. Frequent taarllf revision is. neces­ sary, on general principles/but he de­ precates such legislation during a presidential campaign. Income and inheritance taxes, he says, should be a part of the national system of taxation. He suggests that congress pass a law for compulsory investigation of labor disputes. The tariff on wood pulp should be repealed and an agreement made with Canada that that country shall not impose an export duty, on the same commodity. The president declares himself in favcr of a postal savings bank and a parcels post. is suggested that congress should appropriate campaign funds for proper and legitimate expenses of presiden­ tial campaigns. •IRS.

YOUNG CASE Comes Up Befere United States Supreme Court. IMPORTANT POINT INVOLVED Thomas D. O'Brien of Minnesota and Attorney General Had ley of Mis­ souri Appear for Plaintiff. The case of Attorney General fed ward T. Young of Minnesota, involv­ ing a fine of $100 on the charge of contempt of court, was argued in the supreme court of the United States at Washington. The case deals with the rights of states to prescribe railroad rates and the importance of the matter was indicated by the effort to intervene which was made in be­ half of the corporations doing bnai ness in other parts of the country which involve tbe same questions TliS case against Mr. Young grew tm* of an effort by the Northern Pacific Railway company to prevent Young as attorney general from enfoveing the state law of 1907. The United States court for the district of Minne­ sota, Judge Lochren presiding, grant­ ed a temporary injunction in accord­ ance with the prayer cf the railroad company, but notwithstanding this order Mr. Young instituted proceed­ ings in the state circuit court for Ramsey county asking for a writ of mandamus compelling the railroad company to comply with the law. He was promptly summoned before Judge Lochren, who imposed a fine for con­ tempt. Attorney General Sought Relief. The attorney general sought relief by applying in an original action to the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the Minne­ sota federal court was without juris­ diction. The case involves the constitutional question whether an action like this Is not a suit against a state, whieh is prohibited by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution. So important is the case that Attorney Hines sopght on behalf of the Southern Railway company to file a brief in the ease because of the probable effect of a de­ cision on this point on the various rate controversies of that company, and a similar request was made in the case of the Consolidated Gas company of New York, involving the 80|cent law, by Former Assistant Attorney General Whitney, who appeared for the House Service Corporation of "New York. Former Assistant General Heck made a protest in the latter pro­ ceeding, contending that to permit such a course at this time* would be equivalent to allowing a premature argument of the gas case. The court took the application in this case un­ der advisement, but admitted the brief in the Southern Railway case. The Youfig ca?e wns argued by At­ torney Thomas D. O'Brien of Minne­ sota and Attorney General Hadley of Missouri fcr 3£r. Young, and Chief Counsel C. Bunn of the Northern Pacific ar-'ust that official. BAN PUT ON MALT DRINKS Minnesota Supreme Court Defines What Are Intoxicants. Tht state supreme court has hand "d down an important decision re­ lating to the sale of intoxicat­ ing liquors. This decision goes into the rights of dealers to sell malt bev­ erages without local licenses and it would appear that if the decision has any general effect it will prevent the sale of the various malt extracts ex­ cept at regularly licensed saloons or I on the presentation of a doctor's pre* l*8cription at a dmg store. The case was that of the state against Noble Schagel, a resident of Kandiyohi county. The defendant was indicted and found guilty of selling intoxicants without a license. He sold what was called Swedish malt. One sample, after analysis by a university professor, was found to contain 2.72 per cent alcohol and another sample disclosed 3.18 per cent alcohol. Scha­ gel appealed and the supreme court I says the verdict must stand. I
