PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT was depicted in a speech by Senator Rayner yesterday as a self constituted dictator attempting to fill the role of a great regulator of the universe, this caustic criticism being voiced in Rayner s strong attack on the Presi dent's views on the Japanese question. Shows Roosevelt as Yankee Czar Senator Rayner Flays Stand on the Japanese 

WASHIXGTO.Y, Doc. 12. — Much Inter est wa» manifested in the Senate to day- when Sennlor Itaynrr delivered a *P*~"eh on the Japanese qnention. He «-ontended th^t the inherent rfsrhi* of a j >tate r-ould not be violated by treaty! any more than they could be violated by Conereas. To support thin he cited many cases adjudicated by the ' Su preme Court and arrayed long line* of eminent authorities. Rayner also gave the cases and au thorities on the other side to the propo sition. I He was interrupted many times in his argument by Senators who wished to bring out specific points. II* 1 spoke for more than an hour. Caustic criticisms of President Roose velt's position on the Japanese ques tion prefaced Rayner"s discussion of the constitutional questions involved. If the military and civil forces of the Federal Government were to be used by the President. Rayner said, it be rame very important to know the exact power of. the President in the matter. Continuing, he said: It Ik quite a »eriou» matter, in view of the sreai calamity that has lately befallen the city of >an Franci«co. for the Prcxtdrnt to contemplate the bombarding: of the city at this time and to declare war agrainst the Board of County School Trustees of San Fran cisco If there la no Justification or ore text upon which such ferocious pro .\u25a0'recdlnErs can be undertaken, r The President is exercising a great [ "isny functions — legislative, executive^ and judicial, lawful and, unlawful, cen ptitutional and unconstitutional. If he is possessed of the idea that he is su pervisor of all the public schools of the various States of the Union — and he seems to be Impressed with this idea, because in the very last paragraph of his message he recommends the estab lishment of shooting galleries in. all of the large public schools of the coun try — we must either disabuse his mind of this fancy or we must lft him know that we agree as to the omnipotence of his jurisdiction. If he can take possession of the pub lic schools of California and coinpcl the State to ndmlt to them Japanese Mtidrnt* contrary to tbc laws of Cali fornia, he could with equal propriety Kcsd us an amendment to the Santo Dominj^o treaty and demand the admis sion of the necro children of Saato Domineo Into the white schools of South Carolina or any other State of the Union. Of course if the people have come to the conclusion that everything that rh«? President recommends Is right, then there is hardly any use in con-, testing any of bis propositions, and In stead of conferring upon him the powpr to give Congress information of the s-tete of the -nion we might confer upon him the function of furnishing his own peculiar views upon the entire state of the universe and recommend ing any improvements or changes in the general plan of creation that he may deem expedient from the cradle to th* grave. In fact, the President, upon page twenty-nine of his message, antici - at*s the cradle and makes a re.com \ : :«-.ndation upon 1 the state of the Union * . hat tends to place fh his hands the -stablishment of the birth rate of the •o en try. -Now if we can only supple •nt this function by giving him com • t^> jurisdiction over the death. rate .. •' vrUl hay« a rule on which his übiquity is uncircumscribed and whose unlimited possibilities are beyond the rrarh of human contemplation. Rayner coincided with what the President had said in his message in praise of the Japanese. His sym pathies had. h« said, been with them during the war with Russia, and he thought it a great shame that Japan should have been overpowered in the conference room when she had been victorious .on the battlefield. Rayner proposed, he said, to discuss the pres ent question entirely outside of the particular circumstances and plant himself on these two propositions: I— That there Is no provision what ever In the treaty with Japan that con fers the rfgrht that the President speaks of or gives to the Government of Japan the privilege* It claims In connection v itli the, public school system of Cali fornia or of any other State. 2—lf2 — If .there should be such a nrovl slon In this treaty or any other treaty conferring this right the treaty would be void and without any authority upon the part of the United States to make it and fn violation of the constitution and treaty making power of the Gov ernment. / The precise point Involved is the tenth article of the constitution, that powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution nor prohib ited by it. to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the.peo ple. The power of a State to regulate it* public school system is clearly among its reserved powers. . SAX
