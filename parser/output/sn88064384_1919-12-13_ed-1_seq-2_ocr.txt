General Recommendation for Return of the United States To Peace Basis. Washington.—General recommenda tions on legislation to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a readjustment of the nation to peace time basis were the features of Presi dent Wilson s annual message to con gress, delivered Tuesday. The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be discussed iu a sepa rate message later, as will the ruilroad question. For the second time only since the president established the practice of addressing congress in person his mes sage was read today by the clerks. The president's principal recommen dations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation sys tem, with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world conditions and make the system con form with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world." Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war, particularly In the way of government farms, as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farm ers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes of political restlessness in our in a Is a. causes of political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest "art superficial rather than deep-seated," and that they "arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to ar rive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal con ditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European cen ters pendi»g such delay from heartless profiteering, resulting from the in crease of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear. The president renewed his recom mendations for legislation to deal ef fectively with "those persons who by violent methods will abrogate our time tested institutions." Several recommendations, some re : newals of previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the . cost of living. Among them were ex tension of the food control law to peace times for the emergency; regulations for transportation of foods in inter state commerce; a coal storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey; a law requiring markets to show the length of time foods are kept in stor age, and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits" by federal license of corpora tions selling food in Interstate com merce. A long portion of the message was devoted to a discussion of the condi tion and rights of labor. "A definite program to bring about an Improve ment in the conditions of labor" and bring about a genuine democratization of industry" was recommended. "The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances is to re move grievances," said the president's message. Another point it declared, "the seed of revolution Is repression." "The establishment of the princi ples regarding labor laid down in the covenant of the league of nations," said the message, "offers us the way to Industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. ... Governments must recognize the right of men to bargain collectively for humane objects. . . Labor must no longer be treated as a commodity." "The right of Individuals to strike Is inviolate," continued the message, "and ought not to be Interfered with by any process of government, but there is a predominant right and that is the right of the government to pro tect all of its people and to assert Its powers and majesty against the chal lenge of any class." The president was referring te the government's recent injunction against the coal strike. The message closed with a pointed reference to radicalism and red doc trines and referred to "Russia today with its blood and terror" as a "pain ful object lesson of tha power of minorities." MR.
