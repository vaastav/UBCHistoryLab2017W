MEASURING A TREE. Different Ways In Which Two Boys Accomplished the Taek. Near Hie end of the boy announced the height of tall maple tree to be thirty-three feet. t* season our our " 'Why, how do you know ?' the general question. " 'Measured it.' " 'How?' et e was Footrule and yardstick.' You didn't climb that tall tree?' his mother asked anxiously. " 'No'm. 1 found the length of the shadow and measured that.' But the length of the shadow changes.' 'Yes'm. U t on to tt 4 it But twice a day the shadows are just as long as the things themselves, ing all sum nier, into the ground, and when its shadow was just us long *s the stick I knew that the shadow of the tree would be just as long a9 the tree, and that's thirty-three feet.' " I've been try 1 drove a stick The above paragraph appeared in one of the daily papers which come to our office. The item was headed "A Clever Boy." Now, do not knoxv who this advertised boy was, but we knew quite as clev er a boy, one who could have got the approximate height of the tree without waiting for the sun to shine at a particular angle or to shine at all, for that matter. The way boy No. 2 went about the same problem was this: He got a stick and planted it in the ground and then cut it off just at the le\*el of his eyes. Then he went out and took a look at the tree and made rough estimate of the tree's height in his mind, and, judging the distance along the ground from the tree trunk, he planted his stick in the ground. Then he lay down his back with his feet against the standing stick and looked at the top of the tree over the stick. If he found the top of the stick and tree did not agree he tried a new position and kept at it until lie could just see the treetop over the end of the upright stick. Then all he had to do was to measure along I the ground to where his eye had ! een when lying down, and that Ihe point about this method is | that the boy and stick made a ! right angled triangle with boy for | base, stick for perpendicular, both of the same length, and the line of sight the hypotenuse or long line of the triangle. When he got into the position which enabled him to just see the treetop over the top of the stick he again had a right angled triangle with tree as per pendicular, bis eye's distance away from the trunk, the base, and- the line of sight the hypotenuse, could measure the base line along the ground and knew it must equal the vertical height, and he could do this without reference to the sun. It was an ingenious application of the well know'n properties of right angled triangle.—Railway and Locomotive Engineer. we a same on He a Tempus Fugit.

In the first place the President says that he desires express geneial concurrence in the conserva on near future, movc an programme embodied in Mr. Ballin «er's report.

Later in the message ne enumerates practically all of the recommendations pertinent to conservation contained in the annual report of the secretary of the interior. It is expected that Mr. Taft's mes sage on conservation, which mav be sent to congress before the holidays, will contain a sweeping and emphatic endorsement of Secretary Ballinger's administration. It will make clear, however, that the forests, lands and the water powers of the nation must the coal be protected from spoliation and conserved for the benefit of future generations, the most ardent friends of the servatiou movement are agreed that they can find nothing to criticise in Mr. Ballingei's legislative mandations. They insist, that congress will not carry out the Even co ri recoui however. i> that it is their sacred duty to define by law the measure of protection which shall be afforded the public domain and the wonderful resources of the nation by the administrative officers of the government. An effort will be made to induce congress at its present session to authorize the purenase of embassies at Berlin and Paris. Representative Perkins, the new chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, is noi enthusiastically hopeful, however, that the men who handle the purse strings will approve the necessary expenditure. Congress will not get down to the real work of the session until after the holidays. The various house committees which handle the big supply bills are now engaged in their annual task of cutting down the de mands of the various departments.

The importance of rural education in our state can be realized when it is remembered that 04 per ceut of our population is rural, says a news letter from Lewiston. For some time past President Black of the Lewiston Normal has recognized the fact that it would be well if those who are to teach in the rural schools received special training for this im Is the past, in Idaho as everywhere, the rural schools have beeu more or less below the general standard—sometimes because of of poorly trained teachers who had no thorough understanding of nor | sympathy with the conditi poor equipment, but more often because about Strange as it may seem liiere are *'* I them. but two educational institutions in America today that offer courses in rural science with the distinct view of training teachers for rural schools —MacDonald College in Canada and Lewiston Normal in our own state. It is Idaho that is now pointing the way in this important phase of education. Bulletins are soon to he issued by the Lewiston Normal on various phases of rural school educa tion—such as "The Rural School Library", "The Rural School Build ing and Its Equipment", "The L'eautlllcation of Rural School Grounds", and "The Ioterior Decora tion of Rural Schools through the Application of the Manual Arts".

A motion that the board proceed dig a well was lost by three to two. The to a vote oi question was discussed quite fully, members of the board having interviewed the business men and tax and found that the a number of payers sentiment of majority was opposed to the project. It was estimated that well on the prairie, with the a pump and mams would cost in the neighbor hood of $3000, and the board did not feel justified in incurring this expense, with chances that the well might prove a failure.
