Williams was placed upon trial, charged with a malicious amaulr., in May last, upon the person of Henry B. Mosby, a policeman ol this city, with intent to malm, dUable, or kill. The evidcncc went to show that. Williams was engaged in a diiikultv with one btratton, and that Mos bv, while ondcavorlng to stop the difficul ty, was accidentally ptruck by Williams ; and further, tbat when Williams disco vered * but he had struck the policeman he promptly explained that ho did not intend to inflict, the blow, and that he was sorry for it. Threo wit nesses were examined? Mosby, the po liceman. and two colored men? when the Commonwealth's attorney acknowledged that, he had failed to make out a cafe, and declared tint ho would not further prose cute. The Judge at this point took excep tion at the position assumed by the Com monwealth's attorney, and expressed a de sire to bear argument ; but as far as the Commonwealth'* attorney whs concerned, he declined to tukc any further steps in the project! ion. Messrs. Oojrgin and W11 li;ini-, counsel tor the accused, then briefly reviewed the evidence, which, they claimed, faded t<? ?u-taln the indictment ; and tbe ca>c beitm submitted to the jury, they promptly rendered a verdict that "the ac cused was not guilty ns charged in the in dictment. The Judge then took occasion to h'jy that while the verdict of the jury was a correct oue, in view of the position of the Commonwealth's attorney, he nevertheless thought a verdict should have beeu ren dered lor unlawful assault and battery, aud that a - a conservator of the peace ho should require the acquitted party to enter into bund* of *500 lo keep tbe peace for twelve mouths, 'this position of the court brought counsel on each *ide to their feet, the re presentative of the Commonwealth declar ing that he would nev^r undertake to pro secute .1 partv when the evidence did not sustain the charge, the action of the court Lo the contrary ; while the counsel for the accused took the portion that by the ver dict just rendered the accused party was declared In e from crime as court, bar, or jury, and that he should not be put under any further restraint by leijal process. The .Ti.d;:e at thi- point declared that he would maintain the no-ition indicated by him, nod that i!' counsel wished to impeach him they could do so. Tho scene was a very unusual cno tor a court-room, and what with tho spirit manifested by all parties concerned was highly interesting.

In July, 18.11, 1 wa- on board a ?t earner called the ( omet, a small ves.-< 1 which used to run fromilob son'- liav to Melbourne. I bad beeu at \Villiam>towa that day.

I then saw *ome nun come t>n imaid from the other vessel ; they were evidently sailors. They appeared at the time w? be common sailors. Some went art, and others stood about the chimnev. 1 went id't mvself, and there noticed two ol th ; men I bad seen come down the pad d e-box. One was a well-drossed nun, tlie other a voung gentleman dressed as a sailor, but evidently not a sailor. He had not the bearing of a sailor. I was talking to anothvr person, and this voting gentleman turned round and made an observation. Ho had de cidedly a French ac.ent; so much so tbst 1 took him for a Freucbmsn. 1 also sttw him 1 . t\ hh eyebrows while talking. 1 pertect ly rein^m a-r this, it struck ine tnat he'w.is Interested in what 1 was nay iny.

Every body was lookiug at him. 1 bad not at the time any belie! that 1 had seen him Ik fore. Since then 1 have had an opportunity of conversing with bini, and ha\c come to the conclusion that he is tbo same person I fs'iw on board the Comet In lboi. liefore our intei view on Saturday I saw some photo Rvaphsol him in a shop window at York.

December 3d, 18TL? 1 fur nish you a brief account of a sad, sudden, ?nd mysterious death in this (Talbot) county la^t night. A certain John ft. Pla ter, of very respectable and well-to-do fam ily, in the early stapes of the late war joined his fortunes with the Confederacy, and before his return to Maryland married a Virginia lady. Plater on returning to this county avoided public places, keeping him self confined to the estates of his mother, and it was not known that lie had left a wife behiud him until an advertisement ap peared in a Baltimore paper request intr information of Captain John It. Plater, of Maryland. An answer was sent, and in a short time a gentlemau connected with the press of Lynchburg or Peters burg, Va., came here in quest of Mr. Plater, who, as be stated, had deserted bis wile. A month or so later the wife arrives, and seeks the minister of the ilothodist Pro testant church, to whom she had a letter of recommendation. Plater before thi* had left bis mother'* i evidence, and was farm ing on a small plice near tiiis town, his habits forcing the mother to get rid of bitn by purchasing u separate farm for him. The wronged wife seeks him ou his farm, but Instead of a loving welcome. Is told to leave, that bo will nave notaiug to do with her. .Sb^ remained aud resolutely clung to him. Several months elapsed, when she came to town, took counsel, aud hud her husband " bonded" to keep the peace. He ?ought to have bor placed under bond also. Family iiiends or others Induced the wife to leave, and money is given her to defray ex penses. Sbe returned here last Friday, and about noon next day Hougbt hor hu-bund at his bou*e. lie came to town, and was advised (legally) to givo bis house up to ber. This be did by moving immediately iuto one of his tenant-bouses 011 the firm, leaving bin wife alono, without bed or pro visions. To-day he came to town, and re ports that his wife was found last night about 0 o'clock near a fence about two hundred yards from tbe house, dead or dying. An inquest was held this after noon. No decision given as yet. It Is said the evidence given by the said Pluter, by a while man in hts employ, and by a negro boy, was contradictory, unsatis factory, and leads to the suspicion of foul play. The jury to-day found tbe body, ag before stated, near the fence. She was fully dressed (excepting her bat, found in the house), about seven dollars iu her pocket, lying on her face, one hand in her muff, the other grasping some dead grasp, a bot tle of chloroform on the opposite side of the feuce, partially concealed by a fence-rail on the ground, and small pieces of colored paper scutteied around near by. No marks of violence, ouo knee being somewhat swollen. I believe, and ono or two bad quilts under her. l>n ?'o?Opcraitvo SnaleitcK* To the Editor of the Cincinnati Commercial: 'I here i- hardly a proposition to ce found that is tlioimbt so fit to soive the social question, and to establish just and sntisfic tory rel-itioiK ol human society, ns the idea of association. We al*o are admirers ot its principle-. They make the heretofore piu r and helpless workman a respected member <-.f :i powerful society, st-roni; and willing enough to aid li'in in t'me of need. They equalize the hard differences between sup", pie si d aud suppressors, brin^ins both to l he jus? standpoint of human rights. The old, well-known proverb, "Viribusunitis," jsynouwn to 44 In union is strength," cer tainly u verity, and will always prove to be true and effective. Upon it reits the exist ence of republics and the real welfare of nations. However, ns nil thine;* on this earth arc limited by natural biw<<. ho Is it ul>o with association. ft is bcneficcnt only to a cer lh i n point, but becomes pernicious as soon it overruns the boundaries fixed to it bv nature. We have to respect the law of measure always and any where, and tbe difi'orenccs iu "character, and the kind of application in each separate case. Oue thing is not lit for all, uud all men are not fit for the fame tiling. Acknowledging the principle* of benevo lent societies, !iud approving of I hem tho roughly, we fail to see tne same beneficent effect i'u cooperative associations, destined a* well for consumption as for production. The first one buying commodities in whole sale and selling them to their members j without charging the profit of the retailer have had till now sometimes a very salutary effect, but wo doubt that this success will be permanent. The idea of these consump tive societies is founded upon a principle exactly opposite to the higher law of tne division of labor. As soon as the existing causca of thope associations? the exorbitant avarice of the Hinjll shop keepers? aro removed, by bringing down their ujuriuu* profit to rea?;oua:ile terms, this kind of association will prove to be useless and unsatisfactory. Let the me chanic be a mechanic, the farmer a farmer, the merchant u merchant, and let them practice the trades thev h*ve learned at great cost of money aud libor. It will neither work to make a baker a carpenter nor a mechanic a merchant ; each trade de mands its own skill and training. Jt is a real Inconsequence of some economists to represent the division of labor as one of tbe most efficient means to improve the condi tion of the worklngmcn, and afterwards to recommend its reverse. We may u-e such an application as an exception, bur *e d ire not attempt it as a rule, without beina pun ished for offending the law of nature. Tiitse associations, however, will uie out gradually, without doing any barm :o the working' classes or to human society in general. 3iore important sro the cooperative socie ties for production ; but also more falla cious. We are very well aware that In stating tbisiwo have* the whole host of new economists and socialists and all working men ag.uust us. Nevertheless, we aro not able to change our views to plca.-e them. As soon as the economist leaves Ills own conviction aud the strict path of logical consequeuce, yielding to tempting pallia tive means, lie is lost, and bis opinions are not only or no avail, but become directly pernicious. They confuse the public mlncl land bring the whole science into disci edit. Lectckk on the Principles op Thue Civ ilization. ? itev. James A. Duncan, I).

One of the oddest wager.i we have heard of for a long time was made on Friday night end handsomely won on Saturday : Andrew Hifes. the well-known driver In theemplov of Youns <fe Uucemnn, at their livery stable, made a wager of 830 that he could draw a bucgy welghine 260 pnunds from Youog & ?Ju*emm's siablo to Frank Lawson's place. In Triadclphln, nod return, in six hours. The dtetahco is about fifteen mile* and a half, with two or three pretty touch hills to climb. The piel minaries being settled, Andy was barues?ed info an open- top buppv of the required wric,bt. Andy's opponent disputing the weight, the cushions and rug were put in, making, i?s was afterwards found, the tot u 5 weight 2S9 pounds. Juat at 12 o'clock Saturday noon ho started, ac companied by the judges appointed to see that the terms of the wager were fairly complied with, the man who hod wagered that Andy could not do it, nnd several other parties From the time keeper'* note-book we tcke the following: Leaving the stables at 12 o'clock M. pre cisely, the first mile-stone wiw reached it 12:21 ; the second at 12:45; third at 12:19 ; fourth at 1 :09 ; fifth at 1 :22 ; sixtn at 1 :'?$ ; seventh at 1 :50, arriving at Frank Lawson'a at 2:02. Jttetiirning, the time of the miles was not kept, lie stopped at Lnw.-on's six minutes for refreshments ; at Auc. Itoett ger'h four minutes, and at Frank Walters'/! live luiuutes, arriving at Young & Hu-;e man's stables (<he starting point) at twenty tive minutes after lour, having won the wager with an hour and thirty-five minutes to spare. Deducting the stoppages on the return trip, it will he seen that he came back at about the same rate of speed as un going out. Bet* of two to one tha*: he c^uld not ac complish the feat were freely ottered before he started, without takers. A good many dollars changed hands on the event, though. An immense crowd grafted Kites on his return, and he was the hero of the hour. Cheer after cheer went up as he came pran cing into t lie stable almost as fresh as when 0e started. Hire* i-i a rather under-sized, firmly-built, wiry man, of twen'.y-live or thirty years of a;je. lio will weigh about 147 pounds, and isuot over live feet six or seven inches hi^h. He is not the man one would pick out as a model ct endurance, but be is, as we heard one of tie boy? say, "a touah little cuss." That a man of his physique should be able to haul a bUL'gy weighing 239 pounds nt the rate ot four miles an hour la a matter of as tonishment. Andy no w proposes to wacer that he can draw the same bugtrr to St. Chtrsville and back in ten hours. If he can do that he had better sot un fur a draught Lorss at ouce. ? Wheeling Register.

All Europeans agree that the Chinese arc equal to their brethren, and some said they are morn than and some nominates them the best hu-bnnd men in the world. They are more particu larly active, raisins* two crops of rice from the ground every year, extending tlie'r cultivations In every direction, bringing the most unpromising spots into use, In or der that nothina may he lost.

An official telegram from Madrid denies { tbe reported removal of Yalmaseda. The telegraph line between Los Tumas and Santiago de Cuba, so long interrupted by the iu*uigents, will bo working again in a few days. The fact that this line, together with others that have been put in working oruer, remain undisturbed is considered positive proof that tuo rebellion is on tbe decline.
