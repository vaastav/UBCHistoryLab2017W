OUTLINES ISSUES OF THE DAY Important Recommendations as to Legislation Made in Annual Message to Congress Large Part of Document Devoted to Corporations and Railroad Rate Legislation Relations of Labor and Capital Dealt With Fully. The message of President Roose velt, read at the first session of the Fifty-ninth Congress, congratulates the people on the continued prosper ity of the nation. The close relation ship and mutual dependence upon each other of capital and labor are pointed out, and the message con tinues: Corporations. Tct, while not merely admitting, but In sisting upon this, it is also tiue that where there is no governmental restraint or supervision some of the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for the common good, hut in ways which tell against till common good. The fortune;, amassed thiough corporate oiganlzation aie now so laige and vest euch iioivcr in those that wie'd them, as to make It a matter of necessity to give to the hoverolgn that is. to the Govern ment, which represents the people as a whole some effective power of supervis ion over their corporate, use. In oider to insure :t healthy social and industrial life, every hig corporation should he held re spoiislhle hj. and he accountable to. some boveieign strong enough to control Its conduct. I am in no sense hostile to cor porations. This Is an age of combination, and anv effort to prevent all combina tion will be not only useless, but in the enil vicious, because of the contempt for law which the faihue to enforce law in evitably produces. Vv'c should, moreover, recognize in coidial and ample fashion the Immense gcod effected by corporate agencies In a country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidel ity devoted to their soivice .and there fore normally to the service of the public. by their oiliceis and diiectors. The cor poration has ccme to stay, just as the trade union has ccme to stay. Each can do and has done gieat good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. Hut each .should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice. The President shows the impossi bility of the individual states deal ing successfully with corporation greed, and the necessity of conferring power upon the general government even to the extent of a proper amend ment to the constitution. He says: It has been a misfortune that the national laws on this subject have hither to been of a negative r piohil.itive rather than an aihrmative kind, and still more that thev have in part sought to rno hibit what could not be- effectively pro hibited, and have in part in their pro hibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be allowed. It is genemlly u-eless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition, whether chis restraint be reasonable or unreasonable; and where it Is not useless It Is generally hurtful. Events have shown that it is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law of this kind by incessant appeal to the courts. The Department of Justice has for the last four eais devoted more attention to the enforcement of the anti-trust legis lation than to anything ele. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked has been the moral effect of the piosecu tlons; but it Is increasingly evident that there will be a very insutlicicnt beneficial result in the way of economic change. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another device to accomplish the same punose. What is needed Is not sweeping f imbibition of every arrangement, good or iad. which may tend to restrict competi tion, but such adequate supet vision and regulation as will prevent any restriction of competition fiom being to the detri ment of the public as well as such supervision and regu'ation as will pre vent other abuses in no way connected with lestriction of competition. Of these abuses, pet haps the chief, although by no means the only one. ,is overcapitaliza tiongenerally itse'f the tesult of dis honest promotion because of the myriad evils it brings in Its train: for such over capitalization often means an intlation that invites business panic; it always con ceals the true relation of the profit earned to the actual capital invested, and It creates a but den of interest payments Which is a fertile cause of improper re duction or in limitation of wages: it damages the small investor, discourages thrift, and encourages gambling and spec ulation: while perhaps woist of a I Is the trlckiness and dishonesty which It implies ' -TOr harm to morals alld wotse than any possible harm to material intetests. and the debauchery of politics and business by Rieat dishonest corporations js far worse than any actual materi il evil they do the public. Until the national govern ment obtains, in some manner which the t wisdom of the Congiess may suggest, pioper control over the big corporations engaged in intei state commeice that is. over the great majoi ity of the big cor porations it w ill lo impossible to deal adequately with these evils. ' I am well awaie of tne difficulties of the legislation that I am suggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action in securing it. I should emphatic ally protest against improper radical or hasty action. The first thing to do is to deal with the great corporations en paged in the business of interstate trans Jiortation. As I said in my message of )ec. C last, the immediate and most pressing need, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regulation of the rates cnargcu uy the railroads of the ccuntrv engaged in Inter state traffic as si'all summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must in clude putting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power to regulate lates. like all similar powers over the business world, should be exer cised with moderation, caution, and self restraint; but it should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised when the need arises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affirm ative and should be given to some ad ministrative body created by the Congress. If given to the present Interstate Com merce commission or to a reorganized Interstate Commerce commission, such commission should be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe in the government Interfering with private busi ness more than is necessary. I do not believe in the government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left in private hands. Rut neither do I believe in the government flinching from ovei seeing any work when it becomes evident that abuses are sure to obtain theiein unless there is governmental supervision. It is not my province to indicate the exact terms of the law which should be enacted; but I cill the attention of the Congress to ceitain existing con ditions with which It is deirab'e to deal. In m judgment the most important pro vision which such law should contain is that ennfening upon some competent administrative boely the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it. whether a given rate prescribed by a rail road is reasonatle ard iu.t. and if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the com plaint, to prescribe the limit of jat fcejond which it shall rnt be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as It is commonly cal ed this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain fiom thence onwaid. subject to review by the courts it sometimes hap pens at present, not that a rate is too high but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commis sion would have the right to fix this already estab'ished minimum rate as the rmximum and it would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad com panies of the practice of giving improper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originate rates generally. but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon complaint and after investi gation. A heavy nenalty should be ex acted from any corporation which fails to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform In the matter of railway regulation. The first necessity is to se cure it: and unless it is granted to the commission there is little use in touch ing the subject at all. Continuing, the President earnestly disclaims any spirit of hostility to the railroads, pointing out the bene fit to be derived by the fair-dealing Giads in the even-handed administra te of justice. In this both the hon est railroad man and the honest ship per alike would be benefited. Ending the subject, the President says: All private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce commission or some similar body so far as rates, and agreements practically affecting rates, are concerned. The private-car owners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable compen sation on their investment, but neither private cars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, or in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. Xo lower rate should apply on goods imported than actually obtains to domestic goods from the American seaboard to destination except in cases where water competition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of common car riers; no common carrier engaged In interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the inspection of the government. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be suiely detected. A sjstem of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners; a few first-class railroad ac countants, if they had pioper direction and proper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much in preventing willful violations of the law. It would not be necessary for them to examine into the accounts of any railroad unless for good reasons they were direct ed to do so bv the Interstate Commerce commission. It is greatly to be desired that some way might be found by which an agieement as to transportation with in a state intended to operate as a fraud upon the federal interstate commerce laws could be brought under the juris diction of the federal authorities. At present it occuis that large shipments of interstate traffic are control'ed by con cessions on purely state business, which of course amounts to an evasion of the law. The commission should have power to enforce fair treatment by the great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines. I urge upon the Congress the need for expeditious action by the Interstate Com merce commission in all these matters, whether in regulating rates for transpor tation or for storing or for handling property or commodities in transit. The history of the cases litigated under the present commeice act shows that its efficiency has been to a gieat degree destioyed by the weapon of delay, almost the most formidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law. The question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial success, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place during the last half century has been the most Important factor in the growth of the new industrial conditions. Most emphatically we do not wish to see the man of great talents refused the re ward for his talents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized; but we do desire to see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong man shall be given no advantage over the weak man. We wish to insure as fair treatment for the small town as for the big city, for the small shipper as for the big shipper. In the old days the highway of commerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; it belonged to the public and the traffic along it was fiee. At present the railway is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it is kept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a very difficult and complex thing to manage, and it is far better that it should be managed by private individuals than by the govern ment. But it can only be so managed on condition that justice is done the public. IP Is because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads Is highly undesir able and would probably in this country entail far-reaching disaster, that I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them in the interest of the public as will make it evident that there is no need for public ownership. The opponents of government regulation dwell upon the difficulties to be encountered and the Intricate and Involved nature of the prob lem. Their contention is true. It is a complicated and delicate problem, and all kinds of difficulties are sure to arise in connection with any plan of solution, while no plan will bring all the benefits hoped for by Its more optimistic adher ents. Moreover, under any healthy plan, the benefits will develop gradually and not rapidly, finally, we must clearly under stand that the public servants who are to do this pecu'iarly responsible and delicate work must themselves be of the high".st type both as regards integrity and efficiency. They must be well paid, for otherwise able men can not In the long run be secured: and they must possess a lofty probity which will revolt as quick ly at the thought of pandering to any gust of popular prejudice against rich men as the thought of anything even remotely resembling subserv iency to rich men. Hut while I fully admit the diffi culties in the way, I do not for a moment admit that these difficulties warrant us in ,stoppir.g in our effort to secure a wise and just system. They should have no other effect than to spur us on to the exercise of the resolution, the even-handed justice, and the fertility of resource, which we like to think of as typica'ly American, and which will in the end achieve good results in this as in other fields of activity. The task is a great one and underlies the task of dealing with the whole industrial problem. But the fact that it is a great problem does not warrant us in shrinking from the attempt to solve it. At present we face sucn utter lacK or supervision, sucn freedom from the restraints of law, that excellent men have often been literally forced into doing what they deplored because otherwise they were left at the mercy of unscrupulous competitors. To rail at and assail the men who have done as they best could under the conditions accomplishes little. What we need to do is to develop an orderly system; and such a system can only come through the gradually Increased exercise of the right of efficient government control. The necessity for safety appliances on railroads, recommended in the President's message to the last Con gress, is emphasized, together with the necessity for a law regulating the hours of labor of railroad men. On the labor question, the mes sage says: There has been demand for depriving couits of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of the equity powers of our courts wou!d be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of the power any moie than an improper exercise of the power to call a strike by a labor bader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy is to regulate the piocedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not ap pear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case; it should not be ued as a pretext to permit violation of law, or the jeopardizing of life or properly. Of course, this would not authorize the issuing ef a restraining order or injunc tion in any case in which it is not already authorized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made in my last annual message for an investiga tion by the Department of Commerce and Labor of general labor conditions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child-labor legislation in the several states. Such an investigation should take into account the various prob lems with which the question of child labor is connected. It is true that these problems can be actually met In most cases only by the states themselves, but it would be well for the nation to endeav or to secure and publish comprehensive information as to the conditions of the labor of children in the different states, so as to spur up those that are behind hand, and to secure approximately uni form legislation of a high character among the several states. In such a Republic as ours the one thing that we can not afford to neglect is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the nation depends upon the citizenship of the generations to come; the children of to-day are those who to morrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we can not afford to neglect them. The legislature of Colorado has recom mended that the national government provide some general measure for the protection from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout th United States. I lay i.ie matter before yon for what I trust will be your favorable con sideration. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employe interested, but also a third party the general public. Every considerable labor difficulty In which interstate commerce is involved should be investigated by the government and the facts officially reported to the oublic The question of securing a healthy, self respecting, and mutually sympathetic at titude as between emp'oyer and employe, capitalist and wage-worker, is a difficult one. AH phases of the labor problem prove difficult when approached. But the underlying principles, the root principles, in accordance with which the problem must be solved are entirely simple. We can get justice and right dealing only if We must face accomplished facts, and the principle of treating a man on his worth as a man rather than with reference to his social position, his occupation, or the class to which he belongs. There are selfish and brutal men in all ranks of life. If they are capitalists their selfishness and brutalitv may take the form of hard indifference to suffering, greedy disregard of every moral restraint which Interferes with the accumulation of wealth, and cold-blooded exploitation of the weak; or. if they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of the more fortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of mur derous violence. Such conduct Is just as reprehensible In one case as In the other, and all honest and farseelng men should join In warring against it wherever it becomes manifest. Individual capital ist and Individual wage-worker, corpora tion and union, are alike entitled to the protection of the law, and must alike obey the law. Moreover, in addition to mere obedience to the law. each man. If he be a really good citizen, must show broad sympathy for his neighbor and genuine desire to look at any question arising between them from the standpoint of that neighbor no les3 than from his own: and to this end it Is essential that capitalist and wage-worker should con sult freely one with the other, should each strive to bring closer the day when both shall realize that they are properly part ners and not enemies. To approach the questions which inevitably arise between them solely from the standpoint which treats each side in the mass as the en cmv of the other side in the mass is both wicked and foolish. In the past the most direful among the influences which have brought about the downfall of republics has ever been the growth of the class spirit, the growth of the spirit which tends to make a man subordinate the wel fare of the public as a whole to the wel fare of the particular class to which he belongs. This inevitably brings about a tendancy to treat each man not on his merits as an individual, but on his posi tion as belonging to a certain class in the community. If such a spirit grows up in this Republic it will ultimately prove fatal to us, as In the -ast it has proved fatal to every community in which it has become dominant. Unless w;e .con tinue to keep a quick and lively sense of the great .fundamental truth that our concern is with the individual worth of the Individual man, this govern ment cannot permanently hold the place which it has achieved among the nations. The vital lines of cleavage among our people do not correspond, and indeed run at right an gles to, the lines of cleavage which divide occupation from occupation, which divide wage-workers from capitalists, farmers from bankers, men of small means from men of large means, men who live in the towns from men who live in the country: for the vital line of cleavage is the line which divides the honest man who tries to do well by his neighbor from the dishonest man who does ill by his neighbor. In o'her words, the stand ard we shoulJ establish is the standard of conduct, not the standard of occupation, of means or of social position. It is the man's moral quality, his attitude toward the great questions which concern all humanity, his cleanlinegs of life, his power to do his duty toward himself and toward others, which really count; and if we substitute for the standard of personal judgment which treats each man according to his merits, another standard in accordance with which all men o. one class are favored and all men of an other class discriminated against, we shall do irreparable damage to the body politic. I be lieve that our people are too sane, too self respecting, too fit for self-government, ever to adopt such an attitude. This government is not and never shall be government by a plutocracy. This government is not and never shall be government by a mob. It shall continue to be in the future what it has been In the past, a government based on the theory that each man. rich or poor, is to ue treated simply and solely on his worth as a man, that ell his personal and property rights are to be safeguarded, and that he Is neither to wrong others nor to suffer wrong from others. Insurance. The great Insurance companies afford strik ing examples of corporations whose business has extended so lar beyond the jurisdiction of the states which created them as to pre clude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent States. In my last annual message I recommended "that the Congress carefully consider whether the pow er of the Bureau of Corporations cannot con stitutionally be extended to cover interstate transactions In Insurance." Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this ques tion, to see whether it is not possible to fur nish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against cor ruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. The Revenues. Touching the question of tariff and revenue .the views of the President are as follows: There Is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal perfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the shock and strain to the business world cer tain to attend any serious change in these methods render such change inadvisable un less for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh (he reasons against such a cuange. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires, of the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not nec essarily identical. Of course no change can be made on lines beneficial to, or desired by. one section of one state only. There must be something like a general agreement among the citizens of the several states, as repre sented in the Congress, that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole; and there should then be a sincere. Intelligent, and disinterested effort to make it in such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the people at large with the minimum of neces sary disregard for the special interests of localities or classes. But in time of peace the revenue must on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the expendi tures or else the revenues must be Increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our ex penditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must bo readjusted. It is as yet too early to attempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should be con sidered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In favor of any other nation maxi mum and minimum tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure a certain reci procity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Having in view even larger considerations of policy than those of a purely economic nature, it would, in my judgment, be well to endeavor to bring about closer commercial connections with the other people of this continent. I am happy to be able to announce to you that Russia now treats us on the most-favored-nation basis. Economy in Expenditures. The necessity for economy and a rigid scrutiny of appropriations is made manifest, with this proviso: Yet. in speaking of economy. I must in no wise be understood as advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst ex travagance. To cut down on the navy, for instance, would be a crime against the na tion. To fail to push forward all work on t'e Panama canal would be as great a folly. Currency. The currency question i3 dealt with as follows: Every consideration of prudence demands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not con sist in an adequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which docs not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should be nrade that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than in the less active seasons of the year: so that the currency will contract against speculation, and will expand for the needs of Isgitinrate business. At present the Treas ury department is at irregularly recurring in tervals obliged, in the interest of the busi ness world that is, in the interests of the American public to try to avert financial crises by providing a remedy which should be provided by Congressional action. Federal Elections. On the subject of federal elections, the President says: "The power of the government to protect the Integrity of the elections of its own of ficials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by repeated declarations of the Supreme court. There is no enemy of free government more dangerous and none so in sidious as the corruption of the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it would seem to follow that none would op pose vigorous measures to eradicate it. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption in federal elections. The details of such a law may be safely left to the wise discretion of the Con gress, but it should go as fa as under the constitution it is possible to go. and should include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended te influ ence his act or opinion as an elector: anfl provisions fcr the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations and elec tions of all candidates, but also of all con tributions received and expenditures made by political committees." I desire to repeat this recommendation. In political campaigns In a country as largo and populous as ours It Is inevitable that there should be much expense of an entirely leg'timate kind. This, of course, means that many contributions, and some of them of laree size, must be made, and. as a matter of fact, in any big political contest such con tributions are always mads to both sides. It is entirely proper both to give and receive them, unless there Is an improper motive connected with either gift or reception. If they are extorted by any kind of pressure or promise, express or implied, direct or in direct, in the way of favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes not only im proper but criminal. It will undoubtedly be difficult as a matter of practical detail to shape an act which shall guard with reason able certainty against such misconduct: but If it is possible to secure by law the full and verified publication in detail of all the sums contributed to and expended by the candi dates or committees of any political parties the result cannot but be wholesome. All con tributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be. as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at In corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the national and the several state legis latures forbid any officer of a corporation from using the money of the corporation In or about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money In connections with any legislation save by the employment of counsel in public manner for distinctly legal services. The position of the United States with regard to The Hague confer ence is clearly shown, the desire of the United States for continuance of the world's peace being made appar ent and the necessity for strength to maintain a righteous position insisted upon. Elaborating on the many reasons ex isting for the maintenance of the Monroe doctrine, the message points out how the interests of our southern neighbors are identified with our own and the impossibility of the United States using the doctrine as a means for aggrandizement. The help af forded Santo Domingo in her escape from the importunities of foreign cred itors and rapacious revolutionists at home is shown as a case in point. Army and Navy. The President insists upon the ne cessity for a well trained body of sol diers as a nucleus for an army in time of trouble, and that maneuvers of a practical kind should be under taken to adapt the forces to actual conditions of warfare. An increase in the artillery force so that the coast fortifications can be adequately man ned is also recommended, with lib eral appropriations for the building and bringing to a state of perfection of the United States navy. . Naturalization Laws. Of our present naturalization laws, the message says: During the past year evidence has accu mulated te confirm the expressions con tained in my last two annual messages as to the Importance of revising by appropriate legislation our system of naturalizing aliens. I appointed last March a commission to make a careful examination of our naturalizing laws, and to suggest appropriate measures to avoid the notorious abuses resulting from the improvident or unlawful granting of cit izenship. This commission, composed of an officer of the Department of State, of the Department of Justice, and of the Depart ment of Commerce and Labor, has dis charged the duty imposed upon it, and has submitted a report, which will be transmitted to the Congress for its consideration, and, I hope, for its favorable action. The distinguishing recommendations of the commission are: First. A federal bureau of naturalization, to be established in the Department of Com merce and Labor, to supervise the adminis tration of the naturalization laws and to re ceive returns of naturalizations pending and accomplished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization cer tificates, fees to be charged and procedure. Third. More exacting qualifications for cit izenship. Fourth. The preliminary declaration of In tention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filiug of his petition. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United States district courts and to such State courts as have jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount in con troversy is unlimited: in cities of over 100. 000 inhabitants the United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Laws. Legislation to make our criminal laws more effective and to provide ad equate punishment for breaches of trust by public officals is urged, and the promise made that all the power of the administration shall be devoted to the detection and punishment of such wrongdoers. The President continues: Once again I call your attention to the condition of the public-land laws. Recent developments have given new urgency to the need for such changes as will tit these laws to actual present conditions. The honest dis posal and right use of the remaining public lands is of fundamental Importance. The Iniquitous methods by which the monopoliz ing of the public lands is being brought about under the present laws are becoming more generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective remedies. The rec ommendations of the Public Lands commis sion upon this subject are wise and should be given effect. The policy of creating forest re serves is shown to have met popular approval, as has the initiation of for est reserves. Merchant Marine. On the subject of the merchant ma rine, the message says: To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should have ships of our own and sea men of our own to convey our goods to neu tral markets, and in case of need to rein force our battle line. It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should be chief ly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that American merchants and manu facturers should have to send their goods and letters to South America via Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even on the Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag Is now threatened through the lib eral aid bestowed by other governments on their own steam lines. I ask your earnest consideration of the report with which the Merchant Marine commission has followed its long and careful Inquiry. Praise of the good work of the pen sion bureau with an acknowledge ment of the debt the country owes to the veterans of the Civil war fol lows. Immigration. Continuing, the message shows clearly the necessity for checking the steamship companies in their activity in promoting the importation of unde sirable immigrants, while pointing out how warmly welcome is the man of good health and moral character, who bids fair to add value to the community. An increase in the strin gency of the immigration law is advo cated. On the subject of Chinese immigra tion the message urges the necessity for courteous treatment of the Chi nese students, business and profes sional men who visit this country, while asserting unalterable opposition to the admission of coolies or skilled or unskilled labor from China. Civil Service. Some paragraphs of the message are devoted to an elucidation of the workings of the civil service law. The assertion Is made that the effects of the law have been excellent. A recommendation is made for in creased appropriations and payment of more attention to the needs of the Indians. The Ph:"j.pines. Despite the series of disasters which have afflicted the Philippine islands since the American occupa tion the rinderpest, the locust's, and the drought conditions are shown to have steadily improved and tranquil ity is now almost universal. The Fil ipinos are beginning to realize the benefits of education, and a school at tendance of 70 per cent is the result Referring to trade between the islands and the United States, the message says: A statute In force, enacted April 13. 1904. suspeiids the operation of the cuastwi.ie laws of toe United States upon the trade between the Philippine Island and the United States until July 1. 19u. I earnestly recommend that this suspension be postponed until July 1. 1909. I think it of doubtful utility to apply the coast wise laws to the trade between the United States and the Philippines tinder any circum stances, because I am convlncoU that It will do no good whatever to American bottoms, and will only Interfere and be an obstacle to the trade between the Philippine and the United States; but If the coastwise law must be thus applied, certainly It ought not to bare effect until free trade is eujoyed between tbe peo ple of tbe United States ami the people of tbe Philippine Islands in their respectlTe products. I do not anticipate tat free trade between the Islands and tbe United States will produce revolution in the sugar and tobacco produc tion of tbe Philippine islands. So primitive are tbe methods of agriculture In tbe Philip pine islands, so slow is capital In going to tbe islands, so many difficulties surround a large agricultural enterprise in the Islands, that It will be many, many years before the products of those islands will huTe any effect whatever upon the markets of tbe United States. The problem of labor is atso a formidable one with the sugar and tobacco producers in the islands. The best friend of the KUIiliu in-ople and the jM-ople themselves are utterly o;ped to the admission of Chinese coolie I ilwr. Hence the only solution is the training of Filipino labor, and tbis will take a long time. The enactment of a law by the Congress of the United States making provision .for free trade N-tweeii the inlands and the United States, however, will be of great Importance from a political and senti mental standpoint: and while Its actual bene fit ha doubtles been exaggerated by the peo ple of the Islands, they will accept this meas ure of Justice as an Indication that the people of the United States are anxious to aid the peo ple of the Philippine Islands In every way. nnd especially In the agricultural development of their Ar hipelago. It will aid the Kl I linos without Injnri'ig Interests In America. The President urges that immediate steps be taken for the fortification of Hawaii and the development of the territory on traditional American lines. Admission of Chinese labor under statute restrictions is con demned as leading to a status of ser vility which, the message declares, can never again be tolerated on Amer ican soil. The President says: "Our aim must be to develop the territory on the same basis of stable citizen ship as exists on this continent." Porto Rico. Dealing with the affairs of Porto Rco. the President says: I earnestly advocate the adoption of legisla tion which will explicitly confer American citl enshlp on all citizens of Porto KIco. There Is. in my Judirmi nt. no excuse for failure to do this. The harbor of S in Juan should be dredged and improved. The expen-cs of the Keihr.il court of Porto KIco should be met from the Federal treasury, and not from the Porto Itican treasury. The elections In Porto Ilicu should take piece every four years, and the legisla ture should meet in session every two years. The present form of government in Porto I.lc-o. which provides for the itppointcieut by the President of the members of the executive coun cil or upr house of the legislature, has proved satisfactory and has .umpired consilience in property owners and Investors. I do not deem it advisable at the present time to change thlt form in any material feature. The problem and needs of the Island are Industrial and com mercial rather than political. Discussing the needs of Alaska, the President recommends that the terri tory be given an elective delegate who will be able to speak with au thority on the needs of that section of our country. The message con cludes: Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indias Te-ritory and Okla homa be admitted as one State and that Net Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one Stale. There Is no obligation upuu Us to treat ter ritorial subdivisions, width are milters of con venience only, as binding us n the ijiiestion of admission to statehood. Nothing has taken up more time In the I'oiigress duri ig the pt few years than tbe question a m the statehood to lie granted to the four Territories above men tioned, and after careful coi.sideratlon of all that has been developed in the discussions of the ipiest'on I recommend that they be Im mediately admitted as two Stater. There is no justification for further d-lay: m the ad visability of making the fiajr Territories Into two States has been dearly established. In some of the Te r I lories the legislative as semblies issue licenses for gambling. The Congress should by law forbid tbis practice, the harmful results of which arc envious at glance. The Panama Canal. The treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama, under which the construction of the Panama canal was made possible, went Into effect 'villi its ratllicr.tlou tiy the United States Senate on Feb. "M. VH. The canal proierties of the French Canl Com uny were transferred to the United States on April 2:5. 11) H. on payment of JfliJ.UOn.Wi to that company. On April 1. l'MS. the Commis sion was reorganized, and It now consists of Theodore P. Shouts, chairman. Charles K. Ma goon. Itcnjnuiiu M. Harrod. Rear-Admiral Mor decal T. Kudicott. ltrlg.-Geu. Peter C. Halus. and Col. Oswald H. Krnst. John K. Stevens was appointed thief engineer on July 1 last. Active work in canal construction, mainly pre paratory, has l en in progress for bss than a vear and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceaed to be open to de bate. First, the question of route; the canal will be built on the lthmti of Panama. Sec ond, the question of feasibility; there are no ihyslcal obstacles on this route that American engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious ilithculty. or that will prevent the completion of the canal within a reason able time and at a reasonable cost. This is virtually the unanimous testimony of the en gineers who have investigated the matter for the government. The jmlnt which Tmalns unsettled Is the question of typ. whether the canal shall lie one of several locks above sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. Oi this point I hoiie to lay before tbe Congress at an e-rly i!aj the findings of the Advisory Board of Ameri can and Kuropean Engineers, that st my invi tation have been considering the subject, to gether with the report of the commission there on; and such comments thereon or recommenda tions lu reference thereto as may seem neces sary. What Is needed now and without delay Is an appropriation by the Congress to meet the cur rent and accruing expenses of the commission. The first appropriation of ?1(.iki().lm. out of the $i:"j dhu.imnj autho-lzed by the Snootier act. was made three years ago. It Is nearly es hsusted. There Is barelj enough of It remain ing to carry the comml-slon to the end of the jear. Unless the Congress shall appropriate before that time all w k must cease. To ar rest progress for any leiigth of time now. when matters are advancing so satisfactorily, would lie deplorable. Th-re will lie no money with which to meet a.i-n!l obligations and none with which to mnt MIL coming due for mi terlals and supplies; ami there will be demoral ization of the forces, here and on the Uthmus. now working so harmor.tnu-.Iy anil effectively, if there Is delay In granting an emergency ap oronrlatlon. Kstlcintts of the an omit neces sary will lie found In the aicompanvln re jorts of the Sec etary of War i-ud the com L'issiou. Department of State. Neither at home nor ab oad Is there a nf ficient working force to do the business properly. In many respects the system which was ade quate to the work of twenty-five, or even ten. rars ago. Is Inadequate now. and should be ibiingid. hir consular force should ! rlsssl ti.'d "and apisitntments hoiiM be made to the several clasM-s. with authority t.) the Kticii tlve to assign the meiiln-rs of each class to dutv at such (sists as tbe l.iteret of th- ser vice require. Instead ef the appointments U lug made as at present to specified Posts. There should be an adequate Inspection ser vice, so that the Department mar bp able to Inform itself how the business of each consu late Is being done. Instead of depending upon casual jrlvate Information or minor. The fee svstem should be entlrelr almlbhed. and a due equivalent made In salary to the oU cers who now- eke out their subsistence by means of fees Sufficient provl-ions should be made for a clerical force to every consulate, composed entirely of Ame-lcans. In-tead of the In sutficient provision now made, which compels the employment of great numbers of citizens of foreign countries whose services can be ob tained for less money. At a large rsrt f n eonulates the office quarters and tbe clrbal fo-ce are Inadequate to the performance of the onerous duties Imposed by the recent pruv!sint of our Immigration laws as well as by our In creasing trade. s-ultable p ovislon should bo made for the ex pense f keeping our diplomatic oScers more fullv informed of w-l.at Is being done from day to day In the progresi of our diplomatic affairs with other countries. The lack of uh In'o-matlon. caused by rnnr5c-Ient approp-ia tlo-is available for able tolls and for clerical and messenger service, frequently puts our othcers at a great disadvantage and detracts f.-oin their usefulness. The salnry list should be readjusted. It does not now eorrespond either n ti,- imDortance of tbe servlc-e to be rendered ami the degrees of ability and experience re quired In the different positions, or to ths differences in cue cose oi nin. ia lbs salaries axe quite laadtquat. 

SENATORMILLARD WHERE HE STANDS QN THE RATE QUESTION. INTERVIEWS m PRESIDENT Promises to Stand by Roosevelt on Much Discussed Question Repre sentative Hinshaw of Nebraska Also Sees the President. WASHINGTON. The Evening Star has the following on Senator Millard's rate position: "The attitude of Senator Millard of Nebraska, who is a member of the sen ate committee on interstate com merce, has been one of doubt for some time, but there is strong belief that Senator Millard has pledged himself to the president, voluntarily, to sup port a measure in keeping with the president's views. Senator Millard saw the president a few days ago and had a conference with him. The Ne braska senator is a candidate for re election and there would he absolute ly no chance in the world of his com ing back to the senate if he should go astray on the rate proposition. The Nebraska republicans last year started the habit of indorsing candidates for United States senator in their state conventions. This was done in the case of Senator Burkett. The next state convention, to be held next sum mer, probably will make an indorse ment for a successor to Senator Mil lard. Even in case he stands by the administration on the railroad rate proposition Senator Millard will have a hard time coming to the senate again. Among those who will oppose him are Norris Brown of Kearney, present attorney general of the state; Ross Hammond, a well known editor of Fremont, and Gurdon W. Wattles, a prominent banker and citizen of Omaha." Hinshaw Sees President. Representative Hinshaw saw the president for a few moments. On emerging from the cabinet room Mr. Hinshaw said it was his positive con viction that a rate bill in strict accord with the president's policy would pass both bodies. "The people of Nebraska are unanimous in support of the presi dent's position as to rate legislation." Senator Dolliver of Iowa, a member of the committee on interstate com merce, talked with the president brief ly. After his interview the senator remarked when asked about rate leg islation: "We are now moving along toward a practically unanimous stand for the president's policy." President Silent Until Message. It developed today that the subject under discussion at the White house conference which was participated in by the president. Secretaries Root, Taft and Bonaparte, Senator Knox and Commissioner of Corporations Gar field, was proposed legislation affect ing freight rates. It has been posi tively decided that there shall be no further expression of the administra tion's views on this subject pending the publication of the president's mes sage to congress in which it is treated at great length. It was also learned that there has been no change whatever in the presi dent's view as to the best form of rate legislation. In othe- words, his views have not been affected by any of the propositions recently made public. 

SUBMITS A COPY OF THE RATE BILL WASHINGTON The senate com mittee on interstate commerce receiv ed a copy of the rate bill prepared by the interstate commerce commis sion to be submitted to congress for amendment to the interstate com merce law. The members of the com mittee who were present at the ses sion read the bill, but took no action and adjourned until Friday. The bill is very extensive, covering twenty seven pages of typewritten sheets, and it proposes to amend very materially the present law. 

LORD ROBERTS HAS RESIGNED. Due to Differences with Premier. Bal four. LONDON It is officially announced that Field Marshal Lord Roberts has resigned from the committee for im perial defense in order to take up the organization throughout the country of work connected with his proposals for universal military training. Vis count Eslier. deputy governor of Windsor castle, and Lieutenant Gen eral Sir John French, commander of the First army corps at Aldershot. have been requested to act on the com mittee for imperial defense. The resignation of Lord Roberts is understood to have been to a great ex tent due to differences of opinion be tween himself and other members of the committee on military policy, and especiallj to the fact that Premier Bal four rejected his advice regarding the strength of the forces required for the defense of India. Lord Roberts, by re signing, renounces a salary of ?2,Q00 yearly. IOWA INSURANCE LAW UPHELD BY COURTS WASHINGTON The Iowa state law prohibiting insurance companies from entering into agreements fixing insurance rates is declared constitu tional by a decision of the supreme court of the United States in the case of Beryl F. Carroll. Iowa state audi tor, against the Greenwich Insurance company, et al. The decision reverses the decision of the United States dis trict court of southern Iowa. Carnegie is Finding Fault. SYRACUSE, N. Y. In a letter to the Syracuse library board congratu lating tbe city upon completion of its new $:JOO.O0O library building, Andrew Carnegie, the donor, takes occasion to criticise the commission that erected the building for the expenditure of 118,000, or nearly 10 per cent of the cost of the building, for inspectors' fees, attorneys' fees and architects' fees. Mr. Carnegie says he never heard of such things and knows noth ing as to attorneys in connection with the building of his libraries. THE GUARDS FAIL. Troops Protecting Imperial Family Show Discontent. ST. PETERSBURG The most alarming indication of the spread of the disaffection in the army, extend ing even to regiments near the person of the emperor, was given in the ar rest at Tsarskoe Selo of a number of soldiers belonging to the Yellow Cuir assiers of the Guard, the Hussars of the Guard and the Life Guard Rille ment for presenting a series of peti tions, including one against the use of troops for police purposes. The regiments in question are thoso which have been specially selected by General Trepoff to guard the emperor and his family. They have been counted upon as being loyal to the last, ready even to be torn to pieces in defense of his majesty, like the Swiss guards of Louis XVI. Their ar rest, however, although not for open sedition, shows how the leaven of dis content is working even within the precincts of the imperial park at Tsar skoe Selo. The incident gave rise to most alarming rumors in St. Petersburg, in cluding one to the effect that the em peror actually had been attacked anil that a grand duke had been wounded whilo defending him; but the Asso ciated Press is assured by a member of the imperial entourage at Tsar skoe Selo that this is absolutely un true. UNITED STATES OFFICIAL ATTACKED BY ROWDIES ST. PETERSBURG Robert Wood Bliss, second secretary of the Ameri can embassy, who has just returned here after a three months' vacation in Paris, was the victom of an out rage by rowdies in one of the most fashionable streets of the capital lato last night, and only escaped being beaten to death through the timely arrival of the police. Charge d'Affaires Eddy has report ed the affair to the authorities at Washington, but as the incident was a plain case of rowdyism he probably will not make official representations at the foreign office here unless in structed to do so. HAVE NOT CHANGED MINDS. Canal Consulting Engineers Stick to Their Views. WASHINGTON The five foreign delegates to the board of consulting engineers of the isthmian canal com mission left for New York and will soon sail for their homes. They will meet again in Brussels during the first days of next January. General Davis will go to that city as repre sentative of the American members of the board, and will take with htm the documents which are not yet drawn up and which will then havo to be signed by the foreign delegates. Speaking of published stories that they had reconsidered their first vote, one of the delegates made the follow ing statement: "Whatever we have had to say will be found in the report which will shortly be in the hands of Presurent Roosevelt. That we should cliango our vote on a subject to which ror three months we have given our clos est attention, and should change it merely because some parties are not contented with it, is a great absurd ity." MR.
