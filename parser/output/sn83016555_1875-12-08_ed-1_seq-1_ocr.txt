The message of President Grant, which appears in full in the Republican this morning, is the longest State paper he has ever issued, and it is, withal, the most interesting one. The President prefaces the message with a brief but glowing comparison of the progress of the nation from the day of its birth to this, its hnndredth year. The results are startling, and the comparison striking. From the past hundred years the President gathers hope and promise of the future. His confidence in the free school system, as the greatest of the agencies of a* good and durable govern ment, is evidenced. The exemption of church property from taxation is referred to, and strong recommendations against its continuance urged. Affairs with foreign nations are alluded to as in a favorable condition. Chili, Portu gal, Colombia, Venezuela and the Sand wich Islands are briefly spoken of. Tbe Cuban question receives more attention. Upon this head the message is frank, ex plicit and exhaustive. The President re cognizes the s 1 toggle of the Cuban insur gents as unabated and violent; that the home government has vainly endeavored to suppress it. Yet the Cuban rebellion lacks those features that would justify even an according of belligerent rights. Mediation seems to be tbe only key to the situation. The friendly offices of the government failing in that, intervention would of necessity follow sooner or later. The Mexican free trade zone and the border troubles are briefly referred to. The Court of Alabama Claims is alluded to; an extension of its term recommended, as well as the organization of a tribunal for the trial of the claims of aliens. The subject of international submarine telegraphic lines demands mnch of the President's attention, and the necessity of requiring certain material and mutual concessions belore permitting cables from a foreign nation to be landed on our soil. The question of fraudulent naturaliza tion and expatriation is treated upon at length, and the President reviews some of the suggestions of his last message to Congress. The subject of resumption of specie payment is directly met by the President. A return to a coin basis can not occur too soon, and while the President has no plan which he is prepared to call the best, he is ready to second Congress in any measures they may iake looking to that end. The army and navy are spoken of and some suggestions of the secretaries recommended lor adoption. The centen nial comes in for careful mention and pa triotic recommendation, and all the gov ernment bureaux in their order. The President urges upou Congress action in the suppressing of polygamy in Utah, and an amendment of the laud and mining laws. He cincludes, with a brief recapitulation of his principal sugges tions, a public document which will pro voke more thought, and excite more com ment, probably, than any like do cument has done for years. Amusements. Tbe Buffalo Bill, Texas Jack and Mor* laccni combination continues at the St. Charles Theatre, and to-day will give a matinee performance. Tbe ''Big Bonanza" drew a fine audience at the Varieties Theatre last night. The "Two Orphans" will be given this noon for the last time, and tu-night we are to have the bright little comedy of "Mons. Al phonse," whioh will be well aoted. At the Academy of Musio to-day the "Two Orphans" will also be played for the last time. At night Mr. Barry Sullivan will make his first appearance as Richelieu. Mr. Sullivan is pronounced to be a great and scholarly aotor. He fills the place on the English stage made vacant by Mac ready, and is Joremott in his line of trag. edy. He brings with him as leading sup port Mr. J. F. Cathoart, a fine aotor, who was last seen here in oonjunotion with Mr. Charles Kean, and the pieces in whioh Mr. Sullivan is to appear are sure to be well east. Interesting to Clabs and Societies. The New Grand Union Hotel, now rapid ly approsohing completion in Philadelphia, announces that the management is pre pared to make special arrangements with olubs and socit ties, for the price ot board during the Centennial months. The Grand Union, moreover, is admirably ananged to accommodate parties from a half dozen to a hundred, affording every hotel comfort at moderate charges. It has the finest loca tion of any hotel in the oity, is within qnick and easy access to the Centennial build ings, and has a capaoity for 2000 guests. Its manager, Theo. Russell, Esq., is one of the moet popular and widely known hotel proprietors in the United States, and we would recommend those of our readers who intend visiting Philadelphia during the Centennial to aot on that timely hint. Lnfiiea' Fair at Grnaewald Hall. The fair given by the Ladies' Aid Sewing Society for the benefit of the Touro In firmary, is in the full tide of snooess. The hall was filled with vis tors last evening, and the young ladies were charmingly en tertaining at the different booths, the floral arbor, gjpey tents, postoffioe, cafe Parisian, and other resorts. An agreeable feature of the entertainment is the dancing, whioh the young folks enjoy at ten o'clock each eve ning. The fair will oontinue until farther notice. _ Compliment to American Manufac turers.— Professor Tnrle, who lately re signed the position whieh ho has held for over fifty yean as organist of Wsetmfnister Abbey, London, has purchased for his own ■scene of George Woods A.

ROUTE TO THE BORDER. Galveston, December 6,1875. I arrived here Sunday evening on the John A. Dix, Captain Freeman, all well. We left New Orleans last Thursday morning early, but stormy weather compelled ns to seek safety in such harbors as could be found. The recruits on board, under charge of Commander Kells, are in good spirits, bat seem anxious to enter on active service. Paymaster Machette, on the Dix, thinks that a quiet life on the Canonicus is pre ferable to rolling around in the turbulent gulf. While we were in Sabine Pass waiting for good weather, Captain Freeman took a look at the lighthouse, as there appeared to be something out of order. 1 visited the tower with him and founc that the outer wiudows had been broken, but the Keeper, Crossman, had patched up the glass .*» well as he could. Wild geese and dneks, at tracted by the glare during the night, had flown against the windows and broken the panes, thus changing the appearance of the light. I learned in Sabine of the loss, in the September gale, of a schooner, npt reported before. Its name was Witch of the Wave, plying between this city and Sabine. Noth ing has been heard of her, and there is no hope that anything will ever be heard of the vessel. At Sabine City I learned that abont 10,000 bales of ootton will go out of that river this season, all of which goes to Galveston, by schooner, the freight or whioh is only ninety cents per bale. In former times not less than 30,000 bales were shipped from Sabine, but the largest portion now goes up the river to the railroad and finds its way to St. Louis. Here is a cheerful crumb for New Orleans cotton men to chew on. The owners of every bale of this cotton, I am told, prefer to send their staple to New Or leans, if they could, taking the same chances that they now own. I find this oity in a tolerably flourishing condition, and I can see no marks of tbe September storm. There are twenty-two barks, six ships, two steamships aud a dozen schooners in por% all ready to take ootton, and they will get good loads, since commercial men are doing a healthy busi ness. The Dix will leave here to-day, if she can, but the sky looks bad aud the barometer is falling.___ _ DUN McPARIS. The President's Message. We present to the readers of the Repub lican this morning the President's message in fall. The general imbecility and in capacity of the Washington management of the Associated Press culminated yesterday in the information that only a synopsis of the message, a column long, or so, could be sent in the usual way. This forced the daily papers ot New Orleans to make other ar rangements, which they were enabled to do, fortunately, through Mr. E. W. Barnes, manager, and his accomplished assistants of the Western Union Telegraph Company. The Temperature. The thermometer at Louis Frigero's, No. 50 Chartres street, stood as follows Decem ber 7: At 8 A. M., 48°; at « P. M., 55°; at 6 P. M., 55°. Lowest point daring tbe night of December 6, 45°. Rain during the evening ol December 6, one-twentieth of inch. The Late Vice President's Own Account of his Early Life. Mr. Z. L. White, the Washington corre spondent of the New York Tribune, has an interesting letter of personal reminiscences of the late Vioe President in a recent issue of that paper, in the oourse of whioh he says: In a conversation about two years ago on the subject of labor organizations, ana tbe condition of the laboring olaases of this country now when compared with what it was fifty or even thirtjr rears ago, he gave me a brief sketoh of his boyhood and early manhood, and although the leading fact* whioh he reoited have belore been published, the narrative as he related it will be nose the less interesting, and I transcribe it irom notes whieh I made at the time: "I was born," he said, "in 1812, and at the age of ten years was put out as an appren tice to a farmer. From the day of my birth to the day I was twenty-one years old I never had a dollar in money to spend for anything. Daring the whole of my ap prenticeship my master never bnt once gave me a penny. On that occasion he allow* ' me a holiday with permission to attend _ master seven miles from home, and gave me three cent* to spend. I walked to and from the muster, and of oonrse spent no more than that snm. "On the day I was twenty one years old, I remember it very well, one Haturday, the sixteenth of February, in the afternoon, my master gave me a yoke ot oxen and six sheep. The latter I sold the same after noon for $9, but, not beiDg able to dispose of the oxen that day. I requested my mas ter to kqep them for me until Mouday morning, whioh he did, bat charged me fifty oents for it. I paid him this and took tbe oxen away. I sold them to a man for $75 and took his note for the amount, bo, when I became of age, I bad, for eleven years' work (l was sent to school only fonr weeks each year), $84. I had saved fiftv seveu oents, which 1 had in some way ob tained, but I had paid fifty of this to my master for keeping my oxen two nights. I then hired myself to a farmer, agreeing to work for $6 a month and board. 1 used to get np long before daylight, feed the stock, get my breakfast and, just as the east was beginning to be streaked with red, start off for the woods with my team. 1 used to place my dinner pail on the sunny side of a tree, and oontinne drawing saw logs to the mill until after dark at night. Then I went home, fed the stock, ate my sapper and went to bed. My father tended the sawmill most of the time for many years for fifty oents a day. "In the spring of the same year I took my pack upon my baok and started afoot for the town where I now live, Natick, Massa chusetts, 100 miles away, and that journey cost me just $1 25. I forked there at shoe making, averaging fifteen hours a day, and the last week's work I did at the benoh was at bottoming -hoes for $5 a week. Oat of this I paid fifty oents for pegs and $2 for board, so that I had left just $2 50. I have bottomed fifty-four pairs of men's shoes without sleeping, and that for a little more than fifty cents. But even at this rate I got some money ahead, and made np my mind to work my way throngh college, l lent my money to a man in Boston, and went to the academy at Conoord, New (three?) months when the man _______ had intrusted my fortune tailed, and I lost it ail.

The New Orleans German Gazette , of No vember 15, contained an interesting article on tbe subject of "churoh propaganda among the negroes." The mission commit tee of the Episcopal Church, in session at Louisville, debated the question: How to bring the negro within the Episcopal Church? The fact was elicited that tbe Catholic Churoh is now oooupied in solving this question in its favor. The Gazette says this truth must forcibly strike the attentive observer in Louisiana, aud asserts "there are no Catholic churches founded and fre quented exclusively by colored people." The clergy has not at any time made a dis tinction of color, while the Protestants have closed their doors and forced tbe colored people to erect their own churches and plaoes of worship. In New Orleans alone there are thirty two Protestant churches exclusively frequented and supported by colored people. "White snd black," says the Gazette, "kneel and pray together in our Catholic churches, from the St. Louis Cathedral to thesmall-st chapel, while the Piotestant 'nigger' could not dare to visit the highly fashionable Presbyterian chnroh of the Rev. Palmer, on Lafayette Square." It is not, therefore, wonderful that Catholics have achieved some success among the ne groes, and the conversions increase aston ishingly from year to year. The Gazette thinks that, outside of the religious, there is a political aspect of the conversions to Catholicism. To the ques tion; Will the negro vote the R-tpublioan ticket as before? it answers that it is doubt ful; for, although the Catholic Church has practically maintained an equality of the races in worship, communion and bnrial, its tendency is decidedly Southern Demo cratic or even Confederate. A paper more openly Confederate than the Morning Star, under the control of the Archbishop, the official organ of the churoh in l^ouisiana, docs not exist the South over. From this fact the Gazette deduces, considering the domination of the clergy over the family and all the relations of private life, that the negro, who has heretofore blindly voted the Radioal ticket, will just aa blindly vote the Democratic ticket presented to him by the priest in the confessional, under the penalty of losing tbe absolution of his sius and eternal life if he dares to vote the Re publican ticker. So far we have followed the Gazette. Its statemei ts are eminently worthy of con sideration. Why dot s it confidently assert "at elections, on every political question, the influence and weight of the Catholic churoh will always be found with the Dean • oratio partj f" It is plain language, uttered by a journal ooonpying an independent position, yet quite conservative in its views. The inferenee must be that its declaration is well founded. Will the Catholio authori ties reply to the oharge, or by silence give it additional weight 1 Nothing is mere oertsin than the fact that race separation is a source of weakness to Protestantism, and of strength to Catholic ism. Shall this suicidal policy be longer continued? This is the serious question presented to Protestants. As a chnroh matter, the negro may be left to the rivalry of tbe two branches of the Christian world with the assurance that he will be provided for. Politically, it is of deep oonoern to all who favor a separation of the oh arch and State to rebuke the pretensions of a olergy in league with a political party. As Repub licans we must be prepared to repel the in sidious attack contemplated by the Gazette.

Mr. Blaine, of Maiue, rising to a personal explanation, said that in the debate yester day on tbe Louisiana question he had ex pressed the hope that the other side of the House would nor, in an incidental way, at tempt to reopen and dishonor the agree ment made last year. Some persons had imagined that the word "dishonor" had been used by him with some desire to im pute it to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Lamar) as a personal affront. He had used it only in the sense of nullifying and disregarding, and not with the remotest idea of off-ring an attront to that gentleman. He (Mr. Lamar) knew if their relations were not intimate they had been nothing else than entirely cordial at all times, and that it most be the furthest from his design at any time to say anything to him wounding or otherwise dissgreeable to his feelings. Mr. Lamar said he had not heard the word whioh the gentleman from Maiue was reported as having said, and that even if he had heard it he would have believed that it had dropped from him inadvertently in the heat of debate, for he believed that the gentleman was incapable of offering a gra tuitous insult to himself or any other gen tleman. He accepted the explanation in the generous spirit in which it was made. Alter the Oommiitee had returned, and the choice of seats was accorded to the oldest continuous member, Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, the drawing for seats oc curred. Mr. Mehnffv, clerk, read the message, the reading of which occupied two hours and five minutes. At first it was listened w with consider able interest and attention, but after the Clerk had got past tbe paragraphs relating to education, churoh property, and the Cuban question, tbe members began gradu ally to ieave their Beats, retiring to the cloak rooms, loitering listlessly in the aisles, engaged in conversation with each other, so that during the reading of the latter half there were not probably forty membeis in their sea's, and not half of that number were paying the slightest attention to the message, lu fact, were it not for the monotonous tone of the Clerk's voice, it might have been supposed t.bat the House was indulging in a recess. The mesiage was ordered printed. Mr. Cox, of New York, presented a peti tion of Mr. W. H. Tresoott and others, of South Carolina, with reference to tbe right of representation of the third congressional distriot of South Carolina, and moved 'hat it be referred to the Committee on Elec tions. He said that the question raised by the memorial was not so much that ol a repeeentative as it was that of representa tion. The petition was so referred. An adjournment until Friday then took place. _
