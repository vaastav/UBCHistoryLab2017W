What they have already ac complished in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experiment of employing us freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, aud the general and urgent desire expressed by tlu ui for the education of their children, may be taken a* sufficient proof that tin y will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they coipiuue to IK- wisely and lnirly guided by the Indian policy sketched in the report of tin- secretary of the in terior, the object of which is to make liberal provision for th» education of Indian vouth ; I to settle the Indians upon farm lot* in"sever altv ; to give them title in fee to their farm* inalienable for a certain number of vears; sud j when their wants are provided for to dis posed by sale of tin- lands on their reservations ' not occupied aud UM-iI bv them ; a fund to be ! .formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians which will gradually relieve the govern ment of the expenses now provided for by an sua! appropriation, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians aud as also calcu lated to remove those obstructions which fne ex ' istciicc of large reservations prevents, to the set- : tkinent ami development of the country. I I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of i a law enabling tin- government to give Indians a title in fee inalienable for twenty live years to i the farmlands assigned to tluni by allotment, I and a.'so repeat the recommendation made in my rfirst annual message, that a law be passed ad milting ludians, who can give satisfactory proof ->t having, by their own tabor, supported their families lor a number of years, and who are will mg to detach themselves from their tribal rda 1 lions, to the beiiclit of the lioiucrdcud act, aud to I grant them patents containing the same provi- I anon of inalienability for a certain period.

AOBICI • LrfISAL INTEREST a. -M.v recommendations in former ines s are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the department of agnet 1- tiir". Agriculture is tho lead ins- interest and the pornianent industrv of our peo ple. it is to the ahimdanc of agricultural prodnetioii as compared with out home consumption and the largely increased and highly profitable maiket abroad w'liieii we have enjoved in recent vears thutwearo mainly i'-dolited for our pre sent prosperity us a people. We must look i ir us continued m lintuinan :e to the same substantial resources. There is no hruneli of industrv in which labor direct ed hy s.-i ai'ilir knowledge yields siie.i in.-leased p odu- tion with unskilled labor, mid no brunch at' thy public service to which the en.uuragenient of liberal ap propriations em lie more appropriately e\t- mled. The omission to render such ni l is n ,t a wise economy, but, on the contrary, lindouhtedlv results in losses ol iiiim. use sums annii illv that might lie saved through well directed dibits by the government to promote this vital interest. I In-results already accomplished with t he limited means heretofore placed at the command of the department of agricul ture is an earnest of what may lie expected w jih increased appropriations for the sev eral purposes indicated in the report of the commissioner with a view to placing the department upon a footing which w ill enable it to prosecute more ell'cctivelv the objects for which it is established.' Ap propriations are needed for a inoic com plete laboratory, for the establishment ol a veterinary division and a division of for estry. and for an increase of force. The reinforcements for these and other pur poses indicated in the report herewith .submitted, of the immediate necessities of the department, will not involve any ex penditure ot money that tlio country can not with propriety now undertake in the interest ot agriculture. Eprc.vno.v.u, MATTEBS. It is ffratifyimt to learn from tho -.urean | of edueation the extent to which educa tional privileges throuirhout the United States have been advaneeddnrimr the year. No more fundamental responsibility- rests upon ennj-rc: s than that of devising ap i propriate measures of financial aid to ed ueation, supplemental to local action in the states and territories and the District i of ('olunibiii. i The wise forethought of the founders of | our government has not only furnished j the basis lor the support of the comnion sehool systems of the newer states, l ot laid foundations for the foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and tlie mechanical I nrts—pleasures in aeeordaneo with tliis 1 traditional policy. The further benefit | of all these interests and the extension of the same advantages to every portion of I the country, it is hoped will receive vour favorable consideration HIE NATIONAL LIBRARY. To preserve and perpetuate tlie national literature should be among the foremost cares of the national legisluture. The li . brary gathered at tho capital still remains , unprovided with nnv suitable aceonimo- I dations for its rapidly increasing stores. Tlie niagnitude and importance of the col lection increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright bv do ; most ie and foreign exelmnges, and hy the 1 seientitie library of th 3 Smithsonian insti tution, call for building aeeommodalions which shall be at once equal and lirc , proof. The location of such a public build l mg which should provide for the pressing necessities df the present and for tlie vast ; increase of tho nation's books in the fu ture, is a matter which addresses itself to j the discretion of congress. It is earnestly ! 1 recommended as a measure which should i unite all sull'iages and which sliou'd 110 '• longer be delayed. 1 Till: WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. In a former message, impressed with the importance of tho subject, I have taken oe-easion to recommend to eoicios tlie adoption of a generous poliev t<rwai d tlie .listnet ot Columbia. The report cl itic e itninissioners ol tlie district herewith transmitted, contains sugg stions and re eoinmen lations, to all ol whieli 1 earnest ly invite your careful attention. I ask >■'"{■ ,u !'y and lavorable consideration ol tlie ;ii ws \vliieli they express: to the uiaent iii-ed ol legislation for tiie reclama tion ol the marshes of the l'otomae and its eastern branch, within tiie limits of the ei.y. and tor tlie repair of tlie streets of 1 1 ' ■'•'l'dol. licit tolore laid with wooden mocks and , 10 w by decay rendered almost iiupassiole and a source of imminent iiaii«4t*r tu the he .ltli Dl* its citizens. The means at tlio disposal of the coininissiou er, are wholly inadequate for the aeeoni pilsliuient ot those important works aud s.ioul,, , suppi.-n: ailed 1} limelv appro pnations from the federal treasury. The U 'yis tue 'lilts at the 11 ont 111 ihe eit V v. .11 add lo toe Villi.' of adjaeeut iaiu/s and parks now owned by'the United States, a la rye ami valuable domain so Hi eient, it is thought. to rciinbitrso its entiri cost, ami will also as an incidental rcsnli meurethe (STinaiient improvement of tin li\ or for the purpose of na\ i.ation. Having iu\ ested rongi-css with supreme ami exclusive jurisdiction over the district of Columbia, its ••iti/.eiis must of liceessitv look to congress abai ■ for all needful leg islatioli all'ecting tlieir interests, and all the territoiv of t nis district is tin? common property ol the people of the United St: tes. who, cipiullr with its resident citi zens, are interested in the prosperity ol tlieir capital. I cannot doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measure you mav adopt for this purpose. I also Invite the favorable consideration ot countess to the wants ot the puluie schools of this district as exhibited in the report of the commis sioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing. no adeipiate provision exists' for a correspniidinir increase ot school accommodation, and the commis sioners are u itliout the means to meet this urgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school purposes are rented and are in inijMutant particulars tinsuited for tie- purpose. Tile cause of popular education in the district of Columbia is surely entitled to tlics tine consideration at the hands of tic national government as in the several states and territories, to which magnificent grants of the public lands have been made tor He endowment of schools and universities.
