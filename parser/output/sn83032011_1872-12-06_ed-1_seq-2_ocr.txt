c XT 4t tc oIoliuvtbuti T1LOOMSBURG, PA, Friday, .Deo. 6' HOIUCL' GREELEY. It Is with sorrow moat gonutno and rrprot unalloyed that wo announce tlio death of tho distinguished Journalist nnd Btnteaman whoso namo heads this nrtlclo. Ho was, porhaps, at tho tlmo of hU passing away tho foremost American of tho day, although years may lntervono boforo tho full morlta of his dooils aro known and admitted. As an editor ho had no suporlor if in doed ho had an equal. Ills stylo of writing was conclso, forclblo, original and convincing. Probably no ono man in tho country ovor moulded public opinion and gavo shapo and form to national moasuros to so groat an extent as Horaco Greoloy. To him moro than anyono belongs tho credit of tho eman cipation of tho negroes. IIo was fear loss In hU utterances whon convinced of tholr truth and noco3sIty; ever ready to aid tho oppressed ; Ingenious and Htrong in tho dofenco of his opinions. Ills private life was blamoloss j ho was conscientious, pure, torn penx to and eharltabio; ho was tho hardest of wnrkir mill on looklnp back over tho many year 0? montal toll which ho has uudcrgonu tho wonder Is that ho ha'l not soquor broken down. Tho world U poorer for liis death and tho void bo 1ms loll will bo hard to All. From all parts of tho country and from all classes of men, municipal bodies, xoclctlK., religious associations, polltl elans mid clergymen, tho rich and tho poor, uomo expressions of sorrow; and from hundred of pulplts,sermon3 wero preached on tho Sunday following his death, whoso text was, tho llfo of tho farmer's boy, who had raised himself to a position secoud to none In this broul land nf ours. Wo liavo had no sympathy with him politically and supported blm In' the recent diction only as tho leader In tho pirty of rof rm, but wo have no heslta tlou in bearing witness to tho extraor dinary ability with which ho advocated his own views, ovm whon most op posed to our own. Wo mourn for him, becauso the world contains too fow of such manly, courageous, able, zealous defenders of tbclr fellow men, not to feel tho fall of such a leader among them. Tho circumstances surrounding his death aro tragical ; the loss of his wife, followed by'his own defeat In tho campaign, were too much for tho earn est and ardent spirit to bear and tho mighty mind gavo way. There is nothing in the annals of our country's politics one-half so Bad as this. It will bo long, wo bellove, boforo Horace Greeley's loss to mankind will bo made good; beforo wo "look upon his liko again." Ills busiest of busy lives merits a peacaful rest. Ctcd grant It. Missing. Tho Now York World published, last week,a list of no less than fifty.two peo ple who have mysteriously disappeared from that city since August last. Some of these, it is truo, are restored to their friends but tho greater number aro novcr heard from. Now and then ono is discovered to bo a defaulter, who has absconded with tho money of his cred itors and upon this tho community hears with upathy tho noxt report of "missing," ascribing it to tho former cause. In a city of tho sizo of New York it Is of course to bo expected that crime will provall.but these mysterious disappearances havo become bo numer ous as to create a feeling of alarm amongst those whoso business calls them at times to the city, and a feollng of Insecurity is rapidly growing iu tho country. The very loose administra tion of criminal law in New York, tho Immunity given to political ruffians and tho consequent increase in crime is doing serious Injury to tho groat me tropolis. Its citizens owo it to them selves to revolutionize- this stato of alt'dirs nnd to replaco ignorance, vonal lty nnd unfitness in Judicial ofllco, by probity, ability and honesty. Now York's murder list alouo is enough to deter strangers from visiting the city tweuty-ono murderers being now In tho Tombs. Is hanging for murder "played out" in New York? Tho "limes" on Mr. Grcclcj's Death. Lord Bacon concludes ono of those ro markablo essays by which, rather than by tho Now Organon or Dy any of tho literary or public labors of his llfo, his fauaehasbeeu transmitted to subsequent generations, with thoso words: "Death huth this also, "that it oponeth the gate to good fame and extinguished) envy." Tho Timet in Its remarks upon Mr. Greeley's death docs not falter in ex hlbltlng itself an exception to that rule. At tho bcdsldo oflhe dylngjournalist, and now bosldo tho coffin which con tains his mortal remains, the Timet has planted Itself to shut tho gato to the good famo with which a nation is hastening to decorate bis tomb, and publishes the gnawing envy which not Death itself can extinguish in lgnoblo hearts. "Died of Liberal Republicanism" is tho epitaph which tho fat-witted,brutal Jennings hustles aside tho mourning daughters of Greeley to chalk upon his coffin-lid. "Greeley was the Tribune; without him it Is an empty shell," is the legend which tho thrifty Jones reads on tho pennies bo makes haste to snatch from tho dead man's eyes. Was over shell so empty as that tho hapless Raymond loft ? World. fho Pittsburg Gazette says "tho elec tion of Grant was a test of the Intelli gence of the American people." A majority of tho white people votod for Groeloy; ergo, tho negroes are moro intelligent thau tho whlto voters. It is pleasant for whlto Republicans to know Just what estimato their frlonds put up. on them. Erie Ofitervtr. oraco (ircclor.

During thn period mentioned ho also edited nnd publlslioil snveral political campaign papers, in 1811 ho commenced the pun- lleatlon of tho "Now York Tribune," with which successful Journal his namo has baen thoroughly ldontlflod. In 1818 ho was olected to tho U. a.

Mr. Oreo ev about this it mo became prominent as an author, nnd during tho remainder oi ins ino puousned many treatises on various subjects, and inter esting accounts of his Journeylngs through Europe, una through dtlTcront narCs of tho United States. Ills most ox- tended work Is "Tho Groat American Conflict," giving n history of tho ro bclllon, and tho causos which produced It. His other works aro "Glances nt Eu ropo," published in 1852; "Art nnd In dustry, as Represented In tho Exhibi tion of tho Crystal Puluco. New York," In 1853; the completion of Sargent's "Llfo of llcury Clay," In 1853 ; "A His tory of tho Struggle for Hlavory Exten sion or Restriction in tho United Statos from 1787 to 1850." In 1850, after no overland Journey to California ho pub lished "A Journey to PIko's Peak." Mr. Greeloy also published "Recollec tions of a Busy Lire, "Essays on Polltl cal Economy,"" WhatI Know of Farm ing," and "Letters from Texas aud tho' Lowor Mississippi." In 18G1 Mr. Greeloy was a Presiden tial Elector for Now York; In 18GG ho was u delegate to ino ".Loyalists' Con vention." held in Philadelphia, and iu 1SG7 lie was a mombor of tho Now York Constitutional Convention. In May. 18G7. ho becamo ono of tho sureties on the bail bond of Jefferson Davis, and his course excited great commient, both favorable and tho rovorso. In Novom bor, 18G7, ho was appointed Minister to Austria, by President Johnson, and was continued by tuo souate, out no declin ed the position. In May, 1872, Mr. Greeloy was nominated for tho Presi dency by a Convention of Liberal Re publicans, sitting at Cincinnati, nnd ho was subsequently, in July, accepted as a candldato by tho Democratic Conven tion, which assembled at Baltimore In tho ensuing political campaign, Mr. Greeley strenuously exerted all his pow ers of argument, both in writing and in speaking, and delivered ovor sixty ad dresses during a very short period pre vious to tho election. IIo was, howover, unsuccessful. His labors in tho political Hold, together with a severe domestic atlletion, prostrated his nervous system, and his great strength of constitution was unable to support tho shock. THE (UtKAT 

JOUKXAMST BEAD. New Yonic, Nov. 29, 1872. Mr. Greoley always said ho did not expect to carry either tho State of Ver mont or Malno, yet the result of the State elections there, September 4 and 10,respectively,mado him moro despon dent than ever. Georgia gavo tho Democrats a rousing majority on tho m oi uctooer, and his spirits rose pro portionately, but when, six days later, Ohio and Pennsylvania iravo larcro ma jorities for tho Administration candi dates, and whilo tho result in Indiana was still In doubt, ho becamo UTTERLY DESPONDENT, and for tho first timo his most intlmato friends becan to perceive tho defeat in November might prove fatal to him. Ho talked ono moment of offering tho portfolio of Secretary of State to Mr. Charles Jb rancis Adams, and in tho next breath he would lament a lanro falliner off in the subscription lists of tho Tri bune. Such outbursts of Incoherent ex pressions, followed by paroxysms of rage, now became moro frequent and spontaneous. They camo involunta rily as it wero, and always excited anx ious apprenensions among bis friends, but they wero attributed to tho fact tnat no was too mucn deprived or sleep while watching beside his wife. THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE. On tho rnornlntr of October 30th. Mrs. Greeley died. Wnen the widowed hus band was Informed of his wifo's death he wrunu his hands, cried'liko a child. and said, "Oh I why didn't you let mo sit up with her-? Why did you send mo to bed.- My poor wiroi My poor wife I" Two days afterward Mrs. Greeley was burled. Her remains wero followed to tho grave by a large con courso of people, all of whom noticed Mr. Greeley's grief. lie roturned after tho funeral to Mr. Johnson's but instoad of interesting himself about his daughters and tho fu ture, gavo way wholly to dejection. It was then ho showed tho first positive ovldenco of MENTAL DERANGEMENT. Tho November election seemimrl v did not interest him ; his dofeat did not seem to surprise him ; ho decelvod his menus Dy receiving tno news with per fect indifference. It was noticed about this time, however, that ho would tell his private business to evory ono with whom no was brought in contact, and to each ono ho told a different story of his dereat.hls troubles, and tho infideli ty of his supposed friends. Ho would at times)donounce tho democratic party, whom ho would accuse of selling out tho Administration ; then he would vio lently criticise tho "courso pursuod by tho opposition nowspapers, and espe cially tho inlsuianageniont of tho Tri bune, and niS FATAL MISTAKE in allowing his name to bo used as a candidate for tho Presidency. Mr. Alvln J, Johnson was his most intimate friend, and ono ovenlng, whllo holding bis hand, Mr. Grooley said to him, "A. J., do you know I made a terrible mis- tako about Mr. Dana. Ho was right about that 'On to Richmond I' Often after that, when ho was unablo tosleop, anu wniio msuiseoso was yei in lis in clploncy, Mr. Greoloy would tako Mr. Johnson to bis room, aud with his hands clasped, he would Impart to him tho most intlmato secrets of his heart. THE LAST I1LOW. It was during this period that he wroto his card resuming tho editorship of tho Tribune, published on Novom ber 7. Ho was inexpressibly shockod whllo reading tho Tribuneon thofollow Ing morning to find an editorial artlclo headed. "Crumbs of Comfort." occupy ing as conspicuous a position as that of nis card. J. n is arucio, it win do re membered, spoke of tho Tribune as hav inir been used as "a sort of federal era- ploymont agency, and said that for twelve yoarsovory red-nosed politician who had cheated at tho caucus and fought at tho polls, looked to tho editor or tno Tribune to securo nis appoint mont as a gauger or army chaplain, or as minister to France, and then closed with an insult to friends who had stood by Mr. Greeley during the cam paign. It wai wiltlcn under tbo supervision of Mr. Whltelaw iiciu, wno ntui acted as editor of tho TWAund'durlng the polltl cal canvass, and was inserted in tho columns of tho Tribune without Mr. Qreolov'a know o Jco. Mr. Grooley has toned to tho Tribune otlico, and there wrote a card denylnsr thercsponsibllity for tho abuslvo artlclo, aud regretting its publication, this denial no sent to his old friend, Mr. Thomas N, Rookor, v THE COLUMBIAN foroman of tho Sribune printing offico, ordorlng It to bo placed at tho fioad of tho Tribune columns on tho following morning. THE DENIAL DID NOTAITKAR It was Bunnrcssod lato at ulehtby Mr. Whltelaw Roid. On tho following day tho Domncratle nnwsnancra flamed UP In just Indignation on tho "Crumbs of Comfort" article. They naturally os sumed that Mr. Greeloy wa Ms author, nml accused lilm of thobtackest lneratl tudo. Their rcbuko and taunts deoply affected tho veteran editor. Recogniz ing tho Importance of an laimcdiato denial of any knowlcdgoof tho nrtlclo, he scut Mr. Reid another disclaimer, ordorlng Its insertion iu tho noxt day's Issue. This donlal wosalso suppressed, and up to this very hour tho Demo cratic Journals In the West and South are bitterly denouncing Mr. Greoloy under tho supposition that ho is tho au thor of tho artlclo In question. REASON DETHRONED OF ITS l'OWER. Mr. Groeloy novcr again visited tho Tribune editorial room. To a frlond whom ho met thrco days later ho said, In a honoloss tono of volco, "I don't go to tho Tribune olllco any moro. I havo no business there, bnt I want a thou sand dollars. If you got it for mo" after a lomr pauso. as If ho had suddon ly forgotten what he was talking about "I am ruined." When his mind was recalled to tho thousaud dollars, Mr. Grcolov told his frlond that ho might loavo tho money with tho cashier of tho Tribune, and It might roach him, but ho did not go to tho Tribune office any moro. 1118 LAST JOURNALISTIC REPORT. On Septomber 8, nftor tho printing of ms lamous card an editorial nrticio ap peared in tho Tribune, boadod "Conclu sions." (K was simply a summing up oi tno result or tno elections in Mr, Qroolo.v's old stylo, beclnnliict tho para graphs with numerals. This was his last professional effort. About this time ho rovlscd fivo nrtlclcs which ho had carefully prepared for nn encyclo pedia. They nro entitled "Abolition," "Agriculture." "Antl-Masonrv." "Cau cus," nnd "Southern Confederacy," tho latter being nis history or tho Amori can conflict, condensed into thirty pages oi manuscript. A CONVERSATION WITH 'SIR. GREELEY AT THE "TRIUUNE" OFFICE. Col. Ethan Allen, chairman of tho lato National Llboral Republican Exe cutive Commlttoe, Informs a Sun ro portor that ho had a long conversation with Mr. Greoloy at tho Tribune office Boon after tho election. The colonel does not romembor tho oxact dato, but it was probably on tho 8th of Novem ber. Colonel Allen says that during tho election excitement in uctouer, no saw Mr. Greeley only at intervals, as ho was constantly engaged in watching by his dying wifo's bedside. Whon ho ontored Mr. Grceloy's private office at tho tlmo roferrcd to, ho was surprised at tho warmth of tho grcotlng which ho re ceived. Mr. Greeley stretched both hands, and putting Col. Allen's extend ed palm between thorn, said, "I am glad to soe you, and thank you for your heroic efforts In my behalf." Tho old man's eyes becamo moist at tho samo tlmo, and the tears trickled slowly down his face. Tho sight of bo much qmotion by Mr. Greeloy was something new to Mr. Allen, who replied. "Mr. Grooley, tho people will look on you as another Henry Clay. You aro too great to bo President." "Oh! it ain't that," was Mr. Greeley's answer, "I don't caro for politics, and would not go on tho cars to Washington to get a commission as President. What I do fool," continued Mr. Greeley,"ls the I033 of my wifo.who has boon ray companionfor nearly forty years. I have watched by hor bedsldo night and day, and now 1 am COMPLeTELY 

WORN OUT from unxioty and want of sleep, but am obliged to come back to tho Tribune, where my services aro neoded.'-' After conversing further with Mr. G. who promised to dino with his visitor at his home' Colonel Allen took bis leave, and has not seen him since. The San roportor asked tho Colonel whether ho thought thcro was any foundation for tho idlo rumors to tho effect that Mr. G. had spent tho mo3t of his money on the election, and that its loss had effectod him. Colonel Allen scouted tho idea, and cited an Instance of tho little valuo Mr. G.' placed on money. He said Mr. G. called on him Boon after bis nomination, and tendered him ono thousand dollars as a portion of his sharo of tho political expenses. Colonel Allen told him there wero oth ers who could afford to contribute, and declined totakoit. Mr, Greeloy inform ed him that ho intended giving $5,000, and Insisted on Colonel Allen accopting tho money, saying that if he did not ac coptlt ho would give it tosomoonoolso. Colonel Allen said that Mr. Greeley did not manlfestany concern whatover in re gard to tho money. ON WEDNESDAY, NOV. 13, Hon. Rutin F. Andrews was requostod to meet Mr. Greeloy at the bouse of a mutual friend, in this city, in relation to a matter of business which personally concerned Mr. Greoley. "I wont to tho house," Bays Mr. Andrews, "and was ushered into Mr. Greoloy'a presence. When I first saw him I was greatly sur prised at his personal appearance ; in deed, I should scarcely havo known him, so changed and emaciated was he, had I not understood that I was in his presence. I addressed htm cheerfully and cordially, as in former times. He got in a moody state, and at first mado no response, x was snocKeu at receiv ing no answer and pained at tho indlf fcrenco and hesitation which he mani fested. I saw at onco that something was wrong. Mr. Greeley rose from his seat as some members of tho household camo into tho room. He ushered mo Into an adjoining apartment, and thoro sat down. Tho first expression ho utter ed was, 'Rufus, I am HOPELESSLY GONE.' I said. "What Is tho matter. Mr. Greeley ?"" He said again, "I amhopo lessly gono." I Bald, "I am sorry, Mr. Greeloy, to soe you lnthlsstate of mind. 1 Know you navosuuereu intensely in the loss of your wife, but I hope your defeat has not had a tendency to depress you. Tho American pooplo esteem you as much as ever. Tho result of tbo Pres idential election docs notarise from any want of appreciation of your abilities, or of tho eminent services you havo renuerou tno country ami lis people.' Mr. Greoloy, after a moment's heslta tion. repeated tno expression. "1 am hopelessly gono." Ho added, "I am ruined." Ho then alluded. In a brief expression. to tho personal business about which ho had desired to bco mo. 1 comprohonded what ho desired, and told him that I would endeavor to. bco that his wishes wero compiled with. I then added! "Mr. Greoloy, you must not allow your self to bo depressed by tho various mis- fortunes which havo come upon you. It is said that troubles never como singly, and I am euro you have recently had more than your share." Mr. Groolov then aroso from his seat and left mo with tho expression: "Rurus,I am hopo lessly ruined." Others, who saw him at tho samo timo, wero greatly shocked at hlsomac iatod and dejected appearance. I im mediately called upon some of his intl mato friends and told them of his con dltlon, and requested them to cheor him up. I felt confident at tbo tlmo that his case was hopeless, for ho Bcemod so prostrated that I did not bellevo it possible for him to rally. I havo not slnco seen Mr. Greeloy. COMPELLED TO TAKE TO RED. Ono morning ho said to Mr. Johnson, as tho latter was leaving his house, "Meet mo at tho Tribune offico at 2 o'clock this P. M. I have a private communication to make to yo." At tho appointed hour Mr. Johnson was there, but Mr. Grooley declined saying anything, except, "Meet mo at Bru Sinclair's at bIx o'clock to-night) I want to bco you." Mr. Johnson wont tbero at tho timo and found Mr. Groo ley asleep. Mr. Sinclair and Mr, Georgo Ripley wero In another room, ANL DEMOCRAT, Mr. Groeloy slept for uomo tlmo, but wiion nt icngtii no nwoKO nis mind scorned gono. Mr. Sinclair begucd him to. romaln thcro to go to bed, Ho quietly nssontod. nnd then turning to Mr, Johnson said, "A. J., tako mo homo with you won't you?" Mr, iiipioy also begged Mr. J. to do bo, but, aunougii it was cany then in tno ovo nlng, it was midnight boforo they reached Flfty-Bovcnth stroot. Somo days boforo that Dr. I?. Bayard, tho lato Mrs. Greoloy's attendant, noticed Mr. Groeloy had a rostloss and fovorlsh appearance. IIo Is n homceopathlst, but kindly prescriDou lor nis oiu ationu, as no cor rectly imagined that ho nocdod un.ano dyne. On returning homo tho night auovu mentioned, air. jonnson mixou ono of tho powders nnd gavo it to Mr. Grooley. Tho lattor, In taking it spilled half of It ovor his shirt-front, and whon romlndod of what ho had dono, said, 'Oh 1 novcr mind it : it's as good out- Bldo as In." Tho following morning .Mr. uroeioy was MORE RESTLESS AND HAGQAUD in nppearanco, and Mr. Johnson sent ror his mtnllv nhvs clan. Dr. E. Kmc kowlzer, chief surgeon of tho Gorman Hospital. Dr. Krackowizor recognized tho caso as n sorious ono, and nt onco resorted to tbo most onorcotio treat mont. At first It scorned as though tho malady would yield to tho treatment, nnd at times tho patient becamo gontlo in disposition, perfectly rational, and in apparent good health. Tho modlcai trcatmont Mr. Greoloy was receiving proved inciiectuai. Med lclno becamo of no avail, nnd reason gavo way. On Novombor 20 Dr. Brown, superintendent ot tuo itioomingdaio Asylum, and Dr. Goo. 8. Choato, pro prietor of a private asylum in West chester county, wore called to moot Dr, Krackowizor in consultation. A caro nil examination of tho patlont was mado, nnd thoy unanimousb pro nouncod him suffering from ncuto mania nnd ontircly lnsano. THE SHOCK was a sovoro blow to tho few frlonds of tho votoran Journalist who wero en trusted with tho secret, but nftor duo deliberation tuoy Docomo suuicieutiy reconciled to tho fact to consent to Mr. Grceloy's romoval to Dr. Choate's house, near Pleasantvillo, Westchester county, tuo house is pleasantly situ uted a mile and a half from tho town, on a hill half a mile from tho nearest liouso. It la comfortably furnished. has handsomo grounds surrounding it. and though known lo tho neighbors as prlvato lunatic asylum, it has tho nppearanco of tho country seat of somo weaitny gcntioman. Thoro Mr. Oreo ley was convoyod LAST THURSDAY WEEK. When ho was brought down stairs at iur. jonnson's nouso, in iront or which Mr. Johnson and J. R. Stuart wa3 wait ing with a closo carriage Mr. Johnson handed him his traditional whlto hat and coat. "Don't send mo away, A. J.," ho cried, as tho tears flowed down bis deathly-palo cheoks. "Don't lot mo go don't, don't I" Tho scono was too affecting for thoso who witnessed it, and all shed tears. Mr. Johnson drop pod tho hat and coat, too much affected to say a word. Ho never expected to sco his old frlond again. IT WAS DEEMED REST that Mr. Groeloy should romaln over night at tho resldonco of Mr. John R. Stuart, In Tarrytown. Mr. Stuart was an old friend, and it may be remember ed that it was at his houso that one of tho first receptions tendered to Mr. Greeloy after bis nomination was giv en. Ho was rostloss all night, nnd a strict watch was kept upon his move ments. IIo seemed to know that ho was on tho way to an asylum. At first ho told Mr. Stuart that ho would not leavo his houso. It was only after Mr. and Mrs. Stuart promised to call and see him every day that he consented to go. Beforo leaving Mr. Stuart's resi dence he walked through tho grouuds. Suddenly stopping and gazing intently at two small shrubs, he said " Wo must put tho cider in the sround,'for It will freeze hard before Tuesday." TAKEN TO DR. CHOATE'S. Mfr. Stuart bocamo alarmed, and then endeavored to placo Mr. Greeley iu a close carriage for removal to Dr. Choate's resldenceat Mount Pleasant. Mr. Greo ley cried bitterly, and for a long timo refused to go. Ho repeatedly said to Mr. Stuart, "Don't lot thorn tako mo away. I want-to stay hero with you." It was only whon urged by Aunty i.awson and Mrs. Stuart that he con sented to go with Mr. Stuart in tho carriage. Tho day after his arrival nt Dr. (Jhoato's tho dlsoaso doveloned it self in all its intonslty. Tho horrors of acuto mania wero hourly witnessed, and ho was violont in his actions. Tho most skilful treatment at tho hands of experienced physicians proved of no avail, and tho patient gradually sank into a stato of unconsciousness! Tho Inflammation of the brain mado tho stomach sympathize with it to such an extent that Mr. Greeley refused, and was reauy unaoio, to tano ioou in any form. ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. There wore threo Tribune stockhold ers at his bedsldo on Wednesday night. They were Samuel Sinclair, tno pub lisher; Patrick O'Rourko, chief engin eer or tho Tribune press-rooms, and Thomas M. Rooker, foreman of tho composing room. John F. Cleveland, Mr. Greeley's brother-in-law, and Oli ver Johnson a Tribune editor, wero also present, as well as tho dying man's private secretary. Mr. O'Riurko loft on Wodnosday,but the others remained over Thanksgiving day. uauricno. tno youngest daughter or Mr. Grooley, whom he was fond of call ing "pussy," was In attendance on her rather, but nor grior was so groat and uncontrollable that hor uncle brought hor with him to his homo in this city. ON THURSDAY NIGHT. Mr. Greeley gradually became worse. and failed to recognize tho fow Intlmato mends and relatives who visited him. Mr. Greoloy passed a very restless night. Ho raved lncoherontly all night , threw his arms wildly about, and roll ed and tossed from one sldo of tho bed to tbo other. At 8 A. M. yesterday ho remained unconscious. His oxtromitlcs gradually becamo cold, and ho was MOTIONLESS IN HIS RED. Dr. Choato, Miss Ida Grooley, Mr. and Mrs. John R. Stuart, and Aunty Lawson wero in constant attendance, but Mr. Greoley did notrocognlzo them during tho afternoon. Ho appeared to bo "praying. Onco ho said aloud, In a strong volco, "I know that my Re deemer llvoth," An hour later ho re peated several times, "I died beforo I was born," and at precisely 4 o'clock ho alarmed those about him by saying in his natural tono of volco, "It Is dono." Thoso woro his last words. Hotheu again rolapsod into a stato of total un consciousness, his respirations becamo weaker, nis extremities colder, and his facoboro tho unmistakable imprint of ueatn. no was puiseioss at ino wrist, and thus remained until G P. M. THE SCENE AT THE DE ATIII1ED. Mr. Relgnold, Short and Whltolaw Rold called during tho ovenlng, and wero admitted to Mr. Groolov 'a room and bcdsldo, Mr. Rold took tho dying man's hand and asked Mr. Groolov: "Do you know mo?" Tho groat editor noudou nis neau in tno aturmativo, touched his breast with tho hand which was disengaged, and ngaln relapsed into a state of insensibility. Dr. Choato said that It was the last flicker of the expiring flame, and tho menus quietiy awaitouinosceno. urad ually and slowly tho Icy hand of death was enveloping tbo prostrate lournallst. Ills breathing though less labored was growing woaKfr; nis puiso was imper ceptible, and t clammy sweat was on his brow, then Death slowly appioach od and BORE HIS SPIRIT AWAY. At precisely ten minutes beforo 7 o'clock last night Horace Greoley died. without a struggle At tho tlmo Miss BLOOMSBURG, Ida Groeloy was his only rolallvo pres ent. Sho was kneollng noar tho hoad of tho bod and praying for her fathor's soul when alio noticed that HE HAD CEASED IIRRATHINO. Dr. Choato was ntonco called, and ho pronounced him dead. Thon ensued a Bceno of grief nnd sorrow, as tho almost heart-broken daughter, who had lost both mother and father within thirty days, was removed to another apart mont. Aunty Lawson, Mr. and Mrs. Stuart, nnd Miss Broderlck, alio l wit nessed tho doath. Tho room In which Mr. Groeloy died was a largo ono on tho northwest corn or of tho first floor of Dr. Ohoato's house.' It was a bright ono, noatly carpeted, but dovold of chairs, pictures, orna raonts, wash-basin, or any small nrtlclos of furnlturo.

Let no enemy of republican llborty lay tho flattering unction to his soul that tho Democratic party has ceased tooxlst. It has survived tho successive defoats of tho last twelvo years and comes out of tho latest conflict stronger in numbers than ever before. Although its candl dato for President failed to carry a ma jorlty of tho electors, ho received a clean majority of tho whlto voters who nt- tendod tho election. Grant's majority of tho popular vote is mado up of tho lately enfranchised negroo3. Without thoso ho would havo been in a minority, Tho voto in tho United States for Presi dent at tho lato election was about G,- 959,000. This was divided as to raco about as follows : Whites for Grooley 3,100.000 Whites for Grant 3,000,000 Whlto majority for Greelty 100,000 Negroes for Grant 850,000- Negroes for Greeloy 60,000 Negro majority for Grant 800.000 Deduct whlto maj. for Greoley... 100,000 Qrant's total majority 700,000 At least ono million Democrats did not voto. This may soom an extrava gant estimato,but whon it Is remember ed that in Pennsylvania alono Greeley receivod 105,000 votes loss than Bucka lew, tho statement is not astounding. Wo take it, therefore, Grant is a mln nority Prcsldont, in that ho failed to poll a majority of all tho votors of tho United States, notwithstanding the solid negro voto in his fivor. He owes his re-oloctiou to tho lattor nnd to tho immenso sums of monoy expended by his partisans in tho corruption of votors. Now, is a party that polls thrco mil lions of votes for au unpopular candldato, under tbo most advorso circumstances, and which can poll four millions for a popular nominco under favorablo con ditions, dead or about to dlo? Therols considerable llfo in such a party. It is able to glvo and tako pretty sovero blows, Thcro is, there must be, n future and a glorious ono for such a party. It is bound togother by principles that aro eternal and unchangeable. The right of solf-govornmont, a strict construction of tho constitution, civil and political equality, freedom of consclonco, impar tial taxation, a sound and stable cur- roncy, these aro tho tonots of tho great party which now lifts itsenup from its latest dofeat. Purged of prejudice, pur ified by adversity, ennobled by sacri fices which humbled Its prido.this party to-day challenges tho respect and ad miration of tho country. In tho coming timo tho doctrines for which it has con tended will bo surely vindicated. Tho antagonism of raco which is now foster ed by tho so-called Republican party through its intrigues for tho consolida tion of tho negro voto, tho favored classes which havo boon pampered and enriched by tho legislattion of tho last decade, tho imperialism which is root ed in tho policy of tho prcsont adminis tration, tho proscrlptivo politico-religious movement whoso sworn leagues aro encouraged by tho dominant party, tho contempt of tho constitution which pervades tho politics of tho federal capi tal, tho partial and unjust tax laws mado to enrich tho fow at tho expense of tho many, and tho fluctuating cur rency which is the plaything of tho gamblors in gold,all theso will succumb to the Democratic opposition Just assuro as tho Amorican peoplo will, in duo tlmo, comprehond tholr own interests Lot us then bo patient. Lot us work and wait. Patriot. The Now York Church Journal Bays of Gonoral Meade : "A moro saintly knight never drew n sword. A klndor hoart nover beat. A simpler and truer Christian has seldom, in. theso days, lived; none worthier to wear 'tho grand old name of gentleman' without a blot, thau Georgo G. Mcado. Phila delphia did well to drapo horsolf in weeds of mourning, Sho expressed but the whole nation's feelings. Knowing him nearer, she felt hor losses nearer, But wo may all thank God for tho ox- amplo of a llfo truo to duty, for anothor whlto namo to placo among all tho wreath-crowned names upon tho na tion's walls, a model and au incitement Whllo tfco nation stands." Hard on llartranft, Tho New York correspondent of tho Philadelphia Sunday Jtfercuiy, has tho following bit of gossip rolatlvo to our newly-elected Govornor : "Did I tell you last week that Gover nor Dlx was,on tho famous champagno train which carried tbo Truman pol iticians to Washington? Well, it seems that old shoot 'om did not know ho was riding over tho rails In company with tho post-offico sappers aud minors; and when it was told to him that "that norson yonder Is Govornor Hartranft." ho shrugged hlsshouldors and ropllod i "Well, bo don't amount to anything!" andNowYork'sChlofMaglstrato refused to bo acquainted with the Governor ofasUter Htato. It is understood that General Dlx added i "Grant oJectod him." 

COLUMBIA COUNTY, PA. Tlio Constitutional CoiiTCiillon. Wednesday, Novombor 27, 1872. Tho Convention met at 10, a. m, Numerous resolutions woro offered und referred to tho appropriate com mltto6s, Vo do not glvo them how as they will como up for tho action of tho Convention on roferouco from tho com mittee. Mr. Bartholomew offered a resolu tion returning thanks to John A. Smull for his sorvlcos. Agreed to unanimous ly. Mr. Uowman offered roiolullons of thanks to J. A.Solfrldge, Chlof Clork of tho Houso, nnd Thomas McCamant, Chief Clork of tho Sccrotnry of tho Com monwealth, for tholr services to tho convention. Agrcod to, Warrants woro ordered to bo drawn for mombors,miloagoaud for stationary. (No warrants havo yet boon drawn for their pay.) Mr. Nowlln, from a majority of tho Commitloo on Printing, reported that tho Stato Printer, under existing laws, was not entitled to tho printing of tho Convention, and that tho commlttco had not yot had tlmo to solicit bids. A minority roport signed by two members to tho opposlto ollect was pre sented. Mr. Whlto (Indiana) moved to amond thomsjorlty roport, bo as to authorlzo tho Committee on Printing to confor with tho Stato Printer, and to award him a contract If ho will do tho work at tho oxlstlng rates with tho Legisla ture. Tho amendment was agrood to by 51 yeas to 49 nays. Mr. Nowlln moved to lay tho wholo subject on tno tuuie. iioi tigrueu to. Mr. Nowlln offered an amendment, "Provided that the commlttco shall re eclvo bids from all persons desiring to contract." This was accoptod by Mr, Whlto. Mr. Lamborton (Dauphin) offered n resolution looking to an amendment of tho constitution nn advisory council, to bo composed of ox-Governors of tho Commonwealth who, with tho Gover ror( shall consider and pass upon ap plications for pardons and remission of fines and forfeitures. Mr. Hopkins called tho "provlous quostlon" (preventing debato and fur thcr amendments). This was sustained by eighteen members, but tlio Convcn Hon, by n voto of 38 yeas to 52 nays, refused to order tho main question to bo put. This action, under tho ruling of tho Chair, took tho cntiro subject out of tho control of tho Convention for tho day (and of courso until the meeting in January next in Philadelphia.) Adjourned until tho first Tuesday of January, 1873, to meet in Philadel phia. t t CONGRESS Congress met in eosslon on Monday last. Neither tho Senato nor Houso did anything ;in tho way of business aside from tho offering of a largo numbor of bills, all of which wero referred. In tho Senato a resolution of respect to tho memory of Horaco Greoloy was adopt cd, and a similar ono was passed in tho House. Mr. Banks offered his resigna tion as chairman of tho Commlttco on Foreign Affairs, but tho Houso, by a voto of 7G to 54, refused to accept it Speaker Blaine called tho Hon. S. S Cox to tho chair, and, in a short speech, offered a resolution for tho appointment of a special commlttooof fivo to investi gate tho charges In rolatlon to tho Credit Moblller matter.Tho committee was ap pointed, a request of Mr. Blalno that it be not composed of a majority of his political frlonds being complied with, Both houses adjourned shortly after tho reading of tho President's message, which occupied ovor an hour. Tho Senato on Tuosday transacted no business. In tho Houso, Mr. KErjLoaa, of Con necticut, introduced n bill to repeal thr stamp taxon bank checks aud notes. Ro ferrcd. Mr. Randall offered a resolution calling on tho secrotary of tho treasury for information as to what law authori zes him to mako an increased Issue of legal tender notes, as was dono in Octo ber last, and whether such Issuo was mado in tho legal tender notes hereto fore retired, or In now ones, etc. After somo discussion by Messrs. Ran dail, Dawes, Brooks and Garfield tho latter stating that the issue of legal ten der notes last October had taken tho country by surprise the resolution was adopted, A number of resolutions wero offered and referred. 

NEWS During an exciting debato in tho French Assembly Saturday, M. Duval mado a violent attack upon tho Govern ment, and moved a resolution declaring that tho municipal councils had violated the laws of tho country, and that M. Lo Franc, In receiving tho addresses for tho President, had also failed to obsorvo them. Tho motion was carried by 305 against 299 votes, when adjournment amid the greatest oxcltomont took place. Subsopuently M. Lo Franc tendered his resignation to Thiers, who accepted it. Tho situation is now of tho gravest na ture, and it would not bo surprising to soon hear of vlolenco among tho peoplo. President Thiers says thoro is nothing left for him but to resign.

When tho United States Senato mot on Tuesday it was tho Intention of cer tain Senators to offer a resolution to ad journ until Thursday, as a mark of respect to Horaco Greoley and to allow thoso desiring, to nttend his funeral In Now York on Wednesday. This inten tion becamo known and a cliquo In tho Senato determined to defeat tho meas ure, so at tho meeting of tho Senate, Simon Cameron, fit spokesman for such a set, moved a resolution to adjourn till Wcdnosdayand rofused to withdraw it. This prevented tho proposed adjourn ment (o Thursday. As it is imposslblo for Cameron to obtain moro utter con tempt from decant men than ho now enjoys, this last manly oxplolt of his will not injure him. Hartranft & Co will probably think Just as much of him as over. New Advertisements.
