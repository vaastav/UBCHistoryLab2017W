WILLIS IS WAITING. He Does Not Dare Undertake to Restore the Queen. FURTHER ORDERS EXPECTED. la tbe Meantime He »e«leree the Matwe Qaa WUI Mm Kslslststd-ns 11l Mdl Qslst Poirr Towwukjto, Dec. i.—{Special.}—The barkentine K trkuat, Capt. B. D. Cutler, arrived today from Honolulu with ad tires to November four days after the •learner Alameda sailed for San Francisco. Minister Willis submitted to an interview directly after tbe Alameda ealled, and plainly told the people that tbe instruc tions trom tbe United States government which be brought out from Washington City were not applicable to tbe condition of affairs then existing in tbe islands. This statement gave tbe annexationists mucb satisfaction and the royaiista were much nispleaaed. On account of many rumors current of thecontempiatea action of the queen's supporters the provisional government found it necessary to keep two companies of soldiers under arms sev eral nights after the Alameda sailed. The dispatch published in a New Zea land newspaper to tbe effect that Presi dent Cleveland was preparing to submit a message to congress advocating restora tion of the monarchy in Hawaii created much eicitement. The editor of the firming Star requested Minister Willi* to submit a statement to the public to allay the general feeling of uncertainty. He. ■aid: "Yes, I believe the time has come in which it la rirht and proper for me to use my discretion in this matter. Yon are nuthoriced to say for me that no change in the present situation will take place for several weeks. I broupht with me certain instructions from the I'nited States gov ernment on the Hawaiian situation. Hmce my arrival contingencies have arisen about which neither the I'nited States govern ment nor myself were aware when I left Washington City. I have thought best in the eiercise of the discretion allowed me, to submit these matters to Washington City before proceeding further in carry ing out my original Instructions. 1 for ward my dispatches to Washington City by today's steamer, and until I receive an answer to them no change will take place in the present situation, nor will any be allowed." "What do yon mean by the expression, "Nor will any be allowed ?' " "I mean just this: That until the time comes for nie to carry oat my instructions, the peace and good order of this commu nity will be kept undisturbed, in the inter ests of humanity; that any attempt made by any j>erson or persons to make trouble will be promptly checked and punished. You may put the matter more plainly and aay that even if the provisional govern ment diacharged the whole of its troops today, no lawlessness would be allowed for one moment under the present situa tion of affairs. The whole Hawaiian ques tion is now In abeyance, and nothing that the newspapers can say or do will alter the situation one iota. I make thia statement on my own responsibility and in the hope that it will allay the present excitement. No one need fear trouble and no lawless ness will be permitted." This statement gave general satisfaction to the annexationist* and brought forth much grumbling from tbe royalists, nnd immediately rumors began to fly about that the queen's supporters would make a final rally ia her behalf. Two companies of troops remained under arms and the crews of the Vnited States men-of-war Philadelphia and Adams were held in readiness to he landsd if any movement were attempted. The queen's advocates came forth the next day with a redhot denial of the Wil lia interview, saying he was misquoted, and by inference gave encouragement to the idea that Willis had or would have imperative orders to restore the queen. CapL Cutler, of the Klickitat, who has sailed to the islands for the last twenty years and is |*ersonatly acquainted with leading citizens of both factions, says a large majority of the better element strongly favor annexation, but if left to popular vote the natives and the foreign element would outvote the annexationists. K«fip*p»r accounts of ttlount's report hod tint Iwen received in the islands when tha Klickitat sailed, but on account of Willis' intimation relative to his instruc tions It ww surmised to be partial to tha interests of the queen. Cutler said the general sentiment prevailed that Hluunt's report would be htasevi and unfair, inas much as h« trained and hobnoid>ed with the royalist crowd. The natives of Ha waii agree that tfie queen Is an immoral woman ami unlit to govern the islands, and the pilncipal objection offered by the royalists to the provisional government, Cutler save. Is the manner in which it w.\a installed. They want the I tiited States to rotor* the queen and then allow them to change the lorm of government if they choose Jhe captaiu says no further trouble need lx> anticipated until Willis hss further instructions from Washington City, H»w Fiuscwo, l>cc. 4. -Hawaiian Con sul Wilder, when ha read the new* which arrived tonight from Honolulu via I ort Townsend. was greatly pleas*-1 When asked what unexpected contingencies Minister Willis ha I f «und in llouoiuiu l.e said: "I thinV he found that the men compil ing the provisional g overnment of Haw ati ware hs»r>! nun ied, law abiding ntireus, instead ot filibusters, »nch as be had (>een led to l»e!ieve them to )«, This neas will have «re*t rfl,, i on the people of th» Tnited Mates, an i I hop* the ••(ministration w.ll be torcad by t •{>- ular opinion t-> change its vtewa on t' e Hnwnnan •(uastion.
