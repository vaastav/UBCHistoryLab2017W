UNIONISTS APPEAR TO HAVE LOST IN ENGLAND London, Dec. 6.—At the close of to day's polling the compltxion of the House of Commons stood as follows: Government Coalition Liberals, 106 Laborites 20 Nationalists 26 total, 152. Opposition—Unionists 147. The situation has developed an al most phenominal closeness of race be tween the government coalitioin par ties and unionists. The pendulum swung slightly toward the government today and the result of the three days' voting, in which 299 seats have been filled, gives the coalition ont more member than they had in the last par liament from the same constituen cies. Up to last night the Unionists had a clear gain of five. The turning of the tide toward Lib eralism is a surprise and a great disappointment for the Unionists who counted upon capturing half a dozen seats from the enemy. Tht greatest surprise was in the Coventry, because that is the seat of the motor manufacturing element and the Protectionists had put great stress on their plea that tariff reform would prevent growing competition from the American machines. The campaign has shown how very strongly British voters are wedged to their parties, and how slow they are to break away, though the parties change their platforms radically. Newspapers appear exercised over their reader's surprisingly small in fluence. Almost all of the most im portant, among them those with the largest circulation, championed the Unionist cause, yet they were unable to make any material inroads in Lib eral and Labor lines. Betting on the stock exchange be fore election was that coalition ma jority would drop sixty-five. As the elections progressed the betting favored eighty, then ninety. It now concedes that the government will have 106 majority. OFFICIALS OF THE BATH TUB TRUST GUILTY THREE HIGH OFFICERS WILL HAVE TO FACE COURT TRIAL SOON.
