jfrtday December 11 1908 PRESIDENTS LAST MESSAGE ANNI'AL Hl.( OMMi:\KATTO\S TO OOKGIUBM AltK M.VI>K liV IIOOSKVELT. Sherman EjKW Should lie Amended. Favors Postal Havings Hanks and Parcel Post. Washington, Dec. B.—The follow ing is a brief synopsis of the Presi dent's message, read to the two Houses today: The financial standing of the na tion at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the nation's interests by the government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our currency system is imperfect and it is earnestly to be hoped that the currency commission will b>- able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the exist ing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to Sept. 30, 190S, there has been a net surplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over ex penditures, a reduction of the inter est bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary expense of the Panama canal and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. Corporations—l believe that un der the interstate clause of the con stitution the United States has com plete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and 1 believe that the national gov ernment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from and to do justice to the great corpora tions which are the most Important factors in modern business. I be lieve that It is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law can be en forced only imperfectly and unequal ly, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. The railways of the country should be put completely under the inter state commerce commission and re moved from the domain of the anti trust law. Telegraph and telephone com panies engaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commis sion. Labor—As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred by machinery, organization and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger share in the owner ship by wageworker of railway, mill and factory. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of tak ing care of the wageworkers who, under our present industrial system, become killed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The object sought could be achieved by proper employ era' liability laws. [ also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should be as rapidly and aa far as practicable be extended to the en tire work being carried on by the government. The Courts —I most earnestly urge upon congress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our judges. Beginning with the supreme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled. —FT"is~ discreditable to us as a peo , ple that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers or in bringing to Justice men who as public ser vants have been guilty of corruption or who have profited by the corrup tion of public servants. Forests —If there is any one duty which more than another we owe It to our children and onr children's children to perform at once it is to save the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most im portant element of the natural re sources of the country. Pure Food —The pure food legis lation has already worked a benefit difficult of estimation. Postal Savings Hanks—l again re new my recomemndation for postal savings banks, for depositing sav ings with the security of the govern ment behind them. Parcel Post—The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and country storekeeper. Public Health —The dangers to public health from food adulteration and from many other sources, such as the menace to the physical, men tal and moral development of chil dren from child labor, should be met and overcome. ; ; : Statehood — I advocate the imme diate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of con gress. , Porto Rico —1 again recommend that American citizenship be con ferred up#n the people of Porto Rico. The Navy—l approve the recom mendations of the general board for the Increase of the navy, calling es pecial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers and, above all, of the four battleships. It is desirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battle •h!p» of the best existing type. 

NATIONAL APPLE SHOW UNIM AT SI'OKA\K MONI>AY Spokane, Wash., r>"<\ 7. Tho ap ple Is the greatest fruit in the world and the northwestern corner of the United Stales is the greatest place In the world to grow it In, if the people gathered here today to wit ness the opening of the national ap ple show are to be believed. Their belief seems to be justified by the many splendid specimens of fruit placed on exhibition. Months ago the projectors of the show, aided by the Spokane Cham ber of Commerce, induced the na tional government to issue invita tions to foreign countries to send here their best specimens of the ap ple. The object was the bringing together at one time of the standard varieties of apples grown for com mercial purposes throughout the world for the purpose of compari son. Another object is the advanoe ment of the interests of apple grow ers. PRESIDENT KOOSEVELT. tl SIMON TAKES CHARGE Rvbel Leader Proclnlms Himself Ex- ecutive of Hayti. Port au Prince, Deo. 7. —General Antoine Simon, commandei-in-chief of the revolutionists, who Saturday entered Port au Prince at the head of an army of 8000, issued a procla mation in which he assumed the title of Chief Executive and declared that he would organize a provisional gov ernment pending the assembling of the Parliament. The Cuban steamer Oteri arrived from Kingston Sunday, having on board General Fouchard and 30 other exiles. General Simon agreed to permit General Fouchard to land. The two revolutionary leaders re mained together for Borne time at General Simon's headquarters, and after what proved to be a very amic able meeting, General Simon pro claimed General Fouchard chief ex ecutive of the army, all the forts and the Haytien gunboats firing a salute of HI guns. The situation at Gonaives and St. Marc is grave, the movement in fa vor of General Antenor Firrain hav ing been greatly strengthened. 

PRANCE WILL NOT LET PRESIDENT CASTRO LAND Paris, Dec. 6. —If President Cas tro, of Venezuela, comes to Bor deaux, he will not be allowed to set foot on French soil until after he has offered a formal apology for the fashion in which he has flaunted France. This decision was made by the Cabinet, but was kept a secret, as it was expected that Castro would disembark at Santander, Spain. But should he arrive at Bordeaux and his illness not be serious, permission to land will be made conditional upon the dispatch of an official telegram of apology to the French govern ment and the dispatch of telegraphic Instructions to Caracas for the imme diate execution of the arbitral award in the matter of the French claims.

Members of Washington liar Asso ciation licii'i'iiiiiii'il to Sift scandiii to Bottom. Seattle, Wash., Dec. 7.—Breaking his silence for the first time since his resignation from the supreme court bench of the state of Wash ington, former Justice Milo A. Root .stated that the troubles with which he has become involved and which led to his resignation, were brought about through trusting a friend whom he had known for 20 years or more. "But let me say first," said Mr. Root, "I am not corrupt. 1 did not receive a single penny. I did not ask for a cent and what has been done has been done honestly and above-board. 1 do not carp to say that Judge Gordon took my letters in the Great Northern railway and capitalized them for any amount. All 1 know about that ia what friends of mine have told me. "It ia untrue that Judge Gordon wrote the decision in the Harris vs. Great Northern decision, which has been attributed to him," declared Judge Root. "When the decision first was rendered the court stood three to four against the railway. I have been honest. No one has ever influenced me In the matter of de cisions. This horrible stuff that has been circulated against me is untrue. It is as false as those who have at tempted to besmirch my name and character." Judge Root lives in a neighbor hood where there are more working men's homes than there are fashion able residences. Even the street In front of his house Is not graded. From the carline occupying almost an hour from the center of Seattle to his home, his residence is reached over a muddy trail and broken planks. There is no evidence of lux ury at his home. Members of the special bar com mittee are determined to report fully on the exact facts on every charge they can hear. There is no chance of a whitewash report, and the bar oommlttee's findings may be even more drastic than have been Inti mated thus far. Members of the committee are holding personal interviews with members of the supreme court and the court stenographers. CHINESE SENDS GIFTS President Roosevolt Presented Many Volumes of Literature.
