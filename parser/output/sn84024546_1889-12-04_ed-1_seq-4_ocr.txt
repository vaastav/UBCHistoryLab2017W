P1TTSBDKQ. WEDNESDAY. DEC. 4. 1889. PKEEIDEHT HABEIS0IT3 MESSAGE. The first thing which will occur to the reader of President Harrison's message is that the present occupant of the "White House does not mean to follow the example of President Cleveland, two years ago, and commit the fortunes of his administration to a. single issue. President Harrison touches upon almost every subject in which Congress or the country has an interest. As'to a great many of them, he assumes merely the function of a receiver rather than that of an originator or advocate of measures. The general drilt ot the document is con servative, with a tendency to put upon Con gress the whole responsibility for inquiring into details and framing policies. This is notable in respect to the tariff. President Harrison recognizes the necessity for a revi sion of thescbedule of duties, and insists that, while difficult, it can be accomplished with out injury to the protection of homeindus - tries. His position is that a revision of the tariff must not be made with an eye to the Treasury alone. He would not revise it, as his Democratic predecessor recom mended, ior the mere purpose of cutting down the surplus. The interests of home manufactures, and of those engaged in them, must be primarily considered in whatever is done. This is undoubtedly the sentiment of the Bcpublican party. Though President Harrison affords no sort of help or sugges tion to Congress as to the details of revision, he has stated clearly- enough the general lines upon which it should be conducted. The next most interesting recommendation of the message, and one upon which the President is direct, positive and assuredly in harmony with the public sense, is that Congress must provide for transportation between the United States and the South American States. This, he points out, means subsidy for vessels plying be tween them. Subsidy is a word which, through past abuses, has fallen into national ill odor; but it would be puerile to hesitate where it is clearly the only means of secur ing those facilities for the extension of trade of which everybody admits the need. The instance frequently given in The Dis patch, of travel from Brazil to the United States being compelled to take the cir cuitous route by Liverpool, is mentioned by the President as a glaring illustration of the present condition of things. After the tariff and South American trade, the topic which this year has loomed most conspicuously in the foreground is that of pensions. The President does not discuss or allude to the perturbations of the Pensions Bureau during the summer and fall. He does not go in for what is known as a general "service" pension, but he adopts a, proposition which will more readily be accepted by the country as fair and even unavoidable. He urges the granting of pensions to "all hon orably discharged soldiers and sail ors who, having rendered substantial service in the war, are now dependent upon their own labor for maintenance, and by disease or casualty are incapacitated from earning it" He asks that no such veteran be obliged to depend upon such local relief as is given to mere pauperC and he appeals with confidence to the generosity and public sense of the fitness of things to sustain such legislation. On the Southern question the recommen dation is for the passage of a law taking the whole processes of Congressional elections under Federal control. This is a radical step. It will lead to the hottest partisan debates in the present session of Congress. Upon relations with foreign powers the message is mostly narrative a sort of gen eral view of the situation unmarked in any notable degree by suggestions. There are several other stock subjects which are treated quite voluminously; but the parts of tne message which will attract general in terest are those which have already been mentioned. On. the whole, the President's deliverance is, as might have been expected, neither sen sational nor venturesome in the matter' of suggesting new departures. Itis strong and sensible on at least three of the most impor tant questions before the country: the tariff, the extension of our foreign trade, and pen sions. Host of the other topics taken up are merely treated in the spirit that it is usdal for Presidents to say something about them in their messages, rather than with the con viction that there are new lights to throw upon them. j 

EEHAEKA3LE SEUSIBIUTT. There is food for our special wonder in the information which purports to come from Hayti that the appointment of Frederick Douglass as Minister tothe colored Republic is very unsatisfactory to that Government The exquisite reason offered for that dissatis faction is that if the President of Hayti gives it state dinner Mr. Douglass will sit at the same table with the French or British Minister. The diplomatic sensibility which will accept the hospitality of a colored Presi dent but will be wounded by sitting at the' same table with a colored Minister of the United States would be something tearfully and wondcrlnlly made. This, would be especially so m the case of the French Mini ster, at whose capital a colored man, Alex ander Dumas, has been one of the noted lit erary lights. This remarkable trouble may be explained by the fact that it comes to us through some of the naval officers who de veloped a remarkable epidemic of disability when ordered to take Mr. Douglass to Hayti in their vessels. , IIQfflDATIOinK 

INSOLVENCIES. . The one duty which is owing to the unfor tunate depositors of the Lawrence Bank and which is indeed due in all cases of in solvency is to see that the most is made out of the assets which remain. Itis not surpris ing therefore Co find the depositors anxiously pressing for a receiver . That implies no dis trust of the unexceptionable gentleman whom the stockholders clioss for assignee, and who is reported, no doubt correctly, a.R stating that he will not be soiry to be re lieved of an. irksome duty. It is simply a case which may rftsnlt in a conflict of icter ests in Jbeprocess.cf settlement, and in re- sped to which the depositors the class who most need all that can be realized on their own account are naturally anxious, for .the selection of an administrate-r in their inter est , ' But experience shows that whether as signees, or receiver in cases ot insolvency are chosen by one side or another, or with the concurrence of all sides, there is too frequently cause for complaint and criticism upon the matter of realizing from' the assets and distributing the proceeds. Most gener ally delay is the conspicuous fault, by which creditors are kept so long out of their share of the salvage as to make it of little account beyond a bitter reminder when it reaches them. Sometimes again, expensive costs of litigation and fees for services absorb the greater part of what is left after insolven cies. Finally, there are numerous instances where objections are made to properties be ing sacrificed by injudicious handling, or for the benefit of others than the creditors. It is needless to go over the list of such in stances. Even in the Allegheny courts there are records of comparatively recent cases showing the slow and unsatisfactory progress of such settlements. As both a speedy and a full realizationis such a desideratum to the hundreds, often thousands of people effected by bank sus pensions, the qualifications of receivers in such cases are of great importance. Large financial responsibility and known capacity are such factors that of late in all the lead ing cities, Pittsburg among the number, chartered corporations, with large capital and trained fiduciary agents, have organized for executing such trusts under the super- j vision of the courts. That there was room for such a division of labor will not be ques tioned by any one who is familiar with the difticulties, dissatisfaction and waste which so often result from the commission of such work to the private hands of even the most trusted individuals. WHICH IS THE FBAT0 1 Senator Farwell announces, in connec tion with his oft-repeated declaration that the civil service system is a sham and fraud, that he will not introduce his bill to repeal the law, but will kill the system by refusing appropriations for its support. In other words, the Senator's appetite for spoils will develop into an attempt to secure by indirection what his party will not dare do directly. But let us see what this means. The Senator's party won the last national cam paign on a platform in which it pledged itself to maintain and extend the civil service reform system. The President's message testifies to the value of that system. The Senator's idea, therefore, is that his party shall belie its professions, and the ad ministration be forced to abandon its princi ples based on experience, in order that the Senator and his followers shall have their hunger for spoils appeased. This maces it the question not whether the reform, but whether Senator Farwell or his party are the sham and fraud. Let us nope that it may prove to be only the Senator, as that would be nothing novel. 

COUGHLIN'S DEFENSE Some of the most remarkable logic ever heard, in or out ot a' court of justice, is be ing used for the benefit, presumably, of the defendants in the Cronin case. Judge "Wing has particularly distinguished himself by the extraordinary arguments he has present ed for his client, the Detective Coughlin. He has insisted that the finding of two knives, supposed to belong to the murdered man. in Coughlin's pockets, cannot by any means incriminate Coughlin, because, if in nocent, Coughlin could not have had Dr. Cronin's property in his, possession, and if guilty, he would not have taken the risk of keeping the knives. If the jury accept this kind of reasoning none of the prisoners will be convicted. The argument for the moment, it cannot be denied, is plausible, and, if it were a fact that men who shed their fellows' blood al ways did take every precaution against de tection, would really have a little weight But the records of crime have taught us that a murderer often plans and provides fully and skillfully for his safety up to a certain point, and then by some glaring blunder knots the noose about his neck. The fact that the knives were found in Coughlin's possession if it is certain that they were once Dr. Cronin's only proves that the de tective was singularly sure suspicion would not reach him, or else that he merely made a blunder such as other criminals in similar circumstances have made. The attorneys for the State will probably point out the L flaw in Judge "Wing's logic The Cronin trial has not been remarkable for anything more than the attempt of the prisoners' attorneys to supply the want of evidence in their clients' favor by darin.tr distortions of fact and logio in their argu ments. To A sensitive Irish correspondent, who imagines some disrespect to bis race in oursug geetion ot a Htbernlanlsm in the statement that "27 farms within four miles of Brooklyn, Conn., are for sale at half their value, ith the buildings thrown in," we tender the most sin cere assurances of onrrespect and affection for the variety of wit about which Lever wrote, and which Sir Boyle Roche illustrated. Never theless, we must insist that when 27 farms in a single locality are for sale at a' certain rate the valne of land in that locality is no more than Is asked for it The coming appointment of a receiver for the Lawrence Bank bids fair to make the term of the assignee a short one. That shonld be an incentive to the latter to signalize his incumbency by getting out an accurate and full statement of the condition of the bank. These is a good deal of satisfaction in the reflection that while the Republican cau cus declarod that it would have none but parti san prayers, the Honse promptly, smashed the Bcpublican slate on the chaplaincy. "With three Aldermen and four detectives of Pittsburg behind prison bars, how is the city government of Pittsburg to get on V This editorial remark from thb Louisville Courier Journal is intended to be sarcastic, as that co temporary is fond of imagining itself to be, at the expense of Pittsburg. Its main success.how ever, is in demonstrating the Courier Journal1 s entire ignorance of the tact that Aldermen and private detectives have no connection whatever with the municipal government of Pittsburg. The small majority for the .Republican party in the House of Representatives is al ready shown to be liable to result in the fail ure ot caucus dictates. This will be no detri ment to the public and 'may prove no worse for the Republican party in the long run. The lawyers for the defense in the Cronin trial come near to a partial agreement with public opinion, in arguing that expert testi mony does not amount to much when it Is on the other side. The statement that a gang of rioters out in Wisconsin lynched an old man for talking hardly about Ms creditors rljo bad sold him out appears almost Incredible; put the stoiy is given in such detail as to leave little doubt that this is one of the results of cultivating the mob Idea, that it is right for a crowd to take life when It sees fit If Wisconsin law is worth anything at all for the protection of its citizens, . iErarSBJOBGl 3!TTr " it will put the participants in that lynching . beo into close relations with the gallowsV"- . Princk Albert Victor's escape from te elephants, and tigers of India is reported just in time to show that Begot away from tbein a good deal more rapidly tban was noted in bis evasion of too elephants and tigers of London. A decided denial appears elsewhere, of the story that it is the Western Cattle Company in which the Greene county people invested their earnings that is breaktne them up. But what is it I Ix is rather remarkable to find the Phila delphia .Press declaring that in exchange for the art and bric-a-brac that is coming from Eu rope, "all that is valuable, lasting and demo cratic in American Government is going backt to Europe." It might be possible for an ex tremely pessimistic view "to declare that this country is losing all that is valuable, lasting and democratic; but it is an original discovery on the part of the esteemed Press that Europe is getting it away from us. Colonel O'BxENB states that he has taken his refuge in New Jersey in defense of the right of the citizen to his liberty. . The liberty to pocket $13,000 of, "fees" raised to in fiuence legislation is certainly worth defend ing. A New York court has decided that the business of importing French milliners most be stopped. This will make it a necessity for the ladies of fashion to bny all their bonnets in Paris. New researches have developed the fact that the Egyptian obelisk, known as Cleo patra's Needle, in Central .Park, cannot stand our climate. wnen we consmer tne meteorological record of the past year, it looks as if Cleopatra's Needle were in the decided majority. The athletic grounds at Princeton have been made twice as large as before, and the representatives of the college recently won the football match. Who says that Princeton is not in the front rank of educational progress T Pittsbubg extends her aid to Baltimore in getting a belt line railroad track. Is it the theory that belt lines are an excellent thing everywhere but in the Pennsylvania cities. President Harbison guards against Cleveland's mistake ot giving the entire spaco of his message to a single policy, and spreads his summary of national matters over the whole country in a way that is calculated to arouse the suspicion that he has no policy at all. 

PEOPLE OP PROMINENCE. The Chinese Minister at Washington is fond of walking, and goes about town atoot a great deal. The marriage of Miss Margaret Blaine to "Walter Damrosch will take place on Shrove Tuesday. Senator Beck is still an invalid, and his physicians tell him he must do little or no work during the present session of Congress. Judge Allison, of Philadelphia, has com pleted his thirty-eighth year on the bench as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions. He sat in the new Court House Monday, whero he re ceived many congratulations from the District Attorney's office and members 'of the bar. AdmteaIj Veil, of the Chilian Navy, who is temporarily attached to his country's Legation at Washington, is a man of medium height and soldierly bearing. He commanded an iron-clad during the war of 1877-78 between Chili and Fern. He is a diplomat as well as a military man, speaks English fluently, and has sailed aronnd the world. The Greek colony in Smyrna presented two carpets of the finest texture to the Crown Prince of Greece at his recent marriage. They were made by some nf the best workmen in the village of Ousakion. which is noted for the excellent quality and beauty of its carpets. Both were made from the wool of Angora goats. During the last 30 years only two other carpets of such fineness have been made In the Levant Speaking of the wife of Secretary Busk a correspondent says: "Mrs. Rusk has the bountiful, Kindly nature of a Western woman.' She is motherly in appearance, and, like Mrs. Miller, she has taught her daughter to make bread. The one sorrow of her life was the loss of her youncest daughter fonr years aco, and she cannot speak of it yet without tear-dimmed eyes. She is noted in Wisconsin for her house wifery, and even now she goes into her kitchen to prepare some delicacies of which she alone knows the art TOM

Brldgton (Me. ) tetter to "Washington Fost.l The first public speech Tom Reed was ever known to have made, and which auteaates by at least a decade his private address to Judge Carter, is amusingly described by Mrs. LIbby, an elderly matron of Old Orchard, for which account 1 am Indebted to Edgar Yates. "I carried Tom Reed to school the first day he ever went," said Mrs. Lihhy, as she smoothed her apron with her hands. "It was to the school on Bracket street in Portland. Thomas was a tow-headed little fellow then. His cheeks were fat and his eyes as round as buttons. I know I wanted awfully to take him to school that day and so did another girl I' don't remember her name and we had a regu lar sqnabble over the little fellow to see who shonld take him. I remember he sat as still as a mouse. "We used to have speaking poetry every Saturday then. Once when we were all done the teacher asked: 'Are there any others who have a piece they can speak? Up got Thomas and said: 1 know one: Old Jim Crow came riding by. Says I, ''Old man. your horse.wlll die." Says he. "If he dies I'll tan his skin. And if he lives I'll ride him again." And that's all I know.1 "That is, I suppose, the first speech Thomas ever made. I wonder it he remembers it now. He had a funny little voice, but he was so earn est about reciting his piece that it made us all lauzh." TRI-STATE TRIFLES. A few nights ago Ezra King,living in Charles town, Chester county, raffled of a full-grown mule with well-developed ears and hind legs. When the lucky (I) person went after, bis prize on the following morning hfs muleship was cold in death. Death was caused by old age and grief over the fact that the raffle tickets were not paid tor. The big dog he was fondling in his arms saved the life of a gunner at Pittsburg by in tercepting a stray bullet which would have en tered the man's body had not the dog received ,it The animal was killed instantly.

The examina tion is not restricted topurely military subjects, hot includes matters ot general information, A wise provision doubtless, for an officer is none tho less efficient as a soldier If he be intelligent and well informed as a citizen. Some funny results ;ot these examinations occur, I am told. Not20 years ago certainly not so far back into the past a young man who had been elected to a captaincy in a Pennsyl vania regiment was up before the Examining Board. The Colonel of tbe-r egiment was very anxious the young man should pass, and did his best to persuade his brethren op the. board to give the candidate his commission. But the luckless Lieutenant, though of- good standing in society, and a success in the Guard, displayed hopeless ignorance as regards mat ters with which a school bov.of 14 is expected to be acquainted. Finally he was- asked to compute the interest on 300 at 6 per cent for one year, and his failure to even hazard agness ruined his nhances. . It happened that the next man examined was a man who, as the ndicnlqus phrase goes, had no standing whatever in society. He followed a trade, and doubtless a better workman than he in that trade does not exist But it was no secret that the man's calling was regarded with disfavor by the body of officers whose number be aspired to join. He was put through his oaces sharply, and bis examination was as stiff as it was comprehensive. But he answered, every question correctly, and the presiding of ficer of the board caidr "Gentlemen, there Is no possible excuse for rejecting this man," and ho was given his commission, "VOX

Of conrse Colonel Smith did not have to go through the trial. There is, I believe more truth in the story that Senator Quay's principal recreation is sip printed about prominent men. Long before Mr. Quay dreamed of anything bigger in a political way than the supremacy of Beaver, he used r tbe noted for his love of books of all kinds', and fiction In particular. You were liable in those days to find him, so an old acquaintance of the-Senator tells me, lounging about his father's house, or on the nver bank, book in hand, and in a costume queerly neglige, of which the pendant suspen ders were tbe most striking feature. Senator Qnay buttons up his suspenders carefully now, but such leisure as he has a quantity too small to be easily computed is still devoted to novels and the like. SENATOR WAT'S RECREATION. Senator Quay's only recreation lies in novel reading. He is very fond of Fielding, Dickens, Bui wer and Thackeray. 'TIs fitting I fancy for Senator Quay To fly for relief from political strife To novels not weary ones born' of to-day But old-fashioned pictures of manners and life. For your true politician Inst revels In plots, And Dickens and Thackeray valued them too; Tying manifold threads into manifold knots, , With ardor our prophets are bound to pooh pooh.
