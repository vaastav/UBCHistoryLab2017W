Dec. 10. It is estimated that about 75 per cent of the population of Cuba and the country tributary are Bohemians. They are landown ers, and those who cultivate the soil are successful farmers and make money. Their principal farm indus- ries are raising corn, cattle, hogs and alfalfa. And their wives and daughters are great in raising poultry. One of the principal mercantile firms in Cuba, Kesl & Sons, will do a busi ness this year aggregating $65,000, an Increase of $10,000 over 1907. This firm estimates that not less than 50 per cent of the business transacted in Cuba comes from the markets of the sales of poultry, eggs and cream. This family of successful business men and farmers came from Iowa to Republic county in 1886. A Bohemian wedding Js usually Xh occasion of large numbers of the fam ilies getting together, and celebrating the event in a royal good manner. The marriage of Edward Shulda to Miss Albina Vacha, who are highly con nected and belonging to the best Bo hemian families, was solemnized in the presence of a large number of in vited guests and immediate relatives. The presents were elaborate, their relatives being well-to-do. The groom is a successful farmer, while his charming bride has grown to woman hood in Cuba, and is one of her most popular ladies. The wedding services was followed by a bounteous supper, at which the Cuba band discoursed favorite music. The, bridal trip will include a visit to several towns In Ok lahoma. On the evening preceding the wedding many of the young la dies gave the bride-to-be a kitchen shower party in whloh all those pres ent carried with them some useful kitchen article for housekeeping. The Bohemians in this vicinity own from a quarter section to half a sec tion, and a few of them more than this amount, one in particular own ing more than 2,000 acres. It is a custom, so it is said, that the father and mother give their children a farm when they marry, the boys receiving a quarter section, while trie girls us ually receive 80 acres. Many of the business houses in Cuba are the prop erty of Bohemians. nel and in 1901 a colonel. ' He retired in 1904 with the rank of brigadier general.

Dec in Brigadier General Henry Jackson, re tired, died at his home here last night of cancer, aged 71 years. General Jackson was a soldier in the Crimean war, the Civil war, the Spanish-American and other Indian campaigns. He ws born in Canterbury, England. When 16 years of age he enlisted as a soldier and was in the Crimean war from 1853 to 1856. Rising to the rank of lieutenant in the English army, he resigned and came to America enlist ing in the Fourteenth Illinois cavalry in 1863. He was commissioned first lieutenant after the Civil war and in 18 1 6 was made captain. In 1896 he was advanced to the nnv r,r mnim- Washington, Dec. 10. It can be as serted without fear of contradiction that President Roosevelt is unreserv edly in favor of the retention of Mr. Cannon at the head of the Republican organization in the house. He may have had some difficulties in the past, but they are history. The president has stated that he has strongly advised Mr. Taft not to go into a contest with Speaker Cannon, and all because of his belief that Mr. Cannon is a strong and forceful man. and, as such, the best man to head and control the interests of the party there. Further information in relation to the Taft-Cannon misunderstanding develops that the basis of it. insofar as the tariff question is concerned, was largely through a misunderstanding. After the election, Mr. Cannon ad dressed a party of business men Cleveland, Ohio. A stenographic re port of that address is alleged to have been sent Mr. Taft. In that report Mr. Cannon was represented as hav railroads use annually, it would greatly reduce the drain on tne rapiaiy ue creasing timber resources. The Pena. sylvania railroad', alone uses from 3 500,000 to 4,000,000 ties each year for renewals and new work. The aver age life of these red oak and chestnut ties under present conditions is from three to four years, while oak' lasts from seven to eight years. It is esti mated that tie treating will increase the life of these ties to at least twenty years. The Pennsylvania railroad's enormous requirments for ties and lumber strips the timber from some 50,000 acres annually. It Is estimated that by properly treating with pre servatives even a part of this timber, its life will be so increased that per haps. 25.000 acres will supply the company's requirements. 

SPENT 280 MILLIONS. The Coal Bill of Railroads in United States. Canada and Mexico. Some interesting information as to the amount of money spent for coal by the railroads of the United States, Canada and Mexico. Is contained in a pamphlet which has recently been Is sued. The railroads of these three countries expend $190,000,000 an nually for coal at the mines. Other expenses such as handling and haul ing amount to $90,000,000 annually. This makes a total of $280,000,000 which the roads pay for fuel. These fieures are taken from the reports of at I the fiscal year ending July 1, 1908. EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY. M.

SENATORS RtSENTFUL Tliey Don't Like Roosevelt's Reference ' to Secret Service. - Washington. Dec. 10. No subject dis cussed by President Roosevelt in his I annual message to congress has been the subject of so general comment in both the senate and house as t'he rec ommendation concerning the secret ser- ( vicei That portion in which the presi dent declares the amendment incorpor ated in the. law last year "that there should ibe , no detail from the secret service and. no transfer therefrom" con tained the assertion that this amend ment has been of benefit only to the criminal classes. Again the president said that the chief argument in favor of the provision was that the congress men did not themselves wish to be in vestigated by the secret service men and he proposed a restoration of the old law with a special exception pro hibiting the use of the secret service force in investigating members of con gress. This comment by tne president was characterized in strong language by a Distinctiveness Combined With Artistic Merit or Quality As the case may be, gives prestige to the gift chosen from this store.

Cannon a Genuine Revisionist. Since that time Mr. Cannan has made it clear that he not only did not say such a thing, but that he could not have had it in his mind. This be cause he is cognizant of the party pledges at Chicago for tariff revision and has believed sincerely for the last two years that the time has come for revision. He does not deny, nor do his friends for him, that he opposed re vision before the presidential election with the resultant ilsturbance of busi ness conditions. Perhaps the strong est indication of the sincerity of the speaker is to be found in the fact that the last Republican state platform in Illinois, controlled by Mr. Cannon, had one of the strongest tariff revision planks in it that has ever been drawn. It can be asserted, too, that the best friends of Mr. Taft, Including Presi dent Roosevelt, have advised him that an effort on his part to defeat Mr. Cannon for the speakership, even with all the prestige of a president elect, will be absolutely useless. There has been no "laying down" on the part of Mr. Cannon. It may be as truthfullv asserted that the same is true of Mr. Taft.
