The Washington correspondents who hue Vcn tellies us that the Message would diul only with statements of the actual coa .ition of public afTalrs, and be devoid of I o-itivc rccommcndatioris.did not know what i Lev were talking about. The Message is i.'. such characterless document. The Pres , lent logins with the financial question, ar guing it once more with Congress, as a -i..tn would with his friend, and not at all iikc a lasar, and making the very positive and important recommendation of the re- I Ial of the legal tender clause, to take effect alter a day Hied. This would be resump lion of specie payments; anl with the specie Im-is restored, free banking could be per mitted, and, as the President thinks, would 'e desirable. Another very important recommendation i that fur further legislation to punl-h fraudulent naturalization, an- to secure can- i illation U the records of such naturaliza tion. The late Cornwall contested election rave in our lycgr-lature, presented forcible l,ruo!s if the need of such legislation. This w as a rase in which a large and able legisla tne committee satisfied themselves and re ported tiiat a sitting member was elected by the u tes of aliens who were not entitled to ! u naturalize). Hut the committee decided i! at tliv i uuld not go behind the records ..I ; .r.ira' zetiur-s. If they could have lit , una vacated the records of the t Iruu-Iulent naturalisations, they said !.,. v would have done so, and would, i i -och -asc, have given the seat to the con- -ui.t . but they considered that they had no wcr tu do su. Plainly, such power should exist swwhere, however, and Con- yr.s. v provide for its legal exercise 1 ! the President remarks, is not to tl mit ol-staeles in the way of foreigners ,-.n:g 1 aturalization, it is simply to pre- - : t '.l.t- i-erpetuat-on of fraud'.. 1'. i Pris-idt-nt recommends a readjustment 1 tl t tariff, decreasing the number of dcti- a' '.' artnles, increasing the rates and reve nue frmi the articles subject to duties, and stimulating manufactures by permitting the Iree introducliun of such wools and other product-, as we need and do not produce, T.c President endorses the numerous re eoinuiendations of the Secretary of AVar. He di-fu es the condition of the South, but docs hot allude to the civil rights hill. lie rccumiucids the addition of two United ..ati- circuit judge to the existing number; home-tend laws and some sort of territorial go-crauicnt for the Indians; and restoration births, marriiges and deaths, is tinkered a little, as usual. It now reouires a Ver- monter marrying outof the State todeposit a marriage certificate containing the necessary statistics, with the town clerk, in like man ner as if married in the State. The important changes in regard to the supervision of the public schools, made by the abolition ol the Hoard of Education, will be noted. We have no space to indicate them to-day ; but shall do so hereafter. Tie time of holding the courts in the counties of Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle and liutland are changed. The Legislature attended to the case of the milkmen, as well as to the liquor-pcd dlers ; and any one who sella diluted or adulterated milk, is now liable to forfeit to the person to whom he sells it, from $25 to $100, with costsofsuit. Persons sentenced to death have hereto fore been sulyect to solitary confinement, till the sentence is executed ; but now will bo sentenced to hard labor Instead, for twenty months, and solitary confinement thereafter, till executed. The various acts relating to highways will be noted. Persons interested in camp meet ing, in patients in insane asylums, in 'poor debtors," in manufactures of lumber and flu, in savings banks and trust companies ; trustees in suits ; convicts in the State Prism, (who are to be paid a dollars month for good liehavior) ; guardians of insane married women ; officers of towns and cities, and others, will find statutes of greater or less intere-t and importance to them. The list of acts clo-es with the customary act for the support of the State government, laying a State tax of 30 cents for next year, and 3 " cents for the vear after (the taxes for the two years previous were 40 and 35 cent-), and is followed by the resolutions re lating to Recirrocitv. of their iiensions to the few Southern sur-viior- of the war of 1812. Pcrhaiis a noticeable and significant a passage as any in the message is that relating to the reform of tbr ci.il service. In this he gives di-tinct notice to Congress that if it adjourns witl -out o-kive legislation to support the civil -eiti. rule-, such as he has rereatcd!.- Is lore urged, he shall abandon competitive examinations and the civil service rules generally. It has been often said that the waller rests entirely with the President and i),it l.c tan carry out the reform indepen tiii.tlv of Congress. He docs Dot so regard the m uter ; in fact, he says flatly that the -jtrai cannot be carried out without ' general approval" and "positive law to Mipjtort it." On the whole, the message is ahoutUs full ol recommendations as any previous message of President (irant's, and it will be received with wi.ie -interest, and iretty general ap proval. The Laa. Our columns, to-day, show what the last Legislature returned to the public for the Ci-ip.iMki it session co-t the State Treasurv The now laws of importance are not very numerous. There is a long statute estab lishing a Hoard of Insurance Commissioners, requiring Insurance Companies of other State" to rrocare licenses before they can do huines iii this State, requiring such taxes fee-, and penalties of companies chartered by other State-, as such States require of Ver mont Companies, and making divers rule- and regulations designed to protect public ana private interests in matters relating to insurance. There is the act taxing the Kailroad-. It places all the real estate owned and occupied by the llailroads in the list for taxes, with a stipulation that the road-bed and track shall U- considered real estate for such pur poses, and w ith only the limitations that the road-bed and track shall not be assessed at over $2,000 a mile, and that new roads Khali be exempt for ten years. There are several acts relating to the du ties of listers, and the collection of town, school and non-resident taxes. There are two important additions to the ginie laws of the State. They extend the protecti on of the laws (hcrctoforo confined to dser, trout and lunge,) to woodcock, par tridges, wild geese and ducks, salmon, salmon trout, black bass, white-fish or lake shad, pike, mink, beaver, and otter. They p1o forbid hunting on Sunday. Tbeic arc several acts relating to private corporation-. The general railroad law of lS"2is amend ed so that the line of a road organized un der the law may pass into a town not named in the original articles of association, while preserving the general route, direction and terminal point- indicated in the articles. This additi in was found necessary in the case of the Ilnrlington and Lamoille Iload, whose line, a- surveyed, strikes corners of one or two towns not named in the orig inal rrticliR. An important act is ab-o added to the Statute book, requiring towns that have Iionded themselves, for any purpose, to lay the necessary taxes to pay the interest; and requiring the town or city treasurers to pay theinterest. without any vote of the town or city. There is the act prohibiting agents of liquor houses out of the State from plying their trade in this State. The civil damages clause jn the prohib itory law is amended in an important particu lar. The law lforc read ; "Whenever any person in a state of intoxication shall mlfvlly commit any injury upon the person or property of any other individual," etc. ine diflieulty oljxoving that any damage done by a drunken person was wilful, has heretofore practically prevented recovery un der the act. As amended, it now reads . "Whenever any person Ay rtnson ef intoxi cation, s'lall utmmil or maw any injury upon the irsou or property," etc. It is further provided tl at no per-on shall be disqualified a- a w itnes, l,y reason of the marriage rela tion, in any roeceding under the act. The liquor law i- further amended so as to require officers making arrests of persons intoxicated to immediately give notice to a Grand Juror, City Attorney or State's At torney, who must pro-ecute the case, if one is made out upon disclosure ; and the officer, magistrate or prosccoting officer who neglects or relu-cs to do hi- du.T ;n su.n caCi made liable to a fine of from $20 to $100. The little word " not," carelessly or wil fully omitted in the engrossing of the act of 1S72, relating to witnesses in liquor cases, is now supplied. The law now allows no person.to I excused from testifying in such cases, Tor the reason that his testimony may tend to criminate himself, and provides that such testimony shall not be ucd against the fitness in any prosecution for the offence in regard to which the testimony wu giTen.

Mr. Gladstone addre-.'! his tspuMulatiuo directly to Eng lish Catholics-, and in it he declares that the decrees in juetiun are at war with modern thought and ancient hitorr; and that 'no oaeenn now become a convert to Homo with out forfeiting his moral and mental freedom and placing hi?, civil luyalty and duly at the mercy of another. He recalls the repudia tion of the doctrine-, now jj-oinulcated by the church, by the Kogli-h and lrth Catho lic clergy before Catholic Emancipation in lf2U. He allow- no weight to the distinction which confine-f the Pope- infallibility to mitten of faith and moral-, Mnee moral-, in clude the whole field of human activity; and he maintains that, tie the Poj-e fallible or infallible, the Ciuncil exacts "absolute and entire obedience tu hhn," and joints oat that under tbi- ciim a large number of matters of the utimM mil importance have in every Githoltc country been declared to be GCL-let.ia.stical concern. lie demands, con sequently, frum Knglih Catholic, that if the l'uj-e hall make any claim on tbo-e who adhere to U couiiuuuiou that will in anv wuv "iiutiair the iutcgritv of their civil allegiance, it Imll be energetically re pudiate'. 11) way ot bowing that hi fears are hut ihmitncal, I e point- to the struggle in d'eimativ and the one impendim in Aus tria, and at:it that tho Papacy would not engage in conflict ul thi kind, if it had not in view an attempt to recover, by force, the t cm j "oral jower in Italy. hundred and -ixteen thou -and copies of the am ph let had been old,at la.it account-. and it was Mill in great demand. OfcouiM) it has called out omc rejoinder?. Arch bit-hop 31anning ha briefly replied, declar- 1 That the atican decrees have in no jot or tittle thanked either the obli'ratiuns or the conditions ui civil allegiance. H. That i he civil allegiance of Catholics ia" undivided as that ot all Christians, and of all men who recognize a divine or natural xnor.il law . 3. That the civil alien a nee of no man 3 unlimited : and therefore the civil allcci a nee of all men w bo believe in God, or arc coverned bv con-cience. is in that sense divided. He also declare- that he and his flock are a loyal as Mr. Glad-tone, and deprecates the stirring up of the strife, which, he says. going to brinj down great publican! prnate calamities on Germany. Lord Acton, a learned and able Catholic nobleman, has written an extended letter, which i- virtually an endorsement of Mr. Gladstone 's tio-ition. Another Catholic nobleman, Lord Comovs. has taken up the same lbe. He regrets that Mr. Gladstone should, as a matter of polite ness, nave applied such a word as bloody to the reign of Queen Mary, though he ad mit- it to be true. ith this mild reserva tion he adopt- pretty much all that Mr. Gladstone has written. He goeson to reply to Dr. Manning, and remarks thtit though it is not likely that the present 1'ope will adopt against Queen Victoria the course pursued by a former Tope against Queen Elizabeth " that is, giving bis sacred sanc tion to an attempt to assassinate her "there is nn telling what edict might 1 is-ued by the author of the Syllabus." Ho adds squarely, that .the effect of the new dogma of infallibility ha- been to place before Kng lish Catholics the alternative of withholding their allegiance to their sovereign on the one hand, or ri-king their salvation on the other. Monsignorc Capel has also taken part in the controversy, but he merely repeats in another form that every Catholic has a right to think what he likes as long as he does not go against what has been laid down by the 1'ope. His words arc that every Catho lic " has a perfect right to discuss undeci ied questions, but always subject to the suppres sed firmness in his mini that he would obev whatever the Church should declare." On this -ide the water, liishop Gibbons, of Itichmond, Va., lias entered the discus sion. He affirms that the declaration of the Pope's infallibility, does not in the slightest degree alter the relation existing between the temporal and spiritual power. The de finition of iafallibilitr, he says, strictly con- iioes the papal prerogative to faith and morals : and he declares that Catholicshave suffered too much in the sacred cause of liberty to raise their bands against it. Harper's Wttlly, and most of the Pro testant religious paters, sustain Mr. Glad stone's view of the case, and instance thn opposition of the Catholic clergy to the com mon schools, in thl- country, as showing that the japal authority extends to temporal matters. The controversy causes not a little commotion, in both the religions and polit ical worlds, and the end is not yet. Revolution la Mississippi. 

DESPERATE F1CDT ECTWIX.V IUK COLORED MILITIA AND THE CITIZENS OF VICES BCKC. The contest over the office of Sheriff, at Vicksburg, Miss., recently vacated by Crosby, a colored man. at the demand of the citizens, because be had not given a bond, has resulted in open conflict, and the loss of a number of lives. Saturday, Gov ernor Ames issued a proclamation ordering the citizens to disperse to their homes, and calling out the colored militia to assist in enforcing bis proclamation and reinstate Crosby. Monday morning about nine o'clock, the negroes, to the number of TOO or more, appeared, advancing on the city from six different roads. The citizens had rallied, however, to repel the attack, and drove the colored militia back with the loss of 2j killtd and wounded and 40 prisoners, the citizens losing one killed and two wounded. The court house is still in pos session of the whites, and the negro Sheriff is a pri-oncr. The negroes in the country are riported burning the dwellings and gin liouses. A public meeting of the citizens, Monday evcninir. ria-std rc-oluti irs recommending all good citizens to ab-tiiu Irom intlicting any persuiial violence upon Crosby, and tiiat turtntrtuorts bo used to nave bim re moved from 1 1!ico in somo legal manner. There is some talk of legal proceedings against Governor Ames and his Attorney- ueneial. beorge t. Harris, lor inciting and advising the invasion ot the city by the negroes. Hie President's Message. To the Senate and House of Representa tives : Since the convening of Congress, one year ago, the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries such as has not been witnessed with us lor many 3 ears. Speculation as to the causes for tbisprostri tion might be indulged in without profit, be cause as many theories would be advanced as thcro would bo independent writers those who expressed their own views, with out borrowing, upon the subject. N ithout indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostration, therefore, I will call your at tention only to tho fact and to some ques tions as to which it would seem there should not be disarrecmcnt. During this prostration two essential elements of pros currency that shall bo authorized. Such importance do I attach to this subject and so earnestly do I commend it to your atten tion, that I give it prominence by intro ducing it at the begiuning of this mcs-age. OCR 

DELATIONS WITH OTHER rOWEES. During tho past year nothing has occur red to disturb tho general friendly and cor dial telations of the United States with other powers. The correspondence sub mitted herewith between this government and Its diplomatic representatives, as also with the representatives of otner countries, shows a satisfactory condition of all ques tions between the United States and the most of tbo-e countries, and with few ex ceptions, to which reference is hereafter made, the ab-ence of any points ot difference to be adjusted. LELCICM AND THE UNITED STATES. . VENEZUELA. It is with regret I announce that no farther payment has been received from the government of Venezuela on account of awards in lavorof citizens oT tho United States. Hopes have been entertained that if the Republic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years, its great nat ural resources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though it is now understood to bo at peace with other c-untries.a serious insurrection is reported to be in progre-s in an important region of that Republic. This may bo taken advantage of as another rea son to delay the payment of the dues of our citizens. pcrity have been most abundant. Ubor and "- rfilr l? "ZT, ?Vr !t.i. ,.,. v,. ir.w ,,-.,,,.

Katon, Senator from Connecticut, for the term com mencing March 4, 167j, were read and placed on file. Several bills were introduced and tablol till the appointment of standing committees, including one for the revision of the customs and collection laws. In the House tho roll-call showed 22S members, only, pre-cnt. Four new members were sworn in, including Chittenden in place of Woodford, of Xcw York, Dick Scbell in place of Mellish, and Carpenter in place of Elliott of South Carolina. Mr. Phelps, of N. J., asked unanimous consent for the consideration of a bill to amend the law known as the "Press Gag law " by expressly excepting libel suits. Mr. Hale, of New York objected. liills were introduced from the committee on appropriations : Legi-lativc bill, $19, CJ3.43I ; navy. 10,970,000 ; army, t-27,-701,500.

The report of the -ecretary of the navy is largely devoted to showing how much superior the present condition of the navy as a means of defence is to its condition.at the close of the late war. The secretary says that he now has at his command six teen iron clad vessels in first-rata scan orthy condition; while at the end of tho war tbero was hardly more than one left in lighting trim. Mr. Uobeson i- in lavor of continu ing tbi system of repairs, which is really the recoo-truction of iron-clads. until our navy i- much stronger than at the present time. He also says that while the total number of sea-going vessels i not greater than ten ears ago. yet the strength and scrviccableness of the navy on a j-eace foot ing ha- been greatly iocrea-ed. His esti mates for the next fiscal vear were some what in excess of i-19,00O,0OU. The hou-e committee on appropriations has cut down the actual amount to be appropriated to about 10.000,000. THE 

AKVV. The annual report of the secretary of war shows that the expenditures of the de partment for the last fiscal year were $42.- KG,3II, a reduction of $3,99?,993 from the expenditures of tje previous year. The report fairly bri-tles with recommendations. Among the more prominent are the following- The sale of the various arsenals at Alle gheny, Pa., Columbus, 0., Detroit, Mich., Pikcsville, Watervliet, X. Y., Watertown, Mi-., and Washington, and the retention of the 1-ptingfieU armory and the Frankfort arsenal and a few others, the proceeds of those sold to be applied to the erection of one grand arsenal fur manufacturing pur po-e-, to be established near New York : the e-tablishment ol a powder depot and experimental grounds for testing heavy ordnance; the restoration ot the sy-tem of mileage, anil the payment of officers and employes traveling on duty in lieu of actual expenses as now uilowed ; increased appro priations lor the collection of torpedo ma terials, fur ammunition for target firing, for the manulacture ol arms, for equipping j the militia, and for the publication ot the ofScial records of the war of the rebellion. oum 01 me union ana conieoerate armies, to be available at once ; alo appropriations for a permanent military prison. The sec retary also recommends that desertion be considered a felony, cognizable by courts of criminal jurisdiction, and that offenders be arrested by marshals and deputies like other criminals, but juri-diction to be con current witd tnat ot military courts; also turn juri-uiciion its comerrca on military tribunals over military tiersons charced with murder and other felonies. The sec retary is opposed to tho reduction of the army, noldmg that a reduction of the number of men without a reduction of offi cers and posts is not economical. canital. ltoth have been largely unem ployed where security has been undoubted. Capital has been attainable at very nnder ate rates. Where labor has been wanted it has been found in abundance, at cheap rates compared with what of the neccs-arics and comfort of life could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements of pro-perity, therefore, have not been de nied us. A third might be added : oursjil and climate are unequalled within the limit of any contiguous territory, under one na tionality, for its variety of products to feed and clothe a people, and in the amount of surplus to spare to lecd less layered people. Therefore, with theso factsin view, it seems to me that wi&s statesmanship at this sc-sion oT Congress would dictate legislation igno ring the past, directing in proper channels thtso great elements of pro.-perity to any peoplo. THE riNAXCIAL QUESTION. Debt, debt abroad, is tlis only clement that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause aDy contin ued depression in the indu-tries and pros perity of our people. A great conflict for national existence made nece-sary for tem porary purposes tho raising of large sums of money from whatever siurce attainable. It made it necessary, in the w isdom ol Con gress and I do not doubt their wi-Jom in the prcmi-es, regarding the neccs-ity ol the times to devise a system of national cur rency which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency of the civil'zed world. This begot a spirit of speculation, involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happine-s or prosperity of a pooplc, and involving both directly and indirectly foreign indebt edness. The currency lieing of fluctuating value and therelore unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation in itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a for eign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should I13 naid in coin and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted. gold or its equivalent, ine good laitn o: the government cannot bj violated toward- creditors without national di-graee. but our j COMMERCE SHOULD BE EMOl RAoED, American ship-building and earning capacity increa-ed, foreign markets sought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that wc may bo able to pay these debts, where a new market can be created for the sale of our products, cither of the soil, the mine or the manufactory. A new means is di-covered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to the aivantago uf the whole peop c. Hut in my judgement the first step towards accomplishing this object is to securo a currency good wherever civil ization reigns, which, it it becumes super abundant with one people, will 5nd a mar ket with some other a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give to it it- value. Gold and silver aro now the recognized mediums of exchange the civilued world over, and to this we should return with the lea-t practic able delay. In view of the pledges ol the American Congress when our pre-ent legal tender system was adopted and debt ex tracted, there should be no delay, certainly no unnece--ary delay, in fixing by lcgi-U- tion a method by wtm-a we will RETURN TO SPECIR. To the accompli-hment of this end, 1 wish your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no pro-perous and permanent revival of business and indus tries until a policy is adopted, with legis lation to carry it out, looking to a return to a specie bais. It is ca-y to conceive that the debtor and speculative cla--cs may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant, until tney can throw a portion of their burdens upon others; but even these, 1 believe, would be disappointed in the te-ult, if a cmr-e should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal tender medium of exchange. A revival of produc tive industries is needed by ail classes, by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate trom realization upon its sale. Hut admitting that the-e two clas-es of citizens are to be benefitted by expan-ion, would it be honc-t to give it ? Would not the general lo be too great to justify ach relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to iue his own legal tender to the extent of bis liabilities as to do this ? Would it not be safer, for fear of over i-sues bv unscrupulous creditors, to say that initiate the convention of July ISth, IS53 between the United States and Belgium, has been given, and the treaty will accord inely terminate on the first day of July, 1675. This convention secured to certain llelpian vessels entering the ports of tho United States exceptional privileges, which are not accorded to our own vecls. Other features of the convention have proved sat-i-factory and have tended to the cultivation of mutually beneficial commercial inter course and friendly relations between the two countries. I hope that negotiations which have been invited will rc-ulc in the celebration of another treaty, which may tend to the interests of both countries. OUR RELATION'S WITH CHINA continue to bo friendly. During tho past year the hostilities between China and Japan, growing out of tho landing of an armed force upon the I-land of Formosa by the latter, have occa-iuncd unoa-iness. It is earnestly hoped, however, that the diffi culties ari-ing from this eauso will be ad justed, and that the adrance of civilization in thc-e empires may not be retarded by a state of war. In consequence ol the part taken by certain citizens of the United States in this expedition our representatives in those countries have been instructed to impress upon the govern ments ot China and Japan the firm inten tion uf this country to maintain strict neutrality- m the event of hostilities, and to carefully prevent any infraction of the law on the part of our citizens. In connection with this -ujiject I call the attention of Congrc-s to a generally conceded fact, that the great proportion vt the Chinese immigrant- iwho come to our shores do not come voluntarily to make their homes with us and their lahjr productive of general pru-pcrity, but come under contracts with head men. who own them alniost absolutely. In a worse form does this apply to the Chine-c women Hardly u perceptible per centage of them perforin any honorable labor, but they are brought lor sbanielul purpusi.-, to 1110 disgrace ol ice comma mtus where sLtid and to the great de- THE DErLORACLE STRIFE IN CUBA continues without any marked change in the relative advantages of the contending forces. Tho insurrection continues, but ipain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife irive the insurrection a sig nificance which cannot be denied. Its dura tion and the tenacity of its adherence, together with the absence of manifested power of suppression on the part of Spain, cannot be controverted, and may make somo positive steps on the part of other powers a matter of of sclf-ncccs-ity. EXPATRIATION. I had confidently hoped at this time to bo able to determine how far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance was applicable to citizens of tho United States. Congress, by the act of the 27th of July. lsCti. as-crtcd the abstract right of expatriation as a fun damental principle ot thisirovcrnmcnt. Not withstanding such assertion and the neces- ity of frtquent application of the princi ple, no legi-lation has been had definini what acts or formalities shall work expa triation, or when a citizen shall be deemed to have removed or to have lost his citizen ship. lh importance of such definition is obvious, lleprescnta lives of the United States in loreign countries aro continually called upon to lend their aid and the protection of tho United States to per-ons concerning the good faith or the reality of whose citizen ship there is at least treat que-tion. In some cases too provisions of the treaties furnish some guide; in others it see is left to the persons claiming the benefit of citnen-hip whilo living in a foreign coun try, contributing in no manner to the ner lormanee of the obligations of a citizen else where. Tho status of children born of American parents in a foreign country, or American women who have married aliens, of American citizens residing abroad, where such a question is not regulated by the treaty, are all sources of frequent difficulty and di-cu-sion. Legislation on these and similar question, and particularly defining when and under what circumstances expa motion cm be aivompli-lel nr b- prc- sumea, is especially needed, in ttns connec tion I earne-tly call the attention of Con gress to the difficulties ari-mg from FRAUtll LENT N VTl R KLIZ - TION.

Among tho highest pojcs. The eftcn ancridfd law for regbtntlca of lleprescntativcs of all the principal west ern railroads resolved, at a meeting in Chi cago on Wednesday, to utterly abolish the free pas system from the first of January. What is more, having voluntarily adopted this determination, they will probably carry it out; whereas, if the measure had been forced upon them by adverse legislation they would evade actual.while giving formal compliance. Xo law or legislature can prevent the roads carrying free such rrsons as they really desire to carry free. If for bidden to giie passes, they will give com- uiuiauou ucneis, or orders lor tickets, or directions to refund the money paid for ticket-. Iiut if all were voluntarily to re solve to grant no more passes, it" would amount to something , and would undoubt edly bi money in the railroad pocket. THE INTERIOR. The annual report of the .Secretary of the Interior affords some interesting statistics. The ca-h receipts for public lands were nearly two and a half millions of dollars; dd to this over three and a half million of acres entered under the home-tead act. and nearly a million acres entered under the timber culture law and it will bo seen there is an amount of new land in process of cul tivation which is to tell immensely upon the production of food. The entries under these two acts amount to more than hall a million of acres more than in tho preceding year. This is a sufficient reply to those who have been anxious becau-c ol the return of immi grants, either for a time or for good and all. The destruction of government timber is going on rapidly. It has always been the case that the frontiersman has paid little respect to the rights of government in tim ber. As a rule be has stolen :t without mercy und without compunction ofcon- icnce Over three and a ouarter millions of acres have leen certified to railroads.

The annual report of Attorney General Williams shows that there were judgments during the last fiscal year, in civil suits ii favor of the United States, of $2.0-21,721 the amount actually realized was 607,192. Of the criminal cases, 0,01s were terminat ed, including 2,021 convictions, of which 102 out of 000 were under the enforcemcut acts. The expenses of marshals, commis sioner, etc , for the year were 2,009,730, or S3G1.I33 less than durinir the nrevinns year. The amount awarded by the court of claims was -.l-.-iis.&ui, against total claims of 1,051,300. The attorney general re commends that the United States district courts be given authority to is-ue subpoenas directing the attendance of witnesses before the court of claims, and that the latter bo given power to puni-h for contempt any failure to obey: that beads of ilpnirrmpnt be given authority far the uo in court of rebel records in the pos-cion or the gov ernment; that the police force ot the Dis trict ol Columbia be increased; that all the district attorneys and marshals be paid by salary only, fees being abolished; that a penitentiary be erected in the District nf Columbia for the confinement of convicts, instead of that at Albany: that a uniform mode be provided for tbo selection of jurors for the United States courts, and the enact ment ot a law regulating the fees and costs of clerks, marshals ami attorneys of the United States courts. ALL DIRT CBUCATIONS ARE OBLITERATED IV THE UNITED STATES, and now we commence anew, each pos-es-sing all be has at the time, 'ree from en cumbrance. These propositions aro too ab surd to be entertained for a moment by thinking or honest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only fes- in de gree a the hope is held out that a conve nient seasjn will at la-t arrive lor the good work of redeeming our pledge to com mence. It will never come, in my opinion. except by postive action by Congress or by- national disasters which will de-troy lor time, at lea-t, the credit of the individual and ihc state at large. A sjund currency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of the nation of individuals. 1 believe it is in the pouer 0 Congress at this session to devi-e such le gislation as will renew confidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career o: prosperity to la-t for many years and to Ihe sometimes rugged and homely, but K.aLS """"'J understood sentences, in which President Grant annually informs Congress of the atate of the country and conTejs his recommendatioai to them, are sore to contain much good sense and wis dom. This is no less true of the message which wo print this raorninj, than of its P"ors. We ire not sore, indeed, that this Isnot thebestof intm. iertattr THE 

NATIONAL ORDViVCE. The chief of the Huron of Ordnance, in his annual report recommends the re-armtu tnent of the navy with breech-loading rilled cannon, which can be done at very small cost, in view of the reduced number of ships and of guns required. The present types of foreign armed crui-in--shins earrv four and a half to six inches uf crmor, and at presect we have no guns except the 13-inch in tue monitors which will seriously injure the lightest of these armed vessels; but sub stitute a even or eight inch rifle for the 1 1'inch smooth-bore, which even our small est ships carry, and few of them would come off without great damage. The re cent experiments on the conversion of smooth-bore to rifled cannon developed no unexpected results, and the Chief of Ord nance does not deem it possible to convert a cast-iron smooth-bore into an efficient riSe by any system of rifling. The martiags of Miss Tcnnle C. Claflin to allf. John Green is announced. It was JiardJr ntteejary to mention hi name. 

SAVE THE CREDIT OF THE NATION AMI OF THE I-EOrLE. Steps towards the return to a specio basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought lor end. lbere are others which 1 may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in valuo labors under two great di-advan tages - firBt. having no ose for the world- acknowledged mediums of exchange, gold and silver ; these are driven out the country because there is no demand for their uc. Second, the HEDIUX Or EXCHANGE u-c being of a fluctuating value for after all it is only worth iust what it will purcha-e of gold and silver, metals having an intrinsic value just in proportion to tho Honest labor it takes to produce thcin larger margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is months from the date of production to the date ol realization. Interest upon capital mu-t be changed, and ri-k of fluctuation in the value of that which is to be received in payment added ; hence, high prices, acting as a protection to the foreign producer, who receives nothing in exchange for the pro duct ol his skill and labor, except a curren cy good at a stable value tho world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer than tnat tno greater part ot the burden ol exist ing pro-tration lor want of a sound linan cial system falls upon the working man who must, niter all, produce the wealth, and the salaried man, who superintends and conducts business, the burden (alls upon them in two ways : bv the depriva tion of employment, and by the decreased purchasing power ol their salaries. SOME SUGGESTIONS. It is the duty of Congress to devise the method ot correcting the evils which ore acknowledged to exi-t, and not mine; but I will venture to suggest to or three things which srem to mo as absolutely ncccs-ary to a return to specie payment : The first great requisite in a return to pros perity is that the legal tender clause to the law authorizing the issue of currency by the national government should be repeal ed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act ; not to apply, however, to payments ol sal aries by the gosernment, or for other ex penditures now provided bj law to be paid m currency. In the interval pending be tween repeal and final rcsumDtion provi sion should be made by which the iecretary of the treasury can obtain gold, as it may become necessary, from time to time, from tho date when specio redemption eooi- meccc. To this might and should be ad ded a revenue sufficiently in excess of ex penses to insure an accumulation of gold in me treasury 10 sustain redeinDtion. 1 com- mecd this subject to your careful consider ation, believing that a favorable solution is attainable, and that if reached by this Con gress the present and future generations trill ever gratefully remember it as their deliverer Irom a thralldom of evil and dis grace. rBiE 

SANKISG With resumption, free banking may be authorized with safety, git ing fffll protec tion to bill-holders, which they have urder existing laws, ludcel, 1 would regard free banking as e-sential. It would give proper elasticity tj the currency. As aore currency should be required Tor the transaction of legitimato business, new banks would bf started, and in turn banks would wind up their business when it was found there was a superabundmia of cur rency. The experience and judgmen; c,f the people can best decide just how much Currency is required for the transaction of the business of the country. It is unsafe to leare ph settlement of this question to Congress, the Seirstary of the Treasury, or the Executive.

It appears tquitable that an opportunity should be offered to the citizens of other States to present their claims as Well as those iiritish subjects, whose claims were not admissible under the late commi-sion, to the early decision of some competent tri bunal. To this cz.i, I recommend the necessary legi-lation 1 1 organize a court tu dispose wf all claims of aliens offered, in an equitable and satisfactory manner and to relieve Con gress and the departments from considera tion of these questioas.

A copy of the proclamation is submitted herewith. THE BOUNDARr LINE. A copy of the report of the commissioner appointed under the act of March, 1S73, tor surveying and marking the boundary between the United States and the liriti-h possession- from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Ilocky Mountains,is here with transmitted. I am happy to announce that the field work of the commission has been completed and the entire line from the northwest corner of the Lake of tbo Woods to the summit of thel'ocky Mountains has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is believed that the amount remaining unexpended of the appropriation made at the last session of Congress will be sufficient to complete the official work. I recommend that the authority of Congress be given to the use ot the unexpended bal ance of the appropriation in the completion of the work ot the commission, in making its report and preparing the necessary mips. duties of the government is that to atf ird firm, efficient and equal protection to all its citizens, whether na'ivc luru or natural ized. Care -h ould be takt.a that a right, carrying with it such support from the government, should n it he fraudu lently obtained, and sboull be bestowed only upon lull proof of a compliance with the law ; and vot there are Irequent instances of illegal ami fraudulent natural ization and of the unauth irizcl use of certifi cates thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulent character ot the natur alization has appeared upon the face of the cert.li.-atc usell . in others exaaiinition dis ci jse that the bolder had n it complied with the law, and in otVrs ecrtihcaus have been obtained where the ptr-ons holding t iem not only were nit entitled 1 1 be natjralized but bad nut even been within toe- I nited states, at the time of the pretenlei natural ization.

OUR RELATIONS WITH TUREEV. It has been deemed advisable to cxerci-c the discretion conferred upon the executive at the la-i session, by accepting the condi tions requireu uy me government 01 lumcy for the privilege of allowing citizens ot the United States to hold real c-tate in the former country, and by assenting to a cer tain change in the jurisdiction ot courts in the latter. Acopy ot tho proclamation upou the-o subjects is herewith communicated. there has been no material change in OUR RELATIONS WITn THE INDEPENDENT STATES OF THIS HEMISPHERE, which were formerly under the dominion of Spain. Marauding on the frontier between Mexico and Texas still frequently takes place, despite the vigilance ot the civil and military authorities in that Quarter. Ihc difficulty of checking such trespasses along the course of a river of sucfi length as the Hio Grande and so olten furdablc. is obvious. It is honed that the efforts of this government will bo seconded oy those 01 .Mexico to the euectual suppres- ion 01 the acts 01 wrong, from a report pon tho condition of tho business before the American and Mexican joint claims con vention, made by the agent on the part of tne L-nited States, and dated October 2s, 1572, it appears that of the 1.071 claims tiled on the par: of citizens of the United States, 431 bad been acted on, and 175 were in the handsot the umpire, leaving 1G2 to be disposed of ; and of the 903 claims filed gain-t the United States. 728 had been finally decided on, and 272 remained to be Al J I- .l 1 r 1 . uisj,o.s-u 01. cincc ine uaie ui sjcu report other claims have been di-poscd of, reduc ing somewhat the number still pending, and others have been pas-cd upon by the arbitrators. It has b:come apparent in view of these figures and ot the fact that the work devolving on tho uuipiro is particularly laborious, that the commission would be unable to dispose of the entire number of claims pending prior to the first day of February, IS75, tho date Sxed fur its expiration. Negotiations are pending looking to the securing of tbo re sults of the decisions which have been reached, and to a fur;ber extension of tho commivion for a limited time, trbich, it is confidently hoped, will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close.

THE RU- RT nl THE SHEI.TVRV I F TnK TRE151 KV, whi.-h by law is made dirccilv t Congrcx., and forms n 1 part of tin- meage. will shew the receipts and expenditures of the gov ernment tor the l-t n'seil vear. the amount received from c.uh s..uree ut revenue and the amount paid out f ir each of th- depart ments of the gov-rnmcnt It will be ob served trom the report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has Iieen but s.2,34l.!-B2 30 lor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1-71, and that for the current fiscal vear the c-tiu at.d receipt- over ex penditures W,1 11, ,t mi..!i exceed .9.00O.- 000. In view of the 1 irgc nati mal debt ex isting, and the obligation t add one per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now tj over 31,000,001) per annum, I submit whether revenues should nut be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for tho sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations ot the government. At the last session ofCongrcsCa very consider able reduction wasmadein the ratesnf tm. tion and in the cumber of articles submitted to taxation. In connection with this subject I venture the onnion that the means of col lecting tho revenue, especially from im port-, oate oeen so embarrassed by legisla tion as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to coiicci, to me aireet loss ol the treasury and to the prrj udieo of the interests of honest importer and tax paver I',.r secretary of sue treasury in nis report lavurs legi-lation loosing to n cany return M specie pay- ineni-, mus .jup irtinr tiesr- nreri m-iv cxprrs-eu in iui- un-iji' lie ai-o recom mends economy 111 appropriati in, calls at' tcntion to the loss of revenue fnin repeal ing the tax on tea and coffee, without hen. efii to consumer, recommends an increase of ten cents a gallon on whiskey, and further that no modification bo made in the bank ing and currency bill p t-sod at the la-t ses-ion of Congress, unless modification should become necessary by reason of the adoption of measures forrcturning to specie payments, in these recommendations I cor dially join. I would suggest to Congre-s the pro priety of READJUSTING THE TARtrf so ns to incrcaso tbo revenue and at the same timo decrease the n'tmber of articles upon which duties arc levied. Tbo-e arti cles which enter into our manufactures and aro not produced at bo-ne, it seems to me. should be entered free. Those articles of manufacture of which vre produce a constituent part, but do not produce ihc whole, that part which wo do not produce should enter free also. I will instance fine wool, dyes, etc. These articles must he imported tu form u part of the manufacture of the biirber grades of woollen good. Chemicals used a dyes compounded in medicines and used in various wavs in manufactures come un der this cla-s. The introdi.cn m Iree of duty ol such wools as vtedonut produce should stimultte the manufacture of g.mds, requiring the use of tho-e we do produce, and therefore would be a benefit to homo production. Thereare many articles entering into home manufacture which we do not pro duce our-clves, the tariff opon which in creaes the co-t of pr 'lueing the manufac tured article. All r rrec:ions in this re gard are in the dir- 1 hi of bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other, and ot supplying one of the elements of pro-perity so much needed. fense of drawing pay more than once for the same period, for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks, and for tne establishment 01 a proiessor 01 rneioric and English literature at West Point. The reasons for theso recommendations are ob vious, and are set forth sufficiently in the report attached. I also recommend tnat the status of the staff corps of the army be rixed.where this has not already been done so that promotions may be made and va cancies filled as they occur in each grade when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. The necessity for such legislation is especially felt now in tho pay depart ment, tbo number ot officers in that de partment being below tho number adequate to the performance of tbo duties required 01 them by law. the efficiency or the navv has been largely increased during the last year, under the iaipul-o of the foreign complications, which threatened lis at tho commencement of tho last session of Con gress. Mo-t of our effisicnt wooden ships vvcro put in condition for immediate ser vice, and tho repairs of our iron-clad fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor. The result is that most of these aro now in an effective stato and need only to bo manned and put in commission to go at once into service. Some of the new sloops authorized by Congress are already in commission, and most of tho remainder arc launched and wait only the completion of their machinery to cnablo them to take their places as part of our effective force. Two iron torpedo ships have been completed during tho last year, and four of our large double-turretcd iron-clads are now under going repairs. When thc-e are finished everything that is useful of our navy, as now authorized, will bo in condition for service, and with the advance in the science of torpedo warfare the American navy, comparatively small as it is, will be found at any time powerful enough for the purposes of a peaceful nation. Much has alo been accomplished during the year in aid or SCIENCE and to increa-o the sum of general know ledge and further the interests of commerce and civilization. Extensive and much need ed soundings have been made lor hydru graphic purposes, and to fix the proper routes of ocean telegraphs. Further surveys of the great isthmus have been undertaken and completed, and two vessels of the navy aro now employed in conjunction with those of England, France, Germany and I'u-.-ia in observations connected with the transit ot veaus, so ucful and interesting to the scientific world. The estimates for this branch ot the public service do not diffjr materially from tho-0 of last year ; those tor the gen eral support of the service being somewhat less, and those for permanent improvements at the various stations rather larger than tho corresponding estimate made a year ago. The regular maintenance and a steady increase in the efficiency of this most impor tant arm, in proportion to the growth of our maritine interour-e and interests i recommended to the attention of Congress The I SE or THR NAVV in time of peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employment ot naval vessels in explorations and surveys of the suppo-ed navigable waters of other nationalities on this continent, especially the tributaries of the two great rivers of outn America, the Oronoco and the Ama zon. -Nothing prevents, under exi-tirglaws such exploration, except that expenditures must tie made in sucn expeditions beyond tho-e usually provided lor in the appropria tions, ine ueid de-ignatel is unquestionably one of interest and one capable of large de velopment ot commercial interest and ad vantage to the peoples reached, and tnose who may establish relations with them. The education of the people entitle! to exercise the RIGHT OF IKANCHUE, I regard essential to general pro-perity everywhere, and especially so in republics. where both education ur previous condition do not enter into account in giving suf frage. Next to the public school the Dust office is the great agent of education over our la-t territory. The rapidity with which new sections are being settled, thus increasing the carrv ing of mails in 11 more rap:d ratio than the increase of receipts is not alarming. The report of the POST MASTER CENXEAL, herewith attached, shows that there was an increase of revenue in his department in ls73, over the previous year, of 1,671 til, and an increase of cost ot carrying the man-and paying employees of 3,011, 40s. The report of the post master general gives interesting statistics of hi- department and comparing them with the corresponding statistics of a year ago, shows a growth in every branch ot the department. a Postal convention ha been concluded with New Sjuth Wales, an exchange of postal cards established with Switzerland, and the negotiations pending for several years pa-t with France have terminated in a convention with that coun try, which went into effect la-t August. An international po-tal congress wa9 con vened in lterne. Switzerland, in September last, at which the United States ws renrn- -nted by an officer of the post office depart ment 01 much experience and of qualifica ti m for the position.

THE TROUBLE IS AEEAN5-5. Another troublo has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of tho constitution of that State, which was adopted in 1SC3, and upon the approval of which by Congress tho state was restored to representation as ono of the states of the union, provides in effict tnat belore any amendments propo-cu to tuu constitution shall become a part thereof, they shall bo passed by two successive assemblies and then submitted to and rati fied by a MAJORITY Or THE ELECTORS OF TnE STATE. voting thereon on the 11th of May, Is74. The governor convened an extra session of the general as-cmbly of tho state, which, on the ISth of tho samo month, passed an act providing for a convention to frame a new constitution; pursuant to the act, and at an election 1. lion the 30th of June. 1574, the convention was approved and delegates were chosen thereto, who as sembled on the 11th of last July and formed anew constitution, tho schedule of which provided for the election of an entire new set of ate officers in a manner contrary to the then existing election laws ol the state.

As Congrc-s is now investigating the political affairs of Arkansas. I IIVVE DECLINED TO INTERIEKE. Tho whole subject of executive interfer ence with the affairs of a state is repjgriant to public opinion, to the feeling of those who, Irom their olac-iai capacity must be used in such interposition, and to bim or those vvho must direct: unless most clear ly on the side ot law, such intcrlerence becomes a crime with the law to supoort it. It is condemned without a hearing. I de sire, therefore, that all neccs-ity lor execu tive direction in local affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. I invite tne at tention, not of Coneress. but of the people of the United States to THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS Or THE-E INHtPPT QUESTIONS. Is there not a di-no-ition on one s.de to magnify wrongs and outrages, and on the other side to belittle them or justify them ? If public opinion could be directed to a correct -urvey ot what is, and to re buking wrong and aiding the proper au thorities in puni-bing it. a better -tale of feeling would be inculcated, and the souner we would have that peace which would leave the States lree indeed to regulate their own coniestic auairs. 1 believe on the part of our citizens of the Southern States, the better part of them, there is a di-pusition to be law abiding and to do no violenee either to individuals or to the laws exi-ting; but do tbey do right in ignoring the exist ence of violence and bloodshed in resistance to constitutional authority I sympathize with their pro-trate condition and would do an in my potter to relieve them, acknowl edging that in s jmc instances they have had PRESENT STATE ADMINISTRATION OF LOlI-IANA has been the only government in that state for nearly two years, that it has been acknowledged and acquiesced in as such by Congress, and nioro than onco expressly recognized by me,( regard it as my clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent us ovcrthruvv by an armed mob, under pretence of fraud and irregularity in the election or Ip72. I have heretofore called the attention of Congress to this sub ject stating that on account of the frauds and lorgenes committed at said election, and becauso it appeared that the returns thereof were never legally canva-ssed, it was impossible to tell thereby whowero chosen; but from the best sources of information at toy command I have always believed tho present state officers received a majority of toe legal votes actuailv cast at th.it c eeimn I repeat what 1 said in mv sneeinl me ( of February 13. 1S73, that in the cvcnt"of no action by Congress I mu-t continue to recognize the governor nt heretofore recog nized by me.

The theory is even raised that there is to bo no further interference on the part of the general government to protect citizens within a state where the .-tate authorities fail to give protection. This 1- a great mistake. While I remain executive all the laws of Cm-re-. and the provisions of the Constitution, in cluding the recent amendments added there to, wilt be enforced with rigor, but with re gret mat tney should nave added one j it or tittle to the executive duties or powers. Let there befairne-s ia the discuion of southern question-, tho advocates of both or ail poli tical parties giving honest and truthful re ports of occurrences, CONDEMNING THE WRONG AND UPHOLDING TBR EIGHT. and soon all will be well. Under existing conditions the negro votes the Kepublican ticket because be knows his friends aro ot that party ; many a good citizen votes the oppo-ite, not because he agrees with the great principles of State which separate parties, but because generally he is oppo-ed to negro rule. This isa most delusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain, and soon parties will be divided not oa the color line but on principles. Then we shall have no com plaint of sectional interference. petitive examinations will be abandoned. The gentlemen who bavo given their ser vices without compensation, as members of tho board to devise rules and regulations for the government of the civil ser vice of the country, have shown much zeal and earnestness in tho work, and to them, as well as to my self, it will be a source of mor tificatio.i if it is to bo thrown away But I repeat that it Is impossible to carry this system to a successful issuo wi-.bout general approval and assistance, and po-i-tivc law to support it. I have stated three ELEMENTS or FROSPERITT to the nation, capital, labor skilled and un skilled, and products of the soil still remain with us.

The subject ol CHEAP TRVNSPORTATION has occupied the attention of Congn -much. New light on the guestion win withoit doubt, be given by the commute.--appointed by the last Congress to invc-tigai,-and report upoa the snbject. A revinl .! ship building and particularly of IRON' SHIP BUILDING is or vast importance to oar national pros pcrity. The United States is now Daying over 100.000.000 per annum fur freights and passage on foreign ships.to be carried abroad and expended in the employment and -upport of other peoples, beyond a fair per centage of what should go to foreign vessel-estimating on tho tonnage and travel of each r, spectively. It is to be regretted that tins di-parity in the carrying trade exists, an I to correct it I would he willing to see a great departure from the usual -our-e ol the government in supporting what might usually be termed PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

Thcro is no class oi government employes who are harder worked than the army officers and men, none wbo perform their tasks moio cheerfully and efficient y, and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships. Legi-lation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the pub lic service. All the recommendations of tho secretary of war I regard as judicious, and I especially commend to your atten tion the following- The consolidation of government arsenals, the restoration of milcago to olncers travelling under orders, the exemption of money received from the sato of subsi-tence .stores from being covered into the treasury, the use ot ap propriations for tho purchase of sub sistence stores without waiting for the beginning of the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made, for addi tional appropriations tor the collection of torpedo material, for increased appropria tions for the manufacture of arms, for re lieving the various States from indebted ness for eras charged to them during the rebellion, for dropping officers from the rolls of the army witboat trial for lot of- PEPRIVE CITIZENS Or THE BALI OT becausj or their political opinion!. Rinds of men, masked and armed, made their ap pearance, white leagues and other societies were formed, large quantities of arms and ammunition were imported and distributed to these organizations, military drills, with menacing demonstrati ms, were helj, and with all these murders enough were com mitted to spread terror among tho-e whose political action was to he supresscd, ir pos sible, by these INTOLERANT AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. In some places colore 1 laborers were com pelled to work according to the wishes of teeir employers, under threats of discharge if they acted othcrwi-r, and there are too many instances in which, when the.-e turcais were uisregarico, they were re morselessly executed be those vvho made them. I understand tha . the fifteenth amend ment totheconstitutio:. wasmaiiatri n.....! this or a like state of t lings, and the act of .'aj 01, 1010, wiia amti mments, was passed to enforce its provisioi,. the object or this ocuig to guarantee to an citizens the right to vote, and to protect them in the free enjoyment of that right.

Com- piamts are mauc 01 mis lnterlerence by fed eral authority, but if the said amend ment and act do not provide for such interference under the ciroumst-nces as abOTe stated.then they are without mean ing, force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse than mock ery and little better than a crime.
