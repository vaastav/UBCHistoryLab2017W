WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. » THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE PRESIDENT WILSON'S message, read in Congress yesterday, is re markable In only one respect— that its dominant note is negative instead of positive. The really Import ant part of It lies in what the Presi dent proposes not to do, rather than In any of the several recommenda tions he makes. No legislation regu lating business is to be enacted. The President desires so keenly to make this point emphatic that he establish ed a precedent by deviating from the written text of his prepared speech to force it upon the attention of his hearers. The President says the Democratic "program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business is now vir tually complete." This is a sharp right-about-face. When Congress ad journed it was generally understood that the administration had at least one railroad regulating measure and Bcveral other bills relating to business still to be acted upon. This was, how ever, before the November elections. The entire text of the President's mes sage indicates that he has seen the handwriting on the wall. Despite the Democratic claims of endorsement at the polls President Wilson shows by the tone of his message that he is willing to forego many of his pet theo ries in the hope of regaining the confi dence of the public, which he appar ently feels that he has lost. This is the keynote of the whole beautifully writ ten, artfully phrased document. There is little else worthy, of note. As was to be expected, he endorses his own water power control and general conservation measures and repeats that our duty to the Filipinos lies In early and complete Independence for the Islands. The President would turn the Filipinos loose to shift for themselves as an example of our un selfishness, regardless of the fact that it would be far easier for us to do just that than to retain our present position as guide and mentor to a peo ple not yet fully prepared for self government. The most selfish course we could pursue would be to do as President Wilson advises. As for a government-owned mer chant marine, to be operated at a loss, such as the President recom mends, how does this differ in essen tials from government subsidy, and how much less permanently beneficial would it be? What we need is a law as liberal as those under which the shipping of England and Germany eails. That alone will bring many boats under our flag. Nothing else will be worth serious consideration. The message is a model of simple, forceful English, but It contains noth ing of particular importance that he has not said before, and it does not measure up to the stirring period in which It was written, nor docs it sound the keynote of public sentiment and public aspiration. It contains little that is new and much that may sound well aa the President says it, but that would not work out in practice as he anticipates. 

"MADE IN AMERICA" THE "Made-in-Amerlca" campaign is on in earnest, if the pages of the ourrent magazines are to serve as a basis for judgment Scores of manufacturers of standard poods—those backed by national ad vertising campaigns—bear the label. Its use bids fair to spread. The Philadelphia Evening Telegraph sees a danger in this that is more than Imaginary. It points out the peril of placing the "Made in America" card on articles of inferior quality, es pecially at a time when wo are bidding for foreign business, and when we de sire to make a particularly favorable impression on the export trade. Unless there is some limitation on the use of the label it will come to mean as little as the "Made in Ger many" sign does now. Goods of a very Inferior nature are being sold to-day bearing the mark of the Fatherland. It has ceased to be a badge of merit and is now merely a tribute to the untiring energy and vematility of the German manufacturer, which is a re* suit scarcely to be desired In our own case. ANOTHER ZEPPELIN SCARE EVER since war was declared there has been uneasiness in London over the possible Invasion of a German fleet of Zeppelins. Just now the people are in the grip of an other "scare." It is declared that the Kaiiar is preparing to send his air WEDNESDAY EVENING, craft over London to drop bombs on the city and timid residents are lying awake nights a-tremble at the least sound. It is altogether within the range of possibility that German aggressiveness may prompt the dispatch of a number of Zeppelins across the channel, but such a trip would be exceptionally hazardous and void of results, so far as the outcome of the war is con cerned. As Lord Kitchener said In a recent interview, dropping bombs on a defenseless city is not war and can have no effect on the ultimate result of the conflict. Such a raid as is pro posed would be costly in the extreme and would net the Germans absolutely nothing, while in all likelihood Eng land would profit by a rush of new enlistments. It is hardly likely that, with an army in the east and another in the west facing an enemy that on both sides has demonstrated that it can fight, the Kaiser is thinking seriously of an aerial raid on London. He has more serious things to think about, no mat ter how much his love for the daring and spectacular might prompt him to give the signal for flight to his airmen. DR. 

BRUMBAUGH'S SPEECH HE speech of Governor-elect T Martin G. Brumbaugh at the dinner given in his honor in Washington Monday night is just such an address as those who know him best expected htm to make. In some quarters there is some pre tense of surprise at the vigor with which the Governor-elect declared himself for the enactment Into law of all his pre-election pledges, and of his expressed purpose to "go It alone" If those to whom he looks to carry out the party promises perchance should fall to measure up to what he believes their full duty. There is nothing new in this atti tude of Dr. Brumbaugh. From the time he entered the race for the Gov ernorship he has been absolutely true to his own convictions. Even in the heat of as trying a campaign as was ever waged In Pennsylvania he never for a moment swerved. He stated his platform in clear and unmistakable terms; he repeated it hundreds of times over the State in his speech making, and those who have followed his career in public life knew that what he favored as a candidate he would endeavor to the full extent of his ability to carry out In office. There is nothing whatever of the "woolly lamb" about Dr. Brumbaugh. He is as fine a type of upstanding manhood as Pennsylvania has ever produced, and those who hailed him at the Washington function the other night as "presidential material" spoke with inoro than the laudatory good fellowship that often accompanies postprandial oratory. OPENING THE EXCHANGES MUCH interest surrounds the opening of the stock exchanges of the country on Saturday. This Interest largely hangs on whether or not there will be such a rush of foreign owned securities to market as was anticipated when at the outbreak of the war the exchanges were closed. There is no fear of a panic. That possibility is eliminated by the fact that the committees in charge will permit no sales below a safe minimum to be announced pre vious to the opening. In other words, holders of securities must keep them unless they can find buyers willing to pay not less than the bottom price fixed by those in au thority, and this figure will, in all like lihood. be what the stock in question brought on the day the New York ex change ceased to do business. The resumption of stock and bond dealing ought to have a wide and very beneficial effect on business in gen eral. Stagnation naturally follows such a condition as has prevailed during the period since the war began. Oppor tunity to buy and sell, to turn securi ties into ready money or to borrow or lend on them will doubtless stimulate business to a degree that will permit of industrial activities and improve ments that have been held up by lack of funds. The country can get along without the stock exchanges; that has been demonstrated. The exchanges can be operated without danger of panic due to the hammering down of prices; that, too, has been demonstrated. So, with its possibilities for good unim paired and its chances for evil greatly reduced, there is no apparent reason why Wall Street should not be per mitted to resume after its long vaca tion. WINTER WORK FOR LABORERS THE announcement that contract has been let and work is to be started at once on the grading of the ground in the lower end of the city for the new Pennsylvania Railroad freight station Is good news. This improvement will give employ ment to scores of men who otherwise would be idle. The examplo of the Pennsylvania company in this respect should be fol lowed by other corporations and by the city government wherever possi ble. This will be a hard winter at best. Mills are closed entirely or working with reduced forces and on short time. Conditions are better than they were, perhaps, but not so much so that there will not be suffering and hardship among the many who are out of work and will be for an in definite period. Any work that must be done and can be done now as well as next Spring or summef should be done. There is a selfish side to this aa well an a philanthropic, if that phase must be considered. Labor is plentiful now and cheap. Next summer may find the reverse true. NOW is the time; benefit yourself and your less fortu nate fellow at the same time. AN EVENING THOUGHT If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatso ever ye will, and It shall be done unto you —John 16:7. EVENING CHAT ] The Telegraph Employes' Association, which has Just entered upon Its sev enth year, is said by one of the most prominent bankers of the city to have been the first of the Christmas savings clubs, so to speak, and to have been in the van of the practice which has turned so many thousands of dollars loose for the holiday trade and to help make many homes happy. For years there have been beneficial organ izations in this city which have de clared dividends, but the Telegraph association is said by this well-Informed financial man to have been the first to arrange for a general distribution of funds Just before Christmas. Just what these organizations have done for Har risburg and Steelton people is too well known to discuss. They have put money for Christmas In the hands of people whose savings had never before reached anything like what they are now able to command and many sav ings funds have been formed along the same lines. The Telegraph association was formed along the lines of some in Philadelphia newspaper establishments and has been watched with interest by men connected with newspapers in other places. People all over the hard coal regions, in fact in every county in the anthra cite field, will he watching the hearing in the Dauphin County Court to-mor row when the anthracite coal tax will be taken up. This action will test the constitutionality of the tax quite as well as the action In equity which was started earlier In the year and which Is now in the hands of the court to determine. What interests the people In the hard coal region Is that half of the tax goes back to the county where the coal Is mined. This means that every township in Schuylkill county, as well as every one In Dauphin, will get a share of the tax for local expenses. The chances are that there will be closer attention given to this hearing than any that has been held for a long time. It is gratifying to note that Harris burg's new Public Library is keeping right up to date. Not only does it provide over 100 periodicals of vari ous kinds for free reading by the hun dreds of people who frequent the building, but it also maintains its col lection of books right up to the mark. This Is well illustrated by a Catalog of books suitable for children which was Issued a day or so ago by one of the big publishing houses. It con- j tained pages on pages of books for youngsters and a search of the booklet shows that every book mentioned is on the shelves of Harrisburg's library. | C. L. S. Tingley, president of the Pennsylvania Street Railway Associa tion, who has been presiding at the meetings at the Board of Trade this week, is president of the American Railways Company, which operates lines in a number of cities of the State. There was an interesting sale of letters In Philadelphia a short time ago and while many Harrisburgers" probably did not know the connection they were of a native of this city who achieved fame as a commodore in Uncle Sam s navy. The letters were those of David Conners, who was born here and who commanded the Ameri can fleet when it assisted in the tak ing of Vera Cruz and who died while in command of the Philadelphia navy yard. The letters had bearing on many notable events. The wind-up of the fiscal year al ways brings some interesting things to light at the Capitol and It has Just been found that some corporations which were not counted as worth much have been kept alive. This is due to the fact that the State assesses them at a valuation of 

SI,OOO, and ilf they do not pay the tax they are wiped off the slate by Judicial proceedings In almost every instance the tax has been paid. Two addresses of unusual interest are scheduled for Friday night before the Engineers' Society at the clubhouse at Front and Chestnut streets. One will be given by George F. Watt, head of the Elliott-Fisher Typtewriter Com pany, and the other by John Price Jackson. Commissioner of Labor and Industry and president of the society. They will talk on ther experiences in Europe during the outbreak Qf the war. Both were caught by mobil ization. I
