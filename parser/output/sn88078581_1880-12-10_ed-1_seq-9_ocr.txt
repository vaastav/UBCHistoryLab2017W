ThiH determination proeiteds from no host lb sentiment or tociing to any part the people of our country, or to nnyoftbulr Interest. The Inviolability of the amend ments reu upon the fundamental principle our (iovemment. They are tho solemn ex- BrmHion of the will of the people of the United tatea.

Hiip;ilv, the his tory of the late election shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to Fifteenth Amendment has heretofore prevailed, It ii diminishtnit. and is likely tu cease altogeth er, if firm and well-ninsidered action is taken by Couuress. I trust the House of HspreseutA tirMand the Senate, which have the riht Judue of the eleetiona, returns and qiialitiuations of their own members, will see to it thtt erery case of violation of the letter ir sta'nt of Fifteenth Amendment is thoroughly investiga ted, and that no benefit from suoh violation shall accrue to anv person or party.

At the time of the passage of tho act now In force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their valuoand glvingthom legal-tender character. It was believed bv many of tho sup porter of the measure that the sliver dollar, which It auth rlr.od, would speedily become, under the operation of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubt ed us to the prnbahtlty of thi result, never theless were willing to give the proposed ex periment a fair trial, with a view to stop the coinage, If experience should prove that the silver dollar authorised by the pill continued to be of lest commercial value than the stand ard gold dolla-. The coinage of silver dollars, under the act re ferred to, began In March, 17. and ha been continued an required by the act. The average rate per month to the present time has been 27-v4'.ri. The total amount coined prior to the 1st of November last wai '2,H47V7.sJ. Of this amount I7.H4 if) 1 remain in the Treasury, aud only t.f,7M. 01 are in the hands uf the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this cur rency in circulation, anil considerable expense has been necessarily in Mirred for thi purpose, but tt return to the Treasury i prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of the friend uf tho measure at the time of its adoption, ths value of the silver dollar, contain ing 412'4 vrainsof silver, has not increased. Dur ing the year prior tt the passage of the bill au thorising ita coinare. the market value of the silver which it contained was from ninety to ninety-two cents, aa compared with the stand ard gold dollar. During the last year the aver age market value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eicht and a hatf cent. It is obvious, that the legislation of Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was based on an anticutated rise in the value of silver as a renntt of that legislation, has failed to produce the ef fect then predmted. The longer the law remains in fore reo uinng as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is n Jt a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this coun try will he forced to sncept a single metal as the Hole leial standard of value, in eirrnlation. and thi a standard of less value than it purport to oe worm in ine recognixm money or tne worm, The Constitution of the United States, sound financial principles and our best interests, all require that the country should have as its legal tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an intrinsic value, a bullion, equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purptrt.s to posses. The Constitution, in express terms, recognize both sold aud silver as the only true fecal-tender money. To banish either of these metals from onr currency is to narrow and limit the circula ting medium of exchange to the disparagement of importont interests. The United State pro duces mor silver thun any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one uf the two precious metals which furnish the coin age of thn world. It will in my Judgment, con tribute to this resnlt if Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation aa reqnire the coin age of silver dollars contain in g only 412 grains pt silver, and in ita stead will authorise the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent vslne a bullion, with gold dollars. Thi will defraud no man, and will be in accord ance with familiar precedent. Congress on sev eral occasions, has altered tlie ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two metal.

Agriculture expresses tho confident bellof that his effort, in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly rewarded. The Im portance of the result attained have attracted marked attention at home, and have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea, and tho manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference of many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the Nation. The report nf tho Commissioner asks atten tion particularly to the continued prevalance of an infectuousand contagious cattle-disease, known and dreaded rn K 11 rope and Asia as cattle-piHguo, or pleuropneumonia, A mild type of this disease, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of groat loss to our farmer, and of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes a market for most of our live stock and dressed meat.

HAYES. EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 5, 1880. Bread-Making In the East. On our return aa instructive tight awaited us. We saw how bread wag baked in an adjoining building. It wag done with a rapidity which explains how of old the supply was prepared erery day, and how if some guest ar rived the housewife could make the necessary provision without delay (Gen. xviit. 6). Among the Fellaheen the dough Is not generally leavened. A round hole in the ground, some one and one-half feet deep, and the same In diameter, forms the oven. In this lie some live coals, whioh, as in Hosea's time (Hosea vii. 6), are not allowed to go out at night, and, when baking haa to be done, are again revived. The housewife first forms a lump of dough with her hand, then suddenly spreads it out with an indescribably rapid action of both hands which can as little ba imitated aa a conjuror1 movement into a cake as thin as a leaf, which with a moistened dab or rag she presses into the hot oven, where it remains sticking. In a minute it begins to move, and is at once taken out to make room for the following one. The bread is now ready, not thicker than parchment, not very relishing, and somewhat sandy on the outside, but really very enjoyable for anyone who has a good appetite. Although of the size of a large plate, such a slice contains but little nourishment, and Jeremiah could hardly have been saved from starvation when only one suoh Siece of bread was given him every ay. From 0reUC$ " Through tt Holy handy Wealthy New York Hebrews. While it is impossible to arrive at definite estimate of the aggregate woulth of the Jews of New York, some idea oi it may be obtained from the fact that there are nearly a dozen who are worth over $1,000,000 each. There are a large number whose wealth ranges from 9600,000 to $800,000, while those whose fortunes amount to 9100,000, 9300,000 and $200,000 will probably number 100. There are 10,000 who are worth from tO, 000 to 950,000 each. The vast amount of real estate owned by the Jews of the city Is con stantly increasing in extent and value. It includes many of the finest sites on Fifth, Madison and Lexington av enues, and some of the most valuable properties on Hroadway, West Broad way, Wonh, White, Leonard, Church and other thoroughfares in the lower part of the city and on the east and west sides. Among the Hebrew mill ionaires of the city, August Uelmont Is generally regarded as ' first. Jesse ellginan ranks next, and Is said to be worth between 9000,000 and $6,000, 000. Edward King, Henry Hart and the Soholle Brothers are probably worth $3,000,000 each, and the Wormsers, Schaffer, Kuhn, Loeb and Hallgarten can each draw their checks for a round million.. Y. Graphic- Brown, the famous sexton of Qraoa Church, New York, is dead. He used to manage all the ultra fashionable parties in that city. There are many stories of Mr. Brown's prompt repar tees. Several years ao he was asked by a young man in society, who wished to be witty at Brown's expense: " Well, Brown, this is a very dull season.' " Very,' answered Brown, sighing ex pressively; "no weddings no reoep lions but," consolingly, "we try to make tht funerals as pleasant at possible." During the forty-five years of hit pastorate over the Port Richmond Re formed Church, Htaten Island, the Ker. Dr. Brownlee has officiated at the fu neral services of nearly every one of the seventy members who composed the church when he became pastor. He has married over 570 couples, and at tended more than 400 funerals. Ho still retains his hold on tho congrega tion, and, though a very aged man. is in sulliciently vigorous health to dia Charge. ixU DantArei iliUlna i The Slavery of Fashion. lti'T the over-exertion and slavery of providing for tho tablo is but trilling compared with that which is ex acted by fanhinn in dress, amusements ami the prescribed anvmnt of "calls1 Interchanged. Even if the cares of a houschouM arc sometimes severe and overtax the strength, yet there is a cnancoiorine mil ana neaithiul exer cise of the whole body, and a good amount of it In the open air. If the la bor of olden times was often burden some, and time nnd strentrth taxed se voroly, it could not he half as injurious to health or disposition as bending for hours over ru tilings and trimminRs that many of the devotee of fashion and style can not afford to have done for them. We all know how injurious con stunt sewing is, restricting the natural action 01 tne lungs ami heart, nnd mak ing the eyes prematurely old. Few, comparatively, can afford to spend mon ey to hire a seamstress after indulging in mo lavisn expense ot Duying ma terials for the elaborate drens which the present harleuuin style demands. But we are by no moans sure that even the herculean task of making tho ureases is as injurious to health and hap piness as the severe strain on nerves and temper as well as strength which ladies with the most plethoric purses experience who traverse tho cities, roaming from store to store, in their In tense anxiety to secure the newest and most unitue styles; and all the time in torture lest after such tod and painstak ing they may have misjudged or been beguiled into a false selection. Ah! if Mrs. has been betore them and at the next grent ball shall appear at tired in a more attractive dress than they have secured nfter all their re search, what a deplorable calamity that would be! In what a depressed and anxious state they are carried home in their luxurious carriage, and sink ex hausted into the elegant easv-chair. "too tired for anything!" With this fear ever haunting them, they repeat these tiresome shopping expeditions day after day. How uncomfortable they make themselves and how disagreeable to others, exhausting even the wonder ful patience of the weary clerks long be fore they have- settled the momentous question they, whom mmy envy, feel ing that they have all that the world can offer. The material purchased, the poor vic tim of fashion's caprices finds her troubles but just begun. The stvlish dressmaker is the ruling spirit, and'per fectly understands that her patrons have put into her hands a power before which the pjoud, sensitive, and to others over bearing victim must bow. The cat plays with the poor, trembling mouse for a whilo before she gives the final stroke. The imperious dressmaker tan talizes her victim by seeming doubts and hesitation, and then condescends to acknowledge that the materials are sat isfactory but fears there is not quite enough. Then she keeps her in sus pense as to the newest, the very newest style, and with trembling, nervous per sistency she bega to know if there is not something just a little more stylish. But the style at last settled, another trouble assails her. The dressmaker, who has the most fashionable custom ers, fully understands her position ; and, although she knows it is for her own in terest to have her work done in time, phe again keeps the poor weary slave of fashion in Suspense and will not be hur ried. When at last the dress, over which the owner has spent more time and strength and comfort than the hardest worked housekeeper is subjected to, Is brought homo, look at it! What can be more ungraceful than a lady dressed in the extreme of fashion, or, indeed, with but half its absurdities! The Hindoo beauty, who to be the belle "must walk like a drunken goose or young ele phant," is no more at variance with true grace and beauty than the stvlish ladv of the present time, with banged or iruwzy niwr, crosses puilea back, puffed and banded, stooping and tottering on high-heeled boots, and with the added incumbrance of a long train with which she sweeps through elegant parlors or at the slight est beck of fashion drabbles througluhe uiuu ui w iunj uirty HiuewaiKS. io wonder wo hear them so often exclaim, "I am too tired for anything."

But the deep scars that tell where the strain was hardest tell al- o of the balm in Gilead which He who scourges never fails to apply. But the toil of sorrow and care which we make for ourselves has no promise of relief from the comforting hand of the Father, l he slavery of fashion, which so often leads to sin, we can not carry to His throne and hope for relief and a bless ing. is tbore no practical way to break the chains that are becoming each year mnm mtlliriirP T.r. na iriua m.A w ' w mwm uiiid and strength to practical labor of some Kind and less to frivolities, and we shall hear less of feebleness, nervous prostra tion, and our women will lift up their heads rejoicing, making better wives and mothers and securing happier homes; and few will be willing to ac knowledge themselves "too tired for any thing.1 'Afar. if.

I i the country villages It costs 1 rouble copecks (about $1.H5) the pood nearly as dear as in the capital. And wii-u a difference in the wages of the p-ior peasants and the workingmon of tha capital. I might multiply those flgnre. Thf conclusion would be that the most t'r- uie uiHtncLs are me most impovenftnt-a: The Russian Empire has been attacked In her abundant granaries. The hnr vosts have been terribly bad, and in some parts of the country the peasant nave had no work for a year. V. rift can they do nowP A family ol seven persons, which is the average numberiu the country parts of Russia, consumes from 120 to 150 pounds of rye In a year. That makes from 1-15 to 185 roubles, an enormous sum for them. And where s tho money for taxes and clothing to come from? Must the peasant die of hunger without complaining P But this calamity is not merely local. The Afcssager OJficiel itself hiw just pub lished figures proving that this state of affairs extends at the present mnmentlo the Governments of Samara, Khemm, Ekaterinoslav, and to the greMv p nv tion of those of Toural, Saratyff Sim- T..I,oWlo.l ITmU 1J 1. Penza, and Poltova. The same famine is reported from several of the western Governments, Novgorod, Oskof, Brno len-k, and St. Petersburg. , The districts where the harvests have not been quite so bad are unfortunately not very productive. They are hardly able to provide for local wauU. There has been a surplus this year only In Bossarabitv, Volhynia, Esthbnia, and a few districts of the center and Lhe west. Everywhere elso the harvesta have been below the average. ,-o j 1 The districts which have suffered; most have been compelled to have re course to the Government for seed for the fields. Samara received a million roubles, Saratof and Simbirsk a million each, and Astrakhan 60,000 roubles. But all that is for the future, while the' torrible prosent must somehow be pro' vided for. ' ' f , 1 Russia has few newspapers or othef ' publications, yet, nevertheless the mo3t' alarming reports are circulated in re-' gnrd to this fearful nnd universal dis-. tress. Men, women and children are dying of hunger every day 4n the Gov-,, ernments of Samara and Saratof. Sub scription lists have been opened,, but who is able togiveP Tha Government is doing its beL. It haa already given out more than a million roubles, and advanced four millions in favor of the provisioning fund a fund which at the present moment amonnts to only five millions, a sum ridiculously small to 1 meet l he need. At Moscow bread cost six copecks a pound, and ten copecks for white bread, in the oonntry it is still worse, and vtl- . lago pauperism is increasing each year.. Tne primitive system of agriculture, to gether with the weight of taxation and the results of the overtaxing ot the vil- iRCArn riv that1 sln j nt tnarntiinf rnt nrmtnrv Lnnwn nnHotthA nmn r4 bmtla. ki, is ruining a large proportion of the peasants. ..... Silent, But Stormy. may seem, there was recently held In Boston a silent but stormy convention, A large assembly of ladies and gentle- ' men were so excited that they rose to ,. their feet, gesticulated violently to each other; and yet not a word, not even a cry, was uttered. The appareut con-. trad Union is removed by a simple ex planantion. The ladies and frautiemon - were holding the annual convention of -the New England Association of Deaf -Mutes, nnd the excitement was created by the President's address. He charged that certain solicitors of the society had collected money to build a home for deaf mutes and retained forty per cent, of the amount, as commissions. In an instant several solicitors were on their feet. In violent pantomime they indig nantly protested against the charge. The President, however, free from the interruption of sound, continued to utter Ins address in visible speech while me interpreter translated It into sign language. But there was a visible sen sation, though not a word was uttered or a sound heard, when the President ceased speaking. Four hundred ladies and gentlemen stood up to discuss the charges. It was a strange discussion, to a looker-on. All snoke and all list ened. Faces were contorted in expres sive pantomime, arms moved in violent gesticulation and hands snapped out wora -signs, x 01 not an audible vowel or consonant was heard. The stoical reporters looked on in amazement at the silence of the stormy convention. Youtha Companion. Land-Owning in England. At present land is a luxury. ' To its possession certain social advantages are attached. A vast amount of the land in England belongs to no one in existence. By the will of some one who is dead, it is the property of some one who is not born. The life-tenant, whether he cares for country life, whether he has the means to keep up an establishment, and whether he is overburdened with settle ments and mortgages, Is compelled to own a large house with a large garden and lare pleasure grounds atutched to it. Aa in many instances he is indiffer ent to his heir, and in still more fre quent cases has to save to provide a por tion for his daughters and younger son t he lavs out nothing on tbe estaui. and u unable, by the tenure under which he occupies it, to give snch long leases as would induce occupants to turn it to the best use. Habit, moreover, has oftn led the owner to impose numerous re strictive clauses in the leases that he does ' grant, which cripple the energies of the tenant, and keep him under the tutelage of exploded fallacies. An occupier who wishes to buy lind has, therefore, to pay for it more than it ia worth, aud, beside this, he has to expend a com paratively enormous sura among law yers for acquiring it. The result of all this Is, that land nas aoouutulated to a scandalous extent in the hand of some families, that in others it is a euree to the possessor, that the occupier is not his own master, and that it ia almost im- . possible for any yeomun, wishing to be come posse isor of a smalt farm, to pur Hase one unless he is ready to pay a V VAItIA fnr 1ft 1H rlrtn 1 '" Grant has rntd the residence , I States Senator Coniiee, on . nirwu. nmw , rru ki.ii his horn there.
