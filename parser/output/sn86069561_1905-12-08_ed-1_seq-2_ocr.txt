Speaker Cannon had put his foi t clow'ii ou the custom of decoratii g members desks with flowers fo tl.e Houe was not turned into a con sarvatorv as usual. The Senate ndj turned almost immediitely after swearing in the new members as a mark of respect to the Into Senator Piatt of Connctticut Thus the decks were cleared for business on the first div without any thing definitely being done. But this is not to be expected of an assemblinp Conerps. Now come the con test of legislation and the crisis will of course be in the house. The wav old-timers have it figured out is Rate Legislation, the Panauu Canal, the Phillippines the Sinto ,Domiiieo Treaty and the Ship Sub sidv Rill in the order named. But there wi'l be a firce fight for prrcp dence The Townsend rate bill which is thcamended form of the Ksch Townsend Bill is said to stand the best clnnce of consideration and is siid to more clearlv embody the ideas of the President tlian anvotner ot the numerous bills. But there will be others. Senator Elkinson the other side of the house has a bill and Senator Foraker is credited with another bill. Senator Newlands, of Nevada has a plan, but it is too radical in all-probability to get before tbe Senate let alone stand a chance of nasing. There is the amendment hill of the Interstate Commerce Commission, sent to the Snate by reqnest when the rate hearing was on last Mav, and there are wernl otber bills anv one of which come to the front in the orpeput conflict. Then there is Panama Canal legislation. This wilt moke n strong fight lor recognition in the House, for the President wants $16 000 ono for the canal and he wants it quick as he wants most things that he wants at all. ' Snk prCannou is said to haveji lot nf Ji'sfrd qup.stio.ns to aslr concprninp the Panama Cnnal and what has pnne with the ro.wi crnn olrpad'' appropriated Then there is the njipstion of ih rpdnetinn of the Pliiljjpo'rie tariff and th-n is- ornod Tor a 'nng a till as the House wants to pxnend on 'it. Afterward there is tl)P question of the Santo Dominpn Treatv nnd the ta'T' over of the custom house hv United States There is soul tr .hp snirip inside histr.r" at'"c'p'l to this and the State Department is rpadv to transmit some papers to Congress that will show that the action of the administration in Santo Domingo was necessarrv to preserve the Monroe Doctrine. But that is supposed to be executive session stuff and will promptly get published as soon as the executive session gets to discussing, it. The Ship Subsidy bill is said to stand a better chance of passing in the House than ever before and there is little question that such a measure "would pass the Senate If it ever got that far. But that is an abundance for the present. It Is such an nrny of pressing legislation with a multitude of conflicting interest for and against it as has. seldom before confroutad a session of Congress. And with the regular ap nropriation bills and the urgent deficiency bills, it is a serious question whether the first session of the Congress will get through on the first of June as Speaker Cannon hopes it will. It may not be according to ethics of professional men to advertise, but'tbe country newspaper man appreciates a five or' ten for a little card in the professional column,

And this too, in face of the fact that a few of the would-be leaders of the party are howling of "disruption," "d'scord" and 'machine.'' Judge John M. Lassin, Chajrnian of the State campaign committee was here Saturday in counsultation with Secretary, Halv, and they compiled the vote in the legisative contests. Tnere are 19 couuties still missing., but returns from them will only increase the Democratic majority as estimates made from the vote in them at the last election. The total vote in the Stale exclusive of these counties was 351,- The Democratic, candidates received 194,064 votes and the Republicans 157 026. The Democratic majority is 37 048 These figures are official. In the returns above set out the following counties did not report: Bel 1, Breathitt, Carter, Clay, Clinton, Estil, Gallatin, Jackson, Jess amine. Knott, Leslie, Lyon, Ma goffln, Mercer, Morgan, Shelby, Spencer, Todd and Woodford. In the election last year this dis trict as between the Democratic and Republican parties, 44,510 votes, and gave a total majority, of 91 Democratic. Since the Repub lican vote has materially decreased and the Democratic vote, corres pondinglv increased in the recent election in these counties, it is safe to estimate 3000 majority in this terrytory which will make a Demo cratic majority of 40,000 in the State. In addition To this splendid showing and splendid indorsement of the .Democratic State the Democrats will have a greater majority in the Legislature on joint ballot than in many years. The rank and file of the party through the length and breadth of the Commonwealth with one voice has given its indorsement to the work of the Democratic administration, despite the carping of certain malcontentsjand disappointed offica grafters. The splendid majority rolled up for the Democratic nominees shows this. Nothing more eloquent could be said, nothing I more appreciative could ue given than the splendid vote of confidence which the Democrats, aye, the people of Kentucky, have given the splendid administration of Gov. J. C. W. Beckham and his corps of assistants. Chairman Lassiug is much pleased with the result of the campaign. Ho and Secretary Haly worked long and nobly during the campaign, and their labors have received rich harvest. They are indeed wheelhorses of the old party, Kentucky State Journal.
