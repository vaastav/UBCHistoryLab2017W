I was not sangUinO of fts rjteasins tttyseff, but I-did hope it would please some one, and that the President would have looked thing3 in tbe fece-. I have-vead it somewhat carefully, and if I understand it, and I think I do, it is this 1 irstThat South Carolina has jiist cattse for seceding. Seoond,.That tihe baa eo ight to secede. Tbird, That we have no right to pre vent her from seceding. - That is-the amount "of the Message, substantially. Then the Pres ident goes on to represent, this as a great and powerful country, and that no State has a rTghfto secede frorifft? that alt the power of tlie country, if I understand the President; con sists ia what Dickens makes tbe English Con stitution consist tbe power to-do-.n6thiug.-T: Now, Sir, I think it was incumbent : on the President of.the United States to have pointed out and recommended to Congress aorae-rule, and to have told us what he reommeaded us to do. Butin my judgment, he has ;onUrely avoided this. He has' failed to look the thing in the face -. He has acted like the ostrich hid his bead, -and thereby thought to escape the danger. The only way to escape the i dan- get is to look it in the face? and. I thiuk the country did expect from the President some exposition of decided policy. I confess, for one, I was rather indifferent as to what ;tliat policy should be, but I did hope it -would be decisive. But he has utterly' failed in that respect 1 think tbat the state, of things'; in this country looks to 'one of -two thingss: It looks to absolute submission, not on the port of Southern States, but on the part of 'the North, to an abandonment of their position, U looks to a surrender, of that popular senti ment which has been uttered through tie con stituted forma of the balk)t-boi ; or it looks to open war.

But I can tell that Senator, if he will sum np every case of injury and suffering and aggression by tbe whole North, of the Free States upon the rights they have to .recapture, fuiiinc slaves, and put them all down iu the- darkest colors, and draw it as hideous a lnulli and fancy can make it, and then I eaa show you aggressions on the constitutional nights of the citizens, of the Free States thab will infinitely outweigh and outnumber every aggression by the Pree Slates apon the rights of the South iu regard to thcis slayea, .

I believe Koine existed as a republic for 600 years. That is something, to-lis proud of. But we have not wtvivod. a lifetime of the men who fought the battle o liberty, or the patriots and sages ; who formed our Constitu tion, and Government- We have obtained what we have obtained by great effort aud at treat urjee. It was not tho mere price of the Jtewolulin on tha mere price of the blood that was shed; or the patriot counsels that (binned the Constitution. But, away back, ct-nturias-upon, centuries, in English history, when powes and principle coulended in all those ueutiiries, there has been going on a. ooutent which is culminating iu our experi ment here. No pariot blood poured out on the battle fields of civil war in England: bus been insignificaut in this conflict. I will add this, that we shall presents most humiliating spectacle to this world, if, at this time, when, by the acknowledgment of. the President of the Uuited St ales,, the blessmgs of Heaven have desceudi-d. upou this people in all the channels of their industry aud busi nessat a time when, by tbe confession of the Senator from Georgia Mr. Toombs last year on this floor, this general Government was laitniuuy perlorming all its luacuous : in relatioo tojbe!aye State Jiind every State I say under sot-h- arou'm64uut of a feuthful Government, and I will add of a eubeetirient Judiciary, if this .

Tbe gentleman Speaks of South Carolina. : He conld tell the gentleman that .South Carolina would not bo the only one that would go out. He bad the confidence to' say that his ewa State would not be behind her sisters in boldncssi decision and Brmnexs, and Alabama prom daughter of his own Stale will follow this example of patviotiBin and prido which South Carolina has set her sisters. ' She will undoubtedly go out on tlie 7 th of January, and Georgia will follow on the 10th, and before the 4th of March, before your President is inaugurated, there will be five Slates, if not eight, that will be out of the Union, and will have formed a constitution for a frame of government. An4 in his opinion there is nothing under heaven that could prevent such a consummation. Gen' tlcmcn speak of concession of the vepcal of. the Personal Liberty bills. Repeal then all to-morrow and" yo eSmnot stop this" revolu tion. It is not tto Liberty laws, bat tbe mob law which, the South fears. They do uot dread these Overt acts, for, without the power of thc Federal Government, by force, under tbe Republican ' rule, their institution would not last ten years,' and they know it. They intend to go out of this Union, aim be believ ed this. Before tbe 4th. of March five States will have, declared their independence, and he was satisfied that three other States would follow as soon as tbe action. th aeople can be had. Arkansas will call her Convention, and Louisriauw would follow. And though these ia slog iu the way in the lone star or Texas, in the person of the Governor, who will not consent to call the . Legislature, yet tbe public seutiincnt is so strong that even her Governor may be overridden and if he will uot yield lo thai public sentiment, some Ttx an Brutus muy urize to rid his country of this old, hoary headed traitor.

The North, governed, by such. far see ing statesmen as the Senator from New York (Mr. Seward) will sea the futility of this. In less thau twelve months a Southern.
