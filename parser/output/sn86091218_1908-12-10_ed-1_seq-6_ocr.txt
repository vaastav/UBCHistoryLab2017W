Another case of where the state railroad commission is lacking and the dear peop'e are up against the scant courtesy of the railroad with out a buffer. The papers in question claim that four wholesale houses have been foi'ced out of business through the rate discriminations favoring other points. According io Mr. Stubbs and Mr. Plaisted all that any one has to do is to take the matter up direct with them and presto, change! it is settled, but usually to the advantage of the ."Union Pacific. it ed ly a The approaching special city elec tion might as well be taking place in the moon for all the interest it is at tracting from the business men of the city. It is time that the taxpayers get busy and decide whether they care enough about the question to at least go and register. Less than twenty voters have registered in the two wards at present and the election is only four days distant. Civic duty should impell a man to go to the polls on that day and declare whether he is for the bonds or against them. Any man that stays away should have no kick coming over increased taxes or about the bonded indebtedness of the city. The case of the state versus Frank Lyells will undoubtedly be watched with considerable 'nterest, when it comes up for trial in the district court. There is an open chance that if Lyells gives the testimony he threatens to give in his trial that the men who aid ed him in giving bent to gambling pro clivities may be bxought to justice. The father of the young man while present in the city stated that he would probe the matter to the full and make the guilty persons suffer just as his son is being made to suffer. It often takes a case like tne present one to wake up the people to an evil and the chances are that gambling in this city will be so unfashionable that no man will want to take the risk. The newspapers of the Boise valley have been agitating the establishment of some state institution for the children of parents too poor to give them proper care, or where the moral conditions of the home are such that the children should be taken away. Nearly all of the eastern states have some such institution usually called the state institute of corrections and charities, the aim of the institution be ing to take the children and give them the education and training necessary to make good citizens of them. It differs from the reform school in that no criminal children art admitted. That Idaho needs such an institution is strongly evidenced by the Wilson case which is arousing so much interest in the Boise valley. The state should surely provide some other place for its poor children than the reform school, which virtually places poverty on the same level with crime. The idea of a state printery is being discussed pro and con by the press of the state. The claiii". of those favor ing such a scheme is that it takes the whole matter out of politics and places it on a business basis and in the end makes the whole newspaper field free from political domination. Those oppos ed to the plan claim that it would mere ly centralize the graft with one paper and cut off a very lucrative bunch of work from the various papers. The idea of a state printing plant should not prove graft at all if the state pur chases the entire plant and hires a competent manager on stipulated salary. As it is now, and there is not a paper that will deny the statement, all of the printing bills are allowed, regardless of their size and justness, simply because the publisher handing in the bill was a good fellow and help ed to get the state officials into office. The whole system is pernicious be cause i t makes the newspaper man cringe and bow before men who should feel honored if an honest man looked at them. It is putting the newspapers of this state on the same footing with the cheap politicians who deal out the political pap. The state printery may have its faults, but it cannot be half as obnoxious as the present system of political awards. 

WILL OPEN SKATING RINK. Management Offers $5.00 for Best Name for Hall. The new rink that is being enstall ed by the Brunk Auction & Realty Co.* in the building that was for some time occupied by the Clarke Family for revival meetings, is nearing com pletion, and will be open to the public sometime next week. Mr. Arthur W. Steinle, a member of the firm of Steinle & Jennings, bill posters and distributors, has assumed the management of the new rink. Mr. Steinle is well qualified to manage the new rink in an up-to-date manner, having been associated with the Coliseum and Mammouth Rinks of Denver, last season. The new rink has not been given a name, however, the management pro poses to award a pi ize of $5.00 in gold for the name it selects on the open ing night. Every purchaser of an admission ticket will be entitled to vote a name, and the party that sug gested the name selected will be awarded the prize. The skating surface is 40x100 and the seating capacity will accommo date 200 spectators. The management anticipates a large attendance, and has provided 200 pairs of skates to accommodate its patrons. An oichestra will fur nish the music. There will be skate boys in attendance, a check room, re fi-eshment stand, in fact every conven ience and service that is found In an up-to-date rink. The management proposes to permit the use of the rink for basket ball and polo contests, besides all the latest and up-to-date features, such as fancy, novelty and fast skating, mas que balls, confetti parties, etc., will be introduced at frequent intervals to entertain and amuse their patrons. Private afternoon sessions will be held with competent instructors in at tendance to teach those who desire to learn to skate. It will be the earnest aim of the management to conduct the rink on as high a moral plane as pos sible. The most exacting person need have no hesitancy in extending their patronage, for disreputable characters will be barred and roundyism will positively be prohibited.

ENTHUSIASTIC GRANGE. Pioneer Organization Adds Many New Members. The Pioneer Grange has taken new grip and is getting down to busi ness with the lessening farm work. Eleven new members were taken in at the last regular meeting and a general discussion of needed legisla tion took place. The remainder of the evening was spent m a social way in which the ladies filled a merited part by the fine feast set before the hers. a raem The National Grange has at last un dertaken the organization of Idaho. Chas. B. Hoyt, national organizer from New Hampshixe, is now in the state. Nearly thirty granges have been formed, also two county granges, and the state grange. Five district depu ties have been appointed in the state and the work of organization is being pushed. It is expected that eight ox ten granges and a county grange will be formed in the county this winter. The list of twenty-five topics, sug gested for discussion at the farmers' meeting held last Saturday by request of the president, will give an excellent idea of the lines along which the grange works—they are educational social, legislative and business operation. President Roosevelt, in a message to congress two years ago, called special attention to the grange and the good it is doing. He often calls the legis lative committee Grange in consultation on proposed or needed legislation affecting the farm It is largely due to the persistant efforts of the grange that we have to day a department of agriculture in the president's cabinet, large appro priations by congress for experiment al work along agricultural lines, rural free delivery of mail, and many other things which greatly benefit farmer. Among the men prominent In push ing the grange in this state, are Pro fessor French and Professor Elliot of the agricultural college; A. E. Gipson, of the Gem State Rural, and Elias Nelson. An organizer will be sent to co of the National er. the any DR. G. F.
