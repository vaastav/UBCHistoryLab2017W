2 IDAILY BEUORD-PNIOS WKDNESDAV DIXESBER 0, 1888 THE MESSAGE. Tke President's message opens appropri ately by reference to the historic anniver sary that the sitting of Congress brings to mind. The next division discloses Mr. Cleveland's discomfiture. It is the mingling of fears of discontent with a reaffirtna tion of his views concerning reformation of the tariff'and disposal of the surplus. The President draws a gloomy enough picture of the ton.liii.--i and discontent of tl»e wage-earners of a country which is subse quently spoken ofTis enjoying domestic tran quillity. It fcas been demonstrated that our wage-eareere are better situated, eun more and rnjoy greater comforts -and broader liberties than the workers in any other country upon the face of the globe. The arraignment of combinations and trusts that make speculation of the neces saries of life is not discussion of an Ksue: that unjust combinations of capital, schemes to oppress and tax for private sain are blameworthy and demand strong and effective remedies, none will deny. But the current of assault upon the ability to amass and use capital in the development of the country and the promotion of its industries, even though it may lead some money-makers into vainglorious exaltation and parade of wealth, is not justified in the face of the established truth that in this day capital earns less than at :iny pre vious j>eriod, and enables labor to earn more. Mr. Atkinson has shown that in this de cade capital wins but ten per cent., as against ninety per cent, secured to labor of all profits of investment that engage labor. This process of diminishing the earnings of capital and increasing to labor the share of the result of the use of nionty, has been going on (teadily, and is still pro gressing towards greater reduction on the one hand and larger division on the other. That poverty exists in large communities, is undeniable and lamentable. That it will continue so long as men are improvident and contribute so largely to the gratifica tion of their appetites for intoxicants, is not questioned by :>ny intelligent observer. If the President had sought for the reason for poverty, more than sixty per ■• m. would have revealed itself to him as due wholly to the rimm named. Poverty is a condition of civilization inseparable from it, and will forever exist. If the attainment of tariff reform as de sired by Mr. Cleveland were already reached, and it resulted as he maintains it would, and all tinjust combinations of Capi tal were eliminated, poverty and human distress would still continue, and improvi dence, intemperance and cruelty remain. Instead of Mr. Cleveland's message be ing a philosophic document of stateman like views, suggesting specifics for the ills he deals with relative to " taxation," its tone is all defensive of the President's tariff ideas, attuned to the discontents of the day, as if the one complete and only remedy is the adaption of the scheme out lined in his message of last December. A broader view of the economics of the age would have suggested other remedial measures, and have proved that no sin gle one will bring about a condition of per fect harmony between all interests, or eliminate all causes for grievance, much less satisfy to the extent of hushing all complaint against our governmental sys tem or the conditions of society. The fis cal ]>olicy of the country, the adjustment of its income, the barriers of a tariff and the economics of government generally, have been wrestled- with by Congress and the statesmen of the nation since its foundations were laid. The solution of all questions involved will be worked out or derly and in the light of experience, the infallable guide to the best ends. The paragraphs of the message devoted to the question of the use of the surplus for the redemption of the debt of the na tion, are illogical. It will not demand trained financial ability to understand liiat as the bonds are taken up in advance of maturity, and a saving of millions thus made to the Government, the money paid OJt of the surplus for the purpose goes im mediately into circulation among the peo ple; its retention in the Treasury, it is admitted, would nut have benefited busi ness. But the President holds that had it not been through a tariff revenue plated in the Treasury in the first instance, it would have remained in business and have been worth to the people fully six per cent. Without discu-sing anew the tariff question as to whether the non-collection would have left the money at home or have sent it abroad, it is apparent that since the bonds must be taken up, the cost of redemption met by Government rev enues of some kind, to call them in now at a saving, at in the last seven months of more than f 27,000,000, is an economic and wise policy. There is with much error and illu<ri<Ml •xpression but much of sound sense in the message. Thus the Chief Magistrate does well to draw attention to the vice of "riding" necessary appropriation bills with claims of localities for Government pat ronage and expenditure. That wise meas ures should be unable to reach adoption without purchasing support by acceding to the demands of "riders," is shameful. The references to polygamy; to the need for legislative readjustment of our postal ma chinery; to the centennial celebration ai April next, are timely and wise. The reference to the abuses of naturalization privileges should command attention, but the evils are not fully disclosed by the President nor ■ policy indicated whirl) might well have been suggested by him, that would extend the probationary period and limit the privileges secured in some cases by mere declaration of inten tion. The defence of the policy adopted toward the Apache Indian* is invulnerable; the suggestion to re duce the Consular posts is sound, a< also is the advice that in settling the question of railroad financial relations with die •Government, businew sense should prevail and prejudice he eliminated. The mes sage wisely eoniiaeads the educational methods of controlling the Indian tribes, and properly enough eautiooa the country agaiwt the danger to the system of our Government in yielding too much to the tendency to extend the «t"ope of Federal legislation. The President adheres is his views con cerning' tke fisheries dispute and silver coinage, matter* unnecessary to again go over at this time. The pr<vfornia state ment^ of our delation* witii odMr Govern ments are ni.nk'. and the UHial reference to the great eveais of the times in which we have :i national interest are followed by approval of the reports of the Cahiljt S.-cretaric-, and invitation to consider the daemneqta in fall. As a whole the me* g ge is dwtioguiabed from usual Presiden. tiui review of the coodilion of J|ie Cuun* try mainly by the matter it contains in. • , reference to the tariff and the insister c^ upon its reformation in the direction upon which the President went before the jury of the country in the first week in No vember aod received its verdict. A <ißJU>roxi>E>.T, in a too extended letter-, asks us if the election of Monday was not held under the charter and not under the general election law ? A mis take; there is nothing in the charter what ever, concerning (he polling hours at any •ejection. Moreover, Section 31, of the ■charter, to whk'h he refers, provides that the general livr?, so far as not inconsistent with the chsTter, shall govern in elections, and there k no "inconsistency," because the polling hours are not referred to by the charter, nor indeed any other method of conducting an election. But to pwt the matter beyond all doubt and to answer a long question, the present schools of Sac ratneiyto are not even mentioned in the charter. They were established and are maintained under an Act of tlxs Legisla ture passed in 18C2, while the charter was not given life until 18G3. The Act creating the School Department stands alone and independent of the charter, and all elections held under it are under the general laws of the State; indeed, all elec tions, of every kind in this State, are held | under the general election laws, as to size and color of tickets, hours f>r polling, and all other requirements. The election for Trustee last March, our correspondent will recall, was so held, and the hours pre scribed by the genera! law were observed just as they were at the Presidential elec tion a few weeks ago, when we chose some of our city officers. Our correspondent '■ also asks how it is possible for the Trustees I to refuse to canvass the returns of the election l>oards. The answer should , have been obvious to him. No power can • compel the Trustees to canvass returns of i a pretended election. Their own proda ■ motion discloses the fact that legal election i or pollinir Boon were not named, while i the same document declared the election was to be held under the general laws, and these laws require the exact polling i hou»s to be stated. They cannot, there fore, declare that to be an election which on its faco discloses its invalidity. It is . time, fuiiy time, that the authorities i prove by their action that the blunders of . officials shall not be the means of defeating [ the ri^ht of the people to poll their votes . within the time fixed by the laws. It has ■ happened twice in this city within a year. • and it is time to put the seal of official i condemnation, not condonation, upon it. ■ It is too dangerous a blunder to adopt. Thk Administration's treatment of ex- Consul Mosby, in refusing to pay back to him fees he had jmici in, subject to deter mination of his legal right to them, has been rebuked by the Court of Claims. The Government official?, while admitting that the fees belonged to Colonel Mosby orig inally, claimed that as he had turned them in to the Treasury Department, he had surrendered his right to them. Hud an ordinary business house set up such a claim against one of its employes who left his money in its treasury subject to final settlement, the business world would have scorned it. 

STATE BOARD OF TRADE. It Asks for a Cabinet Representative With the New Administration. |S. F. Bulletin, December 4'.h.l At the meeting ol the Slate Board of Trade to-day a memorial was adopted ask ing the President-elect to appoint as a member of his Cabinet a resident of the Pacific coast. The preamble of the resolu tions suggesting the memorial set forth the I peculiar interests of the Pacific B:ates, as- I serted that representation in the Cabinet :s I of equal value to representation in Con-1 gress, referred to the cot.struction here of the Eteel cruisers, the growing importance I of this port, and the general policy of con cession to Pacific coast intereti'.s shown by I the present Administration, which it was I d sir»d shou'd be cominued.

In presenting this memorial we ate not m- Eendole of the seeming indelicacy of our peti tion. We ere not unmindful of the fact that the Cabinet of th:* President is his political and official family, and we recognize the peculiarly perronal considerations which must, therefore enter iuto the s.!ection of Cabinet ollieers. It remains historically true, however, that geo graphicaj and sectional consideratio s have entered into the formation of Cabinets, and, moreover, that the sectional advantages to en sue make the subject cognate with all other questions relating to the dis'ribution of sov ereignty. The vast extent of the national do-1 main, the growth and expansion of the com monwealths ot I nil nation, and the increasing complications arising out of its foreign and do mettic policie*. impose U]p<Jll the Chief JBxecn-1 the coiutastlr uugmenliug admini-tralivc duties.

WEATHER. Yesterdaj'B Report and a Summitry for No ye inter. The average Signal Service temperature yesterday was 40°, being 4° cooler than the normal temperature for that day. The highest and lowest temperature was 47° and 44°. This shows that during the twenty-four hours ending at 5 r. M. there were but a" difference between the highest aod lowest temperature ou the roof of the Signnlf Office buiiding, while inside the Signal Office the temperature stood W° for thirty-six hours, day and night, and has ranged but 2° in the past four days, the windows being closed at night ai;d open in the daytime.

Army, "> Division of the Pacific, \ San Francisco, December 1, 1888 J Weathtr —The storms on the Pacific coast during the past ruoi.ih have been noteworthy for the general absence of hinh winds, and for the low latitude in which many of them were first observed. To this iatt^r circumstance is due the abun dant rainfall in California ciurin!,' the month, and the comparatively small rain fail in the northern districts. Temperature—The mean temperatur. for the month hus been slightly higher than the normal temperature for Novem ber in all districts west of the Rocky Mountains. The greatest departure from the normal temperature (averaging about five degrees) occurred in Northern Nevada, and the least in Washington Territorj". Rainfall—The monthly rainfall has been in excets lhroughout California, and has been leas than the nornjHl amount in Oregon and Washington Territory. The marked increase in precipitation, with in creased latitude, which is usual on the I'acitie coast, did not appear in November, the rainfall in Los Angeles in the south being nearly equal to that of Portland in the north. Thu following table of rainfall at si lectetl stations shows the distribution of the rain for the month and season : Stations. n i ? ni / ~ z' I if —; ■ 9 rr> • | 5 : 3"o • fi p imvis_ Cnlistoga Kupa..
