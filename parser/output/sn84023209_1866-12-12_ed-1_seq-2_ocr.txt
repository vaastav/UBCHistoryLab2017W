Cb c rrrinan. MONTPEUEK, VT., Vdardy Morals; December 13, 1866, The Appointing Power. There is some hope from present indications tbat Congress will, by some legislation, limit the power of the President ia the removals from office of persons appointed by and with tbe advice and consent of the Senate. As the law and practice now are, the provisions that ap pointments shall ba sent to the Senate might as well be stricken oat of the Constitution The President, without coneahirg the Senate, removes any official, and having thus created a vacancy, commissions one of his followers " un til the close of the next session of Corgrest, Sometime during the next session, as may suit his convenience, he goes through the form of ending the name of the new appointee to the Senate. If the Senate refuse to approve the nomination, the appointee still has a commis sion until the end of the session, and when the commission expire the President gives him another" until the end of the next session of Congress " In this way the President can keep in office, during his entire term, officials whom the Senate have over and over rejected If Congress doesn't reform this uncsnstitutional prac'ice, and thoroughly reform it too, they will deserve to be written down as unfaithful to their trust. . They should either brin tbe appointing power back to the plain meaning of the Constitution, or they should propose to amend the Constitution to conform to the pres ent unconstitutional exercise cf tha power. There is to more Arrant perversion cf a pow er given by the Constitution, than tbe abuse of the t ppointing power has now becose. The fallowing is a summary of the bill which passed the House last session, and is now be fore tbe Senate : The first stction provides that ro officer of the United S'stea appointed on the nomination of tbe President by and with the advice and consent of the derate ha!I be removable, ex cept ly tt e same tgeneies which concurred in fcis appointment ; provided, however, that in case cf disability ir in it conduct in office, cccur rin during tbe recets cf tbe Serste, where the interests of the public mr-y make it reces&ry to displace the incumbent, until the advice and consent f that Ixcy csn be duly bad snd ob tained thereon, it fh?.il be lawful fr tbe Presi dent, on the rt commer.dstion of the Attotrey Gneral. to eusj-er.d the disabled or defaultirg efficer, and to commission arother person to perform the duties of tbe place until the Sen ate shall have an opportunity of acting tbere upen ; and it shall be tbe dutv of the Presi dent, within two days after the next assemblage cf that body, to report to it the fact of such suspension, along with the reason therefor, and tbe name of he person so temporarily commis sioned by him, or of such person as he may think proper to nominate for the pi ice. And in case cf the refu.-al of the Senate to concur in the removal, either by a direct vote thereon, or by advising and consenting to the person ro nominated, the efficer who has been thus sus pended shall thereupon resume the exercise of official functions as though the rame had not been interrupted. But in ro cafe shall tbe person so restored be entitled to any salary or compen-ation for the interval of time during which his functions may have been suspended as aforesaid. The second a?ctirm provides that in case cf refusai of tbe Senate to advise end consent to tbe r-nomtnation of any officer whose term of service may hie expired by its own limita tion, the place filled by the person so renomin ated siaii be regirded, and is hereby dtcUred to be vtciot from tbe time cf such refu.-al. But 6hou!d the Senate adjourn without action on such renomination, either in the way of con sent or disapproval, the same shall be held to ba vacant immediately after euch adjournment. And in no ca.e shall any person who has been nominated by tbe President for any tffice acd rejected by me Senate, or on whose nomination that body has failed or declined to act in tae way of onsnt or disapproval, be appointed or commiioo?d by him after the adjourn ment, and durirrfj the recess of that b-idy to hold the same office for which he had been previously nominated. A ptoposttion his been made in the Senate to strike out the third section of the House bill, and insert, substantially as follows : When a vacancy happening during the re cess may have been hi ed by the President, it shall be his duty to make a nomination be fore the end of the next session. And in case of the nomination of any other person than the one commissioned, and the refusal of the Senate to adv.se and consent thereto, the of fice shall not be considered as vac ml i-d its ad journment ; but the person so commissioned shall continue to bold and erpy the same dur ing the recess, and until be shall be either nominated r rrj-cied, or duly superseded by a new appointee. That tbe heads of departments bhall bold their office for the term of four j ears, unless removed with tbe concurrence of the Senate, and shall nominate, and bv and with tbe ad vice and consent of the Senate, appoint all their assistant and subordinates to hold for the like period, unless removed in the like manner. Seward and Johnson's Policy ns Heard Mexico. The official correspondence between Secre tary Seward and Minister Bigelow, respecting tbe French occupation of Mexico, has j-irt been published. Mr. Bigelow'a despttch giving an account of his interview with Napoleon in which the Emperor told Kim of his purpose not to recall any portion of tbe French troops until spring, is, in its more important part, as follows : 4 I concluded that it would be more satis factory to tbe President that I tbould see the Emperor himseif upon tbesutject. I accord ing'y waited upon his Maj-iy yesterday, at at. Cloud, repeated to him wbat tne Alarquis de Mou&lier bd told me, ai d desired to know what, it so) thing could be door by me to an ticipate and prevent the discontent which I fell persuedeJ would be experienced by my country people, if tbey receive this intelligence wuhcu. any explanation. I referred to the early meeting of Cor gres, when any charge in our relations either with France or Mexico would be likely tc come under discussior, and my fear that his M-jsstj's reasons for post poning the repatriation of the first detach ment of bis troops might be attributed to motives which our people would be disposed to resent. Tbe Emperor said that it was true that he bad concluded to pes'prna the recall of any of his tioops until sprirg ; but that in doing so he had been UitluecceU by entirely military considerations. Al the time be give the or der, the successors of the dissidents, support ed as tbey were by large re-enforcements from the Uui'.ed State, teemed to render any re duction of bis force there perilous to thotte rev maining behind. lie accordingly sent a telegraph to Marshal Baziine, who bad already tmbsrked a regi ment (eighty-first, I think be sain), bat which had fortunately been prevented rrrm sailing by unfavorable winds, directing bim to embark no troops until all were ready to come. This dispaicb, bis Mejesty said was not sent in cy pher, that no secret might be made of its tenor in tbe Uoited States. Tbe troops were then disembarked anrl returned to Oriiib. llis Majesty went on to say that he sent Gen. Castelnau to Mexico about tf e tame time, ch-rged to inloim Maximilian that France could not give him another cent of money tor another man : if be thought he could sus tain himself there aktno. Fiance would not withdraw her troop faster than bad been stipulated for bv M. Druyn deL'Hoys, should such be his desue; bat if, on the oiner band, he was exposed to abdicate, wbich was tbe course bis Mtjesty counseled him to . take, Uen. Castelnau was charged to find some gov- . eminent with which to treat for the protec tion, of Fresch interest, sod to bring all tbe army home in the spring. I naked his Majesty if the President of the United States had been notified of this, or i.v tbinr bad been a one to prepare his mstd for tie change in bis Majesty's policy He sa d that he did not know i that M. de Moustier ought to bave drne so ; that, as these events occurred daring tbe interim of a change in tbe ministry of foreign affairs, it was possible that it had been neglected, though his telegram to Marshal Bazaina was purpose ly sent in a way to show that there was noth ing in bis plans to disguise." Mr. Seward writes to Mr. Bigelow, say ing : We cannot acquiesce : First. Because tbe term ' next spring,' as appointed for the entire evacuation, ia indefi nite and vague. Second. Becime we have no authority for stating to Congress and to tbe American peo pie, that we have now a better guaranty for tbe withdrawal of the whole expeditionary force in the epring than we hate heretofore bad for the withdrawal of a part in Novem ber. Third. In full reliance upon al least a lite ral performance of the Emperor's existing agreement, we have taken measures, while fa cilitating the anticipated French evacuation, to co-operate with tho Republican government of Mexico for promoting the pacification of that country, acd for tbe early and complete resto ration of the proper constitutional authority of tost povernment.

Sherman t-J report to Juarez, Johnson, Seward and company, ff-r orders in this Mexican business. We tiust Congress and tbe peo ple will make co delay in advising Mr. Jobnson and Mr. Seward, that, until we hate pacified our own country and given protection to loyal men at home agaicst the assaults and brutali ties of pardoned and unpardoned rebels, we are in no condition to take upon ourselves the regulation of the domestic concerns of any other state. A government that cannot, as Johnson says it can't constitutionally inter fere to say who shall govern South Carolina, had better not trouble itself just at present about who governs Mexiso. The Complication on the Rio Gbanob. A dispatch from General Sheridan to General Grant, dated New Orleans, Nov. 27, 1866, baa been received, in which Gen. Sheridan sends a copy of a communication from Gen. Sedgwick, commanding the sub-district ot the Rio Grande. Gen. Sheridan says : ' Although the contemplated action of Gen. Sedgwick will not make any complications, still it is disapproved by me as against my or ders, and so far as 1 know, unjustifiable. In structor are ia possession of Gen. Sedgwick that if American citizens, if any are in Mata moras deserviog to be called such, think their grievances could not ba settled by tbe military authorities tbey must seek the proper avenue, the S ate Dcoartiuent, for redress. I very much fear Geu. Sedgwick has allowed himseif to be influenced oy Matamoras shrewdness. Those who bave furnished supplies to Canales to sustain bim in bis acts, since they cannot bave tbe debts aeknowledged by Gen. Ecobe do, nor personal security given by Canales, now find some means t influence this bad ' iuJgment on the part of Gen Sedgwick. Tbe act contemplated by Gen. Sedgwick may not take place, but u u does 1 will regret it. Tha following is (sen. Sedgwick's communi cation abort referred to. It is dated at Browns ville, Texas, Not. 22, and addressed to Gen. heridaa : " The condition of affairs along this border' and especially the state of affairs now existing ia Matamoras, renders it necessary for the United States to interefere, in order that the lives and property of the American citizens, may be protected. Camles has just declared to his men that they most help themselves.' This means indiscriminate pillage, robbery, breaking open of stores, etc. Canales has of late frequently violated the neutrality laws now existing between the United States and Mexico ; and in view of all these facts, I deem it my bounden duty to interfere, and shall this day demand of Canales the surrender of tha city of Matamoras, which I shall bold until I receive instructions from ycu." It is said that Gen. Sheridan has removed Gen. Sedgwick. It is certain that the latter officer transcended his duty when he invaded Mexican territory. That he and the troops under him were glad of an excuse for taking a hand in the Mexican business, there ia not much doubt; and it is not impossible that Gen. Sheridan himself would have been glad to have received orders from Washington to drive Maximilian out of Mexico. Intervention in Mexico has cost tbe French Government a j good many millions, and if the United States legal government from representation in.

The Committee on Pensions to inquire whether any pensioner in disl jyal states who were struck from the rolls have been restored in violation of law. 7tb. A special commit'ee to investigate the releaae of the murdered Union soldiers in South Carolina. There was a decided feeling manifested in the caucus to assert all the prerogatives of Congress, and to provide against the evident purpose ot Mr. Jobnson to use all tbe means at bis command to aid tbe Southern disloyal communities in their resistance to the just demands of tbe loyal people .of the country, Sexpreeiad in the recent elections. TiKRiTORiAL Governments for thk Rebel States. Last Wednesday the House of Rep resentatives passed the following resolution ; Resolved. That tbe Committee on Territories be inatructed to inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill providing territorial govern ments lor tne several aisiricuj or country wnu in the jurisdiction of tho Unted States, for merly occupied by tbe ooco existing states of Virginia, ortn uaronna, douiu eaiunua, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Lou isiana, Arkansas and Texas, and giving to all adult male inhabitants born within tbe limits of the United States, or duly naturalized and not participants in the late rebellion, full equal political right in such territorial governments. Tbe vote upon tbe resolution was 107 to 37, the Jobnsooiied Republicans, like Raymond Hale and others, voting against it. It docs not pledge tbe House to pass a bill to re-organ- lxe tbe southern states, yet it is a tolerably clear indication of. tbe conviction of tbe Re publicans in Congress tbat each a bill is the onlv true method of reconetr action. Ae to what action Congress will probably take on ibis subject, a Washington dispatch has the following : It is the opinion of a prominent Senator who faai bad unusual opportunities of otser ration, tbat at the present session of CoDgrees an enabling act will be passed, rejecting tbe present governments of the rebellious states aa nullities, and that the loyal people of those states, without respeot to color, will be au thorized to choose delegates to constitutional conventions, and that the conventions will be required to submit tha constitutions thus form ed to a rote of the people for approval or re jection. The Senator makes these statements with so much earnestness, that little doubt can be entertained of his source of informa tion. He predicts that the bill will very ehortly be presented for action." Constitutional Akindmxnt. Mr. Went worth of Illinois offered the following resolu tion in the House of Representatives last Tuesday : Besolved, In respect to that portion of the Preaident's Message tbat relates to those com munities which claimed to be the Confederate thA mnv AAra fit flifl nvaltv vh Ah hAVA rrAnil- . .. .: :. i . i pireu ill buueu uuuiiuttuiuca oiuuc its itai nu- i jQurnmcus, no wen no ui uia icoeiib otouuuj in the loyal states, additional reasons for in sisting on the adoption of tbe pending Con stitutional Amendment, before it will coneider tbe propriety of giving them congressional representation. This resolution passed by a vote oi 1U to 32. It indicates that Congress is as firm in its position as the President in his; and it leaves the persons claiming seats from the Southern communities which reject tbe con stitutional amendment, to contemplate a con-1 tioued absence from Congressional Halls a3 the reward of their contumacy. Will not Liav. Mr. Raymond, of New York, is disinclined to leave the Republican party. At the caucus at Washington he ap peared, and when interrogated, declared tbat be was still a member of the party, und not a Johnson man or a Democrat. Lie, howev er, said be etill adhered to the platform and address of the Philadelphia bread-and-butter convention as be understood it. The caucus voted not to expel him from tbe meeting. He votes, however, very much as he did last ses sion, and that is, generally, with the Demo crats. Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois, offerer! tbe follow ing resolution last week in tbe lloute ; Resolved, Tbat tbe President of tbe UnitcP States is hereby respectfully requested to in form tbe House, if not incompatible with the public interest, bow near tho verge of the Government tbe present body called a Con gress is at present, acd if it is not nearer the centre than be formerly supposed. After tbe resolution had answered its pur pose, creating considerable merriment, it was rejected . SurrsAGK in mi District or Columbia.

Tbe bill also prevents tbe payment of money out of the Treasury for this purpose, until Congress shall order it. It is a measure which affects the late slaveholders of Kentucky and Mary land to the amount of several million dollars. Mr. EJmundsalso presented the resolutions I f it .

In view of all these far. they deemed it t:ecefy to to borne pni ed with a ple-i for the Constitutional Amend ment ; then Pennsylvania and fair sister etates gave their voice for Congress ; and finally Wew York and tbe whole long train of states declar ed against the President and his policy.
