ISTHMIAN CANAL ROUTE. N1CARACUAN ROUTE RECOM MENDED. Canal Com mlulita Keporte Completion ot Caual Will Heiieire ipendttnre of axoo.oou.ouo. The report of the isthmian canal commission which was submitted by the president to congress Tuesday gives as the unanimous conclusion of that body that "the most practicable ud feasible route for an isthmian canal under the control, management and ownership of the United States is that kuown as tho Nicaraguan route." The commission estimates the cost of this route at 8JO0,q 10,000. Thia esti mate is much in excess of any hereto fore made and is due to Increased di mensions and other features not here- ofore considered. The commission also estimates the cost of a canal by the Panama route at 8142,343,573, ac cording to one route, or 8158,378,258, according to another route. As between the Nicaragua and Pan ama routes the commission sums up a number of advantages favorable to tho former. It states also that under the concessions giveu by the government of Columbia to tho Panama Cauul com pany that governmeut is not free to gruut the necessary rights to the United States, except upon conditions made by the company. After golug over the several routes, the commission considered the dimen sions of the cunul to be built Having in mind the increasing size of ocean going vessels, it was determined to fix upon a depth of thirty-live feet at mean low water, and a bottom width of HO feet, with some increase of dimensions at certain poiuts. These dimcusions are larger thau those proposed for any previous canal scheme. While they may seem excessive today, the com mission says that the canal is not likely to bt! opened within ten years, during which time tho increase iu maritime dimensions is likely to continue. A I width of 150 fect will allow all but the very largest ships to pass each other in the canal, while the locks are of a dimension to permit even the largest ships afloat to be maneuvered. 'The size of locks is 7-10 feet in length, 84 feet in width, in tho clear, with a depth of 33 feet.

Brltlth Offer to Transvaal. The London correspondent of the Leipsiger Tegeblatt has received from a highly-placed personage in England the following communication: "If the Boers should now surrender, England will permit them to create a new Boer republic in tho northern half of the Transvaal. It Is in order to keep the possibility of this open that Eugland has not yet officially announced to the powers tho annexation of the Trans vaal. "One of the first conditions, however, is that the announcement of surrender must come from Kruger. There is every prospect that he will soon be ln elined to this course, nis visit to France has taught hlin that any nu ra ce r of empty assurances of sympathy will not result in the slightest practi ;al help. Germany will make a fur ther contribution to the education of Mr. Kruger, and it will be to her alone that the Boers will owe thanks if Eng land makes them concessions." This statement acquires some im portance by the fact that the seml-of-iicial Post reproduces it and adds that it does not sound improbable, and that England has every incentive to erect a itrong bulwark against the warlike iribes of Central Africa in order to as lure .the possession of the territory they have just conquered.

CHINA WINNING? 4 London Paper Thinks So, Owing to the Attitude of United States and Knatla. The London Spectator in a striking article dealing with the Chinese crisis expresses the opinion that the most re jent occurrences at Pekin foreshadow Chinese victory over tho allies. "The quarrel has been brought to the test of force," it says, "and force on the civilized aide has proved insuffi.. cient. This result is mainly due to the attitude of Russia and United States. If China escapes with the payment oi a small indemnity and many promises on paper, as seems not unlikely, since Germany and Great Britain may not be willing to incur the expenditure and risk involved in persisting in their de mands, it will be a victory for China, for nothing has occurred that will con vince the Chinese that their mighty Empress has been defeated or that E rope can avenge any future massacres.
