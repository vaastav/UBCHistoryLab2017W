CQHNVr) POUT NP HOTEL 0TB, UMEffi IN Charge Against Peacock Dismissed Because Of Error 1IUL OF 01HERS AKRfcSIED IS POSTPONED HEADS OF FIRMS BROUGHT INTO COURT ON WARRANTS IS SUED AGAINST COR PORATIONS An error In the manner of making nut and serving tho warrant against W. C. Peacock & Co., charging that firm with selling adulterated liquor re sulted In tho dismissal of tho chargo against tho head of I lie firm, V. C. l'eacoclt, In Police Court this morning. Attorneys Dreckons and Ashford rep resented tho defense in tho cascH against Peacock, Chu Hut llln and Sing I.oy. When Clio Hut Hln's case was call ed Ashford Immediately moved that the defendant bo discharged from cus. tody on tho ground thero was no war rani against mm. Tno warrant on which ho was arrested was sworn out against tho Wing Chung Lun Co., and the attorneys for' the defense claimed that tho urrtniofone or-the supposed members of the firm was Illegal. "There Is no charge against this man," said Ashford, and he Is not here by duu process of law. Wo demand thai ho bo released. Andradu opposed tho motion on tho ground that Clio Hut llln was not yet charged before the court. Judge Whit ney continued tho case until tomor- ow. In tho coho against W. C. Peacock the 'same arguments wero advanced. but with better Biiccess for the de fense. Dreckons argued that Peacock was Illegally arrested since tho war rant was directed against tho corpora tion ot which Peacock was supposed to bo thu president. "Thero Is a wny III which thu corporation may be brought Into court on such a charge," ho aald. "but a single member of tho firm cannot be tried for au offeuso committed by the firm." Andrado did not strongly oppose tho motion for dismissal In this case, hav ing apparently come to tho conclusion that nothing could be gained by trying the case In Its present form. It Iff probable that new warrants, not open to the same objections, will be Issued. Harry Juen and Joo Clark did not have tho same excuse, of being only co-partners In a firm, and will prol ably have to stand trial. Doth asked ror a continuance in oruer 10 ouiain counsel, and their cases wero contin ued. Clark's case was set for Decern-j Ler 18 and Juen's for the 12th. Sing Loy, charged with thu samo of fense, was also represented by Dreck ons and Ashford, who entered a plea of not guilty and demanded Immediate trial. Andrado objected 011 tho ground that the prosecution was not ready, anil Judge Whitney set the case for December 11. J, J.
