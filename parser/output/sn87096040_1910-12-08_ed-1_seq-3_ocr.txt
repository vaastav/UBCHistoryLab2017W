It waxed from bad to worse, and at last I saw 1 had a bad skin disease. I tried many widely known doctors in different cities but to no satisfactory result. The plague both ered me more in warm weather than In winter wild being on my leg joints !i made it impossible for me to walk, and I was forced to stay indoors in the warmest weather. My hopes of recov ery were by this time spent. Sleepless nights and restless days made life an unbearable burden. At. last 1 was advised to try the Cuticura remedies [Cuticura Soan, Ointment and Pills] and I did not need more than a trial to convince me that I was on the road of success this time. I bought two sets of the Cuticura Remedies and after these were gone I was a differ ent man entirely. I am now the hap piest man that there is at least one true care for skin diseases.

Thousands of men and women, who !ue felt the Eting and torture of that dread disease, Rheumatism, which is Eo respecter of age, persons, sex, ')ior or lank, will be interested to Vnow that it is one of the easiest af flictions of the human body to con qu(r. Medical science has proven it, r.oi a distinct disease in itself, but a symptom caused by inactive kidneys. Hhe.imatism is uric acid in the blood finj other waste products of the sys tem which should be filtered and fcti,imed out in the form of urine. The function of the kidneys is to sift these poisons and acids out and keep the blood clean and pure. The kidneys however, are of sponge-like substance, *1,0 Ifles or pores of which will some t-n.csi, nther from overwork, cold or -V-hMe become clogged, and failing In tur-ir function of eliminating these poisons from the blood, they remain tlie \eins, decompose and settling about the joints and muscles, cause tlio untold suffering and pain of rheu matism and backache, often producing ^'implications of bladder and urinary disi'ase, and general weakness. The following simple prescription is said to relieve the worst cases of rheumatism because of its direct ac t'On upon the blood and kidneys, re li"iing, too, the most severe forms of |°RESIDENT TAFT BRINGS STAL WARTS AND INSURGENTS TO WHITE HOUSE.

President Taft invited a number of regular and progressive leaders to the "White llou.-o today. The presence of the regulars, who dropped in singly and in pairs during the day attracted little attention, but political Washington began to sit up and take notice when Senator Cum mins of Iowa, recognized leader of the senate insurgents, arrived at the ex ecutive offices, lie was quickly foN lowed by Senator William K. Rorah~of Idaho, a progressive. I.ater came the information that Senator Rristovv of Kansas had been invited by telephone to the White House, but had failed to put in an appearance. The president did not attempt to bring the senate leaders together in one big: conference. There never were more than two in his private office at one time. Ho saw Cummins and liorah together and then had a private word with each alone. In insurgent circles tonight it was said the preliminary conference had given no definite promise of success.

OVER NINETY MILLIONS. Growth of United States Has Been Rapid in Last Decade. Washington. Dec. 3.—The population of the United States should be 01,193, 400, if the rate of increase, shown by the states on which complete returns have been received and tubulated by the census ofiice. is maintained. Counting New Mexico and Arizona for present purposes as states, the full returns of the enumeration under the thirteenth census have been tabulated for 33 out of 49 and the District of Columbia. They show a grand total of 00,355,ITS as against nn.203.G3G for the same area in 1000. This is a gain of just 20 per cent over T.".004.r.7r in dicated by the census of 1000. States not yet announced are Arkansas. Geor gia. Kentucky, Louisiana. Mississippi, Montana. New Jcrsev North Dakota, North Carolina. South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas. Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Of those it Is expected that Texas and Washing ton will show very lariro increases and that Georgia, New Jersey, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and the Pakotas will go by and beyond the average so that there is little doubt that the exact grand total will be even more than the present tabulation indicates. It would not be surprising if the aggre gate would be almost 91.r»00.000. USE
