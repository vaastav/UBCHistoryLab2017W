For Christinas, J tCbe tribune. Only Repofclioan Newspaper in the Coant?. HENDRICKS & COMPANY OFFICE Bissell Building, corner Laporte and Center Streets. mtred at the Postofice at Plymouth, In diana at second-class matter. Plymouth, In A, December 6,. 1906. Congressman Brick in an interview at Washington says the Republican party is in danger of defeat. Mr. Brick is mistaken. It is only the would-be bosses who thmk they are the party, that are in danger of defeat. J J The first steamer of a Russian mer cantile line has just reached New York from Odessa. It will ply be tween those ports and thus open di rect communication with th-- Black sea regions and may become the pio neer oi Russian commercial prosper ity. J Ji J The Interstate Commerce Commis sion recommends to President Roo sevelt that the public coal lands be withdrawn permanently from entry and developed under government control, thereby breaking up the coal monopoly and producing a revenue which, it is estimate!, would pay the expenses of the government, jt j j Congressman Brick's press agent at Washington, A. W. Tracy, has tak en his type-writer in hand to tell what wonderful things Mr. Brick will do in the next few months, to try to regain his lost prestige in the Thir teenth district, but the people of the district know what his political ma chine has done and is now doing and Mr. Tracey's fulscme praise will have little weight with them. J J Charles E. Hughes, -the new gov ernor of New York says that he will require proof of devotion to public interests before making appoint ments. He is making h clear that he is his own spokesman and that he is in in lme with the best senti ment of the country in this regard. It is becoming the habit of executives to show that they have minds of their own and that they can direct their own affairs. That such is the case bespeaks well for the future of Amer ican politics. J J J Chairman Moorman of the Repub licat. district committee, doesn't seem to be in harmony with Congressman Brick on the tariff revision subject. Moorman is inclined to be a 'stand patter," for the present at least. But Brick can easily whip Moorman into line with himself. When W. G. Ucti drkks was elected county chairman here, Moorman swore he would stand by Hendricks until heaven and earth passed away if necessary, but when Brick and Riddick cracked their whips he wilted. Jfi J jf Congressman Brick has his press agent, A. W. Tracey, inform the peo ple of this district that he expects te boss President Roosevelt, and will call on the . president and urge him o assemble congress March 5, to re vise the tariff. He will tell the pres ident to "put on the gloves" and jo after the stand-patters In earnest. The people of this district think the vote which Mr. Brick received at thj late election will not impress the president favorably as to Mr. Brick's ability as a boss. J Ji J The attorney-general of Texas claims to have proof that United States Senator Bailey received va rious sums of money, presumably as counsel fees, from the Waters-Pierce Oil compmy, and that he borrowed $3,000 which was audited by the Standard Oil company. A few weeks ago the senator unqualifiedly denied that he had ever received money from either of the companies, and it is believed in Austin that if the sttorriey general's charges are proved ' Mr. Bailey4 'wiil'be "defeated "for re election. , J JI J Carl Riddick tells the Plymouth Chronicle why he and Jim Goodrich undertook to organize the lower house of the legislature instead of leaving the organization to the rep resentatives elected by the people. It requires considerable gall on the part of Goodrich to do this after almost electing a majority of Democratic representatives to congress and the legislature of this state. Webster's old "Elementary Spelling Book" said "Experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other." If Noah Webster was now alive he would see that some fools cannot learn in the school of experience. J J Jt The final session of the Fifty-ninth congress opened at noon Monday December 3 and will close March 4. The passage of the appropriation bills and as little legislation as pos sible is given out as a forecast of the plans of the Republican leaders; but the Democratic leaders will try to force the tariff issue to the front to make campaign material for the elections of 1903. A. W. Tracey, Con gressman Brick's press agent at Washington, sent flaming notices to the South Bend Tribune last week announcing that Brick would try to have President Roosevelt call an ex tra session March 5 to revise the tariff, but' Brick may change his mind.

SOMETHING ABOUT TEXAS. John R. Jones Gives His Impressions of the "Lone Star State." Many farmers of Marshall and ad joining counties have invested in Texas lands during the past six months and every wester.i excursion carries more people from this county to Texas than to any other state or territory, consequently what John R. Jones, county clerk of Marshall coun ty, writes will be of interest to our readers. He says: After traveling over various parts of the state of Texas, I believe 1 can with some degree of propriety say, "The Empire State of the south west" is a designation richly merited by her, and as well she has been po etically called by her people, "The Lone Star" because her ensign when an independent republic, like her coat of arms today, was emblazoned with a single star. While the flags of five nations have floated over her imperial dimensoins, yet she succeeded in wresting her in dependence from Mexico in 1836, un der the celebrated leadership of Gen eral Sam Houston, vhose name stands today without a peer so far as Texas is concerned. The city of Houston in Harris county, with a population of 50,000 and commercially one of the best lo cated cities in the state, and I doubt not the time is not far distant when it will be one of the important cities of the United States, is no mean monument to be left to this distin guished general. In the year 1845 Texas abdicated her soverignty and was formally an nexed to the United States, in De cember of that year. With only a few thousand inhabitants at that time, she today exceeds three and a half mil lions of people, mostly a cosmopoli tan population, coming from every state in the Union and from every civilized nation on the globe. There fore her people are characterized by thrift and enterprise and by a spirit of progress and liberality that is not surpassed by any state in the Union. -Owing to her vast extent of area, 205,780 square miles of the best all round productive soil in the world, with a population in 1900 of only 11.6 persons to the square mile, it is suffi cient evidence to indicate that much of her vast territory has not as yet been reduced to private ownership and in my judgment no place will better bear investigation for .those who want to own. their own homes, than will Texas. It is but nalural that one of the first inquiries from those seeking homes in a strange land is, "What are the school privileges to be enjoyed there?" In reply to same I beg to say, it affords mo much pleasure to inform you that Texas, m this regard, has been peculiarly for tunate. She has a State University, an A. & M. college much to be en vied and the Normal and other educa tional institutions. Last but not least, her Constitution requires a six months term of public school during each year; but best of of all, Texas, unlike her sister states, when she came into the Union, in stead of ceding her public lands to the general government, reserved them to herself. And at that time a large percent of her lands were pub lic lands, one half of which was set aside as a permanent school fund. It follows that today she has a school fund represented in bonds, land notes etc., exceeding $45,000,000 in value, of which only the interest arising therefrom can be used in the conduct of her schools. It goes without say ing, the influence of her educational system and facilities upon her citi zens may be read in the fact that she has only fourteen per cent of illiter acy far less than any other south ern state while among her white population, there is only 6 per cent of illiteracy. The advantages for obtaining a home, surrounded with such oppor tunities is exceptional; but that they are being appreciated by the people throughout the .country at .large, is proven by the fact that a flood tide of immigration is now pouring into the state. The last trip I made to Texas over the M. K. & T., the train was run in three sections to accom modate 'those bent on seeing for themselves what heretofore they were compelled to be satisfied with only reading some one else's glowing reports. These excursions were largely .'made tip of men from the North and East, who after selling their land from $50 to $100 per acre are now buying lands equally as good in the great commonwealth of Texas at from $10 to $20 per acre. I have seen lands that were bought a genera tion ago at from 50 cents to $1.50 per acre, which are today selling at from $25 to $75 per acre and this all tak ing place away down in Texas. His tory is repeating itself, but with ac celerated speed. The last chance to obtain cheap lands in the United States is being eagerly seized by the homeseekers and investors in antici pation of; that land famine which must soon' and inevitably come upon us. He who buys a home in Texas is not only enriching himself but con tributing .vastly to the population, the power, the prosperity of the glor ious EmpireState of the Southwest Texas. A Sensible Southern Editor. Clark University at Atlanta, Ga., is an institution for training negro preachers. ' Its president is a colored man, Dr. W.H. Crogman. There were statements sent out in connection with the late riots in that city charg ing him and his institution with har boring negro criminals. The Atlanta Georgian, published by a prominent leader of the whites, comes out in the strongest defense of Dr. Crogman.- It declares that he has al ways advised his people not to har bor or defend criminals of their race, but to aid in bringing them to jus tice. The article in The Georgian and the cause of the university will work together for the good of both whites and blacks. South Bend Times. President's Message. President Roosevelt urges upon Congress the taxation of inheritances and incomes with a view to the curb ing of swollen fortunes and the plac ing upon their possessors of a share of public burden. More effective supervision aid control of railways and industrial combinations is recommended in the interest of public policy and as a check to government ownership and socialistic sentiment. Japan is the subject of a remark able eulogy, discrimination against the Japanese in "schools is denounced and a law permitting the naturaliza tion of the islanders is asked. Lynching is condemned and an earnest appeal is made to both whites and blacks for co-operation for the betterment of both and the punish ment of all crime. Warning is given against, the abuse of labor injunctions and limitation of the practice of courts is advised. President Roosevelt has aroused a storm of protest and indignation on the Pacific coast by that part of his message dealing with the segregation of Japanese in the San Francisco schools, the claim being made that he has thereby lost California to the Republican party. The president says fair treatment is due the Japanese berause the Unit ed States must act uprightly toward all men; passage of a bill is asked providing for naturalization of Jap anese who intend to live in America; Congress is urge'd to amend the stat utes so as to empower the United States to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. He says corporations should be prohibited from making political con tributions; that the best way to avert undesirable move for govern ment ownership of railways is to place their control and regulation in the hands of the government; rail way agreements favored if the agree ments be approved by the interstate commission. He says it is wrong to prohibit in junctions in all labor cases, but abuses should be corrected; eight hour day favored; need for interven tion in strikes; drastic child-labor law suggested for District of Colum bia and territories. Referring to marriage and divorce he says congress should be. given the power to regulate, and thus wipe out scandals and abuses; urgent seed exists to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy. The tariff is not referred to in the message. SHver Wedding Anniversary. Mr. .and Mrs. John H. Baxter of Mishawaka, celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at their home last Thursday by entertaining a num ber of relatives at dinner. Guests were present from Plymouth, Elk hart and South bend. Rev W. L. Steckel of the English Lutheran church, was present and made an ap propriate address. A choice menu was served and the day was enjoy ed by all present. John H. Baxter and Miss Carrie A Miller, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Miller, were united in marriage at the home of the bride's parents in Plymouth, Ind., Nov. 24, 1881, by Rev. J. J. Faude, The minister who spoke the words that made them hus band and wife, and the father of the happy bride have died since that day, but the bride's mother and Mr. and Mrs. George W. Baxter parents of the groom of 25 years ago still re side in Plymouth and were present at this beautiful Thanksgiving anniver sary. Habitual Drunkard Law. William Fruechtenecht, Democrat ic member-elect of the lower House from Allen county, is preparing a bill for the incarceration of inebriates un der a law similar to that now on the Iowa statute books. He thinks the state should step in and assume the custody of habitual drunkards. The methodi provided) .wJll,.. be much the same as in insanity" cases,jjand . wil) require proof to show 'the 'habits of the accused. If found addicted to the drink habit to a certain extent, the commission will have power to com mit the man to some' place of deten tion. He may seek and obtain a pa role after thirty days, but only on condition that he abstain from liquor. An infraction of the parole will re turn the victim of drink to the insti tution without necessity for new trial. St. Louis a Republican City. St. Louis Republicans flount their starry flag at Democratic Boston and chuckle at their substantial Republi can victory this month. In 1860 St. Louis was a slave city. It gave but a few scattered Republican rotes. This month the Republicans cast 7, 200 majority and elected three Re publican congressmen S.t. Louis at five presidential contests has given Republican majorities. Boston at the last election gave the Democratic candidate for governor Moran, 13, 000 majority. The cause of Boston being so strongly Democratic is the large for eign vote. Outside of Boston, how ever, the Old Bay State Is over whelmingly Republican, giving the state to the G. O. P.'s by a large ma jority. Death of Mrs. Riley. Mrs. Hannah Riley, who has been a resident of this vicinity fifty years, died at her home in this city Tues day night, after an illness of more than ten years.

" Way to True Success.; The one hope for success; for our people, lies in a resolute and JearleJ but sane and cool-headed, Advance along the path marekd out last-year by this, very Congress.

President's Message. ' Taxing the Rich. The president distinctly favors a graduated inheritance tax, and, if a way can be found to obviate the cor stitutional objection, an income tax also. Such a tax has been jmposed by the federal government on three occasions rin 1797, in 1SC2, and In 1898. Its equity can not be question ed. 'To whom much has be,en given, of; him much shall be required," has high authority. 1 - The Taking Cold Habit The old cold goes ; a new one quickly comes.
