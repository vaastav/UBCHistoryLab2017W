Tin: N.XVV The report of the secretary of the navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service. During the last fiscal year extensive repairs have been made upon ves sels, and two new ships have been completed ami made ready for sea.

The up. propria! ions available for the present fiscal year are $ I t,5l)-J,2.iO.i7, which wili, in the opinion of the secretary, answer all the or dinary demands of the service.

The report of the secretary show the gratifying tact that among all the disbursing ollicers of the pay corps of the navy there is nut one who is a delimiter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the ob lervatory to a more healthful location. That institution reflects credit upon the nation and has obtained the approbation of scientific nu n in all parts ot the world. Its removal from its present location would not only lie conducive to the health of its ollicers ami pro. tensors but would greatly increase its useful ness. Dl'.l'AHTMLYI' OK .ll'STtCK. The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore be"ii made for the de. partment of justice in gross, was sub-divided at the last session of congress and no appro priation whatever was made for the payment of the fees of marshal's mid their deputies, either in the service of process or for I herds, charge of other duties, and since June III) these ollicers have continued the performance of liheir duties without compensation from the government, baking upon them selves the necessary incidental outlays as well as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution ol process of the I'nited Stales Tailed by reason of the absence of the reipiis. ite appropriation. This course of ollicial conduct, on the part of these ollicers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the attorney general, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the pros, pect of future legislation by congress. I therefore especially recommend thai an im mediate appropriation be made by congress for tins purpose. The act making the prin cipal appropriations for the department if justice at previous sessions lias uniformly contained the following clause, "and for de fraying the expenses which may be incurred m the enforcement of the act approved Feb. 28, 170, entitled, "an act to amend an act approved May ;(), ly70, er.titled, "an net to enforce the right of citizens in the I'nited States to vote in the several states of the I'nit ed States, and for other purpose, or any acts amendatory thereot or supplementary iherc. to." No appropriation was made for this purpo-e for the current year. As no general election fir members of congress occurred, the omi-simi was a matter of little practical imponsnee. Such election will, however, taiie p!;ice during the ensuing year and the aj.propriiti'in for the pay of marshals and pu'.:'-s should be Mifiicicnt to embrace com-:j- t .on for the wrvices they may be re- 1 t rrfonn at such elections. " THE MI'KKMfc COlllT. TLr bMsine-s of the t-upremo court is at r,re.;nt brg-Iy in arrears. It cannot be ex p'twt that more cases can be decided than are now di.ip-M-,! of m its annual session, or that by any aviiduity the distinguished mag istrate who compose the court can iiccoiii plili more than ia now done in the courts of many of the circuit. The tmsinesa has in f rea.scd to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all in done in each circuit which can fuirlv be exited, and the evil arising from de lay are less lnwmlr felt by the United Males titan by private suitor as its causes are ad vanced by the court, when it is seen that the involve the discussion of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the attorney general is the appointment of additional circuit Judges aud the creation of an intermediate court of errors and up. peals, wUicfi shall relieve the supreme court of a part of iu Jurisdiction, while a larger force t-, also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. 1 recommend this suggestion to the consideration of congress. It would seem Ui afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure at the present rate of salaries of not more than 0U,0uo a year which would certainly be atnall In coinparb son with the object to be attained. TH FOBTOKnCE. Tke report of the postmaster general bear testimony to the general revival or business throughout the country. The receipt of the postoffice department for the fiscal year end m? June 30, 187, were $30,0412e, being $764,465.91 more than the revenue of the preceding year. The amount realized from the "ale of pottage taapa, itamped envel ope and postal card wa $764,465.01 more tbaa in (he preceduigjrear, and 12879 J23 department were $:s;i,4 M,S!'!).4, of which the sum of jf:i7tl,4;i.(i:S was paid on liabilities in curred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were .f soi.'O!) 77 less Hum in the preceding year. This reduction is to lie attributed mainly to the operation of the law passed on June 17, 

ISIS, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commis sion on the value of stamps sold to u com mission on tin value of stampsc anceled. The amount drawn from the treasury on appro priations, in addition to the revenues of the department, was $:i.i)::i,4"il.!)ii, being $'-V-7ii,-l!7.Ni less th in in the preceding year. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending .June ;!, 1 -S 1 . are estimated at if fl'.i.WO.HOO. and the receipts from all sources at if.li.'JlO.ouii, leav. inga deficiency to be appropriated for out of the treasury of .7,710,!M)0. The relations of the department with railroad companies have been iiaruioui.eil, notw ithstanding the gen. era! reduction by congress, of their conipeii- cation by the appropriation lor general fa cilities, arid the railway poslolllce lines have been greatly extended, especially in the southern states. The interestsof the railway mail si r. ice woiihl be greatly promoted aud the expenditures could he readily controlled by the classification of the employes of the railway mail service, us recommended by tin postmaster general, the appropriations for service with respect to which the maximum limit is already llxel by law to be made in gross. The postmaster general recommends an ameielmeut to thu law regulating an in crease of compensation for increased service and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise tor proposals for such increased service mid speed. Hi: also sug gests llie advantages to accrue to the com merce ol the country trom tne enactment ol a generl law authorizing contracts with American built steamers carrying the Ameri can flag for transporting the mail between the I'nited States anil parts of the West In dies and South America at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations in like manner with the amount for the domes tic star service. The arrangements made by the postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury lor the collection or duties upon books received in the mail from foreign coun tries has proved so satisfactory in its practi cal operation that the recommendation is now irade that congress extend the pro. visions of the act of March J!, 1S71I, under which this arrangement was made so as to apply to all other dutiable articles leceived in the mails from foreign cnuntries.

INDIANS. The reports of the secretary-of the interior and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, setting forth the present state of our rela tions with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civiliza tion and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian population tias been so satis factory that the occurrence of two disturb ances which resulted in bloodshed and dis traction of property is all the more to be la mented. The history of the outbreak on the White river I'te reservation m western ddorado h is become so familiar by elabor ate reports in thu public press that its re markable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lend to such arrange ments as will prevent further hostile contests between the Indians and the border settle ments in western Colorado. The other dis turbances occurred at the Mescalero agency in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small baud id' marauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border and lsnmv on nforeiirn soil. While these occurrences, in which a com paratively small number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majori ty of our Indian population have fully justi fied the c.vpections of those who believe that by humane and peaceful inlhiences, the In dian can he led to abandon toe habits of sav age life, and to develop a capacity for useful aud civili.ed occupations. What they have already accomplished is shown in the pur suit of agriculture and mechanical work. The remarkable success which has attended the experiment of employing as freighters a class of Indians hithertu counted among the wildest, and most intractable, and the gener al and urgent desire expressed by them for the education of their children may be taken as sufficient proof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue to lie wisely and fairly guided. The Indian policy sketched in the report of the secretary of the interior, the object of w hich is to make liberal provision for the educa tion of Indian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them ti tle in fee in their farms inalienable for a cer tain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their reset vat ion not occupied and used by them, a fund to be tunned out of the proceeds for the Indians, which will gradually relieve the government of the ex penses now provided lor by annual appropri ations, must commend itself ws just and ben eficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions w hich the ex istence of large reservations presents to l lie settlement ami the development of the coun try. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indians a title in fee inalienable for twenty-live years to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the re commendation in my first annual message that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having, by their own labor, supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision of inalienability for a certain pe nisl. The experiment of sending a number of Indian children of both sexes to the Hamp ton Normal and Agricultural Institue in Vir ginia, to receive elementary Knglish educa tion and practical instruction iu farming and other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks of Carlisle, in l'ennsylvania, to the interior department for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This school bos now one hundred and titty-eight pupils, selected from various tribes, mid is iu full operation. Ar rangements are also made for the education of ii uumlHTof Indian boys and girls belong ing to tribes on the I'aeilic slope, in a simi lar manner, at Forest drove, iu Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to tfie lilierality of congress and to the phi lanlhropic munificence of the American peo ple. hast spring information was received of the organization of an extensive movement in the western states, the object of which was the occupation by unauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian territory ced ed by the Chcrokees to the government for the purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the 'Jllth of April 1 issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation in such an attempt, and by the cooperation of a military torce the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the right of the Indian inhabitants ot that territory to the full extent of the ex ecutive; hut it would be unwise toMgnore the fact that a territory so large aud so fer tile, with a population so sparse, and to great a wealth of unused resources, wiil be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year when the aur and the westward movement of our popula tion looks still more cacerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances, the dilllcully of maintaining the Indian Terrlto. ry in its present slate will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting il would do well to prepare for such a contigency. 1 therefore approve of th advice given to them by the secretary of the interior on a re cent occasion to divide among thcm-elves, In severally, as large; a ipiantity of tneir lands as ! 1 1 y can cultivate, to aeipiire indi vidtlal title in fee, instead of their pre.-enl tribal ownership iu common, and consider iu what manner the balance of their lands may be disp"sed of by the government for their benefit. Uy adopting Mich a policy they would more certainly secure for them selves the value of their pos-'esnions, and a' the same time promote their progress u civ llization and prosperity than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of timers in the territory. The question whether a change in tic- con. trol of the Indian service should l.e made, was, iu the forty-fifth congress, referred to a joint committee of both houses for iniUirv ami report. In my last annual inwssaue I expressed the hope that the decision of that question, then in prospect, would arrest fur ther agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce ndisturbing i licet upon the service as well as the Indians themselves. Since then, the committee having reported the question has been decided ill the nega tive by a vote in the Iiomsu of representatives. For the reason here stated, and iu view of the fact that further uncertainly on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service and to unsettle salutary ineas. ures now in progress for the government and llie improvement of the Indians, I re spectfully mainlined that thu decision ar rived ut by congress at its last session be permitted to stand. 

TIMI1KK TIIKKTS. The ell'orts made by the depaitinent of the inferior to arrest the depredations on the timber lands of the United Stales have been continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of cases of tres pass have been prosecuted in the courts ot the I'niteu Slates. Others have been settled, the trespassers olfering to make payment to the government for the value of Hie timber taken by them. The proceeds of these pros ecuions and the settlements turned into the treasury far exceed in amount the sums ap propriated by congress for this purpose. A more important result, however, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests by depredatson, although mch cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in ex tent, and it is probable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued, and sullicient provision to that end made by congress, such trespasses at least those on a large scale can be entirely suppressed, except in territories where timber for thedaily require ments of llie population cannot, under the present state of the law, be otherwise ob tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten tion of congress to the recommedation made by the secretary of the interior, that a law he enacted enabling the government to sell timber from the public lands without con veying the fee where such lands are princi pally valuable for the? timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to cnulorm to do mestic wants and business requirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment of a law appears to become a more pressing necessity every day, THK AliUtcri.Tl'llAI. Itl llKAtr. My recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facili ties of the depaitinent of agriculture. Agri culture is the leading interest and permanent industry of our people. It is to the abun dance of agricultural product ons, as com pared with our home consumption and the largely-increased and highly-profitable mar ket abroad which we have enjoyed in re cent years, that we are maiuly indebted for our present prosperity as it people. We must look to its continued maintenance for substantial resource. 1 here is no branch of industry in winch labor, di reeled by scien tific know ledge, yields such increased pro duction in comparison w ith unskilled labor, and no branch ol the public service to which the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriatly extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy, but on llie contrary undoubtedly results iu losses of immense sums annually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the government to promote this vital interest. The results already accom plished, with the very limited means hereto fore placed at the command of the depart ment of agriculture, is an earnest of what may be expected with increased npproprio tions for the several purposes indicated in the report of the commissioner, with a view to placing the department upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more ef fectively the objects for which it is estab lished. Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the establish ment of u veterinary division and a division of lorestry and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other pur poses indicated in the report of the commis sioner, under the head of "Immediate Neces sities of the Department," will not involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture. i:i)iv.vntNAi.. It is gratifying to learn from the bureau of education llie extent to w hich educational privileges Ihroiighocl the United States have been advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education, sup plemental to local action In the slates and territories, and iu the District of Columbia. The w ise forethought of the loiinders of our government has not only furnished llie basis for the support ot the common-school sys tems of ihc newer stales, but laid founda tions fort lie maintenance of their universi ties, of colleges of agriculture and mechanic uit. Measures in accordance with this tia ditioual policy for the benefit of all these interests and the extension uf some advanta ges to every portion of llie country, il is hoped will "mi et your favorable considera tion.
