ploy the slime u > thods We trust tluit I in the future that these bankers mer chants and othfr who prate so glibely t about the intoleiinco and bigotry the Mormons in tl yr 4empt to boycott all I Aiio arc not of their particular faith will remember to take the beam out of their own eyes before they undertake to remove the mote from the eyes of the Mormons On the subject of boycotting iwe recommend them to attentively study the following words from an editorial of the Tribunc in reply to a question by a correspondent of that paper as to what was its opinion on boycotting Itis gen r erally a most cowardly l proceeding jt is generally subversive of the liberties of the country it generally seeks to take am tm the citizen the right to choose for S V < < 4 elf what is best for his own good I DECIDED I The longexpected decision in the case of Angus M Cannon vs United States I has been rendered The decision sustains the local courts in their construction of the cohabitation clause of the Edmunds law This has been a vexed question and many hopes have been built upon it these hopes are now as house built upon the sands and have been washed away This of course settles all question as to the validity of the cohabitation clause as I it has been construed here and makes the cases for unlawful cohabitation much easier to prosecute The plan which will be adopted by those liable to be prosecuted will probably be to make no acknowledgments whatever as to their polygamous families and to be so secretive in their attentions to those families that it will be next to impossible to obtain evidence to convict under the law as now construed This decision will be a complete refuta tion of the charges of Delegate Caine against Jtfdge Zane for his interpretation of this clause Delegate Caine in his letter to the President said that it mattered not that in the entire history of civil and criminal judicature no English or American court had ever held that cohabitation meant other than sexual intercourse and here the Supreme Court of the United States has done the same thing I The letter of IMr Caine contains a I number of assertions to which we cannot subscribe and whatever may have been the representations of Governor Murray and Marshal Ireland they could not have been much more incorrect than the repre sentations of Delegate Caine Mr Caine I says that the Mormoas understand per fectly that every effort has been and is being made by characterless Federal of ficials to provoke an outbreak We doubtthis just as much as we doubt the rumors that the Mormons sent armed posses into this city on the Sun day night succeeding the McMurrin Collin shooting scrape We think that some of the Federal officials here are very anxious to retain their places and would be willing to do almost anything to aid them in keeping them but we dont believe they would incite a rebellion even for that purpose Mr Caine tells the President that he has been imposed upon by the Governor and Marshal It may be so but if he accepts Mr Caines statements absolutely the imposition is increased We should dis like very much to say of Mr Caines representations as he said oftbose of the Governor and Marshal that these rep resentations are maliciously false but the justification for such an assertion is as good in the one case as in the other THE 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE As there has been considerable com ment upon and controversy over the DEMOCRATS leader on the Presidents message at the request of a number of friends we reprint it The Presidents message is at last before the people It is somewhat lengthy a thing necessary in such documents The docu ment is straightforward and statesmanlike and treats nil subjects touched upon in a most comprehensive manner Americans in the peace and security of their prosperous and happy homes are apt at times to think that our country is isolated and far removed from the world The reading of a Presiden tial message dispels all such ideas for then we see that we are intimately connected with the nations of the earth From the strifes and ambitions of the nations of the earth we are happily isolated and no greater blessing can ever be vouchsafed the United States than a continuation of such isolation President Cleveland has sought to impress upon Congress and the country the wisdom continuing that policy which will save us from entangling alliances To do this it is not necessary that the Monroe doctrine be abandoned or that it be so distorted as to put uponthe United States the burden of guaranteeing the obligations of every na ture of distant and revolutionary countries The discussions over the Isthmus lines of transit during the past year have given rise to many false theories regarding the rights and duties of the American Gov ernment The President has given no encouragement to any such false notions but he calls the people back to the true and salutary doctrine of Monroe when he says Our duty in the present instructs us to address ourselves mainly to the development of the vast resources of the great area com mitted to our charge and to the cultivation of the arts of peace within our borders though jealously alert in preventing the American hemisphere from being involved in the political problems and complications of distant governments If a transIsth mian canal or ship railway is to be con structed it should be for the benefit of the world and far removed from the chance of dominion by any one single Power The message shows that the relations of the Government to foreign Powers are emi nently satisfactory This is so common a thing with the United States that the people fail to realize its full significance Even with China the relations c t 

TAIU vuiuu uuo jciubiuiia of the Government are most cordial although the treatment which the of that subjects country have re ceived here during the past few months has been such that it might very easily have brought about a rupture between the Gov ernment of Pelan and the Government of Washington For this cordial relationship as much credit is due China as the United States The reference to the Kiely affair is dignified and such as to receive the appro bation of all Among other matters we may mention is that part of the message which refers to the naturalization laws laws of which advan tage has too often been taken for unworthy purposes and without any intention on the part of those who take advantage of them of becoming bonafidc citizens It is this that has brought about the trouble in Germany over naturalized Americans of German birth 1 The naturalization laws need amendment in various ways as pointed out by the Presi dent The matter of extradition is also an important one and one to which attention should be given immediately The facility with which embezzlers and defaulters escape punishment by a trip to Canada is a dis grace to our diplomacy In antebellum days in the days when the country was a seething cauldron on account of the slavery question Canada was a haven of rest for the colored refugee and an asylum for the oppressed Today she is a place of safety for the unworthy and the criminal Extra dition treaties should remedy this state of affairs The recommendations in regard to the consular service are wise and timely and the recommendations in regard thereto should receive the favorable consideration of Congress One recommendation in par ticular is right and timely We refer to the recommendation that the duty on the paint ings of foreign artists be removed The policy of discontinuing the appointment of civilians to lieutenancies in the army is wise and proper His discussion of the sil ver question is both thorough and from the right standpoint and the conclusion he reaches in regard to a discontinuance of an enforced coinage of silver correct as we look at the matter It is a knotty question and one that requires more exact knowledge and a fuller appreciation of the laws of trade and commerce than almost any other ques tion The question very nearly approaches true science and to decide one way or the other requires the most exact analogical reasoning It is the foremost question of peace in all commercial countries All subjects touched upon are ably treated m l c < J < A M P < i 0 it c c < and show a breadth of view on the part of I i the President that gives great hope for the future prosperity and welfare of the corn try and shows that the country has not misplaced its confidence It shows the President to be the true successor of the great men among his predecessors All who have filled the place he now occupies have not been great men He is but beginning his career in a field where greatness can find its fullest play and if the closeof that ca reer shall be as auspicious and happy as its beginning then it will be one of which the American people may well feel proud and will place Mr Cleveland in the front rank of statesmen IN THE 

DISTRICT COURT The motion of ProsecutingAttorney Vrian in the case of S H Lewis and the ruling of the Court thereon created a genuine sensation yesterday We do not propose to discuss the law of the case nor to say whether it was right or wrong but to make some general comments This case was brought in the Justice of the Peaces court and the defendant was found guilty as charged in the complaint He appealed to the District Court and there his case was dismissed without prejudice The statement of the Prosecut ingAttorney showed that houses of ill fame had been established in this city for the express purpose of entrapping men into them The scheme seems to have been very successful according to all the rumors When men had been entrapped into these places they were then spied upon by men there for that purpose The men who resorted to these houses went there for the purpose of vio lating a law and while they were en trapped they were not entrapped as inno cents The men if they be men who performed the part of spiesdebased them selves more than those who went there and wete spied upon The man who could perform the part of the spy in these cases must have been actuated by mo tives of revenge and his nature is of that kind which delights in low and loathsome things and he is entitled to the contempt of all decent men The baseness of the spies does not palliate the guilt of the spied The case of the spies and the treatment which they should receive is well illustrated by the story of the gun ner in 93 He had allowed a cannon to get loose in the ship in the midst of a storm and the havoc which wrought can only be told in the language of Victor Hugo Byjmperhuman efforts the gun ner got control of the cannon and made it fast A subaltern stepped up to the commander and drew his attention to the heroic manner in which the man had fi nally conqueredthe cannon and suggested that such conduct merited the bestowal of the Cross of the Legion of Honor The suggestion was acted upon and the gunner was given the cross for his heroic conduct in getting control of the cannon after he bad let it get loose but after his decoration he was ordered out and shot for letting it get loose The evidence of the spies should be received and then they should bepunished for conspiracy The establishment of these houses was clearly for the purpose of getting men to violate the law that they might be pun ished and the sudden flush of virtue which the city and county authorities have had is altogether too spasmodic to be healthy Houses of illfame are notor ious in this city and the city authorities have rather encouraged than discouraged them while the county authorities have completely ignored them But this is not all The District Court and the Pros ecutingAttorney have ignored them as well and the instructions of the Court yesterday to the Grand Jury is about as spasmodic as the efforts of the city to suppress sexual vice in the last three weeks Yesterday we believe was the first time that the District Court has ever adverted to the matter and we have never heard of the ProsecutingAttorney bringing acase under Section 1996 of the Compiled Laws to the notice of the Grand Jury This is the thing of which we comptain and not of the instructions of the Court to the Grand Tury in the Lewis case Why this has been we are unable to say but it has been and the laches of the Federal authorities have been as great as those of the municipal authorities with this exception that the latter have used houses of illfame as a source of revenue All laws should be enforced and the shortcomings of one court cannot justify the shortcomings of another It is to be hoped that in future there will be a more rigid enforcement of the laws by both Federal and local authorities and above all it is desirable that no such places as those referred to by Mr Varian shall ever be opened again in this city for their purpose is a travesty upon law and justice and an outrage upon humanity I TIlE RICHEST HIINE IN MONTANA Over Nine Millions of Dollars in Sijrlit Four Men Take Out S 1OOOOO in a month Probably the richest mine in Montana everything considered is the celebrated i Granite
