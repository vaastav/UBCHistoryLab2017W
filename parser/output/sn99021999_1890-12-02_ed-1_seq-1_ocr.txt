[ Now York Herald Cablo-Speclul to TIIK Huc. | While all the London papers weni announcing Parnell's arrival at Dublin , rn his way to Cork , ho was quietly break fasting at the Westminster Palace hotel , his Sunday h.ivlnjj been spent in the way 1 told you yesterday. Ho docs not intend to trlvo up anything , and therefore Is not afraid to visit the lady who has brought all these woes upon the Irish party. Fully twenty minutes before the hour appointed for the meeting today ho was In the library here , cool and resolute nnd ready for the fray. Ho had a long day's ' work before him , as ho probably knew , for the programme to bo followed was thatslcetcbodlnmy Sunday's dispatch. Tlmo was to bo gained by moving adjournment of the meeting as often as mlgiit bo necessary , but I can inform you on the host authority that Parucll never had a moment's doubt of the final result. Ho was well aware that nil those who have long been ambitious to trip him up all whom ho "uas offended , blighted and neglected in ether words , at least two-thirds of his party , meant to got him down now and make nn end of him , but ho was confident that this would bo the beginning , not the end , of the struggle. Iloom 15 , overlooking the Thames , was the plnco assigned by the sergeant- at-arms for the gathering , Parnell walked in with his usual nonchalcnt manner , nnd cast ono rapid , keen , healthy glanca around. Thcro they wcro , the men whom bo hud made or who had protested undying friendship , now ready to put an cnil to his political life. Ills faithful band , headed by Diclc Power nnd John Itedmond , kept near him. Somebody proposed that tlio meeting should begin by reading the telegrams from American delegates and other sources , but they were not nil against Parnell. As tlio day wore on Ireland began to knock at the door of Koom 13 , and her voice moro than once crlod outDo no harm to the man. " It > vas In the afternoon that a message from the Dublin corporation was re ceived sustaining Parnell , A flush passed over the sallow countenance of the Irish loader as he read It , but ho said not a word. His supporters shouted till they were hoarse. The meeting was thoroughly Irish from first. to last. Ttio warmth , eloquence and excite ment , the wild outbursts of feeling some times elicited cheers tlmf could bo heard across the river. Wo heard them below In. the libraries nnd oven the houso. The Irish party alone could have kept things going at this high state of tension hour after hour. Some times ono or the other slipped out for a little refreshment. At 0 o'clock thcro was a general adjournment for an hour. "I"spoko to ono of 1'arnoll's closest friends , who was looking worn and sad. "How are matters goingl" I asked. "As I told you they would , " he replied. "Ther.o is no change ; they have all como herewith with their minds made up. The speeches change no votes. It is Just the same as it is down hero. They are all tired out. Ho ( Par- ncll ) has been badgered and hunted a good deal , but ho hears it well. " In fact , 1 sow the leader himself shortly af terwards and ho looked as if be bad Just strolled in carelessly from the street. Ho secured - cured a victory after lunch by ordering the admission of the Freeman's Journal to report the proceedings. This gave great nunoy- anco to the opposition , who wcro anxious to keep the proceedings secret. They nro by no means confident of securing the approval of. the Irish people by some of their attacks on their leader. At ono tlmo in the early part of the day a largo body of reporters had gath ered outside the room , endeavoring to pick up a few words hero and there. Parnell heard of it and sent a message down to the sergeant-nt-arms , who immediately gave orders to hnvo the corridor cleared. There nro shoals of reporters at every approach to the fateful chamber. The business of the house , though important , is almost neglected. Such excitement has not been seen since the rejection of the1 homo rule bill in 1880. Healy opened the engagement with n power ful address , declaring against Parnell for taking a course destructive to Ireland's hopes. Sexton thrilled the meeting with n similar har angue , in which ho did lull justice to Par nell's ' services , hut dwelt with omphnsis upon the immediate shipwreck of the homo home rule cause which would bo the consequence quence of keeping him as leader. Sexton de nounced the breach of faith shown In Par nell's manifesto. Ho declared that If It went unrebuked , no English statesman or party would ever again put faith in Irishmen. "And a good thing , too , " some ono shouted , but Sexton concluded bis speech under a tremendous outburst of cheers , Dlood was up nil round. John Hcdmond answered Sexton. He reminded the meeting what the Irish representative In parliament was llko before Parnell's magic wand trans ferred him , recalled the way in which ono and another had been called from obscurity to places in the commons , and declared that to depose Parnoll was to shut out nil hope of the Irish in parliament. This pro voked cries of "NoI Not" so vehem ent and angry that it astonished some of Parnoll's friends who did not know how deeply the passion of hate had secretly caton Into the hearts of some who had apparently been Parnell's most docllo followers. The leader hlmeelf burst Into phlllplo against Suxton. Ha reproached him with his treachery. "Wo have been your follow ers , " Sexton replied ; "wo wcro not your slaves. " The rebels demanded a vote and the Parnclllts kept moving adjournments , Once the motion was that the adjournment should bo to Dublin. Kach motion was debatable at any length un less the chairman hud chosen to shut off dis cussion and permit n vote to bo t'nkon. The chairman , being Pnrncll himself , naturally nl- Idwcd the proceedings to take their course. Sometimes u telegram was brought In against him und sometimes It was Jayorablo. The walls shook with the tumult which each mes sage excited. Parnell holds that Gladstone's attack upon /him in the letter to Morley released him from all obligations of secrecy ns to anything thai had taken place between them. "Ho came out suddenly to destroy mo , " ho said this evening to a friend , "and I had the right to use every weapon I could find to defend myself , and I hnvo not yet told the worst. "Ho has dotted Oladstono to challenge the truth of his vcrnlou of the now bill , and says that ho will produce a memor anda made at the time , Gladstone declines to acknowledge any /under / coinmunlcntlon from him. At 11:30 : another moUoti for adjournment was pressed. This tlnp It was till 1'J o'clock tomorrow. This , after , some demur from malcontents , wns carried , I nm nssurod the final vote will tlicn be tnkun and that It will result In the defeat of Pnrnell by a consider able majority. Aftcr'that the battle-ground will bo transferred to Ireland and the United States. Pnrnell will" " mount guard In . the house ' with about twcnty-llvo men prepared [ to tuko any stop ? necessary to sicuro his ascendency. In tlfo opinion of some of the oldest members of the house nn opinion ahartUI have reason to t bcllovo , by Calfour ho will yet trample down nil opposition and disperse his foes in nil directions , , 'It Is a serious loss to the rebels that they can iiot hnvo Dillon nnd O'Brien among thorn for at least six months after their return , owjijg to their sentence of Imprisonment.

Let Gladstone , Hurcourt and Morley give him letters declaring that in the event of the return of liberals to power the homo rule bill to bo proposetl by which the control of the constabulary bo vested in the Irish executive who will bo responsible to an Irish parliament empowered to settle the land question.

If Hnrcourt over conies into power hovill give you local government with plenty of coercion , I know full well what Gladstone nnd Morley will do. If I nm to leave you tonight I should llko to leave you In security. It Is not an unfair thing for mo to ask to sco vou within sight of the promised land or that I should como with you , having como so far , until you are absolutely sure of Ireland and I can go no further. Enthusiastic applause followed Parnell's remarks. McCarthy followed. He told how ho went to Gladstone Saturday und that Gladstone told him how Jio regretted the demoralisation of the Irish party , but could not regard him as representing the Irish party. Ho would offer no suggestion , nor would ho sign any document or give any message to bo conveyed to the party. Ho informed McCarthy bo could not give any document with nny cer tainty that It might not bo printi.-d by some of those concerned.
