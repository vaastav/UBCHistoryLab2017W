VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN STARTED James L. Cowles Says if Pres ent Congress Takes No Ac tion a Special Session Will Be Asked for. Amrlran Newt Srvu) Wmthlncton, Dec. 19. A parcels pout w III be one of the most Important mbjects that the present congress will have to deal with, and the champions of this movement feel confident that home definite steps will be taken to ward the establishment of this system before congress adjourns next March. The, fact that both President Taft. in his annual message, and Postmaster General Hitchcock In his annual report have recommended the. rural parcels post, has greatly strengthened their hopes, and they believe that If once a system Is established for the rural districts, it will only be a short time before It in made general. James Ia Cowles, founder and secre tary of the Postal 1'rocress league. says that a vigorous campaign will bo made this year tn Washington tobrlnrf about the enactment of Borne parcels poet legislation. Ask Special Session. "Should we fall." he continued, "we shall urge the President to call a spe cial session of the 62nd congress to take up this matter. "Every effort Is being made by the members of our league throughout tho country to bring about the election of senators pledged to a parcels post system. We feel confident that a ma jority of the House members are in favor of such legislation, and now is our time to make sure of the senate. "A mass meeting la to be he'.d in Cooper Union, New York, on Decem ber 29. whfftr-irtir twwMmwed by a number of prominent business men. and this will be followed by our annual convention In February. "At present there are. two bills be fore congress providing for a parcels post system the Bennett bill and the Hulzer bill. Our league favors the Sul y.er bill because it specifies the limit on packages. If this bl'.l Is made a law It will save the people of the country 160.000.000 a year that they are now paying to the express com panles In excessive rates, and convert the annual deficit of the Postoffice De partment Into a handsome profit." Although the sentiment in the House seems generally favorablo to the par cel post, there is a strong factor op posed to it. This is the House Com mittee on Postofflces and Post-roads Representative Weeks, of Massachu setts, the chairman of this body, has expressed himself very forcibly as on- itoaed to any legislation of this kind. and he apparently has the support of the majority of the committee. With the end of the present session, how ever, ten of these lose their seats In the House, and there will be a new committee with a new chairman, when the 62nd congress opens. The arguments for and against a parcels post are many, and have been reiterated time and again, and it Is safe to say that they will be present ed in amplified form at this session. Rep. Suiter's Bill. Representative Sulzer's bill Is as fol lows: Be It enacted, etc, That the common weight limit of the domestic postal service of the United States is here by Increased to 11 pounds, the com mon limit of the Universal Postal Union, and that In the general bus! ness of the postoffice the 1-cent an ounce rate on general merchandis fourth class mail matter be, and 19 hereby reduced to the third class rate. 1 cent for each 2 ounces or fraction thereof.

SEVERAL CLAIMS , FOR REPARATION Interstate Commissioner Is in Chicago to Conduct a Hearing. (American News Service) Chicago, 111., Dec. 19. Interstate Commerce Commissioner Edgar E. Clark arrived in Chicago today to con duct a hearing in the so-called Burn- bam-lianna-Munger case. This is also known as the Missouri river rate case and after it was begun the Interstate Commerce commission in accordance with evidence that had been introduc ed, reduced freight rates from the At lantic seaboard to the Missouri river. Litigation ensued, and the reduction in rates was suspended until Novem ber 10 last. Tho Interstate Commerce commis than $100,000 already have been fled with the commission under its decis ion reducing rates. A typical case is that of the William Warnock company of Sioux City, la., against the Chica go & Northwestern railway company. Reparation is demanded on all ship ments of class freights from the east to Sioux City during the period of the commission's original order. The re duction, which was sustained by the United States supreme court, amount ed to nine cents a hundred pounds on first class freight, the reductions on classes being from a sixty-cent scale to a fifty-one cent scale. The linterstate Commerce commis sion has received to date nearly 800 claims in reparation. About 450 of them apply to shipments originating in Atlantic seaboard and Eastern trunk line territories, about 200 to shipments originating at various points east of the Mississippi river and, north of the Ohio, and the remain der are shipments originating in the Central Freight association and South eastern territories. In addition to the claims already on file, other claims will be presented and the likelihood is that eventually the aggregate will be in the neighborhood of a million dol lars. Final disposition of these claims probably will hinge upon the result of the Burnham-Hanna-Munger case, which is to be heard here this week by Commissioner Clark.

(American News Service) Washington, Dec. 19. Fight of the vindication of Senator Lorimer began to brew teday in the senate. Bever ldge and La Follette of Wisconsin are in the limelight to a considerable ex tent just now. Beveridge is on the senate committee of privileges and elections. The sub-committee which investigated the Lorimer case made its report to the main committee. So far the report is secret, though it is well known that it gives Lorimer a clean bill of health, and takes the po sition that not enough members of the legislature are shown to have been concerned in' the bribery to have changed the result of the election. More over it is not shown, the sub committee finds that Lorimer had any hand in the bribery. In some quar ters in the senate it is felt that the sub-committee has been unduly len ient and members of the main commit tee should make a most careful study of the testimony for themselves. Bev eridge is proceeding on the theory that nothing is to be taken for grant ed and that it is up to him to explore the testimony for himself. If there should be a minority report of the committee it is generally supposed Beveridge will make it. La Follette is not on the privileges and elections committee, and Is 'not taking part in the case. He cannot do so under the circumstances. But if the report made to (he senate is adverse to the major ity report there is not much doubt that La Follette would get into the game and go into an analysis of the case. More ways than one. La Fol lette has indicated his disgust at the "jackpotters" of the Illinois legislature and nobody doubts he will give ex pression to his sentiments about the whole proceeding that culminated in Lorimer's election, if there is an op portunity and seems to be warrant for it in the nature of anything that comes out of the committee. But no matter what report is made no ques tion is longer entertained that Lorim er will keep his seat. It is against precedent for the senate to expel any one.
