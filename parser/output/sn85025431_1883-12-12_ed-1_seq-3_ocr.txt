THE TRANSCRIPT OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY. Entered AS sucond-class matter at the post office at Austin, Minnesota. C. H. DAVIDSON, Editor and Proprietor. AUSTIN. WEDNESH.A V'.LDECEMBER 12,1883. WKL.COAIE. It is with feelings of hearty good will, and of genuine satisfaction, that we wel­ come to our city and homes the officers and delegates of the Minnesota gutter and Cheese Association, which convened in the court-house last evening. We have anticipated your coming as an auspicious event in the annals of our farming community. It has long been felt that a departure from the old methods and employments must be made before that degree of temporal prosperity which we have been toiling for so long can be secured. We are conscious that the fertile lands, so many thousands of acres of which are lying unimproved about us, need only the magic touch of the right kind of en­ terprise to make them immensely pro­ ductive. What has been done in other localities, can be affected in Mower and adjoining counties, now impoverished from partial failures in crops. We have anticipated that the advent of so large a number of skilled and experi­ enced dairymen, bringing to our farmers the results of their investigations and efforts, will stimulate them to persistent and enthusiastic endeavors to turn into golden profit the suggestions offered during the Convention. Not only do we welcome you as bene­ factors, the results of whose labors will be manifest in years to come in the in­ crease of our visible prosperity, but we esteem it a privilege to meet in conven­ tion so many of the sturdy yeomanry of our state, the men and the women upon whose broad shoulders and patient hearts are laid the foundations of the progress and wealth of our noble state. We are glad to join hands with you in promoting the development of the resources of this queen state of the north. But while we have been waiting for better davs we have not been idle, bat aggressive, as may be seen by the beautiful court-house, in which you have already held your first session, the finest in the state. We can also point with pride to our numerous new blocks, finished up in first class style, and occupied by live mer­ chants ready to welcome the first wave of decided improvement in our agricultural affairs. In communicating freely for our bene­ fit we trust you will find the sessions of the convention promotive of your own welfare, and return home at length, bet­ ter fitted for the succes ful prosecution of your industries, assured that you bear with you the best wishes of your Austin friends. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. In accordance with the time-honored custom, President Arthur presented his annual message at the opening of the winter session of Congress. It is a very conservative document, and contains but little more than a resume of the reports submitted to him by his cabinet. He speaks at some length upon our "Foreign Relations," which he sums up as in a "most favorable condition." We are at peace with all nations, and all those matters which concern our intercourse with them are adjusted readily and amic­ ably. The Treasury reports an income from all sources of $398,287,581, with an ex­ penditure of $265,308,137, leaving a sur plus of $132,-879,444. This surplus has been devoted to the reduction of the na tional debt. The President recommends the reduc­ tion of the revenue in order both to ligh­ ten the burden of taxation and prevent the disarrangement of finances by with­ drawing the bonds in which the National Banks give their security. The trade dollar he would have re­ tired, and redeemed at a small per centage. Until the revenues are reduced to equal only the necessary expenses of the gov­ ernment, he would have the surplus ap­ plied to protection of our sea-bo&Td by suitable fortifications, and the perfecting of our naval defence by the construction of powerful ships of war and submarine torpedoes. In the Post Office Department the con­ dition and outlook is most gratifying. The Postal Telegraph is not considered desirable. The message afirms that the laws against polygamy are not producing the desired effect, and recommends that Congress take the Government of Utah under its own control. Attention is called likewise to measures inaugurated to settle the question of Presidential succession, in case of the death or disability of the President, and recommends care in defining the exact nature of such a disability. He concludes with an appeal to Con­ gress to make some guarantee of equal rights to all citizens, in place of the civil rights bill lately declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. All in all, President Arthur's message is a plain, straight-forward document, in which he does not commit himself to any*question likely to agitate the peace and harmony of the administration party. 

INCREASE OF CRIME. That a high degree of civilization, where schools and churches abound, and Chris­ tian benevolence blossoms on every hand is not free from numerous scenes of dia­ bolical crime, is only too painfully mani­ fest in the criminal records of our coun­ try for the year. Never before in all the history of jour­ nalism have its columns been so crowded with the details of all that is fiendish and horrible, and with the often frantfc and ominous manner in which the public has sought to avenge itself, as of late. During the year 1882, the number of murders reported by telegraph was 1,266. Already the list for this year foots up 1,517. Another feature, suggestive and reproachful, is the fact that the larger proportions of punishment have come in the shape of public retribution, but of 211 who have paid the penalty of crimes, only 93 have been judicially executed. Here is important matter for reflection to both the philanthropist and law-maker. THE marriage of E. A. Hendrickson, a young lawyer of St. Paul, to Miss Annie L. Ward, of Waseca, last Thursday even­ ing, was "the greatest social event in the history of Waseca." Hon. W. G. Ward, the father ef the bride, made her a pres­ ent of $15,000 government, railroad and municipal bonds. Other presents were made of the cash value of about 95,000.

Recently theWorld published the names of two hundred millionaires living in New York city, and it appears from let­ ters sent to the editor of the World after­ wards that many were left out of the list. The city of Boston, according to the Globe, can show up over one hundred of these millionaires and you have no dif­ ficulty about hunting up many more of them, beside decuple millionaires, and quinquagintuple millionaires, in San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, Philadel­ phia, Cinncinnati and other places. Be­ sides our long string of millionaires, we have now here the centuple millionaire and the bi-centuple millionaire, and per­ haps there is truth in the remark made about the king of them all, that, "as soon as he got to be a millionaire, he was seized with a mad ambition to become a billion­ aire." If the 80 millions left by old Com­ modore Vanderbilt to his heirs 7 years ago have since then swelled to 200 millions in W. H. V.'s hands, it is easy to compute how many years it will take, at the past and present rate of increase, to raise his spoils to 1,000 millions,or,in other words, to make him a billionaire. To raise this pile, he does not need to live as long as his father lived. In a recent letter, "Gath"savs: "William's fortune is at least $200,000,000. He told some of his friends about four years ago that his in­ come was $10,000,000 a year. "He has never been beaten by any stock operator, and has made every one of them who tackled him squeal." William H. Vanderbilt, says the World, enjoys an income estimated at $15,000,000 a year. In April last, when he held $40, 200,000 in Government fours, his quarter­ ly check for interest upon them was $402,000 so that his annual interest upon that amount of Governments for the pres­ ent year is $1,608,000. The Woild says: "Nobody knows exactly how rich he is, because, unlike other kings, he does not allow his subjects to scrutinize his civil list. But he is a very rich and powerful king. His fortune is estimated at $200, 000,000. In the years when he only builds palaces and buys paintings and does not buy Nickel-Plate roads, his yearly civil list ranges from fourteen to twenty millions of dollars. He buys fifty mil­ lions of 4 per cents, at a single invest­ ment. He controls over six thousand miles of railroads. The area of his terri­ tory is very large. His subjects grumble a great deal under the burdens he lays upon them, but the only answer he makes to their remonstrances is, 'My subjects be damned.'" In the Saratoga interview of last Au­ gust Mr. Yanderbilt's legal adviser, Mr. Depew, said: "What is known as the Vanderbilt system when completed will be the greatest sytsem in the world, and will reach the most productive agricultu­ ral, manufacturing and commercial terri­ tory in this country. It now consists of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, 450 miles and four tracks Lake Shore, 550 miles, double track Canada Southern and Michigan Central 550 miles, double track Northwestern 4,500 miles Nickel Plato, 550 miles miles, or a full 6,000 miles of double quadruple track not to speak of thous­ ands of miles of side tracks, etc. In addition to his large interest in each one of these roads, Mr. Van­ derbilt has blocks of Rock Island and Burlington stock." It is said no fortune was ever accumu­ lated by any individual in England equal even to the present fortune of Mr. Van­ derbilt. 

OHIO AND ALL. The Oplnioo of an Old and Experienced Political Editor Backed up by the Pres­ ident, Cabinet and Governors. The B. & O. Red Book has become the standard text-book on elections, and each year grows in popular favor. That it is deserved is evinced by the unflagging en­ terprise manifestsd in its preparation and publication. The latest exhibition of a determination to meet even the most ex­ acting demand is the issuing of the Ohio election less than a month following the election in that State. Ordinarily those who are prone to studying the official figures of a political contest have to wait for months before receiving them in com­ prehensive form, and then do all the comparative figuring themselves. Here is the B. & O. Red Book for Ohio not on­ ly with the election results in every coun­ ty tabulated in the clearest manner, but comparison with past results all figured out and explanatory remarks which are of the greatest interest. As a specimen edition of the Red Book the contents are worthy of note. The Presidential vote by counties for 1876 and 1880, with ma­ jorities, losses and gains, total vote, etc., while the side-notes give a summary of all the Presidential elections in the United States since its admittance into the Union. The Congressional vote of 1878 and 1880, by counties and districts, with full details of the changes made by the new reappointment. The Gubernatorial vote of 1883 compared with that of Secetary of State 1882, majorities, gains, etc., and side-notes covering all possible data as regarding results. Comparative tables showing Democratic vote for Governor, for 1877 to 1883, showing gains and an in­ teresting study of the Democratic vote as compared with the vote for the prohibi­ tion amendment. A similar comparable table based upon the Republican vote for Governor for the same year and compari­ son of the vote for the prohibition amend­ ment with the Republican vote for Gov­ ernor, 1883. Another most interesting table is that devoted to a comparison of the vote of both parties and the total vote each year from 1880 to 1883, inclus­ ive this by counties and showing great care in computation. Full roster oi the United States Senate, Forty-Eighth Con Sepresentatives,roster ress, and full of the House of Forty-Eight Congress, arranged so that comparison can be made with the full roster of the Forty-Seventh Congress. List of Governors of States, expiration of term, date of next election in each State and of meeting of Legis­ lature. Certainly a very cleverly constructed book to contain all this, and it is by no means a large one either. Very handy as to size, beautifully printed upon fine Baper and a handsome cover, the .Red look, as characteristic of all the B. & O. publications, is exceedingly artistic and attractive. Of course it is an advertisement, else it would not be sent free upon application by letter or postal to C. K. Lord, Balti­ more, but so unobtrusive is the advertis­ ing matter and so valuable the mass of information the book* contains, that it would undoubtedly sell like hot cakes if put upon the market. However, there is no desire manifested to sell it all who wish, get the Red Book by return mail even with the postage paid upon it. The remarkably complete make up and per­ fectly unbiassed presentation of the result in Ohio may be taken as conclusive that the Red Book for the coming presidential year, will in its different editions, be' in great demand. It is understood that sev­ eral new features in connection with the information which will be so earnestly sought after next year, are already in course of preparation, and those who are down on the mailing lists of the B. & O. will certainly receive books worth keep- f'he policy of the B. ft O. is to render its advertising matter so valuable from the information to which the largest por tion of space is given, that the demand for it will much more than compensate for the largely increased expense in the preparation and publication. Large sums have been offered by outside concerns for advertising space in the Red Book, but no money can buy it. The publication is beyond question the finest andmosteffec tive issued by any railroad company, and the B. & O. has no notion of decreasing its value. Hardly a newspaper office in the coun­ try that does not keep the different edi­ tions of the Red Book always at band for reference, while to State Committees and other political organizations it has become indispensable. Praise has unstintedly been bestowed upon it by Presidents and candidates for the piesidency, Cabi­ net officers, Governors and other high dignitaries, and it is indeed the popular political text-book of the day.
