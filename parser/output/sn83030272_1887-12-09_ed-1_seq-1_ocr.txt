ambitious young pugilists who punched ut each others noses right merrily and blackened each others cjos with nn enthusiasm which lent Inllnlto zest to te cooling drinks going down nil around hero was no opportunity to avoid punish mont for tho Pelicans were present in force and could only make room for a 1 tiny llttlo ring twelve feet square to be roped In fur tho flcht ore on the soft carpet The fighting which wont on in this uncomfortably small spacewas applauded by a big crowd of learned ShortS and two or three dozen lords of various call bres none worth mentioning except the Mnr quls of Queonsborrr who revels in the poll distinction of having his name associated with of tho most beloved of knocking one ways knoklll out Tho solr o was calculated to please nny body and tho way In which little Sam Blacklock ham mered a roan oneslzotoo big for him was worth alone a years subscription to the club yet no on was completely happy The brnlnlo little rodfaced lot looking with their whlto shirt fronts and black coats like bits of snow framed In coal wero Ideally full of yearnings and oven tho usually calm sporting men suggested co many little boys eating some I common ordinary dish with a big plo in sight I but out of roach All eyes oon tho hammered I eyes of tho lIttle fighters wore fastened on ono I man a very big ono Ho had a rod face and wore evening dress with patent leather boots and all such frivolities Yet no one would over havo taken him for a lordlet His shoulders were broad enough to lill door His neck was a good Imitation of I section of an old fashioned hitching post his arm was the size of a ordinary leg his wrist tho size of an or dinary arm and tho fIst fastened to I about the slzo of a moderate Thanksgiving turkey Of course everybody knows now that I was John 1 Sullivan Ho was perched In tho placo of honor and the little lords formed a buzzing swarm o admirers around him pressing him to share their whiskeys and sodas and to toll them things Tho whiskey was refused with 1 degree of virtuous sternness that would have mado all Boston glad But tho great man un bonded sufficiently to tell tho crowd an aston ishing fact which he had recently added to his store of knowledge that the old Itomans used to go in for sparring too but under the most foolish conditions rules no twentyfourfoot of oven hundredfoot ring but In Oiplace as big as tb Madi son Square Garden This pitiful state of things Sullivan dcleared mado ono despise tho old Ito mans but on the other hand ho had heard that 100000 people would turn out to seo the flghtwhich would mean millions nowadays and so far from prohibiting hare fists or skintight gloves tho police organized thin whole business themselves and allowed men to go at it with brass knuckles Sullivan sighed for now policemen with public spirit of the Roman sort and the young Lords although they had road at school about Sextus and oldtime lighting were deeply Interested in the comments of tho man who would probably have been the head of all the gladiators had his homo boon ancient Homo instead of modern Boston When Sullivan had talked a little while suc cessfully ho grow very good nnturod as often happens to great men and a chorus went up from the encouraged llttlo Lords Oh Mr Sullivan please wont you box for us A sporting man repeated the request In 1 more dignified though an equally enthusiastic way and no young woman in I low neck dross was over moro urged go hammer thin piano than Sullivan to do tho saran for something alho It was Ed Wells proprietor of time Iellcan who broko Sullivans resolve not to work out of business bourn by suggesting that all present were good friends of his and bo ought to show them how well ho deserved their admiration and at the same time them from the tmo save patri otic dangorof putting their money on Smith should ho and Sullivan mcot Bostons 1rldo had two excuses he had not his boxing gloves and tho ring was too small but a fleetfooted waiter was sent for tho fighters gear and the Pelicans delightedly squeezed together and piled onto each other sufficiently to make the ring an eighteen foot ono Sullivan came into tho ring Jack

his first exhibition at Ht James Hall A good many pounds of upor IliioiiH fat have evidently boon worked off mind whether it Is duo to n desire to eclipse tho old Romans whom ho had boon discussing or to general cheerfulness ho sailed Into Ashton and gave for nothing such nn exhibition as ho has not given hero and such a one us tIme Peli cans had never oven dreamed of Although ho used all his science to keep his blows from hinting Auhton the fate of that tough specimen was no bettor than that of an avorato steak properly pounded Sullivan boxed four hard rounds surprising every one by his astonishing quickness nnd llghtnoio and the wonderful number of blows which bo struck in a minutes time Tho majority of Pelicans all knowing birds as far as fighting Is concerned declared that their first Idea of genuine fighting had just been Imbibed while Smiths most ardent admirers scratched their noses und looked thouahtftiI Thorn was only ono man to mention Smiths natno with praleo when Sullivan hud ilono with Ashton The sol Itury ono who was a good sport laboring under temporary obscurity of judgment announced that Smith could whip anything Hut ho wits excusable as ho had burled his confidence In Smith so deep under a hood of whiskeys that no amount of great sparring could dig It out When Sullivan appeared once moro In his openTested gorgeousness time Pelicans ex pressed an ardent desire to prove their grati tude for time liberal education In boxing which had just boon bestowed on them Bulll tan declared they worn welcome and asked them not to mention It but they
