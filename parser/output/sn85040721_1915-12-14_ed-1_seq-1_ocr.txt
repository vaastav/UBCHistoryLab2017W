LaFolleHe, Burton, Root, Weeks, Bo rah, Cummins, Sherman, Knox, Fairbanks, Willing lo Run. Washington, Dec. 13.—Special Cor respondence—They’re on the mark, waiting for the pistol crack. Eight republican “favorite sons.” each with a lightning rod for the White House nomination stowed away in his luggage, are lending eclat to the preliminaries for the meeting of the G. 0. P. national committee tomorrow. Once more Senator LaFolleite is in his home state, Wisconsin, on a speech making tour. Theodore Burton, once senator from Ohio, virtually announced his candi dacy at a banquet given in his honor by Representative Emerson of Cleve land. The others are hard at work. In formal conferences are being held. In coming committeemen and the exploit ers of the several candidates have started politics buzzing in the hotel lobbies. Elihu Root has arrived. It is stated that Root will not have back of him the bulk of the progressives if nomi nated. it is argued that the endorsement former President Taft recently gave Root in Chicago has been the reverse of a strengthening factor. Senator John W. Weeks, the New England candidate, is freely discussed. Politicians who hold the Massachu setts man in high regard, argue that his candidacy is almost unknown in the middle west. Senator William E. Borah of Idaho, Senator Albert B. Cummins of lowa, and Senator L. Y. Sherman of Illinois, are all here in the line of official duty, but with an eye not overlooking poli tics. Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana, former vice-president, has arrived. Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania, completes the roster of candidates now on the scene. B. P. 0. E.

Seventeen Tons of (’arp Shipped Alive From Beaver Dam to New York. Work was finished yesterday load ing seventeen and one-half tons of carp into two special cars, and the consignment started on its long jour ney last evening to New York City where the fish will be disposed of. M. C. C. Neiman, Water street, this city, procured the fish in Beaver Dam lake, and disposed of the whole lot to New York parties, who had represen tatives in the city superintending the loading of the two 'cars. Anew wrinkle was used in shipping this lot of fish, as the two cars were provided with nine large tanks, filled with wa ter. into which the fish were placed, which will take the carp alive into New York. Each one of the eighteen tanks was supplied with an attach ment that forced air through the wa ter and insured the fish fresh water on the trip to New York, which will consume about two days. By shipping the fish alive a much higher market value is realized wffien the carp reach their eastern destina tion.—Dodge County Citizen. ‘•Lewis” Out of Danger. Chief of Police Block informs the Leader that Lewis, the forger, is re covering as rapidly as can be ex pected from the gun wound inflicted when Sheriff Teuton shot the criminal. It will be remembered that Lewis and a fellow prisoner at Jefferson had broken jail, but before making their get-awray wrere discovered by the sher iff, and wiien failing to obey the of ficer’s order to halt, Lewis was quite seriously wounded.

The Watertown Poultry and Pet Stock association held a meeting on Thursday evening, and fixed the date of the next exhibit for December 6-10, 1916. A subject before the meeting which brought out considerable discussion was the manner in which the scoring .-.ho ald he done next year, and the question was finally settled by re taining the score card system, al though many of the members were in favor of changing to the comparison system. The association will assist the Fort Atkinson association by loaning them, free of charge, the coops their south ern neighbor might need, in the show in that city. The final figures which would tell how the association came out finan cially with the recent exhibit are not available, but enough is known to as sure those interested that no loss will be sustained. Entry fees totaled $260, and the state aid will total possibly as muck as $250. Knights of Pythias Election.

WATERTOWN, JEFFERSON COUNTY, W ISCONSIN, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1915. ONE “DEFECTIVE” IS NOT PERMITTED TO DIE Miss Helen Kielblock, Formerly of Watertown, Adopts Girl Baby In Portland, Oregon. ECZEMA IS THE CHILD’S AILMENT Miss Helen Klieblock of Portland, Ore., a trained nurse who is w r ell known in Watertown, has recently adopted a girl baby in Portland rather than let her die for the want of proper attention, the verdict arrived at by Portland physicians following the cor oner’s verdict of acquital in the case of Dr. Haiselden in Chicago, where a defective was allowed to die because the surgeon would not operate. It will be remembered that a New York doctor w r ent the Chicago doctor one better and refused to operate to save a child’s life when the case under his charge w r as not a mental weakling, but merely a deformity. Now comes the Portland doctors and they go the Chocago doctor two better. The baby w r hich Miss Kielblock has adopted is suffering from eczema, and is neither feeble minded nor deformed. Miss Kielblock was in Watertown last summer, but before coming here she had cared for the baby and had at time so helped the little sufferer that the child’s skin was almost free from blemish, but when she returned to her duties in Oregon in September the lack of proper attention had caused a re lapse and the baby was almost a solid mass of sores and scab. She again took charge of the child and her efforts were again rewarded by seeing the little patient’s skin clear and soft and velvety. It appears, however, that the Portland physicians had gathered in spiration from the Chicago and New York cases, so Miss Kielblock adopted the girl to save its life and demon strate that death in this case was not proper. Miss Kielblock and the baby are now on their way to Watertown, where they will be the guests of rela tives for several weeks. On the way here they are visiting relatives in dif ferent cities, and this week they are in St. Paul. Her mother, Mrs. Albertine Kiel block, arrived here from Portland two weeks ago and will visit in Watertown, Janesville, Beloit and Milwaukee for several weeks. She is in Beloit this week. Miss Kielblock’s grandmother is Mrs. Avgusta Draeger, 1407 Thrid street, and her ststev is Mrs. Robert Leopold, 217 North Second street. Neighboring Poultry Shows, Among those who attended the poul try show at Oconomowoc were Albert Zier, Prof. Berto, William Gruetz macher and sons, Edward and Wiliam, Robert Doerr, and Alvin Schroeder of Pipersville. Mr. Gruetzmacher and Mr. Schroe der captured prizes, Mr. Gruetzmach er bringing home two cups and sls in money. The Oconomowoc association has fixed the date of next year’s show so that it falls on the same dates as the Watertown show, and no amount of protesting from the Watertown dele gation could get them to change the date to avoid conflict. Albert Zier will exhibit twenty birds at the Jefferson show this week. One hundred birds will go from Watertown to the Fort Atkinson ex hibit, which will be held December 30 to January 3. A like number will be taken to Janesville for exhibition January 21 to 26. The Milwaukee list has not yet been fully decided, but it known that suf ficient exhibitors will attend to justify the chartering of an interurban trailer. John Pfaffenbach Loves Oyster Soup. John Pfaffenbach, the genial sales man for the Wisconsin Gas and Elec tric company, and Mrs. Pfaffenbach, received word that two young ladies from the sales department of T. M. E. R. & L. Cos.. Milwaukee, would be in Watertown to visit with them Sun day. Mr. Pfaffenbach wanted to treat the young ladies nice, so he provided a goodly supply of oyster soup. The young ladies did not come as they had promised, and yesterday John was complaining to his friends about a heavy and dull feeling in the region of the stomach. The oyster soup was not fed to the cat. FROG HOLLOW. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Smith visited at the Cobb home. Sunday. Albert Heitz celebrated his nine teenth birthday anniversary, Saturday.

JUSTICE SCHMUTZLER DOES THRIVING BUSINESS Hears Four Cases ii; Which Assault and Battery Appears Twice and a Hatchet is Twice Heard From. CHICAGO 31 AN FOUND GUILTY—S4O The inevitable and ever-ready line fence, with its aftermath —quarrels aired in court —-was the boards in Justice Schmutzler's court, Saturday, at which time a jury found that Ormey Crandall of Chicago, was guilty of as saulting John Bailey, 415 North War ren street and assessed a fine and costs totaling nearly 340. The trouble appears to have started when Mr. Crandall’s mother placed a tub of leaves in the yard, with which she intended to bank the foundation of her house lor the winter, but tub, leaves and stakes were removed by Mr. Bailey, which precipitated an ar gument between him and the Chicago gentleman. The evidence brought out the aPega tion that one party wielded a hatchet threatingly end he was knocked down by his opponent. City Engineer Kraeft was drawn into the case as a witness to give tes timony as to the exact location of the property dividing line. The verdict which assessed the fine against Mr. Crandall will probably be appealed to the Dodge oounty circuit court. Another suit was filed against Mrs. Emeline Yokes, Mr. Crandall’s mother, charging assault and battery, but was thrown out of court on a. question of jurisdiction. # During the fight Mrs. Crandall, wife of the Chicago defendant, in some way gained possession of the hatchet, which furnished the foundation for the filing of the third suit. When Crandall directed a subpoena for the appear ance of his wife at his trial for assault, the subpoena cited her to produce the hatchet. The officer serving the replevin writ learned of Mrs. Crandall of the service of the subpoena and neglected to read the replevin papers, and this case w r as also thrown out of court for lack of proper service. The hatchet, determined to shine in the lime light, was the basis for the fourth court action, when Mr. Bailey instituted replevin proceedings to re cover the tool from the court, and he was awarded judgment, but by stipla tion his honor retained possession of the hatchet until the assault case is finally disposed of. In the meantime, the property di viding line remains a permanent fix ture. The jurymen in the assault and bat tery case against Crandall were Her man Kuehl, Theo. Koerner, Edward Schmutzler. Albert Krueger, Charles Heismann and Reinhold Block. 3lrriage Licenses. Marvin May and Elsie Weggemann both of Fort Atkinson. Albert H. Wollen of Lake Mills and Emma Senkel of Farmington. Theodore Borchardt and Anna Wie denhoeft. both of the town of Water town Arthur Grossert Promoted In the Navy. Arthur Grossert, a member of the navy for the past three years, informs hs friends here that he was recently promoted to coxswain of the torpedo boat Preble, stationed in Mexican wa ters, taking him from his duties in Alaskan waters. CHOCOLATE F RM WANTED LOCATION Representative Here from the East to Organize a $lOO,OOO Corporation. Encouragement Not. Extended. EMPOYMENT FOR 100 PEOPLE Probably one of the most regretable occurrences of recent weeks in Water town was when last Thursday a man who came to the city looking for a manufacturing location was advised by one of our citizens to look else where, owing, partially, to the scarcity of labor. The gentleman in question was from the Jersey Chocolate company, an eastern corporation of wealth, and his company sent him to this state, at tracted by Wisconsin’s great dairying interests, to organize a company with $lOO,OOO capital, the majority of the stock to be taken by eastern men. While his concern Is now doing a thriving business, the intention is to expand, and Watertown was the first city visited, the statistics gathered from private investigations showing that we are located in the midst of an exceptionally rich dairying counrty. Had the gentleman been successful in his quest in this city, it would have meant one more market for some of the dairy products of this section, be sides the investment of thousands of dollars in machinery and other equip ment, and the employment of 100 peo ple with a monthly pay roll of between $B,OOO and $9,000 per month. After the one discouraging inter view the eastern visitor left for Madi son, but is in Chicago today, where he is in conference with a Wa tertown man who went to the windy city yesterday evening to get audience with him, and try to induce him to give Watertown further consideration. Just how successful he will be is prob lematical, but the hope is expressed that he will be interested. Of one thing there is no doubt: The eastern company intends establishing a plant in Wisconsin. This is not a concern which would establish a man ufactory and then look for a market for its products, because the market is already established, but this is a prob lem of expansion and at the same time locate its branch as nearly as possible to the source of supply of raw ma terial. Watertown, situated as it is in a rich dairy county, can not be surpassed as an ideal location for a factory of this nature, besides the fact that while our transportation facilities are now up to a high standard, it can only be a matter of time until T. M. E. R. & L. Cos. will be doing a freight business, besides the possibility that the Badger Electric Ralway and Power company will build into Watertown from Jeffer son in 1918, and they will certainly do a freight business, also. With the advantages our city can offer, it would appear on the face that concerns such as referred to could be accommodated and inducements of fered which would attract them, and through them others would follow.

The cause was instituted by Mr. Ful ler to collect a commission for the sale of Mr. Bingham’s property in Wash ington street to Emil Tanck, Mr. Ful ler claiming that it was through his agency that the sale was made, and that he had been employed by Mrs. Bingham, which allegation was 'denied. The case came to an abrupt ending after the court had heard two wit nesses, Kading & Kading withdrawing the plaintiff’s action. This leaves the matter where it orig inally stood after leaving the justice court, and another action can be insti tuted by Mr. Fuller should he desire to so do. >VHE> GREEK MEETS GREEK. A Good Story Going the Rounds About Rev. Knutzen and Tobacco Chewing. A story told about the meeting of Rev. Knutzen. pastor of the First M. E. church, and a friend, is so fraught with brilliant repartee, that the Lea der feels justified in giving it to its readers. The story goes that while walking along the street with a friend, Rev. Knutzen observed his companion take a chew of tobacco, and asked him what particular pleasure he derives from putting such a weed into his mouth. The friend, nothing slow, and wish ing to crush the pastor with his own weapons, quoted from Matthew vi.-11, and said: “Not that which entereth into the mouth deflleth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth a man.’’ With no small degree of pride at his answer he considered the incident closed; but not so. No time was lost by the minister who asked, “then if that is true, why don’t you swallow the juice instead of spitting?” Christmas in Early Wisconsin. The Christmas festivities of the present day may be more elaborate than those of an earlier period in Wis consin history, but certainly they do not exceed them in spontaniety and rollicking fun. How the day was spent in the gay old fur-trade post at Green Bay in 1824 is interestingly told in volume sevm of the Wisconsin Historical Collections: “A table was spread the length of the room, and plates laid for a hun dred guests; the invitations extended to the whole population—French, half breeds and Americans * * * The hall was well filled; the variety of costume would have engaged the study of an artist; belles and beaux, men and women, were attired in all the grades of dress, from the highest Parisian down to the buck-skin coat, pants, petticoat and moccasns of the aborigines. * * * “It would be impossible to do just ice to the courses of the dinner; suf fice to say, that for variety or rarity of dishes, it equalled any of a similar occasion in more civilized climes. * * * There was venison, bear meat, and porcupine; a dozen vari eties of the feathered tribes from the waters, as geese and ducks; and of fishes, an almost endless list, headed by that king of all the fish tribe, the THE
