Our neighbor of the Register makes a tilt at the veracity of the Catholic minister, who delivered thedisconrse at the pulpit dedication in Eaton two weeks ago. "Where ignorance, is bliss,, 'tis folly to be wise." Eight years of a whisky-drinking, tobacco consuming, horse-racing and Sabbath breaking President. Four years of a Fraud, and now four years of a man who sold himself for $329! That is what this country has been brought to under Republican rule. The Republicans undertook to steal the organization of the State Board of Equalization, simply be cause it afforded a little pationage to be distributed. They didn't quite succeed, however. The leaders of the Republican party have cheek enough to steal from their grand mqthera. Mr. Hayes admits in his message that the colored persuasion were not bulldozed at the late election. He might have added, however, that white laborers of the North were compelled to vote the Republican ticket or lose their "bread and but ter." The color makes the differ ence.....'. . In his message fr. Hayes speaks about the dangers of "patronage of appointments for personal or parti san considerations." That coming from a man holding the stolen Pres idency and who appointed to official places every scoundrel that assisted in placing ' him in the position, is cheeky, to say the least. . We want our friends to understand that in public officials using the peo pie's monc3r in violation of law and their obligations, we kuow no party. We have no more 6 mpathy for a Democrat than a Republican in the matter, and withdrawing, support frpm-the papiT because we are not partisan enough to pass over the un lawful acts ot Demoiii-atic officials while denouncing that of Republi cans, will nut' help-iV any in our case.

' ; , Our neighbor of the Register agrees that the law is against the Councilmen who took ' pay for ser vices rendered on public jobs. ; Ol course it is. Every man with a grain of common sense knows it, but we had the "sprig" of a lawyer in Eaton to argue with us differently the other day. lie had better go to mauling rails, than attempting to demolish plain Statutes of Ohio in that man ner. ........ . The cotton factory owners at Fall River, Mass., hive effectually solved for themselves the problem of pro tection. To them protection means high prices for goods manufactured; but to their workmen it means star vation wages for their labor. At least that is the way it is working now. There are other examples of employers ( who promised better wages to workingmen if Garffcld was elected; but no sooner was the elec tion over than the then low wages of laborers were reduced still lower. , While it is true that all the south ern states voted, for Hancock, there was 1,300,000 more votes cast for him in the north than in the south, or in the approximate proportion of six democratic votes in the north to two in the south, or to put it differ ently there are twice as many demo crats in the north as there are in the south, while there are three re publicans in the north to one in the south. The grand jury in general session at New York, presented indictments against Joseph Hart, Lewis A. Post, Kenard Philp and Charles A. Bryan, for publishing in the Truth newspa per "a criminal libel'' upon General Garfield. Judge Noah Davis, before whom Kenard Philp was examined on the Garfield-Morey Chinese letter, lays down the laws of libel thus: "If : a public newspaper charges a man with being a liar, felon or forger, the editor is guilty of libel, unless the charges are true." Under this rul ing Garfield should commence suit againt the New York Tribune, Times and other Republican papers for what they . said about him in 1873, provided they lied. The Southern question is treated at considerable length in the mes sage of ( Mr. Hayes. He expresses satisfaction with the affairs in the Southern States and believes that the South is steadily advancing in the direction of political freedom and toleration, and that before long the ballot in that section will be as free as in the North. He also expresses the belief that the era of bloodshed on account of political differences has passed and points to the fact that there is now less intimidation and violence in the South than was practiced a few years ago. The bloodshed era has been succeeded by an era of fraud and misrepresen tation through tissue ballots and other devices of misrepresenting the real strength and disposition of the colored man, but while he is cheated in this way his physical rights are beginning to be universally respect ed., Mr. Hayes might have added that the party that stole the Presi dency for him is largely responsible for ballot box frauds in every part of country. : Hon. S. S. Cox has announced that he will shortly introduce a bill in Congress for the reapportionment of Representatives under the new cer sus. He thinks that the Consti tution of the United States requires that such a measure shall be passed at the earliest practical time after u decennial enumeration of the popu lation has been made. As it is purely a mathematical question so far as Congress is concerned, Mr. Cot cannot understand WI13' aliy body should seek to delay it on par lisan grounds. He says that if any partisan advantage is to be gained by a reapportionment this winter the Republicans will be benefited, because they control the Legislatures in a majority of the States, and will, therefore, control the re-districting of those States. Mr. Cox says per sonally he would prefer to see the whole number reduced to 250, but he has no hop-j that this can be done and is inclined to think that 300 will be the lowest number tuat can pos 8ilrly be fixed, while the probabilities are that 325 will be the number adopted. Mr. Cox says that when the census figures arc complete they will show a population somewhat in excess of ,000,000. It is amusing to read some of the labored articles of "smail fry" Re publican journals, about fiand and corruption in elections, and .the weakness exhibited in their effort's to make it appear that the Demo cratic party.is Ihcbnly.sinner in this respect, while the Republicans are all good, pious and moral Christians ! The Republican party since it has been in power, has been guilty of the most shameless debauchery and corruption in conducting election campaigns, and in the one just clos ed, it excelled all its previous efforts. Ohio and Indiana were carried in the October election by the sheer use of money and lawless colonization of negroes, repeaters and ballot box stuffers, and the State of iNew York in the same manner in November. The vote in Indiana in October shows an increase of over 30,000 male inhabitants more than the cen sus takers could find in June last, and in the counties where the Re publican vote shows the greatest in crease this excess is the largest which ought to be enough to satisfy any candid mind that it was a sys tematic Republican game, carefully planned and skillfully executed" all over the State. In Ohio it was the same. We need onlv to refer to the city of Columbus, which returned 1,000 more votes than the census re turned male inhabitants of a votable age. Republican employers every where were beset by their party managers and begged and threatened until they consented, some willingly, some otherwise, to compel the men in their employ to vote for Gar field. From all over the country we have well authenticated reports that the workingmen in extensive manufactories were notified bv those in authority over them that if they voted for Hancock they would be discharged, but if they voted for Garfield they could rely : upon steady work with them. And this is the party that hoTls and whines about negro intimidation and bull dozing in the South! ; Such conduct is worse than the negro Blavery that prevailed before the late war, and unless the American laborer will rise up and resent the insult and vote their honest sentiments, it will not be long until his condition will be far "more degrading than ever was the enslaved negro. - . Gen. Grant, the great national panper of this country, contributed his share of. services toward placing a Frau 1 in the White House in 1876, but has failed thus far to receive his reward. Mr. Hayes speaks for it in his message in the following passage, which "'at the same time shows the tendeney of the Republican party toward a monarch- ial government: " ' I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the commander and chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose wise, hrm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents tor the recognition of dis tinguished military merit, authoriz ing rank and emoluments to be con ferred for eminent services to the country. An act of Congress author lzing the appointment of a Captain General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to compensation, retirement and other details, would. in my judgement, be altogether fit ting and proper, and 011 Id be warmly approved by the country." m m m t It is said of John Randolph, of Virginia, that on being asked why the Old Dominion did not prosper more, he replied: "Why the negroes raise the corn, the hogs eat the corn, and the negroes eat the hogs." Now adays, says a correspondent of the Washington Post, we have a politi cal back-action movement, affecting the Democratic party as this eco nomic one affected the prospects of Virginia. The Republicans raised and control the national banks; the banks issue the money to buy voters and the corrupt voters keep the Ee publican party in power. : , The New York Herald says : During the recent canvass no iour nals were so stalwart hs the Repub lican papers 111 Southern Ohio. It made one s blood tun cold to read of the horrors that would follow from the election of Hancock. Since the election, however, the Southern mer chants of Louisville and other points in Kentucky have been complaining 01 the tone ot those Republican pa pers, and talk about transfcring their trade to other markets.' We have discovered that a Republican may be very stalwart about election times, but when he has goods to sell he would just as soou have a Demo cratic customer as a Republican. Now these Republican papers take up a chorus of friendship for the South, deny that they ever said any thing .against their ""brethren" and urge their brethren to come and buy in Cincinnati and to be as friendly as it is possible for brethren to be luis change is a curious one. It is only another illustration of what we see every day of the insincerity of our political life. What the Re publicans wanted to do before the election was to elect Gen. Garfield liierelore thej- howled about the "miseries of Southern domination." Now they want to sell goods, and tliey coo ana chirp in the most af lectionrte manner about "fraternity and "union." It shows the devilish hypocrisy of the Republican journals, ami proves that their howls about the South are only to influence simple minded vot era. It's about played out, how ever. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our Regular Correspondent. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec 12, 1880. Mr. Hayes 13 entitled 'to all the credit or discredit involved in the re tiremeat of Generals McDowell and Ord, and that'of several Bereau Gen erals soon to be 'anuojjnced. On the whole, I think he has done just what the law certainly intends, although it does not distinctly command it. Most men, however, will disapprove of the substitution of Howard, who is a sentimental General, for SchO ficld, who is a solid thinker and an equally good General, as Command- ant of West Point. There is consul erable-danger that the Academy will, under Howard, be an experimental school for the study and develop mcnt of negro morality and negro capacity, rather than, as heretofore, a school of military education. , ihe annual message from the White House was received by the Senate and House of Representatives without manifestations of applause, In fact, the messages of Mr. Hayes have ' not attracted much Congres sional attention for several years That portion of the present one which speaks of progress in reform of the civil service under the present Ad ministration is so absurd that it must have inclined members to laughter, but they suppressed their feelings while . it was being read Everybody knows that there . has been more absenteeism among office holders during the present Admin istration than during any other, and more meddling .with pclitics, and more contributions for political pur poses. , .these things were not done boldly, as . the Jack Shepherds of Grant's time did them, but slyly, as JNoan Ulaypole would do them. Mr. Hayes is able to truthfully say that the crops would have been good during nis Admistration, and there fore he argues the people have been more prosperous than for 3'ears. He points to the fact and receipts from mport duties have been large bnt does not 883', as he might, that this indicates an accumulation of wealth in a few hands as compared with the great mass of people. I do not think it unlikely that we shall hav 6tart ling evidence soon that the-importa tions are greater than the 'solid in crease, of wealth will justify. ' ; Mr.. Hayes also suggests that the office of Captain-General be created for ex .President Grant. The meeting of Congress on Mon- da37 was. without any event of note. Ihe two measures which have so far attracted attention either in Com mittee or in., the House are the re funding bill, and the resolution pro viding a "joint rule" for counting the electoral vote. This latter-prop O8itiott which is simply to restore the conditions of affairs under which in 1868 aad 1872 the vote was count ed, was consideraoiy discussed yes terday in the House. So far as the speaking was concerned, it was on the part of Democrats favorable to an early vote on the the joint rule, while the Republicans demanded un limited time for debate. There will be an early disposit ion of the whole matter, I think, and I do not see that either party will gain -anything,-no matter wnat is done on the subject. ihe highest interest any one may suggest for the proposed $100,000, 000 of refunding bonds, is three and one-half per cent. Secretary Slier man, of course, is the man who sug: gested the highest figures. The House Ways and Means Committee have agreed on three per cent. Mr. Kell3 however, thinks two and one- DEM.
