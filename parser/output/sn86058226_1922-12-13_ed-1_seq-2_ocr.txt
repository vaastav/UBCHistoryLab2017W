PAGE TWO THE RICHMOND PALLADIUM AND SUN-TELEGRAM, RICHMOND, IND., WEDNESDAY, DEC. 13, 1922. "PENALTIES," SAYS MARY LOCKE HURIN American policies, new Central Eu ropean state, the premier's confer ence, and other national and Interna tional topics were reviewed by Mary Locke Hurin in her Current Event 3 address before the Civics department of the 'Woman's club Tuesday after noon at the First English Lutheran church. - Our country's policies as outlined in the president's message to congress wero pa,ssed over briefly by the speaker. "The law ot exchange and econom ics takes no account of guilt or Inno cence," Mrs. Hurin declared In dis cussing Germany's condition and pos sibility of another moratorium in Jan uary. France's demonds, she said, are not "guarantees" Dut "penalities.' French exploitation of the Ruhr, she continued, would result in a great triumph for a time but it would be temporary.. France in taking the Ruhr would acquire all the metallurglc and coal resources of Germany which would be a crushing blow to that coun try. The breakdown of the premiers' conference in London Is partly due to this question as not even Bonar Law feels that he can side with the French in this matter. The premiers are so at variance that the Brussels conference would as yet be useless. Lloyd George, the speak er commented, is laughing up his sleeve in the meantime because Bona Law's conservative policy is getting no further than he with his Liberal policy. Jugo-Slavia, Czecho-Slovakia, and Roumania were discussed In connec tion with their little entente treaty and the conditions and rltuatlons which they were presenting. The people of the first two countries which were so oppressed by the German magyars, have made great tdvances educa tionally. Count Tolstoi to Speak At Newcastle, Thursday
