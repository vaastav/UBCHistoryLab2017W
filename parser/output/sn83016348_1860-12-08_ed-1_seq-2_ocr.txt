For a tnontii fast the ryes of the nohticnl j , ftirmlik am! fjtrg of tlm President, all over the ! | | country, have tern directed to him as the per son of all others, perhaps, most likely to fur nish ■ solution, in his Annual Message to Con gress, of the difficulties now bi selling the gov- . j eminent. Uis friends looked in confidence. while hin opponents, in spite of their fears of what has been termed Mr. Buchanan's char- * . ..... . . I arienstic lirniduy. were in hopes the emer gency would raise him above the unfavorable ( influences supposed to surround him in a v cabinet divided in opinion upon questions ‘ vital to the interest and perpetstty. of- the try | government, and inspire him with that decision and cotirsgc so nrctssary to his re- ’ sponsible and trying position in this crisis. His Message furnistres siitSt.Mcnt evidence of a desire to act “ well and'Wwdy’ r in this hour : of peril to the Republic, and. as wc progres sed with the reading of that portion of it in which he discusses. f tbly, the question of the right of aectSnfidlt, the impression become ( stronger end more encouraging, that the President's patriotic desire to pave the country from destruction had overcome all the difficulties of the case, and furnished the modus optrahili by which the gordian knot of ( our troubles would either be untied or severed. Like ninety-nine of every hundred of those who have read (bis document, however. We were doomed to suffer a sad disappoint* ment, and we arose Irom the rending of that part of the Message in which the Presi dent so illngicully com lud.s t In. t tbe Const no tion has not contoured the power upon Con press to enforce obedience to its own enact ments, — for that is tbe real question involvid in secession —with the disheartening convic tion thl, instead of throwing oil upon the troubled waters, and calming the storm now raging ircuml, and threatening to involve in ruin our hitherto glorious country, the Mes sage. like the lurid glare of tbe lightning, only tevcals to the terrified occupants of the Ship of State the perilous reefs upon which they arc rapidly ami hopelessly driving. Tin argument of the President against the tight of Secession by n State is irrcssitible. It is a digest ol the opinions of our ablest Stales man. and is complete, needing no additional word to render it convincing to the minds of reasonable men. Ii seems, therefore, truly astonishing, that the President, after follow ing Mr. Madison, in his conclusive arguments on the same point, so far, was able to resist the inevitable inference of that great man’s view of the question, as staled by himself. “ that it is not necessary to find a right to coerce in the federal articles, that bring in herent iti-lhe compact.” The singular posi tions orthc Message upon the right of Con gress under the tlonslitution to enforce oh dience to itsuwn laws, can only be accounted fur upon the supposition that the President’s characteristic indicisinn bawbecn taken ad vantage <>f by the disumonists around him, and in his counsels, in ordet to aggravate the difficulties of the nation, and render a peace ful solution of its troubles almost impossible. The countenance given by the Message to the secessionists, in their treasonable designs against lire unity of the gorernnunt. will, we fear, tend to a precipitation of all the evils of dissolution. A UiiosKjr U. S.

That of Maryland met at Annapolis at noon on Wed nesday, and formal ly cast its Vole for Breck inridge and Lane. The six Breckinridge Electors chosen in Vitginia, as stated in another par agraph, declined acting on Wednesday, thinking that, though technically entitled to vote, they were not in fact. The nine Bell electors filled the vacancies and cast the vote of the Slate for Bell and Everett.

At 12 o'clock on Monday last, in the pres ence of an eager throng of visitors attracted-' to the galleries of both Houses by the univer- *■ ssl anticipation of an caching opening of ibc i t session, both branches of Congress convened : i * \ ice President Breckinridge presiding in the J 1 Skn'atm. and Speaker Pennington in the! lloftSß of Rkphkskntativks. i J In the lliit sK before calling the roll, the ] I Eloquent Chaplain, Rev.

By an amendment to the original motion of reference, offered by Mr. 1 Bolelcr, of Va., the part excepted, as above, was referred to a Special Cumin litre of one from each Slate. On the question lopfer, as amended by Sir.

The Slate* tlvfft have calli*d State Conventions thus far, are South Carolina, for December 17ih: for January 1 Gila: ' Alabama, for January Till : Fluriiln. for Jan uary oJ ; Mississippi for January Till. A despatch -Uteil Cuarlestou, S. C.. . Nov. 2Uth says: *• It is now dcviiU'J'cirtain j here that the ordinance of secession v/ili’ be i* passed either on the 17th of Ifitli of Decciu- i bcr.” The Georgia Legislature passed, on | the 30th ulf, ar‘bih authorizing rhe suspension | of the banks, and suspending legal process i on aH d*Uts till December IWU. i A Idler from a lifelong Democrat, ami a gent liman of the highest personal character, in Springfield ill., to a file ml in \ irginia, assures hint in the most earnest manner, says the Ralto. American, that the South has nothing to fear from the adminis tration of Mr Lincoln ; that, knowing Mr. Lincoln well, as a friend of the South Jatnl the country he feels it his duty to express the firm conviction that Lincoln's administration will be national and patriotic, and will give no just cause-of offense to any section. The candidates for thr S. Carolina Convention front Charleston arc all being questioned as to their views. Those answer ing hare in substance said that, if elected, they will vote for withdrawing South Caroli na from the Confederacy of the United Scales and will, thereafter, oppose her union with any non-sl.veholding Stale under any form of government. Considerable excitement prevailed in Charleston, last week, on account of ru mors of re-inforCements of men and ammuni tion at Surf Moultrie, Sumpter Ac. A few pieces of ordnance and' some ordinary sup plies of ammunition l ad been landed at Port Moultrie occasioning the excitement. A very small body of men are posted at the latter Portress. A enrreepondent of the National over the signature of “ A voice from Virginia” sugg.sls, thtvS immediately upon the assembling of Congress that body shall stud to lb<* South Carolina Convention to meet on the Ith inst.. five experienced, upright and patriotic citizens, clothed with authority fiom the government to suggest n plan of adjustment, and especially to u:gc South Carolina lopai.se—to forbear the pre sent execution of her rash purpose of seces sion. and consider and devise the best means of affording the South redress and security.

Dr. Meicer, of La . and A- I 11-Stephens of (ja., are suggested by the writer as proper nun for the mission. ft is stated that Hon. Jno. M Bolls, of Va.. has written a letter, soon to he published, containing an original scheme for j the settlement of the slavery question. which. | if adopted, will give satisfaction North and j South. | -Mr. Brcck im Idge’s home organ i recommends a convention of the slave Slates j to announce their complaints, and demand rediess with such guarantees as they may think proper. If the 4th of March intervene before trie North answers through its Legis lature. then the U. S. Senate shall stop the wheels of government, by refusing to confirm Mr. Lincoln’s appointments, until all just de mands are conceded. The Vermont Legislature, before adjourning, referred the question of the repeal (if the Personal Liberty-hill of that Stale, to the Commissioners for the revision of the Laws, with instructions to report as to its con stitutionality. The Commissioners of revision are men of known conservative tendencies, and great legal ability, it is said'. Gov.

PASIB or ADJISTMfMT. The more conservative wing of the Southern Democracy proptsie, us a basis of adjustment, the extension of the Missouri Compromise to the Pacific ; the recognition of the right to curry and hoM slaves south of it. with pn toction, if necessary, until .State governments be formed; and the declaration that the power of Congress to regu late commerce shuß not bo construed to authorize the slave trade between the States. They give ashuranccs that such a compromise would hold all the Southern States but South Carolina, and her secession would be reconsidered. All the opposition members from Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Louisiana, with many of the Democrats from those States, are earnestly desirous of odeoting some reasonable and fair arrangement. The Culf States are really dosirous of sececdiug, and of in volving the whole South in the mu\cineut. Hence, they interpose obstacles to every scheme which is suggested. The comparison nf. opinions btftwrea Southern mem bers thus far show* *ht no plan yet suggested covers the points of embarrassment practically. wn.vt ft'riiotoAT or the mehsafe. The truth it, the Message is only laughed at by all par ties. It raps them all over the knuckles, and then tries to pacify them. The Southern Senators are particularly severe in their criticisms, while the Demociats in the House only ridicule it. Its contradictions are attributed to the fact of several parties being engaged at diflorenl times in patching it up to suit all sides. In spite of this ridicule, however, the Union feeling is evidently gaining ground, and the Select Committee, it is confidently be lieved, will be able to produce a plan which will be suc cessful in restoring quiet to nil the States but South Car olina. The Un|on men arc busily at work this evening, seeing and consulting with all the different delegations. Hon. Joshua It. Hill, of Georgia, tells mo he feels confi dent that all yet will l well. Tbo Virginia members also think all difficulties will bo healed. A MKBSK*OF.R OF PEACE. Mr. Troscott, Assistant Secretary of State, has gone to South Carolina, with a view of urging u posponoment of any hostile demonstration against forts and other public property, until after tlifd. se of Mr. Luchnnau’s term.— The administration hero is anxious to transfer all such responsibility to Mr. Lincoln, and maintain a ti uae until the 4tb of March. Mr. Trcscott’s mission will dot pro dco much effect in the present temper there. The Treasury has virtually suspended payment, and refused the usual drafts to the disbursing officers. Of tbo pay and mileage due Congrcsmien only f 200,000 have been paid on account fur the House, and

This document was submitted to both I houses of Congress on Tuesday last. Wei give the iTdlowmg abstract of it. which we i have rfiade pretty full as 10 that poilii’in of i :!*• Message treating of ihe pm-int inffnpity , condition of the country, hic-iuse of ihe gen l i ■ oral interest which the' discussion of the suh- ! j j-ct at this time, particularly by the I’iesi- j j dent, commands. The President, after alluding 'n the pros- i I perityof the material imcrosis of ihe country, I | the exri-llcnce of general health, the alnmd- : I ance of Inn vests, anti the ample returns yield- | led liy commerce anil mami facttires until very I recently, inquires the cause of the prevailing j discontent, and llneiilened'di-striiciimr of the Uni and attributes Ihe same- to the long continued anil intemperate mterfe-ience of die Northern people with the qinstion of slavery | in the Smith, the incessant and violent agna tion of winch, in the North, he- says, has in spited the slaves with vague notions ed free dom and destroyed that sense of. security for ine-ilv existing around Il.e family altars of the South. No political Union can long ex -Ist. the Ihesidrnt thinks, where the tiiesidcs of nearly half the panics to it are rendered hopelessly insecure. It is his conviction. liowevet. that the fatal period for ibssolorion lias not yet anived, nevertheless we should lake warning in time and remove the cause of danger. After rifciring to (he agitation of Ihe slavery question by the circulation, in 1833, of inflammatory appeals and pictorial hand hills. calculated to excite the passions of the slaves, the continuation of the agitation since then hy the press, by Slate am) County Con ventions, abolition sermons, ami speeches in Congress, the Message goes on to show bow easily the question could be settled br ibe people themselves, by allowing Ihe slave i States to manage their domestic institutions in their own way. They, and not the people of the North, are responsible before (£tod and the'World for slavery existing among them. ’1 he elect ion of any one ofonr fellow-citi zens, the President declares, does not of itself afford just cause for a dissolution of the Union, particularly u that election is hy a mere plu rality of voles, and is the result of tempmarv causes not likely again to occur. To justify a resort to revolutionary resistance, the Fed eral government must lie guilty of •• a deliber ate, palpable and dangerous exeicise ”of powers not granted hy tin- Constitution. The lute presidential elec:ion having been held in strict conformity with the ptnvisions of the i Constitution, the lesuli cannot justify such revolutionary resistance. The antecedents of the President elect, and the apprehensions of contingent danger in the future (hereby occasioned, are not sufficient to justify tlie destruction of the government The nature i f Ins office, its high responsibilities ant! the tiuly of administering ihe vast concerns of government afford the guarantee of a conserva tive anti Constitutional administration hy the Presidt nt elect. As the mere executive officer of the government his province is not to make hut to execute the laws. In view of the fact, ns cited by him. that no act has ever passed Congress, except the Missouri Compromise, iinpaiiing the tights of the South, anti the improbability ofany such legislation by the present or next Congress, the President thinks we should he restrained and not rashly bring the evil day upon our selves. In answer to the allegation that the South is denied iqnal rights in the Teiritori es. and should therefore secede the President says. Longtcss has never missed any act to exclude slavery from lie Territoriis, anil the Supreme Court has decided in favor of the right of owners to take slaves there and hold them under the Constitution. The act of the Kansas Legislature declaring that slavery is. and shall he, forever ptohihi ted in this Territory, the President declares to he unconstitutional, ami thinks it w ill be declared void by the judiciary when present ed in a legal form. Allusion is then made to the Diet! Scott decision as adjudging that this power did not exist in a Territorial Leg islature. Ihe President proceeding to argue that question somewhat at length anil sus taining the assumed position of the Court. The acts of Northern legislatntes to defeat the execution of tlie fugitive slave law. the Pnsideot regards at, the most palpable viola nun of Constitutional duty yet committed. Neither Congress nor any President, he says. Can justly he held responsible for these acts, w hich, passed in violation of the Constitution are null and void. The Constitutionality of the fugitive slave law, has been es tablished by all the Conns,—State, National ami Supreme, except a State Court in Wis consin, whose decision lias been reversed hy the proper appelate tribunal. The Cnnslilutiomd provision upon which the law is bastd was essential to the adoption of lite Constitution, and Ihe law has been tlie taw of tlie land from ’ fie days of Washington till now. Should the next President fail in the enforcement of tlie fugitive slave law. he will have manifested a disregard of the Con stitution and laws to the great injury of the people of (he South. It would be at war with every principle of justice and Christian chatily to presume in advance that Mr. Lin coln will thus violate his duty. Let ns ait, says the President, for the overt act. Unless these obnoxious and unconstitutional enact ments—the personal liberty bills—arc repealed, which the South has a night to demand as an act of justice from the North, the South, after the use of peace ful means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolu tionary* resistance to Ihe government. In reference to Ihe doctrine that a Slate has a tight. wheneVtr it shall he its sovereign will and pleasutr, to secede from the Union, the President says, such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history and character of the Constitution, in the framing and adop tion of which no such idea ever occitrtcd to either its opponents or its advocates. Not until many years had elapsed after its adop tion was such an idta advnncid. and then it was met and refuted hy Cicn. Jackson in his message of Jany. 10th 1833, transmitting to Congress the S. Carolina nulliflcalion ordi anee. The theory is founded upon inference alone, and not upon any language in the histiumint itself. In proof that Ihe Union was intended to fie perpetual the President cites die fact that tlie old articles of confederation were entilhd “ Articles of Confederation m.d perpetual Union between the States,” and the declara tion of die 13th article, that the article of lids Confederation shall be inviolably observ ed by every Stale, and the Union shall he perpetual;” also the preamble to die Consti tution, which recites ihat it was established " m order to form a more perfect union.’’— As still more conclusive on this subject lie points to the nature and extent of die powers of die Fideral government under the Consti tution, embracing the very highest attributes of national sovereignty, viz. the power to make war and peace, raise and support armies and navies, conclude treaties, to coin money anil regulate its value, to ngulatc com merce: foreign and domestic; and to carry nil these into effect. Congress processes die light to collect duties and taxes. These powers are not only conferred upon Corgi ess by die Constitution but the Slates are ex pressly prohibiud by it fiom interfering widi their exercise by Congtess. The Con st tuition is made tliesnpieme law of the lain) and die judges in every Stale arc bound thereby. Slate Constitutions or laws to die contrary notwithstanding. Senators and Kepiesentativesof the United States, members ol State Legislatures and all Executive and Judicial officers " both of the United Stales and of Several States, shall lie bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitu tion.” To carry into (fleet these powers a perfect Government is established, acting directly upon individual citizens of the States and executing its decrees by its own officers.

The consequences of such an Htlimpi is made, would rest upon the heads of llie assailants. The President is invested with no discretion, spall from the execution of the laws lo determine or change the relations be- i tween the federal gnveriiiiient and South Carolina, and has no power to acknowledge the- independence of that Stale. Any attempt to do so would lie a naked act of usurpation or. his part. The question is therefore sub mitted to Congress, Willi tin- re-mark, that the emergency may soou arise when the momentous question of compelling a Slate, by force of arms, lo remain in the Union will require de-terminal ion. For the remainder of nnr synopsis we are indebted to the- Baltimore American of Wed nesday. The Pre-sident discusses the right of Con- j gross lo use force against a seceding Slate, and comes lo the conclusion “ that the power to make war •• against a Slate is at vaiinner with llie whole spirit and intent of the Constitution." If, however, such a power could he constitutionally exercised, the- Presi dent thinks it could not be wisely used under the present ciiciimstonces. IK- contends that nnr Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be cemented by the blond of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live in tin alll-ci ions of the people, it must one day perish. Congress possesses many means nf preserving it hy conciliation : but the swuin was not placed in thrir hands to preserve it by force. Passing from the discussion of these poin's. the Piesidi-nl appeals to the country to pause andjde' berate before tie y deti rinine to de-troy the Union. Not iveiy wrong, even though it be a very grievous wrong, can justify the resort lo such a fiaiful alternative. Tbete are means of adjustment and conciliation which should fiist be tried, and the means which he proposes in the present crisis is a Constitutional Convention for the- purpose of obtaining an •• explanatory amendment of the Consulnlion on - llie subject of slavery."— lie proposes that Ibis explanatory amend ment shall be confined lo the final setleinent of the tine construction of the Constitution on three special points: 1 An -xpn*d rcrnjcnititin <*f tb* l of pr>prrtT in •*lavr** in (hu Mate* where it now exists or mav hereafter t \i*t. -■ The duty of protecting thin rlpfht in all the common Territories throughout their territorial existence, ami until they *lmll he admitted as States into the I’nion. with or without slavery, ax their cunxiitutioin mav pre scribe.

The Picsideiil thinks that such a# appeal lo the arbitrament established by the Con stitution itself would be received with favor hy all the States of the Confederacy. In any event it ought lo be tried in a spirit nf concil iation before any of those Slates shall, separ ate themselves from tho Union, The remainder of the Message is devoted In the discussion of the usual subjects of domestic and foieign relations. Our foieign relations, with the exception of those w ith Mexico, are generally in a satisfactory con dition. In relation to the tarifflhe President says it is now q.niic evident that the financial necessities of the Government will require a med ideation of the tarifl' during the present session, for the purpose of increasing the revenue. lie therefore reiterates the recom mendation contained in his last two annual messages, in favor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem duties on all imported articles lo which these cm be properly applied. From long observation and experi ence he is convinced that specific duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue and lo secure to our manufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from tlie revenue tariff. The Gov. of Virginia has issued his procla mation declaring the election of nine Belt, and six Breckinridge electors in that State. The highest Bell elector chosen received 74.304 votes and the lowest 73,877 voles. The highest Breckinridge elector chosen received 74.180 and the lowext 74,029 votes.
