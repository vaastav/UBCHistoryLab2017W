The greatest devtilution nml that demanding speedy relief, e. ists principally in the western portion of Sedgwick and bunmcr countie-. with a small per cent, scattered throughout each and every township in the five conn tier, linl enough in this line.

I'mtok Eagi.k, Dear Sir: As you have not any correspondent from this ihe best part of Sedgwick county, 1 thought I would drop jou a few lines to let you know how we are getting along. Our friend,. lohh Duuscomb, has left Dr. Ashmore who murdered his rtifo some lime ago in Topeka, b -hooting her in the head, and who wa iflerwards captured in the wilds ot Texas, and who got a change of venue to Uurlingame, Osage county, wa loiiud guilty of murder in the first de gree last week and sent to the peniten tiary to await his execution which un der our law will never occur. Tin murder was most brutal and the exe cution in all righteousness shuld havi been speedy and would have been bin for the law. The Topeka Commonwealth in a seven column review goes for Auditoi Wilder's report, allirming that it reads tnd sounds more like the v.ily plead ings of a politician than like a stat. paper. We have not had time to re view the report, but from what w. have seen we fear Webb has gone a lit tle outside of the record and the law to make a ca-c. doing violence, to tin political life and motives of sevcra iioii who acted conscientiously and ti ihe best of their ability we have no. the least doubt. Webb was an editoi loo long to confine him-elf to iniist records and dry figures, hence, w. suppose, his graceful pen pictures. Mr. Secretary Delano, of the Inter ior Department, has fiui-hed and pub lished his report. Among his recom mendations respecting public lauds i one very sensible one for a law to pro Icet our forests, lie advises a systen of surveys that will establi-h thequau i i ty ol pine or fir timber on eacl -mallest subdivision of a .section, th. appraisal of all such timber hind, am Hs sale at appraised value. This wil accomplish the double purpose of pre venting a further waste of the forests .mil of securing to the government : largelv increased revenue.

The meauderiu; creek with its banks covered with for est trees, looked like a huge serpent anl on either side the brown prairies ihe green wheal fields, the black soi of tiie corn fields, and the newly bro ken laud looked like an iiiitucn-i checker board.

Perhaps we were ready to say this is : great country and an empire of itsell and providence has caused this rid -oil "to withhold its corrupting aliun dance" for this once to remind u thai ucaro not independent of our breth ren of tl.e cast. When I arrived at tho school house 1 found it crowded with people who all seemed to be Irv ing to talk taster and laugh loudci than all the rc-t.

Charlie Ward also has a good stock of groceries at Clear Water. Uoth ol these gentlemen, (Mr. Ward, and Mr. Cramer), are very accommodating, and .ire doing a very good business, consid ering the-e haul limes, and scarcity ol money. We need a hotel at Clear Water. I'hc farmers iu general are in prettv ;ood spirit notwithstanding the grasshoppers eat all of their crops. I think wc can make it though with a little assistance from the State Central Aid Society, iu the way of getting -omecorn to feed our stock, in order io keep llieni able for spring work. We nearly all have friends iu Iowa, and eNewliere, who will contribute to om .-clief, in the way of sending us grain, out wc arc not able to pay the freight. Wc formed a society this atternoon for the purpose of asking assistance, operating with the State Kclief So-i-iety. Nearly all of us have food plcutv for ourselves, what we lack most is food for our stock. We have new settlers oming in fulling up the places ot those who got scared by the grasshop pers. The citizens themselves have a con siderable emigration in the way of bov .abics, for this reason I think this lo cality, and Wichita should be on verv joud terms, as Wichita can't produce my thing but girl babies. The grange spirit is not dead here. A'e are still taking in new nicinbcis uto the grange.

Ks., Nov. 27, 1874. We reached this youthful city last night iu a storm of sleet and snow that was anything but agreeable, and which failed to impress us with a be lief that we were in a tropical region. We hud to be constantly reminded we were iu in south Kansas, where the balmy breeze- blow and the sun is ev er shining. The storm to-day equals au thing we have had up north, and Ihe snow is several inches deep, ll brings to the minds of Vermonters re membrances of the Green mountains, to Iowa men it looks like Iowa, and Michicau settlers think they are at home. Hut then the like vvas never seen before. The memory ot tlfc old est inhabitant, the first squatter, runs not back to the time when such a storm occurred. We are well pleased with the busv little city, and somewhat surprised at the solididy and worth of the blocks of business houses, &c, that make up the streets. The citizens seem to be fully impressed with the notion that they have a lull-fledged city, if it isn't as long as New York or as broad as PliiholJj)l"r-a. Their po lice force is as wisHMflfganized and ef lectivc as that of their big sisters, and law and order is maintained at all haz ards. Indeed, the absence of rows and disorderly conduct is a matter ol won der to those knowing the location of Wichita and the character of many ot it citizens, and who are pre tared to encounter deeds of violence. We found the Eagi.i: spreading its wings prutertingly over the town, and the Murdocks happy iu the possess ion of the bird. They have a good, wcll-furuished office, and conduct a No. 1 paper, a credit to the town am' coil u try. We al-o met Mr. Gable, the gentlemanly editor of the Beacon, which is also an excellent newspaper. Uoth journals arc Republican, and Wichita is fortunate in possessing two such papers. W. E. Stanley, Esq., so well known io many of she JmU-pemlcut readers, is right at home here, and is now ''resting upon his l.iurels," having, af ter a hard light, been elected to the of lice of county attorney. He gained a greet deal in popular favor by his manly way of conducting the cam paign, and seeins to be on the high way to success and fortune. May he reach it. Wichita is located on the Arkansas river, 212 miles from Alchisun, bv rail, about -l.'t wiles from the southern line of the stale, and is the terminus ol one branch of the A. T.& S. P. rail road. It has about 2,:,00 or 3,000 in habitants, and bids lair to remain a protniiicist, healthy business place. There are main iiue, two and tin ee story brick buildings here; several good hotels, one of t hem at least com paring favorable in all icspects with .my in the state; a very complete and extensive flouring mill is one of th. piouiiueiit feat in es; two or three church buildings, one of them, the Methodist, being a good house; thev nave a pretty large frame schoolhoiise. which, however, is insufficient for the purpose, and, doubtless, another om will soon be creeled; tho busiiies houses, many of them, seem to be well conducted and to be doinga good bus iness. Wc understand that the socie ty is now verv good, that the churches have excellent congregations, and an lully alive and apace with the column niiy. Sunday schools arc iii-litutiou-of the city, and trc iu a nourishing -late. .Tins M. E. srhool, under Mr Stanley's supcrintcndchc., is to give n dinner next balm day, Dec. oth, to all the children in the community. Kc lief committees are being talked up. and aid is to be given the destitute of of the country scrroiiudiug. Altogether we are surprised at the town that has been built up here in the last four years, well pleased with it, and believe that it is bound to win. A man never leaves this region with out i:iv ing his debts, never abeouuds, never runs oil". He simply "jumps the country." That tells it ail. A soldier was brought iu here last night with his hand and feet badlv Irozen. He started from Port Sill, a few days ago, on the stage, became so cold as to not know what he wa about and jumped out. The drivel called for him some time and fiuallv drove off and left him. He was found next morning, hiving laid on the prai rie all night, tie may lose some ol his lingers, if not his toes. Ilegocs to the hospital at Leavenworth. The A.T.&S. P. road is the best in Kansas, it is well built and runs smoothly; it is well conducted, and has obliging, liberal officers: it is en icrprisiug, and labors to build up the country along the line. Some ot the best citizens the state has have been brought here through the efforts of iis olliceis. The Mennoiiites, who ban settled on the lands of thi- compauv are proving their worth. Thev aie de veloping the country, creeling good houses, improving their land, and building whole towns, and making tin desert blossom.
