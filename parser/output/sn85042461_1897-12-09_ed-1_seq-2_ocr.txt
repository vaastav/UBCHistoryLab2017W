2 PELAGIC SEALING v The First Question Argued in the Senate SEAL KILLING TO BE STOPPED fV ACCORDANCE WITH BRITISH DEMANDS No Business Done in the Honse, But the Committees Oet Matters in Shape ' Associated Press (Special Wire. WASHINGTON', D. C., Dec. B.—ln his Invocation at the opening of the Senate today, Rev. W. H. Mllburn, the Chap lain, delivered a brief but touching eulogy ot the late Senator George, of Mississippi. Mr. Davis, of Minnesota, reported from - "rthe Committee on Foreign Relations, a ' bill prohibiting the killing of fur seals in the North Pacific Ocean. He asked Immediate consideration of the bill, but Mr. Hale, of Maine, objected on the ' ground of the importance of the meas ure, and asked that the bill be printed. The bill was reported to the senate later In the day. The first section of it Is as follows: "That no citizen of the United States and no person owing duty or obedience to the laws and treaties of the United States; nor any person belonging to or on board a vessel of the United States Shall kill, capture or hunt at any time or in any manner whatever any fur Seal in the waters of the Pacific ocean north of the 35th degree of north lati tude and including Bering eea and the Sea of Okhotsk." The bill also prohibits any citizen of the United States from equipping, using: or employing or furnishing supplies to any vessel engaged in killing or hunting fur seals, and declares that no United States vessel shall be employed in this ■work. Tho penalty for violating the proposed law is imprisonment for not more than six months or a fine of not less than $200 of more than $2000, or both, and the forfeiture of vessels so engaged. The fourth section of the bill is as follows: "If any vessel of the United States Ehall be found within the waters to which this act applies, having on board fur seal skins or bodies of seals or ap paratus of implements suitable for kill ing or taking seals, It shall be presumed that such vessels were killing seals. The United States courts in Alaska, Califor nia, Oregon and Washington are given Jurisdiction over cases arising under this act." It Is especially provided that the act is not to interfere with the privileges of coast Indians, nor with the taking of seals on the Pribyloff islands. Officers of the navy and the revenue cutter service are empowered to search suspected vessels. The importation of sealskins b3' any person, taken contrary to this law, is prohibited and all such eklns so Imported are to be seized and destroyed. Representative Hltt of Illinois, chair man of the committee on foreign affairs Df the house, introduced a similar bill in the house. This measure supplements the diplo matic negotiations which have been go ing on for some time between the United States, Great Britain, Russia and Japan, i Throughout the negotiations with rep- i resentatives of Great Britain effort was | made to have British citizens stop i pelagic sealing, while at the same time j the United States permitted its own : citizens to carry on this practice. When < the American commissioners urged that I pelagic sealing was contrary to the die- i tates Of humanity, they were invariably ' met with the answer that this inhuman ity was sanctioned by the laws of the I United States The state department ' desires to overcome this objection The 1 law, as it stands, permits citizens of the United States to take seals outside of < the throe-mile limit urroundlng the 1 Pribyloff islands. This was never in- 1 tended, but has come about through a f supreme court decision respecting the 1 Paris awards. Tho law reads that cit- ' izens of the United States shall not take. •' seals in the waters of "Alaska." It was 1 supposed that this was a universal pro- I hibition to our citizens. But the Purls • Court of arbitration held that the United 1 Elates held no property on the seals out- 1 Side of the three-mile limit of tho Priby- 1 loff Islands. In construing this, the su- ' preme court held that as the United 1 States held no property outside of the three-mile limit, the law prohibiting the 1 destruction of seals "in the waters of ' Alaska" did not apply to pelagic sealing on the high seas. In consequence poach- ' ing by American vessels was in effect 1 legalized and quite a number of Amer ican vessels have been sealing in Bering ' sea, although the government has been f seeking to show that this sealing was unjustifiable. It is expected also that this step by the United States will have , a salutary effect on the negotiations now \ In progress between Breat Britain, Can ada and the United States. Mr. Hill will , call tho bill up tomorrow. And the pur- ■ poso Is to have it reported and passed i With the least delay possible. THE CUBAN QUESTION : Mr. Allen, of Nebraska, presented a ' resolution declaring It to bo the sense ' of the Senate, that Congress should With all due nnd convenient speed, ac- £ knowledge by appropriate act, the poll- « tical Independence of Cuba. 1 Mr. Allen said that he bad long urged 1 that the United States should recognize c the independence of the Cuban insur- i gents. He would not be content with 1 the recognition of belligerency, but' 1 would Insist upon the acknowledgement 1 of absolute political liberty. Ho wa „ satisfied that the people would not be i content with the course advised by th.' i administration. Inasmuch as the Cv- : bans for more than two years, on many battlefields, had demonstrated their < valor and love for liberty, he felt that they had earned a recognition of their i political liberty, and that it ought to : be accorded to them without further temporizing. If necessary, this recognition should be backed by a fleet of American vessels In Cuban waters. He expressed a belief that the owners of Spanish bonds in this country, American citizens holding property In Cuba- that had been Injured or destroyed by the Insurgents, and the carrying trade of the country, which might be affected by such a step, bad Joined to prevent the recognition of Cuba's political independence. Mr. Allen expressed the belief that President McKinley's statement In his message that the recognition of the bel ligerency of the Cuban Insurgents Is now unwise and therefore lnadmlssable, would be a great disappointment to tho members of the Republican party throughout the United States. The na tional convention of that party has de clared for the Independence of Cuba, going farther than the simple recogni tion ot belligerency. He thought that the president was under obligations to carry out the pledge which his party had made—a pledge which had been made to seventy-three millions of people. The president, Mr. Allen thought, had been lulled to sleep by the declaration of Spain that she would give Cuba a semi political existence. He expressed the be lief that the president's neglect to take such action as would Insure the politi cal independence of Cuba as an exhibi tion of "rank hypocrisy" and a "fla grant neglect of public duty," which would be corrected by the all-ruling power In his own good time. At the conclusion of Mr. Allen's re marks, Mr. Hoar presented a resolution expressing the regret of the senate at the news of the death of Representative Ashley B. Wright of Massachusetts, and providing for an adjournment as a further mark of respect At 12:55 oclock the resolution was adopted and the senate adjourned. IN THE 

HOUSE The Pension Bill Reported—Nothing Else Done WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.—The session of the House today lasted only SENATOR C. K. DAY IS OF MINNESOTA fifteen minutes. Mr. Stone, Republican, of Pennsylvania, reported the pension appropriation bill, the first of the ap propriation bills, and gave notice that he would call it up Immediately after the reading of the Journal tomorrow. The Committee on Elections and the Committee on Banking and Currency were given leave to sit during the ses sions of the House. Then, at 12:15, the House adiourned. IN COMMITTEE The Currency Reformers Hold Their First Meeting WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.—The House Committee on Banking and Cur rency, which has the shaping ofl a con siderable portion of the financial legis lation before the House, held Its first meeting this morning and outlined Its general plan of action. In view of Sec retary Gage's recommendation of a comprehensive revision of currency and banking affairs,a resolution was adopted inviting the Secretary to embody his views in a bill. The committee was informed that the Secretary was now at work on a meas ure and that it would be available for the committee In about a week. Mr. Hill, of Connecticut, then pre cipitated a sharp debate by moving that the committee move at once by reporting to the House a bill embodying the three financial features which had the Pres ident's approval. These were embodied in a bill heretofore offered by Mr. Broe sius, of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Hill, now proposed that . the first three sections be placed before the House immediately. The three sections provided: Bank cir culation up to the par value of bonds deposited; reduction of the tax on cir culation to one-fourth of 1 per cent; J.he establishment of small banks in rural communities. Mr. Hill said the committee would do well not to go through the tedious pro cess of considering and dividing these throe propositions, which appeared to meet with general acceptance and had received executive approval. Mr. Johnson, of Indiana, earnestly op posed such hasty action. He said there should be time to hear from the gentle men forming the Monetary Commission, and to weigh all provisions. Precipitate action on such a vital subject would, he said, seriously prejudice the commit tee before the House and the country. The debate was proceeding with ani mation when, at 12 o'clock, It went over, a vote on the Hill motion not having been reached. Chairman Walker announced four sub-committees and assigned to each a number of the banking and currency bills already introduced. The sub-committees will begin work at once on the bills before them, each sub-committee having charge of the bills introduced by Its members. The Walker sub-committee will have eharg, of the Walker bill, which has attracted considerable attention In banking clr cles. it proposes to Introduce the New England Suffolk bank system to tho whole country, adding a government guarantee for all notes Issued by banks and imposing a small tax on bank notes as a safety fund. The bill of Mr. Hill also goes before this committee. Mr. Hill says ho has endeavored to draw it on conservative lines, meeting the finan cial ills which most need reform wdthout going to a radical extent. He provides for an Increase of bank circulation to the par value of bonds deposited; re duces the taxation on circulation to one fourth of one per tent; provides for the establishment of small banks in rural communities and does awey with the re LOS ANGELES HERALD i THURSDAY MORNING* DECEMBER 9, 1897 i strlctlons on the free Issue and wlth ' drawal of national bank notes. Except i In the last particular, the author of the ■ bill feels that he Is in line with Mr. Mc -1 Klnlcy's recent currenoy recommenda ; tlons. This sub-committee will also deal with the bills of Representative Cox, the ranking Democrat on the committee. The main one Is known as the "Carlisle bill," which was originally urged by John G. Carlisle when he was secretary of the treasury. Mr. Cox is also press ing the bill for the repeal of tax on state banks. The Brosslus sub-committee will prob ably deal with Secretary Gage's plan of currency and banking reform. A bill on the same lines has been Introduced by Mr. Mitchell of New York, a member ot the sub-committee. Its essential feat ure Is to separate the funds of the gov ernment Into two branches relating to j fiscal expenditures and the other re ! latlng to the broader monetary affairs of the country, the details being much the same as those outlined by Mr. Gage. Mr. Brosslus, the chairman of this sub committee, also has a comprehensive measure of currency reform. It covers the features which Mr. Hill sought to have reported today and also a separate redemption fund calculated to reinforce the treasury reserve. The Brosslus bill also gives the secretary of the treasury the discretion of redeeming notes In sil ver and gold at the option of the hold ers. The Johnson sub-committee will deal with Mr. Johns' bill, which more par ticularly seeks to allow national banks to issue circulation up to the par value of their bonds deposited. The Van Voorhis sub-committee will handle the Fowler bill, which provides for the refunding of bonds for United States gold bonds bearing 2 per cent in terest. There are many other measures which are before the several sub-com mittees but the foregoing comprise those which have attracted the most general j attention and are likely to furnish the basis of discussion. INVALID PENSIONS WASHINGTON, Dec. B—The house committee on invalid pensions met to day and took action that Is intended to correct the alleged rapidly growing abuse of young women marrying old soldiers and sailors for the purpose of becoming their widows and drawing a pension from the government. This subject has been much discussed in view of a comparatively large number of widow claimants on account of the rev olutionary war of 1812 and Mexican war service of husbands. The committee authorized Chairman Ray to obtain from the committee on rules and order a rule permitting an amendment to th? pension appropriation bill providing that no pension shall hereafter be granted to the widow of a Boldier or other person who is married to such soldier or per son after the passage of this act, except ing, however, all soldiers, sailors, offic ers, etc., now in or who may hereafter enter the military or naval service of the United States. SESSION NOTES Gear's Kansas Pacific Bill—Civil Service WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. B.—Sena tor Gear today introduced a bill author izing the Secretary of the Treasury to enter a bid for the* United States on bond-aided railroads, and to close off Hens. The provision is as follows: "The Secretary of the Treasury shall, under the direction of the President, re deem, or othenvise clear up, such para mount Hen or mortgage, or other in cumbrance, by paying the sums lawfully due In respect thereof, out of the Treas ury; or may bid and purchase, in the name of and for the United States, the property affected by or subject to, such paramount Hen, at any sale thereof, made under any order of the court, or any Judgment or decree of foreclosure of such lien or Interest of the United States." The bill is understood to have been framed by the Attorney-General and it is Intended to open the way to the settlement of the Kansas Pacific debt. A paper was circulated in the house today with a view to bringing about a conference of those members favoring a change in the present civil service sys tem. The paper was handled by Rep resentative Pearson of North Carolina and received numerous signatures. The purpose, It Is understood, is to make the conference non-political in character and to extend it outside of the member ship of the civil service committee, as some of the men most active In urging a revision of the law are not on this com mittee. General Grosvenor of Ohio is among these. A bill was Introduced In the senate'to day by Senator Nelson for the amend ment of the interstate commerce law, authorizing the Interstate commerce commission to Investigate complaints of inequality of rates made by the patrons of railroads and prescribing the regulations for such Investigation. Senator Pritchard today introduced a bill reducing the tax on distilled spirits In bond to 70 cents per gallon. The house committee on foreign af fairs will hold its first meeting Thurs day, when Chairman Hltt will name the sub-committees which will consider the several questions of Cuba, Hawaii, etc. Tho river and harbor committee will meet the early part of next week. Al ready strong pressure Is being brought to bear for the preparation of a river and harbor bill.

There are twenty-one con tests pending. 

BURNING QUESTIONS How Members Will Vote on Fending Measures NEW" YORK, Dec. 8. —A special to tho Journal and Advertiser from Washing ton says: A reporter having made a poll of Congress on the most vital questions likely to come before that body at this session, below is given the exact ques tions submitted to the members: "Do you favor the retirement of green backs?" The surprise in the vote upon this proposition was In the fact that such Re publicans as Belknap, Dolllver, Odell, Henderson, Meslck, Bruce and Hopkins were found In opposition. Not a single Populist, of course, favored the propo sition, while Brenner of Ohio and Kitch en were the only Democrats In its favor. The following propositions were sub mitted to the Senate: "Can any radical financial legislation. Involving the retirement of the green backs, the limitation of the legal ten der quality of silver, or the issuing of gold bonds for the retirement of green backs pass the Senate?" There was practically a unanimous sentiment that nothing can be done. On this poll there was not an affirmative vote. The negatives were largely in the ma jority and the doubt expressed by cer tain Senators virtually meant a nega tive. To the Senate on the matter of annex ation this proposition was submitted: "Do you favor the annexation of Ha waii?" Not a single straight Republican was found in opposition, but Cannon and Pettigrew. The silver Senators voted in favor of it. All the leaders of the Demo cratic party were opposed, with the ex ceptions of Morgan, Pettus, Rawlins and Turple. The exact form of the vote taken upon the question of arbitration was this: "Do you favor the adoption of a gener al arbitration treaty with Great Brit ain?" Among the Republicans found in tha negative were Elklns, Frye and Baker, going with Cockrell, Mills, Morgan and Murphy among the leaders of the Demo crats. The greater lights in the Re publican party who leaned toward an affirmative view were Allison, Foraker, Hale, Hanna, Hawley, Morrill and Hoar. But many of the Senators who wished to be recorded In the affirmative qualified their declarations by con ditions and estimates as to exactly what such a treaty should comprise and what its exact conditions might be. Upon the Cuban question, these two propositions were submitted to the mem bers of the House: "Do you favor the Joint resolution passed by the Senate at the extra ses sion declaring that a state of war ex ists In Cuba?" "Do you favor a resolution acknowl edging the Independence of Cuba?" The first proposition seemed to meet wilh the views of the greater portion of the known friends of the Insurgents, al though the Republicans were far be hind the Democrats In numbers. Among those on the Republican roll who voted for the proposition were Belknap, Bou telle, Danford, Davenport, Dorr, Grow, Henry of Indiana, Bobbins, Stevens and Overstreet. All the Democratic leaders favored it. Such men as Bailey, Ben ton, Bland, Ermentrout and Taylor of Alabama being found among the posi tive friends of belligerency for the gal lant patriots of Spain's beleagurer col ony. Friends of Cuba appeared to lie a bit shy of the bold suggestion of Cuban in dependence, probably for the reason that the first proposition having passed the Senate affords the means of more direc tion, and through the fear that the Con gressional recognition of Cuban inde pendence might lead to complications with Spain which the other move would avoid. HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION CHICAGO, Dec. B.—A special to the Tribune from Washington says: If a vote could be taken today the proposi tion to annex the Hawaiian Islands would undoubtedly fall to secure the necessary two-thirds majority. This Is the result of an Informal canvass of the Senate made since the opening by Senators who are more or less favorable to the project. They say that thus far not over half a dozen of the Democrats have announced themselves as being openly in favor of the treaty. There are about ten of the same party who are ad mittedly on the fence. At the present time they would vote against the treaty. In all probability, but are expected to be won over In the course of the debate. The remainder of the Democrats, num bering eighteen or so, are apparently hostile to the annexation for various reasons. The full membership of the Senate is ninety. It therefore requires sixty votes to pass the treaty as a treaty and without resorting to the subterfuge of a joint resolution. Thirty-one Senators can defeat the treaty entirely, and a much smaller number, If sufficiently belligerent, can prevent action for a long enough time. The opponents of annex ation say that at the present time they oan count on twenty-five Democratic Senators, seven Republicans and three Independents, making a total of thirty live, or more than enough to defeat the treaty. There are many Senators who believe that by withholding- their votes on Hawaii they may be able to force the President and his advisers to do some thing for Cuba. NOT 

READY YDT WASHINGTON, D. O.i Deo. B.—Sena tor Davis, Chairman of the Foreign Re lations Committee, says he Is not ready to proceed with the Hawaiian annexa tion treaty and cannot now fix a time at which It will be taken up, though he thinks It will be before the holidays. LEGALLY DEAD Hill Not Now a Subject for the Hang- man's Bops PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. B.—The post ponement of the execution of Hill and the developments in the case have caused a sensation In legal circles. Geo. H. Kane, one of the young members of the bar, who acted as Hill's counsel, 1b supported by several Judges of the coun ty court, as well as by many of the leading attorneys. Mr. Kane says: "Philip Hill Is legally dead. We shall ask for a writ of habeas corpus to have his body turned over to his friends, and If necessary, will Take the case to the supreme court of the United States. The writ of error, as we notified Governor Hastings, should not have acted as a supersedeas or stay of execution under the act of 1897, and he is regarded by the law, as I see It, as dead." Tho postponement of the execution by the writ of error is something before un heard of In the history of this state. It Is almost a parallel case to that ot Theodore Durrant, the San Francisco murderer, whoso execution was pre vented by the same sort of an applica tion, but, according to the lows of Cal ifornia, the date for the hanging may in California be again fixed. The execution of the negro, Philip Hill, which was set for today, has been post poned Indefinitely. Falling to hear favorably from Governor Hastings' upon the application of Hill's mother for a respite, his attorneys took out a writ of error to the supreme court this morn 'lng, and upon advice of counsel that the | appeal acted as a supersedeas, Sheriff ' Lowry postponed the execution. The writ of error is returnable Oct. Ist next. Hill was convicted of the murder of George Lawrence, a railroad labor boss. ARKANSAS CRIME A Constable Lynched for Making an Arrest FORT SMITH. Ark.. Dec. B.—James Murray, constable at Jenny Llnd, a coal mining town in Sebastian county, was lynched on Sunday night by a mob of coal miners. Constable Murray went to Bonanza Sunday afternoon to arrest la miner named Mcßroom. He cap tured Mcßroom without trouble and started for Jenny Llnd about midnight. That was the last seen of Murray alive. The constable's body was found lying near the roadside, about thirty yards from the shaft of the Bonanza mine. His hands were tied securely behind his body and his neck was black and blue, showing plainly the Imprint of a rope, I which had choked the life out of his body. Blood oozed from a dozen bullet wounds in the officer's body, and his clothing was torn into shreds. The cor oner began an Investigation, and it has been fully developed that he was way laid by a mob of Meßroom's friends, composed of miners, determined upon rescuing the prisoner, and that Murray was lynched, the body cut down and placed by the roadside. Mcßroom was arrested today. A MEXICAN LOAN Silver Bonds to Bear Five Per Cent Interest CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. B.—The chamber of deputies has approved the bill authorizing the minister of finance to issue a new series of 5 per cent silver bonds of the interior debt to the amount of $20,000,000, making the total authori zation $60,000,000. The bill Is now beforo the senate. These bonds are Issued to convert the floating debt Into the form of subsidies, port works, payments, etc., and as ameans of making the internal debt uniform. These bonds are always in active demand in Europe, where they are mostly held by small investors, who regard them as an excellent form of placing their savings. The bonds are quoted at 78 to 80 In this market. The bill has gone to the senate from the chamber of deputies approving the con tract made with the Mexican Telegraph company for the Introduction of an In ternational cable and telegraph ser vice.
