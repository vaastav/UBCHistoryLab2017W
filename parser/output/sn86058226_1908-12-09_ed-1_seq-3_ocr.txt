S. -The first Federal Council of the Church of Christ in America, organized to fur ther the movement of unity of action among the protestant denominations in the interestof spreading the gospel, ad journed Tuesday to meet in Decem ber, 1912, at a place to be selected by the executive council of the organiza tion. Strong resolutions were adopt ed at the finel session in opposition to Increased armament by the nations of the earth. A feature of the session was an ad dress by Prof. Henry Wade Rogers, of Tale University, who said the time was at hand for obligatory arbitration of disputes between the nations. He dep recated the unchristian attitude of the tTnIted States and its "ma drivalry" rith the nations of Europe in building the largest, swiftest and deadliest bat tleships. Resolutions were also 'adopted con demning the divorce evil and com mending organizations that have ta ken up the subject of better divorce laws. The council also passed a res olution calling upon school authorities to give children more time during the week for religious instructions in their koines and churches. WOULD PREVENT PUMPING OF GAS Madison County Farmers to Appeal to Legislature. "There is no fixed rule that could be stated for preventing chimney flue fires except by keeping the scot burn ed out," said Ed Miller, chief of the fire department last night. He had been asked to offer a rule for the ben efit of the public in preventing chim ney fires. This class of conflagra tions, which in the most cases is not at all dangerous, has been the source of half a dozen or more calls for the department in the past week. Upon arrival there is nothing for the depart ment to do but stand around while the soot burns out and then return to headquarters. The expense of these runs is not in the slight damage done once in awhile, but in the cost to the city of its fire department mainten ance. Miller eays there can be no rule stated, because none would apply in probably more than one case. "It Is just like with fires that are fires, there are no two that are to be at tacked exactly In the same way" said the chief. "However," he continued, "if a little care would be taken a great deal of good would be accom plished. It's the story of an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. There is practically no danger from the majority of flue fires. You see the soot collects in the chimney and when a spark falls it is ignited. It burns with a flash, similar to pow der and the only danger come in sparks from the chimney falling on tiie roof. It Is not hard to extinguish these without calling the department, If you have a good chimney it is best just to let the soot burn, whenever it wants to. If the heat passes through the bricks and scorches the wallpaper that is no sign the house is going to be on fire." The chief advises persons to inves tigate before turning in alarms of fire. as often it is found there is no work for the department after it has been called.

Users of natural gas in this city jnay be affected by the action of farm ers in Madison county, who are circu lating a petition to be presented to their representative in the state leg islature. The petition - would have a law enacted to prevent the pumping of natural gas from any wells of the state. The Richmond Natural Gas company obtains its supply from the field in Henry county and practically every bit of the gas is pumped. The proposed bill would make it not only unlawful to pump gas but to use any unnatural means to increase the flow. J

PREPARE FOR WAR Roosevelt Thinks It, Time to Establish Adequate Machinery. BILL ASKED OF CONGRESS. Washington, Dec. 9. An emergency volunteer army measure was advocat ed Tuesday by President Roosevelt in a special message sent to congress and the draft of the bill accompanying the message was introduced in the sen ate by Mr. Cullum. The president eays the bill is intended to strengthen the present law, which was placed on the statute book "piecemeal and hur riedly, partly on the. eve of the war with Spain and partly after hostilities had actually commenced." After de claring the present law to be faulty and wholly inadequate to a speedy and proper organization of a volunteer force, the president says the bill pro posed, which was drawn under super vision of the Chief of Staff of the Army, has the hearty approval of the war department. The message says further: "It is designed to afford the complete machinery by which, should we be confronted with a foreign war, the ex ecutive power could proceed at once to transform enthusiastic and patriotic citizens Into efficient ana" organized soldiers. Happily there is at present no cloud upon our horizon, but that very fact affords us the best opportu nity to proceed with deliberation and care in the preparation of laws ade quate and indispensable for our pos sible war needs.',' The proposed bill is elastic. Under its provisions a force of 2,000,XH men could be raised as well as one of 50,-000.

A dinner to celebrate the thirteenth wedding anniversary of a New York couple took place Friday, Nevember 13. In order to emphasize the disbe lief in hard-luck, superstition, the guests had to walk nnder a ladder to reach their places at the table; they found the salt cellars all overturned, the prongs of the forks pointing the wrong way, and many other things which come under the head of "un lucky." At each plate, however, there was placed, as an antidote, a four- leafed clover, and this and the un doubted happiness of the celebrants seemed to remove any fears as to the many hoodoos. f s I sPiAVYC -nrwwvo R r I LC Otreatm ent Li Lw C Cores Hemorrhoids, Ulcers, Itching, Bleeding Piles, Fistula and all Rectal Diseases.

Even Scottish Barmaids Are Abashed at Carrie's Talk Dundee, Scotland, Dec. 9 Carrie Nation raided several public houses here last night. At the first saloon she admonished the bartenders who told her to leave. Some physical force had to be used to get her out. Large crowds collected and followed the hatchet woman as she entered the dif ferent "pubs." Entering a fashiouable "pub." where barmaids are employed, she addressed them especially on the shame to wom anhood of their business and urged them to quit what she called their hellish life. The barmaids appeared to be much abashed. Eventually the manager politely insisted that Mrs. Nation withdraw. Thereupon Carrie left the high road for the poorer quarters, patting little barefooted children on the head on the way. By this time the crowd, which had grown dense and unwieldly, made a great rush "to get inside a public house which Carrie entered. The shouting and hustling became theratening and Mrs. Nation desisted from further crusading in the interest of public safety.
