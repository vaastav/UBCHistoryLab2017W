President Ilarrlson nominated David J. Hrewer, of Kansa as asso ciate justice of the supreme', court. He Is a nephew of Justice, Field, and a graduate of Yale college. Th Investigations into the New York dock department show that the politics of that city are far from be ing reformed They seem hopelessly con-Tammany-ted. Dtt. Journal. We see from the Detroit Journal of Monday evening that Gen. U. A. Alfrcr, commander-in-chief of the O. A. U., has appointed George P. Hum phrey, of this city, one of his aides-de-camp. Cheboygan Tribune. We understand now why the Demo crats want a blind man for chaplain of the house. . He can't see what they are up to; if he could he would change liis politics. Cashier Silcott saw the point. Det. Tribune. The secretary of war sees no good reason why the war department should place the flag at half-mast in honor of Jeff Davis. Tli loyal people of the North can see many good reasons why it should not. -Det. Tribune. Gov. Luce has returned from Cali fornia, and his first official act after coming home was to appoint ex-State Treasurer E. O. Grosvener, of Jones ville, a member of the board of con trol of the Flint school for the deaf and dumb. In place of Congressman Helknap, resigned. ; During iho last state general elec tion the headquarters of the Democrat io organization were located at Eavt Saginaw, and the Courier, of that place, was the party's official organ. Now the Courier is suing the state cen tral committee for $1,600 it has neg lected to pay for work and material fnrnlshed. There was one rascal who didn't wait to be turned out. Cashier Sil cott of the sergeant-at-arms' office of the house turned himself out, taking with him a big pile of government funds. He is supposed to be in Canada receiving the congratulations of other Democrats who are there for the same kind of health. Dtt. Tribune. Those who are always talking about the degeneracy of business and pre dicting financial disaster, won't be made very happy to read the state iuent that the cotton-goods manufact urers report that the year now closing lias been one of unparalleled prosper ity. The free traders will also bo sor ry ; but we can't help that. Of the 84,031 votes cast for governor in Mississippi the Democrat candidate received 84,045. Six votes were re turned for Gen. Chalmers, and if the men who voted for him know when they are well oil they ' will keep still about it. Anybody can see that they are open to the charge of trying to in cite another "negro insurrection." Dvt. Tribune. In declining to honor the memory of Jeff Davis m a former secretary of war, by a public display, Secretary Proctor behaved very sensibly. It would have stirred up bitter feeling for jjo useful purpose. The Cleveland administration might probably have been in power but for one or two "bad breaks," like the "rebel flag" order, the half-mast Hag for Tacob Thompson, and the harsh language of the pension vetoes. Dtt. Journal. The Minneapolis Tribune-Star, (Ind.) agrees with the Times regardiug the president's message. It says: "President Harrison's first message to congress is plain, vigorous and practi cal like a lawyer's brief. No attempt is made at fine .writing, and the docu ment hardly rises to eloquence in any portion. 13ut the recommendations are for the most part sensible." "Day City Times. The Grand Rapids Eagle hasn't yet learned that Silcott is a Itepubli can. He was one of those thieves the Cleveland administration did not turn out. Hut there are some things the Eagle will not permit itself to know. Dctmit Free Press. Silcott was a Democrat of the deep est dye that is to say, Ohio Demo crat. The Free Press is almost the only paper in the land that has not "permitted itself to know" this fact. Dtt. Journal. 'The! Ex-conftfderate veterans of New Orleans, are said to be much pleased at the remark of Capt. Jacob Gray of the Grand Army last Saturday night. He said that Jeff Davis had been a vatuabla soldier and an honest purs man, and if it were agreed to have his body carried by veterans he should be proud to be one of them." He should be kicked out of every Post of the Grond Army or Veteran's Association, with which he is connect ed, as one of tho precepts of the order Is Loyally. The remains of Jeilerson Davis, the arch traitor, and leader in the late re bellion were deposited in their last resting place, yesterday. It would have been better for the country, of which he was not even a citizen, being disfranchised, that he did not die on the saiuo scaffuld with his faithful henchman, the brutal Win. If Satan does not give him a warm welcome, as a reward for causing ihe death of from 150,000 to 200,000 of our brave boyw, who wore the blue, by starvation, we will miss our guess. Democrats all over the land are vieing with each other as to who can pay the body the most attention. The people of the South, without exception, are grieving as much over the death of their late babbler of treason as was shown by the people of the North at the death of Lincoln. But as he was the Apos tle of treason, free trade and all the crimes in the political oategory, which are believed and carried out in the South, his loss to them from the wail of woe with which the dally pa pers are filled, his death must have cre ated a void that Mills, Vest or McCoy cannot fill.' The party is the same the couutrv over, for a convict sent to the penitentiary for forging election re turns, or fraud of any kind in regard to elections is no sooner released than the party appoints or elects him to of fice at the first opportunity. The greater the crime the greater the rev erence displayed toward them by the democracy. The Democrats of Augusta, Ky., be came so enthusiastia over the success of the democrats in the recent state elections that they thought the "con federate brigadiers wer in the saddle" and expressed their exuberance of joy by hoisting the rebel flag. Avalanche. Which end of our double headed contemporary is responsible for the above asinine statement getting into print we, ot course, have no means of knowing. We do know however, that it is basely tatee and have no doubt that the writer of it knows it. Put it is to such malicious lying as this that the defenders of a robber tariff are re duced in order to divert the attention of the people from the one great issue which presents itself to the American people today. That of tariff reform. Democrat. The above article, which the Demo crat credits to the 

AVALANCHK, was clipped from an exchange, but the compositor forgot to give due credit. As to the falsity of it, let others judge.. The flag was torn down the next duy by members of the Grand Army of the Uepublic, which is a matter of record. We have seen democrats in the North tear down the U. S. flag and hoist that of the confederacy, and the history of the late war is full of such incidents, but that was nothing for sneaking cop perheads to do, when not opposed by those who wore the blue. The free trade papers are continual ly howling about the tariff being a tax, and this in face of the fact that experience has cleirly proven that it is not a tax. They call it a relic of the r, a war tax, and demand that it should be removed. There is no question that internal revenue is a tax, neither can it be denied that it is a tax that is paid by the home con sumer. Since G rover Cleveland was elected president the people of this country have been directly taxed to the extent of $000,000,000. The Re publicans of the last congress wanted to remove a large portion of this war tax, for it is a war tax, but the Demo crats would not hear to it. They in sisted that the reduction In revenue must be made by reducing the tariff and they fought for the Mills bill, which cut and slashed the commodities affecting northern industries, but carefully preserved the protective feature of such articles as the south produced. Tho internal revenue is a tax that is constantly growing. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 18S5, the internal revenue amounted to 112,498,723. For the year ending ihe SO, of last June, it amounted to 130, 894,434, an increase in five years of $18,395,709. This immense tax af fords no protection to any industry, does not enhance the price of labor one cent and yet the Democratic free traders are opposed to its removal. Cheboygan Tribune. In the age of rush and rabid exertion for the flesh pots of office, would it not be well for the young men of the party In power to reflect upon the ben efits the couutry now derives from the grand exertion made by those who heard the whistle of bullets and the shriek of shells in the days of long ago. Put yourself in the place of men who suffer from wounds and disease, caused by a hcrrible war for Old Glory, and to unite a country torn by civil strife, and imagine how you would feel if bravery was not considered in a candidate for office and young fresh workers were given the advantage over you and appointed to fat positions, imagine if you can, the worst torture a man oan endure in this world and you cannot give expression in words to the anguish and pain which many of the boys in blue, have endured for a quar ter of a century. The soldiers will soon be too old to do duty, and it is just and right that now they be given oc cupations suitable to their ability Don't crowd. Your turn will come you deserve, by-and by, one-hundredth part as mnch as they are entitled to now. Put your sous nearer to China and bear the rumbling. Coffee Cooler 

WASHINGTON LETTER IFrom Our Regular Correspondent! , - Washington, Dec. 6, '89. The President left here today for a short western trip. After visiting Chicago, he will go to Indianapolis and attend to some Important private business before returning to Washing ton. The Senate has, by lot, determined the length of tha terms of the six new Senators as follows: Washington Senator Squire expires March 3, 1891, and Senator Allen March 3, 1893; South Dakota-Senator Moody March 3, 1891 and Senator Pettlgrew March 3, 1893; North Dakota-Senator Pierce, March 3, 1S91, and Senator Casey March 3. 1893. The terms of the Montana Senators will not be fixed until they occupy their seats. Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas has been nominated by the President to be associate Justice of the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the late Justice Stanley Matthews,' of Ohio. Judge Brewer is a nepjiew of Justice Stephen J. Field of the Supreme Court; he has been since 1881 United States Judge for the Eighth circuit of Kansas. He has fill ed a number of important positions in Kansas, judicial and otheiwlse, and has always been a popular official. The nomination is highly pleasing to Senator Ingalls and Plumb, and in fact to everybody, with the possible exception of several disappointed can didates and their immediate friends. Justice Miller, over whose circuit Judge Brewer has presided for the last five years, says he considers him one of the ablest judges now on the bench. When Justice Brewer takes his seat on the bench with his Uucle Justice Field, it will be the first time in the history of the court that two of the contemporary justices haye been so nearly related. Owing to the organization of the House on Monday the President's message was not read to Congress un til Tuesday. The message has been well received by everybody except a handful of Southerners who profess to see in its plain statement of the con dition of political affairs in the South cause for alarm. The message is strictly conservative, both in tone and in its recommendations, being thereby iu striking contrast to the last dicta torial documents sent from the White House to Congress. Mr. Harrison evidently intended thij mesflage to be confined to its Btrlct constitutional limits, that of informing Congress of the state of the country. Its recom mendations are in every instance what has been approved by the republican party. Upon those things on which there are different opinions in the party in which he has presented the facts without recommendation. It is document that has greatly disap pointed the democrats because It fur nishes them with no ammunition. Next in importance to the Presi dent's message is Secretary Wiodom's annual report to Corgros, which was made publio on Wednesday. Mr. Windom covers the entire financial field and furnishes one of the most in teresting as well as important reports of the kind ever made. It-presents a plan for the satisfactory solution of the silver problem, which Mr. Windom believes will be accepted by both sil ver and gold men. Space prevents further notice of the report, but it should be carefully read by every in telligent citizen of the country. It may be obtained' by addressing Sec retary Windom. The organization of the House was attended by a little circumstance that shows the danger which will constant ly menace the majority during the ses sion. Alter need uaa neen elected Speaker, McPherson Clerk; Holmes Sergeant-at-Arms ; Adams Doorkeeper, and Wheat Postmaster, Representat ive Henderson, as chairman of the re publican caucu. nominated Rev. C. B. Ramsdell for Chaplin. Represent ative Cheadle of Indiana, bolting the caucus nomination, moved to strike out the name of Mt. Ramsdell and substitute that of Dr. Milburn, the blind preacher who was Chaplain of the last House. Mr. Cheadle was sup ported outright by three republicans Moore, of New Hampshire; Lehblack, of New Jersey, and Ewart of North Carolina and enough refained from voting to elect vr. Aiuourn, wno re ceived 1G6 votes to Mr. Ramsdell's 155, the democrats voting solidly for Mil burn. This is of itself a small thing, but if the party caucus can be success fully bolted in small things, there Is nothing to prevent the same thing be ing done when something important is at stake. Secretary Noble has gone to St. Louis, his former home, to look after some private matters. He is expected back early next week. The onlj evidence of sorrow for tho death of Jefl DatIs, an shown at Wash ington, Is a broad band of black cloth uncross tho front of Mrs. Fairfax's res idence. Mrs. Fairfax during tne war was a devoted friend of the southern cause, and frequently passed the lines to give Information and supplies to the enemy. It was due to Mrs. Fair fax that the union army so frequently found itself anticipated In Important movements, but nhe was not discover ed until the custom of hanging spies had fallen into what a recent reformer called innocuous desuetude. Mr Fairfax is having a real quiet time In her grief, and is getting considerable notoriety out of It. Dct Journal NEW
