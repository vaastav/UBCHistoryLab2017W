The loss will be immense. That not one member of the crew oi sixteen persons, including a chamber maid who could not swim, was drowned seemed most strange and the rescues were most thrilling. Miss Peters, the chambermaid, made a leap for life as the immense tow poised on the edge of the falls.

President Roosevelt's message to Congress was delivered at noon today. The Pi*esi dent sa\s: Corporation!. I am in no sense hpstile to corpora tions. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combina tion will be not only useless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to *t. y, just as the trades union has come to stay. Fach can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply cheeked where it acts against law and justice. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state ac tion. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex tensive witft the field -work of the cor porationsthat is, by the national gov ernment. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the na tional goyern:" ment of the constitution. The laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often In showing that the states have no power in the matter tban that the na tional government has power so that there at present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an in terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a so\ereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assent the sovereignty of the na tional government by affirmative nc-lj" tion. This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the Iaw-, making bodies, and all that propose ^mitsamm^smorMmmvtmmssi^^sim^immmx^i^^^sr^^' *%$&- Tfg* Pfll'F*W'^tS is to meet the changed conditions in orgamzailonnad such manner as wUJ prevent tne com-1 monwealth abdicatmg the powers has always possessed, not only this conn-1 try. but also in England before and, since this country became a separate Datlon state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively present the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re bates in every .shape and form. This' power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, so that it can be effectively exercised I when the need arises. In my judgment, the most important' provision which such law IioulU con tain is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought 1 before it whether a given rate pre scribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and If it is found to be unreason able and unjust then, after full investi gation of the complaint, to pre&cribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to gothe maximum A ^s tiiiiniiiiMiurr-- -Tmf

I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. It is worth while considering whether it would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for r.t least twice the value of the rebate. This would .help stop what is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demor alizing and are used as rebates. ,.J Private Car Lines. i All private car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges and the like should be expressly put under the su pervision of the interstate commerce commission or some similar body so far as rates and agreements practical ly affecting rates are concerned. A re bate in icing charges or in mileage or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common earners. Only in 'this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected.
