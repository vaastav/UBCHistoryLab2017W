If It tears down, it can also build op. It earnes at onoe both a banner of blood and a banner of progress. BUenily, and by the operation of great social laws, the tidal wares of a new life are being poarei aeross the continent; and when the nation wakes out of this ter rible incnbas of war, new oonditiona of Society will exist. Tae whole population of the South is divided Into three elasees : mean whiles, mall farmers or yeomen and planters or eaivalry. And below the bottom, the ne gro, are the mean whites oonposing three eights of the population of the Southern Stales. .The social and moral eondiiion of this elaas is pitiable in the extreme. They manage loeke out a life of ignorance and poverty by stealing from the planta tions of the ohiralry whatever corn, ba ton, tobaoco or cotton they can lay their hands oa. Their homes are Indian wig wams, hats with one room, through the ravines of which the winds whistle end ths rains pour. Their moral condition is of a very inferior species. Brother Inter marry with sisters, and husbands are fre quently known to sell their wires for sn Id rifle or a keg of " red eye." The second clans are in the possession of a little land and sometimes own one slave, With whom they plow aod ohop, dig and sow. They take no newspapers; six Tenths oan neither read nor write. In Tennessee alone are such things as free ashjols known and they were doled out by he ohiralry with moon grumbling. Their ohief political knowledge Is derived from the specious pro-slavery speeches which they hear at barbecues. Bdt a new era has been ushered In by this war. ' The million soldiers whom we Bare seat into the field are missionaries to enlighten and instruct these men. They or ueini educated by them to a sense of their degrtdation and ignoranoe. This prooess must go on for years to come. The tidal wares of population which hare boon urging westward their riohly freight- ad treasures, are to be turned Southward Tar the magnificent farming lands of Ten lessee, Alabama and Mississippi. Tens of thoasands of soldiers hare already se lected the spot of land on whioh, with gen nine Yankee instiot, they pitched their UnU. ' Invariably on their return Norths da they bear testimony to the inexhausti ble wealth of the Southern soil, to its ge nial climate and magnificent soenery. If onoe the laner, orer-worked and effete plantations are put nnder the thorough cultivations of Northern farmers, the South will be regenerated with a new in' daitry and aew social institutions. Han dreds of thoasands from the busy, crowded aires of Europe will find a welcome asy lam in s land whenoe they were repelled by the overshadowing iniquity of human bondage. Westward the star ot empire takes its way, must for a fow years give nlaos to the aew Southward impulse of population and civilisation. With ail that is said against the Uni ted States br ariatoc ratio writers and speakers abroad, is is still a faet that, even In the midst of oar great war, this oountry if regarded by the oppressed of Europe as the only refuge and place of safety. They are aoming to our shores by thousands they find here homes, bread and work in abundance for all who come ; schoo's for their children ; a share in the Government as soon as they are naturalised, and a fair ekaaoe to make their way In the world. Let them come; ths war Is opening up naif a continent, and the most, fertile parts of it, to free workingmen , wo have room for the half of Europe; we want all who oan work and who are sober, virtu ous, industrious. Hare are homes and lib arty for all." The preliminary stage) of this new dis pensation, we are already passing through The whirlwind of war is making our pop nlation to seethe throughout all its depths. While onr Northern, newspaper reading soldiers are carrying the toroh of civilis tlon to the deluded whites aod enslaved blacks of tne South, the South is also pour ing Its exiles to the North. Already a half million of them hate sought a temporary refuge In the North. For months they have been finding their way along all the lines of travel. They come by sea, from very port at which vessels might touoh by the Mississippi; by the Cumberland and Tenneesee by the Nashville Rail road : throurh the mountain passes of Western Virginia into Ohio and Pennsyl vania ; through South-Western Missonri from Arkansas and Texas; across ths Chesapeake and Potomac ; by every tortu ous rente, through every wind and weather, hare aome the negro, the anti-slavery man, the loyalist, the business men of the South. - Bat still more. The prisoners of war taken, numbering In all over one hundred thousand, who have been brought North, will not return without new ideas of Borthern life. They have seen the land lowing with milk and honey ; they have felt for a moment the inspiration of free schools, a-free press and jubilant, joy ous eiTilizalion. As ths ooaan currents traverte the sea n all direction, the waters of the tropios blending with and assimilating to those of the X or ih Sea, so Is Southern society to be reconstructed anew, civilisation ushered In. ' About the Weather. A weather-wise Englishman prophesies a stormy Christmas. He broaches a the ory that fifty-four years constitute a oom plete cycle for the prevailing winds, and that la each snoh oyele there are three periods each of four years of deficiency of mat wind, and the same number of ex eats of east wind. 1896-1809, if wo may believe this British Merriam, formed a period of exoess of west wind, and so do 1880-188. With 1864 will begin a pe riod of eioeM of east wind. The "Democratic" Tight Rope. It is seldom a nation is favored with the performances of sash politloel acrobats as hare been catering to the public for the past two weeks in Washington. Monsieur Blondon Is totally eclipsed and most here after hang his diminished head. Ths gen tlemen who are sow figuring so grace fully before the nation are by no meant depts in the artt of vaulting, tumbling, gyrating and equilibrating. They are mostly green hands; and henee their per ilous suspension oa wirs In mid air, both tragic and comic. They are endeavoring to accomplish a very neat trick, however, in all of their preliminary movements. It is nery desirable for the sake of plunder to wield the opposing elements in Congress and hence the incessant diplomacy by which the poor "Peaoe Demoorasy" are to be lassoed or driven into the corral of the "War Democracy." Fernando, with white choker, in order to give due spiritual effeot to his mission of love, is represented as sitting In sullen demureness at seeing the bold summer- setting, which he, as the chief apostle of the new gospel of peace, Is expected to do, until, at length, at the eleventh hour, see ing the baton of power departing from his nerveless grasp, his occupation almost gone, he concluded to astonish everybody by bis skill in weathering the new polit ical Cape Horn. Bat he does It with ad mirable easel Together with his illus trious compatriots who prayed for and propheoied a speedy coming of ths King dom of Peace, he gees in fur ewpplyinf "the meant and men necessary to a prose- cation of ths war." Behold these " democrats 1" What may our eye snot yet see ! We live ,in .an age of wixardryl A few short weeks ago these men piped before the people to the tune of Peace, and begged the people to danoe. The trumpet horn of u arbitrary arrests" blew load and long throughout the land, beseeohlng the defenders of the " Constitution as it is, and the Union as it was," to pat their shoulders against the tumbling pillars on which Freedom's fair temple is builded ; but the dear people wouldn't dance, nor lend their shoulders. Now mark you how wise these " honor able" men have grown. If yo will not hearken unto the dulcet strains of Peaoe on earth and ood will to men," we will lead ye say these venerable acrobats, In to the sulphurous paths of war. We will nnveil grim Moloch to your gate and ye shall bow down and worship him. Bat, seriously, the hypoorisy of these men it sickening. Ate these men to play npon public credulity at so cheap a rate? Is human gullibility profound enough to swallow the new tactics of the democratic party leaders? Already the recoil has taken place and the democracy will be di Tided. Many of them are too sincerely for Peaoe-at-eny prioe to be hoodwinked into any new war policy. Alas I that we should have no better tale to tell abroad of American statesmanship. Are our publio men so bereft of all senti ments of honor that they will belie their faith for their parly? "How can you hope," says the New York World, to the Pease Demooratt in Congress, " to elect President unless yon unite with us?" The Refutation of Bishop Hopkins. Ths Loyal Publication Society, 8C3 Broadway, has Just published an answer by Professor Henry Drisler, of Columbia College, to Bishop Hcpkin's "Bible View of Slavery," whioh we can recommend for sreneral circulation among the class of people who are likely to have been affected by the sophistries and the unfounded as sertions of the Bishop. Professor Drisler completely exposes the absurdity of the arguments by which Bishop Hopkins at tempts to justify slavery oat of the Bible; he proves this pro slavery Bishop to be ig norant of the Scriptures, lllogioal and bigoted. News from the Spirit Land to the Peace Democracy. The Crisis publishes this week the second of a series of supernatural revela tions to the people of America. The author is an old man in Missouri onto whom the angel speaks. The revelation Is copy .righted. We re gard this as very unkind In ths angel ; the most unkind cut of alL The revelation In the estimation of the Crisis shows in startling accuracy the aw ful progress hell ward the natioa is mak ing. Of this new revelator " whom the angel called" Obed Keder, (very good name, eh ?) Colonel Medary thus sweetly saith : On ths faith of a man we are led to be lieve that this old fteaUeman passed through some remarkable state of mind, which developed those impressions, with a most faithful type of the sorrows and hor rors to which otir people would be doomed, by ths labors of a foul priesthood, of bloody lips, of wicked and revengeful hearts, and politioal knives rioting in hu man gore nnder their lead, lash and, direction. Arming the Slaves. The Mobile Advertiser ' takes on" ter ribly at the arming of colored men and their organisation into Federal regiments. It proposes retaliation as follows : ' Some hold that it is not safe, In any event, to employ our Blares as soldiers, and that scoha proceeding would be incompat ible with the maintenance of the institu tion itself.- The answer to this is that Yankee suooees is death to the institution, as well as to its masters, and that any peril should be oonfronted to avoid it. So that it is a question of necessity a question of a choice or ems at least. We bold that it is not only legitimate but a safe and pro- dent policy to fight an enemy whoso pur pose is our ram, with every wespon which God and Nature has placed in our hands with fire and water, with steel and powder and ball, and with oar household servants and plantation hands, if they prove neces sary to avert from ns the supreme calam ity of subjugation. If they send the negro to confront our sons and brothers in battle, why not, if necessity requires, meet them with the same material?" December Flowers. How beautiful and abundant are tha Sowers which adorn ihe gardona of New Orleans just now I Were a Northener sud denly translated here with no knowledge that ha was going South Instead of Jtoria he would imagine himself to have slept till June and then to have awoke in tha garden of Eden.- Howtweetthe fragrance they shed npon the air. If there are no other reasons for loving this sunny land of oars, it is enough that here oar roses are indeed perpetual and tha year begins and ends in bloom. It is the land of tha evergreen the chosen horn of tha Queen af Flowers. if. 0. Picagvau. Phillips Message and Proclamation. On Tuesday evening last Wendell Phil lips made his to-ealled criticism on the President's Message and Proclamation. We lay before our readers the mrst Im portant passages to let them see that Wen dell is not yet satisfied. HE 

PROTESTS AGAINST THE PROCLAMATION. one people en ter my protest against the proclamation, and to ask of you to demand more of the government than that document covers. (Ominous silence), cay not that I am do ing injustice to Mr. Lincoln. As my old professor at the law college nsed to say, ttentleraen, 1 know my profession so wen that I need not blush when I say no to a question that I cannot answer. THE PRESIDENT CAN AFFORD TO HAVE HIS HIS FAULTS TOLD. Bo Mr. Lincoln has done each service In this rebellion, has carved for a niche so high in the world's history, that he can well afford to hare all bis faults told. Applause. TWO KINDS OF STATESMEN. There are two kinds of men in states menship. One is the servant of the peo ple and the other is the moulder or me people. To ths first class belongs President. THE 

SOUTH A BRAVE PEOPLE. The South are brare people. Four years ago 1 said to von under tnis rooi, me 8 juth is now coward, and you laughed at me. fou know now that, however deluded the sonthdoes believe a lie and is willing to fight for it. The last forlorn refuge of such a people is a bloody fight. When in the eighth century the Musselmen poured orer the Alps lour hundred thousand strong Charles Matrel, when France could not muster bat fifty thousand men to meet hi ,!!, "Q'ntlemen, there is no France but what your feet corer" Nerved by such despair they hurled the crescent bank Into tbe Mediterranean and saved Europe and Christianity. The South fights with suoh a motive and such a faith. THE WAR NOT YET ENDED. Na. the war is not enied. It does not touch Its end, and yet its end is certain and we may read it in the light of our own power and our own perseverance. Ths Union is to be reconstruateu wuu cement that laughs all interference tn scorn. Applause 1 Daniel weDstersaia the oement of the Union was the FugitWo Slave act. Sin never cemented anything but evil. CEMENT OF UNION TO BE THE MUTUAL RESPECT OF THE TWO SECTIONS. The cement of this Union is to be the mutual respect of the seotions, bred of that blood which has mingled on bravely contested fields. The South thought of Yankee as one who knew only how oheat. She met him at Chattanrcga and changed her mind. The North thought the South as only gaeoonade and empty vaunt. She has struggled with her four years and learned to respect her sincerity if not her intelligence, and out of that mutual respeot Is to grow a Union as In destructible and indissoluble as the granite that holds up the continent. Applause. There is not the fear. As I said before (as Mr. Lincoln shows it) it is here he North th question of how muoh and how far we will go. THE CONDUCT OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. When the war broke out England as unit hated us. There is no other word that will express her feelings. Closely allied, kindred by olose blood relationship, we trod on her heels. We over passed her on some points. She could not bear the rivalry nor the conquest, 8he felt it as close as relatives always feel the success of their kindred. l'ou will always find safe to abuse a man to his cousin. (Laughter.) England, cur cousin, hated us; and when the London Times looked across the water and said the babble had burst, she meant thank God. (Laughter.) But she looked a little longer, and out that bareted bnbble came seven hundred thousand armed men on the baoks of the Potomac (applause) and the heart that hated us, began to fear as. She said this broken fragment of a people starts up great military power. Boecher is eloquent; but Vioksburg and Chattanooga, and Par rot guns, sending two hundred ponnd balls seven miles, are more terribly elo quent than he. (Applause.) Then, Franoe, the Emperor of France is a long headed man. He does not send ten thousand men by dribbles auxiously keeping alive the march ot Mexican invasion for nothing. He has a keen eight and a determined purpose ahead. He means, oat of the diffi culties of this nation, to make a serious ef fort to arreBt the march of self govern ment and the astute head that sits the throne is our determined enemy. Now, I would not answer Francs solely with the beat of the drum and the noise of rifles on the banks of the Bio del Norte. Oh, not This continent Is self-oonBeorated by the ages to the full and free experiment self government That is our claim our just claim. Europe is trying ths experi ment of thrones. Let her. She has a right to try it without our interference. But Franoe plants the germ of aristocracy and thrones on the soil of the American conti nent, my answer to her is, this reconstruct ed Union, holding out its right hand, with fifty millions of dollars for Garibaldi, say ing, take possession of Rome, and one hundred millions for the republioans Paris, saying, make Napoleon sit uneasy; and one hundred millions for Germany, saying, make kings tremble I would an swer Napoleon with his own weapons Europe leaves America to Republicanism, welL If she interferes, we interfere (ap plause) and the right hand of our resistance is clssped in brotherhood with the radicals of Europe to upset every throne on the oontinent (Applause) That is foreign policy. Now, look South. I said Lincoln does not fear the South. THE CONSTITUTION A BARRIER. Now the lesson of to-day is: the consti tution to be thrown op as a barrier. And that brings me to the second point of the proclamation of Mr. Lincoln. The natur al law, wbioh would have saved as, even without an amendment of the constitution, he ('he President) seta aside. He sets aside the Confiscation aot. He says all slave holders, excepting about seven hundred, may return to their estates, and the State may then oome back on the vote of one tenth into tha Union. What does this mean? Every man who knows anything knows that land dictates government. yon hold land, every man his own farm, is a democracy; you need not go aud ask the statute book. If a few men own the territory it is an oligarchy; you need not ask history. - Thirty thousand families own England; it is an oligarchy. ETery Massachusetts farmer owns his house, and Jefferson Davis, multiplied by millions, could aot make it anything but a democ racy. ' Daniel Webster said, in 1820, tha the revolution in France has crumbled up the nobles' estates into small farms: the throne mast either kill them oat or they will kill oat the throne. Every man knows that,
