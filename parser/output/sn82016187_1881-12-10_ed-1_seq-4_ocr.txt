Some of our subscribers do not seem to under stand the reason "why they receive sample copies of The National Teibune in addition to their regular number. To all such we would say that the extra copies are sent for distribution among such of their friends as are likely to subscribe to such a paper. We cannot write personally to our many friends throughout the country who have done us substantial favors by sending in subscriptions, clubs, &c, and therefore beg that they will ac cept this as an acknowledgment of our appreci ation of their many kindnesses. The New York Herald of Wednesday says: "The Porte will send a commission to America to institute reforms." We suggest that the Turk ish commission begin its work in the Herald's editorial sanctum. The Stalwarts in Congress deserve great credit in 'electing the adolescent Gospeller, Power, as their chaplain. They have shown themselves rich in the qual ity which he entirely lacks, viz: Christian charity. This becomes apparent when it is re membered that Power was the individual who, in a sermon preached in this city July last, charged the Stalwarts, by direct implication, with the murder of General Garfield. The New York Herald characterizes the Ar rears of Pension Act as "a corrupt, degrading system which enables any adventurer who chooses to make a raid upon the Treasury to enter his name upon the pension list and take from month to month and from year to year Government money which does not belong to him." If the editor of the Herald does not look up the laws relating to pensions he will lose his reputation as a first-class liar and fall back to his proper level that of a common fool. TnosE of onr patrons who receive an extra copy of The National Tribune, will please hand it to some soldier friend. The New York Herald lias given us enough of its clap-trap regarding pension matters ; a little common sense will now be acceptable.. But we have little if any reason to hope for any favorable change in the tone of the money kings' organ. It has too much at stake. Meantime, however, we take occasion to say that the pension laws themselves give the lie to the assertions con tinually being made by the enemies of the ex soldiers to the effect that "any adventurer who chooses to make a raid upon the Treasury" under the Arrears or any other pension act can easily do so. The Herald and other journals of its ilk know such to be the case. Hence when they make the charge indicated above they lie willfully and maliciously in their endeavors to rob the ex soldiers of their just dues. We "desire to invite attention to the advertise ment of John P. Clark & Son, real estate agent?, of Mexico, Missouri, to be found on the eighth page of this issue. The firm is one which we can recommend in every respect. The senior member is one of the earliest settlers of Audrain county, was judge of the court for a dozen years, and both himself and his son are of the highest standing for integrity and business capacity. We advise those desiring homes in the West to cor-' respond with them before looking elsewhere. ImwJmiiottali rjvi J","0' rry.vj ! The President's Message. President Arthur's message, the material por tions of which we give upon another page, is a voluminous document far more so than was gen erally anticipated. Its general effect is somewhat disappointing. It is historical and statistical, but does not possess the qualities of a great State paper. Its chief merit may be said to consist in the variety and number of subjects which it includes. Nothing appears to have been omitted. So much as relates to the condition of the finances is well worthy of careful consideration, inasmuch as it furnishes in a condensed form a correct statement of our monetary affairs. The President's views upon the subject of taxation and revenue, however, demand special attention because of the recommendations which he makes in that connection, viz : First. That all internal revenue taxes, except those upon tobacco in its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors except also the special tax upon the manu facturers of and dealers in such articles be abolished. Second. The repeal of the law imposing a stamp tax upon matches, proprietary articles, playing cards, checks and drafts, and also the law by which banks and bankers are assessed upon their capital and deposits. These two recommendations, except it may be so far as they relate to the abolition of the tax upon matches and proprietary articles, are calculated to satisfy only the rich, and are clearly and solely in the interests of the money power of the country. The laboring and agri cultural classes will not be benefited one iota by any such legislation as that suggested. It is true that under our present system of revenue there is a large surplus each year, but to a cer tain extent such surplus is merely a fiction. The Government now owes millions of dollars, long past due, to the ex-soldiers of the country which ought to be paid, and at once. Owing to niggardly appropriations for doing the work in the past thousands and thousands of just claims are on file in the various Departments awaiting the settlement that ought to have been made years ago. For instance, take the President's own figures regarding Pensions. He says: "There are now pending for settlement 265,575 original pension claims, 227,040 of which were filed prior to July 1, 1880." And of this vast number he estimates that only about 15 per cent, will prove worthless, leaving 193,000 good claims for consideration, and these, he says, no new business intervening, " could be acted upon in a period of six years " with the present force. In other words, soldiers who have had their claims on file for ten years or more must wait six years longer for a settle ment, unless the working force of the Pension Office be increased. We think that before any steps are taken to reduce the taxes upon those amply able to bear the small amount required of each that a full and honest settlement should be had with the Nation's most worthy creditors the ex-soldiers and sailors, their widows and orphans. But such settlement calls for what seems to be a vast amount of money say, in round numbers, 235.000,000 for pensions. What if it does? the obligation to pay remains the same. And the sum required is not so very large after all when we come to consider the value which the Govern ment received in advance for it. The country is amply able to pay it to the last dollar if proper legislation could be had in the premises. That this is so may be seen by glancing st the finan cial statement included in his message. From that it will appear that during the fiscal year ending June 30 last interest upon the public debt to the amount of $82,508,741.18 was paid to the bond holders alone: and that after liquidating current expenses for carrying on the Government and paying some $50,000,000 of pension (nearly half of which was in shape of arrears long over due), there remained in the Treasury a surplus of over$100,000,000 the greatest portion of which was devoted to the reduction of the debt. We do not complain, however, at this showing: our ground of objection to the President's recom mendation is that, while he takes steps to relieve one, and that the richest class of the Nation's creditors, he makes no suggestion looking toward the relief of the other and poorer classes. He seems to have absorbed the ideas promulgated by the moneyed interests of the country through their organs, that the moneys to be paid out for pensions are benefactions only, and if not with held should be given grudgingly. More than this, his language is indicative that he is inclined to agree with those who oppose the payment of pensions in toto, that a large percentage of claims filed are fraudulent. But we shall take occasion to refer to this matter hereafter, and, for the pres ent, will only add that we expected better things of President Arthur in this respect. Upon the topic of civil service the President follows in the main the well-worn pathway of ex-President Hayes, and his views will prove equally futile when he attempts to carry them out. The country is not yet prepared for any such departure from the established usage, nor will it be so long as we have a Chief Magistrate elected by the people. Passing on, we think that the subject of our merchant marine has received the attention which the importance of the interests involved demands. The President strongly recommends adequate appropriations, and relegates the ques tion to Congress, asking for its consideration. That portion of the message which treats of the Presidential office simply submite a Series of interrogatories which were propounded upon all sides during the disability of the late President Garfield. The importance of an early solution of the matters involved in these questions is beyond controversy, and in bringing them thus pointedly before Congress the President has done wisely. Whether his suggestion that they have early con sideration will be acted upon, is another matter, of which we are not competent to speak. In closing our brief review of the leading fea tures of his message we accord to President Ar thur full credit for whatever it contains that is really valuable, and have endeavored to make an allowance for the peculiar circumstances under which he has been forced to act. We are, never less, obliged to reiterate the opinion expressed at opening, that despite all merit which it contains, his first State papei is, on the whole, disappoint ing, and will be fouad especially so with the sol dier element of the country, whose interests we have most at heart. Puck's Idiotic Editor. And now Puck has taken up its arms (pen and pencil) against thq pensioners of the United States. It says: "According to Government statistics, five thousand patriots, more or less, laid down their lives or various detachable parts of their anatomies in the war of 1812. From the same source we learn that 26,000 or about 26, 000 legal representatives of these patriots are how drawing pensions from the United States Treasury. "Now, as there is but one pension to a patriot, these figures have a paradoxical look at the first glance. But when we examine the matter closely, we find a simple explanation. "There is but ne pension to a patriot, but a man even a patriot and his wife are one. There is, therefore, one pension to each patriot's wife. Now, if a patriot has five or six wives, and each one is merely a cipher prefixed to the masculine unit, it follows that the multiplicity of wives in nowise affects the oneness of the combination. Hence, a patriot and his wives being one, and there being one pension to every patriot, there is certainly one pension to every wife of a patriot. This logic is guaranteed. We have had it revis ed by an insanity expert." The foregoing is but a sample of the many at tacks now being made upon the Government pensioners by the ex-rebels and money kings of the country. The insinuation made that of the 26,000 persons drawing pensions on account of the war of 1812, the larger proportion of them are frauds is just what might be expected from the class of fools to which the editor of Puck belongs. And the reasoning adpted to estab lish the ground taken is up to the usual average of idiocy for which the'editor of the sheet re ferred to is noted. Has the editor of Puck been possessed of sufficient capacity to understand, and a desire to tell the truth, he would have investigated the matter of which he speaks, and, in doing so, would have found that the whole militia force raised during the war of 1812-15 was 31, 210 officers, 440,412 men; total, 471,622. The number of officers and men in the Regular Army during the same period cannot be actually ascer tained, but aggregated in July, 1812, 6,686 ; in February, 1813, 19,036 ; in September, 1814, 38, 186; and in February, 1815, 33,424 men. He would have found, also, that under the act of Congress of February 14, 1871, all survivors of the war of 1812 who served 60 days became en titled to pension regardless of disability incurred in service; and that under the same act the widow of any such soldier became entitled to the same rate, $8 per month, providing she was mar ried to him prior to the Treaty of Peace, Febru ary 17, 1815. The asinine editor would have further found that under act of Congress of March 9, 1878, every survivor of the war of 1812 who served for the period of 14 days, or was in an engagement with the enemy, became entitled to pension at the rate of 8 per month, and that the widows of such sol diers became entitled regardless of the dates when they were married to them respectively. The war of 1812 closed sixty-six years ago. A large number of the men who served in that war were comparatively young. A man who enlisted at the age of 25 in 1812 would have been only 45 in 1830. Had he at that age married a woman of say 30 years of age his widow surviving him at the present time would be but 76 years old, and entitled to pension as a matter of course. The foregoing is gives simply as an illustration from which any fair minded person orni see that 26,000 is by no means a large number of pension ers to represent an army of nearly 500,000 men. So much for the argument of Puck's crank edi tor. By the by, we wonder where that editor and the proprietors of Puck were during the last war ? The ex-soldiers and sailors of the country are, as a class, honorable men, and there are- fewer dishonest men among them when' dealing with the Government in proportion to their num bers than among any other class of citizens. 4 Those who. arc endeavoring to defraud the Treasury are men like the Herald's chief, for instance, who had neither the patriotism nor courage to assist in putting down the rebellion. Now he sets his paper like a snarling cur upon the men who underwent the sufferings and did the fighting Bah ! What Might Have Been. " When we think of the extravagant propor tions of the Pension Arrears Act and the enor mous sums that must be paid to pretenders under its provisions it is useful to consider what might have been possible if ex-President Hayes had shown the courage necessary to veto an accepted and conspicuous public swindle. The effect of this act, which was signed by President Hayes in order to strengthen the Eepublican canvass in a pending election, will be to take from the Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars in prop erty. Now if this amount of money let us say three hundred millions which is given under the law to claim agents and lobbies and bogus soldiers, could have been devoted to purposes of national improvement, what might we have gained? This sum properly expended would have revived our navy; given us ships which could have encountered the best iron-clads of Italy or France ; opened the Mississippi River ; cleaned out Hell Gate ; established forts at the saliant points of our American dominions ; con structed a new railroad across the continent; subsidized twenty lines of steamers instead of the one which Mr. Blaine is anxious to see estab lished to Brazil, and founded a national univer sity at Washington. Instead of these great na tional improvements we have a corrupt, degrading system, which enables any adventurer who chooses to make a raid upon the Treasury to enter his name upon the pension list and take from month to month and from year to year Gov ernment money which does not belong to him." Editorial in New York Herald. The Editor of the Herald is evidently looking forward to his future state. But it won't do, Mr.' Editor. The Government will never rob the sol diers to clear out "Hell Gate " for you. Too big a job, and, besides, behind the "Gate" is your place along with the other dangerous cranks and falsifiers. Get you gone to your habitation. "Put Up or Shut Up." In view of the reiterated charge of frauds in connection with the Pension Department, made by the newspaper organs of the money kings, we take occasion to say : Congress is now in session. Let a committee of the Senate or House be ap pointed to investigate the allowance of claims since the war if need be, to ascertain what per centage are fraudulent, and the specific character of the frauds perfected. It is time for those who allege fraud to make the charge good by a pre sentation of facts. They should put up the proofs or shut up, and cease lying about the soldiers and pensioners of the country. The Mississippi Plan. The following States have thus far adopted the Mississippi plan of murdering defenseless citi zens while in the custody of the law : Wiscon sin, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia. As the list of law-breaking mob-ruled States increases proper mention of the fact will be made. The New York Herald must have lost heavily upon the elections or else have made some un fortunate bets on the fall races ; it is endeavor ing to rob the soldiers of their pensions. But even if the pension system be abolished alto gether we fail to see just how the Herald is to derive any profit thereby. Have the money kings made up a purse for the polo journal to be handed over to the editor in case the robbery of pensioners be accomplished and the tax on national banks and bank checks is repealed ? The New York Herald characterizes all sol diers benefited by the Arrears Act as pretenders and bogus soldiers. The Herald is a crank and a liar in the in terest of the money kings. Congressmen don't generally care for much religion in their chaplain, and now doubtless they are well suited. The House now has the Power, the Power has the perquisites, but the religion of Christ goes begging for a true representative to open the proceedings with prayer.

NEWS ITEMS, Congress will begin the consideration of busi ness next week, but it is not expected that much will be accomplished until after the holidays. Acting Vice-President Davis has reannounced his political position. He is still on the fence. President Arthur took up his residence in the White House on Wednesday. The new Cabinet will probably be announced on Monday. Mr. John Davis, and not Mr. Phillips, as here tofore stated, is to be President Arthur's private secretary. The defense in the Guiteau case has closed its testimony. A bill has been introduced in the Senate pro viding for the reimbursement of Oregon for damages done the State during the Modoc war Several bills looking towards the expediting of mail service in the far southwest have been: offered in the Senate. Congress will take a recess on or about the 21st for the holidays. General Burbridge, of Kentucky, is being urged by his friends for Minister to Brazil. General Negley, the president of the National Council of the Union League of America, has called a general meeting of that body, to be held at the Continental Hotel, in the city of Phila delphia, on the 14th of December. Distinguished members of the Republican party from all parts of the Union are to be present and take part in the proceedings. First Assistant Secretary Upton has tendered his resignation to the Secretary of the Treasur'. Several others in the Department will, in all probability, be requested to do likewise. Several large flouring mills in Minneapolisr Minn., have been destroyed by fire. Secretary Folger has appointed Mr. James B. Butler, late United States attorney for Idaho, a special agent of the Treasury Department for one month, and detailed him to take charge of the Appointment Bureau, vice Lamphere, whose resignation has been accepted, to take effect on December 31, until which date Mr. Lamphere has been granted a leave of absence There is a rumor that Mr. Dillon will soon be- released from Kilmainham. The British Treasury has undertaken to prose cute Tobin, charged with "treason felony," as one of the "Irish Brotherhood." Spain objects to the partiality shown by the French commission which is investigating the. Saida massacre. M. Rouvier, the French Minister of Commerce, declares his readiness to withdraw the decree against American pork if America would insti tute a trustworthy system of inspection. A fresh outbreak of the anti-Jewish agitation in Russia is considered imminent. The steamer Germanic, on her voyage to Queenstown, picked up the crew of the steamer Hur worth, which was in a sinking condition and had been drifting about for eleven days. The rescued seamen had suffered greatly from exposure. Funds were supplied them by the passengers of the Gemanic, who also presented a purse to the rescuers. On the 3d instant Captain Brownrigg, of the British man-of-war London, with ten men in a steam pinnace, attempted to capture a dhow,, living French colors and loaded with slaves. The Arab crew resisted fiercely; Captain Brown rigg, a seaman, a stoker, and a supernumerary were killed, and one man was severely and two slightly wounded. The dhow escaped. The Dviblin correspondent of the Times says: "The conspiracy against the payment of rent is extending. Intimidation. Boycotting, and threats are prevalent throughout a large area of terri tory." Six hundred of the Duke of Devonshire's tenants have decided not to pay their rents ex cept with a reduction of twenty per cent.
