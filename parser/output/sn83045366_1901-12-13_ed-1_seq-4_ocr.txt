The Navy and Canal During the discussion of the new canal treaty some senators have deplored the j elimination of the Davis amendment, ■which was a conspicuous feature of the former treaty, and have predicted the inability of our government to safeguard the canal without fortifications. These gentlemen do not seem to consider the tential fact that we now have a navy that Inspires respect; which, if the president's advice is followed, will be steadily strengthened for the national de fense and for the performance of our j international duties and the assertion of our rights. Since the building of our modern navy was undertaken twenty years ago, we have accomplished wonderful things in naval construction, but we have not yet attained a position which would natural- j ly generate a high degree of self-com placency. The reports of our naval offi cial are, at least, not altogether reas suring. Rear Admiral Crowninshleld re ports, for instance, that the navy has not sufficient men to man the vessels available and under construction in case of war. The commissioning of several warships is delayed because of the lack of men and j there are 1,500 vacancies in the enlisted j force of the navy. Admiral Endicott has surprised some j congressmen and senators by submitting j estimates for the maintenance of the navy : yards and stations and improvements ag gregating $21,526,359. He shows that yards have to be enlarged and barracks ! constructed and new dry docks provided. ! The increase In the naval force has out- i stripped the necessary provision for yards ' and docks. Naval rehabilitation necessi- | tates progress and improvement in every! department. Secretary Long, in his re-i port, emphasizes the "pressing need for a! national naval reserve force from which to dfraw for sea service immediately upon ; the outbreak of war." Such naval reserve i Is as important for the '•:?.:\ •- as the na- { tlonal guard of the states i :-r the army. Both should be maintain- ' It is not necessary to strive after groat numerical superiority In army or navy, as much as i it is to have both arms of national defense absolutely effective and always ready for service. A limited number of ships of j great fighting strength and handled by j «xperts is stronger and more useful than a vast armada of indifferently con structed and poorly handled vessels. The latter will prove a source of weakness al ways. As it is, however, we are on the way to naval superiority which will en able us to protect the Isthmian canal against any power which may be bold moug to violate the neutrality of that r •■. Senator Lodge's idea that the. old White House must be preserved, while making room for the executive offices, is - a fine one. The TVhite House is, as he says, pleasing architecturally, quite large enough for the residence of republican magistrate and worthy of preservation out of historical considerations. Give the president more room, toy all means, but do not mar or destroy the old White House. So the Btate agricultural college is to lose the service of Professor Shaw any way. That is to be regretted, but it Is good that, in a private position, ln> Is still .to do valuable public work. Endow the Public Schools Discussing the critisiam of Rev. Irving \P. Johnson, to the effect that too much money Is being spent on higher education and too little on elementary in this coun try. Rev. Marlon Shutter makes the per tinent suggestion that the public schools are as deserving of private munificence as the great universities. The universi ties have, of late, got more than their share. This is because thero is a general feeling that the state, through long cus tom, has made ample provision for the public schools and that heretofore such ample provision has not been made for the universities. But we know that in Minneapolis, at least, the public schools, good as they are, are not what they should be; that they do not do aa much as they ought to equip their pupils for useful lives and good! citizenship. It Is a constant and never quite suceedlng struggle to secure appro priations large enough to enable the prop er performance of the functions of the public schools. The Minneapolis public schools do not now have kindergartens and the manual training is confined to the high schools. Most educators agree, we assume, that the kindergartens are good and should be In the public schools. There will be little difference of opinion about the advisability of extending manual training. But there is little prospect that the board will have funds to meet either of these wants for many years. >?ow, why should not the endowment of kindergarten and manual training depart ments of the public schools be proper ob jucts for private munificence? What bet ter use can a man make of his plethora of riches? Where can he place his money where it will do more good? Good educa tion is the right of every child of a re public and the state should give it. If the state, in a growing community, finds the burden too great what more useful work can the wealthy man do than to help the state to perform its duty and help the children to the realization of their right? Why can not a man make a name for wise giving by endowing the public schools as well as the universities? Relying upon the accuracy of the report of a morning paper, representing Rev. Mr. .Love as having said in a sermon last Sunday, bearing on the railroad merger, that lie had noticed that every time con gress met railroad rates went down, The Journal made some comment, suggest ed by the report. It is satisfied now, however, that the report was inaccurate in this particular, and that Mr. Love never made the statement credited to him. Into an otherwise generally accurate report there seems to "have crept an inaccurate | statement as to this particular matter, and it has made the basis of comment in this paper. The Journal is glad to acquit Mr. Love of responsibility for the rather remarkable statement credited to him and withdraws its criticism made in [ that connection. Significant Either Way Mr. Kill has concluded to resign from the directory of the Northern Pacific. Whether this action is due to threatened suit for injunction by a stockholder allied with the Harriman interests, who oppose the retirement of Northern Pacific pre ferred, or whether it is a result of the action set on foot by the governor of Min nesota, and in recognition of the plain let ter of the law which makes Mr. Hill's membership on the Northern Pacific di rectorate illegal, is a matter of conjec ture. In either event it is a setback for Mr. Hill. If it means, on one hand, lack | of harmony among the members of the merger syndicate, it is hardly less sig nificant than it would be if it were due to a recognition of the fact that we have some laws out here in Minnesota that the railroad bosses are bound to pay some at tention to. The report of the state high school in spector shows' that the salaries of teach ers are decreasing at a rather alarming rai'i. This decrease is hard to under stand, in view of the fact that first-class teachers have been in great demand, and that the cost of living is increasing. The tendency ought to be the other way. Teachers are not paid enough. Many are panl an much as they are worth, but not I till salaries are larger will we be able to have all the .teachers excellent. Railroads Oppose the Canal People interested in preventing the con i solidation of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern roads are in a position to appreciate the opposition some or al! of the transcontinental railroads are and have for years been offering to the con struction of an isthmian canal. That canal will mean another transcontinental route —and that by water. Water transportation is always cheaper than freight. It will be difficult for the railway companies to con trol all the steamship lines and steamers that will compete for transcontinental traffic when this canal is completed. In any event it promises to be a constant factor for lower rates. This railroad opposition to the canal is now taking the form of an effort to reject, or, what would amount to the same thing, amend the Hay-Pauncefote canal treaty. If that treaty is rejected or amended by the senate it is not likely that Great Britain will consent to renew negotia tions at the present time. The Clayton- Bulwer treaty will then continue in force, and if we build a canal it will be in de fiance of ice British interpretation of that document's application at the the present time, whatever may be our interpretation of it. We should thus, at least, earn the ill-will of Britain. It is by no means cer tain that congress would feel justified in appropriating money for the canal with the Clayton-Bulwer agreement still in effect. Public opinion Is rightly in favor of the acceptance of the new treaty. It grants all that we need. There is- no use in contending for an explicit definition of a right to defend the canal that we shall, probably never care to use. If we do not undertake to fortify the ■canal or blockade it, it will never be attacked. Considering the liberality of the new treaty, that it abrogates the Clayton-Bul wer agreement and that the international difficulties are all cleared away by it, ' there can be no excuse for not ratifying. The people will know how to classify senators who oppose It. The Pacific rail roads have long had too much to say against the canal. The time has come to disregard ithem and go ahead. Why should not the message of a pres ident be read) In the public schools? It is a state paper, en Important contribu tion to current history, a compendium of the questions of the day. It is a document that high school pupils should read out of school if not in. It is straining at a gnat to interpret it as a partizan fulmination. That there was no connection between Dr. Jordan's wish to have the message read in the schools and politics is con clusively shown by the fact that he is a democrat himself —though politics has never had anything to do with hia reten tion in office. If Miss Stone Is really trying to convert the brigands, as they complain, they know how they can escape. CiiICAOO-MINNEAPOLIS 

TRAVEL Tlio Chicago-Minneapolis roads have de cided against material shortening of the time of the passenger trains between these cities. The roads have settled that ques tion all by themselves. They haven't asked the people of this city anything about it and would probably be surprised if any one should suggest that they ought to do so. But why should the railroads not consult their patrons in a matter of such importance and give some considera tion to their wishes and interests? An article published in this paper points out some of the disadvantages and extra expenses and loss of time the people starting eastward from this city or St. Paul suffer from the present schedule and suggests how easily they might be avoided. The matter is one that should engage the attention of the Commercial clubs of both cities. If there is anything on which they can get together and act harmonious ly ibis is it. In the Wolcott affair Mrs. Roosevelt is the power behind the presidency. The Negro Question The Memphis Scimitar, In answer to the question of a Minneapolis paper, "What educated man or woman, north or south, really fears Bocial degradation through contact with the colored race?" replies, "It is only necesary to say: 'You do, you hypocrite!' " And then follows the stereotyped argu ment about the daughter of the Minne sota editor marrying a negro. These southern people are so terribly alarmed over their daughters marrying negroes, and use this argument so constantly, that one can scarcely avoid the suspicion that their daughters must be peculiarly attracted toward negroes. White men in the north are not afraid of their (laughters marrying negroes, simply be cause the negro has his rights and fair, decent treatment, and we hardly think that the parents of southern white girls are justified in the alarm which they exhibt lest their daughters should do so. In another place in the same article, the editor of the Scimitar asks: "How would the Minnesota editor like to become the granpapa of a brood of mulattoes and be forced to own them before the world?" The idea of being forced to own them be fore the world seems to be chief cause of anxiety in some quarters. There is no doubt about there being plenty of mu lattoes, on account of which fact we do not hear any expressions of shame or embarrassment. It is only the idea of being forced to own them which seems to disturb those who are responsible for them. The conviction of the Porto Rico labor leader, lglesias, for merely marking up the price of labor, through an organiza tion, at the same time that commodities were increased in price on account of the change iv monetary standard, is most un just, viewed from the standpoint of Amer ican law. It appears to be in accord with the obsolete Spanish law that pre vails in Porto Rico. The lglesias case points the way for a needed revision of that law. It is hard on lglesias, but his personal sacrifice will likely lead to rem edial legislation. Winter Lumber Making The request made by the Northern Pa cific railroad for permission to build a spur track directly to the Diamond lum ber mill, calls attention to a proposed in novation in lumber making. If the spur is built the mill will saw In the middle of winter, beginning on Jan. 1. Enough water near the mill will be kept free from Ice by the use of steam pipes to permit the dumping into the river, for delivery to the saws, of logs brough in by train. This mill has been supplied during the past season with loirs hauled by rail, but the place where the logs have been dropped Into the river is too far from the mill to make it possible to keep open water all the way. If this winter cutting of lum ber should prove successful there is no reason why. if the log supply is sufficient, the saw mills cannot run all the year around. Such continuous cutting would clean Ihe standing pine up still faster than at present, ,but it is doomed any way. Not in Steel Trust Bonds It is with no disposition to depreciate j Mr. Carnegie's generosity in offering; to endow the proposed National university that we express our approval of the wise suggestion made by members of congress to the president that the endowment be not in the form of steel trust pre ferred stock. It Is eaid that this stock and not cash was what Mr. Carnegie of fered. Very likely the stock will pay more than any other permanent investment that may be found for $10,000,0110, and Mr. Car negie probably considered it the best form of security for an assured endowment. His confidence in it is shown by his re | ported guarantee of the Interest. But now that we are entering upon an era when the trusts are bound to be the subject of national legislation, any one can understand that it would, at least, be embarrassing for the government to make laws that would affect the welfare of one of its own institutions—such would be the effect of legislation that would tend to depress the value of steel trust securi ties or imperil the existence of the trust. The inevitable consequence would be to create in the minds of congressmen a feel ing that would prejudice them in their de liberations on such a subject. Mr. Carnegie should not feel aggrieved at this manner of looking Into the mouth of the gift horse. It will be an easy mat ter for him to convert the steel trust stock into u3h or government bonds.

Pease, editor and publisher of the Anoka Union, has been having one of the experiences of his life. For the small pox, which he refera to In his paper as a "detestible creation," secured a half nelson on the governor and threw him on his back. Uncle came down to Minneapolis one day and brought it with him. He felt a little out of condition and had a chill as he walked towards the depot. He stepped in and took a. hot bath, but it didn't reach the spot. Re turning to Anoka, he retired to his library and the smallpox did the rest. Did this detestable disease hold Uncle down? Not much! He wrote hia editorials as usual, and held them up against his win dow pane, whence they were copied by the office boy on the outside. On his recovery Uncle said: There were just 378 dots in our contest, but it was plenty. This week's Anoka Union devotes a col umn to Uncle's struggles with the disease. He says: Smallpox! Detestible creation! If I've a friend or foe on God's footstool I hope none of 'em will ever have it. I have had a strong dose, and so close an acquaintance makes me want no more of it. Don't wonder people shudder and shrink at the thought of catch ing the horrid disease. Perfectly proper for them to do so. Where and how I caught it, I'll never tell. During the governor's absence from the office, T. G. J. U. G. Pease ran the paper in a masterly manner. It was a good experience for Uncle Gran ville after all—the smallpox, I mean—for it proved to him, as politics has never been able to do, the soundness of the tenet of universal brotherhood. After hla description of the disease, Mr. Pease launches out in this noble retrain: It's a pretty good old world, after all. The milk of human kindness never ceases flowing. j Let you but need this human kindness and let i the good folks so understand it and they'll give it to you gladly and willingly. There's generosity, brotherly lov<\ genuine friendship and hear'y sympathy lying around every j where and it always comes to the surface at ' the right time. Oftentimes from a source you j had no reason to expect. It needs but the opportunity, and the opportunity is never passed up. No, no, the people of this world are not selfish. They are kind, loving and sympathetic, and I rejoice that it is so. This passage proves that the experience has been worth all that it cost. The state will now look for and expect a higher tone in Anoka county politics. —A. J. Russell. !the problem in wheat expor tation In discussing the possibilities of a canal connecting the Great Lakes and the seaboard, Harper's Weekly gives some interesting fig ures on the probable cost of the construction of sjeh a canal and its possible revenues. i The estimated cost of the construction of ! the carnal ie about $70,000,000. Hence the ! question, Will it pay? This 'is the answer: i The present yearly traffice of the Great i Lakes is about 40,000,000 tons. Assuming that work on the canal will begin in 1903, aud the route opened to commerce in 1908, the traffic i will have increased probably to 47,000,000 tons. If of this a minimum tonnage of 6,000,000 or j 7,000,000 can be diverted, the canal will be a I paying Investment. For instance, it is be lieved that grain can be carried, if competi tion requires, at a reduction of 3 cents under the present average rate of 4% cenits via Buffalo to New York, or Monti-eal via the Welland canal. This saving would amount to about $1 per ton. It Is proposed to charge a toll of 50 cents per ton, or 1% cents per bush el. (The rate through the Suez per ton.) Tonnage is estimated' for traffic in one direc tion only, and no income is calculated from west-bound freight. On the basis of 7,000.000 ton.s the gross revenue would be $3,500,000. j The estimate for working and maintenance is $700,000, leaving a net revenue of $2,800,000, or about i p>ar cent on the investment. 

DRESSES SOLD FOR A SONG It is well known that whenever there Is a sale of actresses' dresses In New York tbe bargains aye snapped up by or on behalf of society dames of restricted income. The ma terials? are always of the best, and in the hand of a clever dressmaker can be turned to capital advantage, being so disguised in the new makeup as to be totally unrecogniz able. About two ytars ago an extensive stage wardrobe belonging to a former society wom an was sold. One purchaser secured for $90 three gowns, either of which cost thrice as much. Costumes in the "The Three Mus keteers" were disposed of at $5 each, the original cost being $.'>s. Six brocaded su tin "Juliet" dresses, trimmed with lace and penrls, were knocked down for $20, and six "Komeo" costumes, trimmed with silver lace, realized only $25. Twenty pairs of buckle shoes worn by the chorus girls in a com!c opera sold lor $4.00. Costumes originally costing 525.000 usually bring about J1',500. THE EVOLI'TIOX OF LEADVILLE "From a mining camp with a reputation for bloodshed that extends to the oceans." says | the Leadville (Col.) Democrat, "Leadville has I developed into one of the most upright cities I of th<? conniry, as free frcm violence and crime of any kind as a Now England village. i This result has been brought about through the influence of the good women of the com munity. They worked for the election of officials who could be intrusted to inforce the laws and make the city and country a most undesirable place for law breakers and vag rants, and their moral influence throughout the year 3 has been most beneficial in this re spect. They have developed a city of homes and good government from a mining camp with a record." NOVELS FOM THE BIBLE Hall Came. the novelist, states that he Is largely indebted for his literary success to the Bible. "I think," he says, "that I know my Bible as few literary men know it. There Is no book in the world like it, and the finest novels ever written fall far short in interest of any one of the stories it tells. Whatever strong situations I have in my books are not of my creation, but are taken from the Bible."

How then is a play to be constructed from the material of fered by that Immortal satire on contempora ry morals and manners? In truth, a real play Is not possible. The best that can be done is a series of episodes illustrating the career of Becky Sharp and the evolution of her character and affording incidental glimps es of the other characters that figure in this •novel without a hero." It should also be possible to preserve some of the bitteT satire with which Thackeray makes his relentless revelations. Success In the role of Becky Sharp must therefore be dependent upon the player's ability to paint the character as T.harkeray conceived It and to show in each succeeding episode the changes wrought by its development. It ia a disappointment to find that Miss Ge/trude Coghlan's promising Becky Sharp of a year a«o has not gTown and filled out with the lapse of time. She has not yet real ized the promises held forth by her first ap pearances in the role. She still but half sat isflea, while seeming ever on the verge of bursting forth Into the real Becky. It Is diffi cult to say just Jiow she falls short, palpable though the fact may be. Is it in too great a reticence, which conceals from her audience as well as from the characters of the play Becky's real self? It is true that Thackeray is hlmuelf not very frank in hia treatment of the character, whloh he develops objectively. But when the career of that remarkable wo man 1b compressed into a play for a single evening, it becomes necessary to adopt other measures than those of th© novelist to make her Intelligible. Another result of this extreme reticence is that Miss Cogihlan fails to bring out the evo- j lution of character in its successive phases. The deserted Mrs. Rawdon Crawley of the ■ garret in the last act is not different from the artful Becky Sharp of Miss Pinkerton's academy, although eighteen years are sup posed to intervene between them. Perhaps Miss Coghlan's youth and comparative inex perience make it difficult for her to reveal in the Uiter episodes of Becky's career the indel ible marks that * time - and vicissitude leave upon human character. While conceding many good points in Miss Coghlan's impersonation and recognizing therein the evidences of a talent which is her heritage, one is constrained to the belief that between her and successful starhood there still lies a thorny path. It cannot be doubted thai the guidance of her lamented father, i Charles Coghlan, taken away at a most criti- ; oal point in. her opening career, would have, beon of immense value to Miss Coghlan. Since It is improbable bhat she will now be willing to go back and serve the apprenticeship in her art that most stars have found indispensable one can but hope that she will happen upon some David Belasco who will serve as a stern guide on that strenuous pathway. Miss Coghlan's support is for the most part admirable. The Rawdon Crawley of Charlea Bertram, while perhaps something 100 fine, is strong and convincing. Thack eray certainly never intended to rouse any sympathy for this big, stupid fellow, devoted to horses and cards; but Mr. Bertram does attract sympathy for the man and reaches a tremendous climax in the scene with Becky and Lord Steyne. James Cooper gives a clear-cut picture of the cynical Steyne but with perhaps too decided a dash of color. One thinks of his lordship as less full of blood and life and as encased in a shell of cynical Indifference that conceals his pas sions, but not his corruptness of soul. Such a conception would permit of a greater and more striking contrast in the great scene spoken of. Hammond Dailey realizes per fectly that smug and sanctimonious hypo crite, Pitt Crawley, while Joseph Fitzpatrick. as old Sir Pitt, is equally satisfactory. Mal colm Duncan as the liekle and reckless George Osborne, Edward Locke as the naif ■and volatile Joseph Sedley, and Lawrence Griffith as the faithful Dobbin, all prove themselves excellent actors, with Just appre ciation of the characters painted by Thack eray. Annie Aliiston furniehes a good bit of character-sketching in her Miss Crawley and May Donohue as Peggy O'Dowd has a delicious brogue and a piquant manner. Mu riel Walling is sufficiently colorless and lach rymose as Amelia Sedley, and the minor roles are for the most part in capable hands. The play ia staged with every attention to detail and gives a good idea of the. dress and manners in vogue . early in the nineteenth century. • _w. B. Chamberlain. " Foyer Chat.

JUST AS A MATTER OF FORM When Fernando Wood was mayor of Xew York, in the early days of the war, he issued a Thanksgiving proclamation that occasioned considerable comment. He said practically that ho didn't see anything to be thankful for in the situation, but as long as the presi dent had set apart the day for thanksgiving, the people might gather in their houses o* worship and give thanks If they wanted to. A WATCHER I am a watcher, whose eyes have grown dim With looklngfor conic star—which breaks on him. Altered, and vorn, and weak, and full of tearft. —Robert Browning. FRIDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 13, 1901 b~hm.pi! i » , .____! in Copyright, 1901, by Charlotte A. Canty. They carried him In from the surgeons' room and laid him on the narrow little bed that tho nurse had made ready. Her eyes were wide aid her face was pale to the lips, but her step was steady and her manner calm as they withdrew and left her alone with him. A suppressed sob ahook her frame as she lightly touched the bandages over his eyes, those honest gray eyes in which aha had read nothing but loyalty aud devotion. But Anne Morton, waa a trained nurse, aud she forced down the rtelng tide of emotion and .eat beside her patient, quietly waiting for him to regain consciousness. When he stirred, her band was on his breaat iv an instant, holding him steady. "Only the nurse," she said in a low, even tone. "You are to remain perfectly quiet." The meaning of her words came to him slowly as the effect of the anaesthetic wore oft. "Nurse?" he suddenly aak&d, "why are my eyes bandaged?" "They have been Injured," she explained, "but we think not seriously. The only way to be sure that we shall cave your sight is •to keep the eyes bandaged for a time." Her quiet manner subdued him, end he ■was silent, but only for a moment. "Tell me first," he eaid, "have you seen my brother, Jim Curtis?" A shudder ran through the girl. Yes, she had seen him, stretched out iv eternal quiet. "All is well with him," she answered, "but you must be quiet now." "He didn't see me until the last minute," went on the man, "aud I liad thought that he was a thousand miles away. We were fighting our -way across the clearing when I saw a big fellow Btrike at a man just ahead of me. The man turned to parry the blow, and I saw his face. It was Jim! I remember throwing myself between the fel low and my brother, but after that I don't re member anything." The nurse was trying to stop him. "I know," she eald. "A shell burst almost in front of your face. It was Captain Jim Curtis who led the men across the clearing. It was reckless work —" "Yes, but that's Jim, though," said the man. "Why, he'd dare anything. How proud she'll be to hear of hie courage in this affair! Say, nurse, couldn't he come in to see me?" "Xo, not under any circumstances," was the decided answer. "You've talked too much now—" "I'll foe quiet, nurse, but won't you ask him to give me a whistle as he passes by? He has the prettiest whistle in the world. It's like a flute. Walt till you hear it!" A swift rush cf tears blinded the nurse. She was only a woman, and it meant much to her that the playmate of her childhood's days was oven then being carried away to lie forever silent in a soldier's grave. "Ask him to whitle just once.. He'll aurely come to ask about me." "I'll see about it," she answered at length, "if you think it will not excite you too much." "O, nurse—the big roan's volco had grown tremulous—"l haven't heard that whistle for five years! You'd know what he is to me if you knew what I've given up for him." The nurse caught her breath. "We'll see about it to-night when I go to make my re port," she said. "Rest now, so that the report may be a good one." The man obeyed. It was some time before lie spoke again. "I don't know why you should remind me of her," ho said. "You're such a little, soft voiced thing, and Annie is a big western girl, with a voice that makes the room ring when she laughs or sings. She does both, bless her! She can whistle, too, as well as any fel low I ever knew. Jim taught her, and I used to tease her about being a whistling girl." A sad little smile passed over the face of the tall nurse as she bent above him to arrange the pillows. "I must leave you know to make my re port," she said. "Be very quiet, and I will not forget your message." The man lay still, wondering how long the darkness would last. He felt lost, lying her? alone, but suddenly through the stillness Daily New York Letter A Little Private Murder. Dec. 13.—Miss Emma King, the trained nurse who voluntarily offered herself to be experimented upon by Dr. George I). Barney of Brooklyn and was inoculated with tuber culosis bacteria on Nov. 22, has developed a well-defined case of the disease and has been removed from this city and state to avoid possible interruption of the experiment by the health authorities of the city. A local newspaper has afflvadlts of eminent specialists on diseases of tbe lungs who signed them not knowing the identity of Mis? King. They believed that they were dealing with an ordinary case of tuberculosis. Dr. Barney says he will surely cure Miss King. One of the physician's purposes <s to disprove Dr. Koch's theory that tuberculosis in cattle cannot be transmitted to humans. He first, inoculated a cow and then Miss King from the cow's disease. Kllzabeth. Ann's Troubles. Elizabeth Ann Padgett went shopping yes terday and bought some furs. She oixler^d the clerk to send the furs home. She needed them last night in a long hunt for a place to sleep. While Elizabeth Ann was shopping Manager Fo?ter of the Hotel Iroquois, in West Forty fourth street, and his lawyer, were busy, too. They got an order from Justice O'Gorman setting aside a temporary injunction which for several weeks has restrained Foster from interfering with Miss Padgett, his lodger. Then the lawyer got from Justice Joseph In the Yorkvllle municipal court a writ of dis possess. All this happened before Miss Padgett had fully decided between sable and mink. She took mink. Then she took a cab and drove to the Iroquois. As she jumped from the cab fhe was con fronted by the large figure of a China cat, with wide staring purple eyes and a blue tongue. It was Miss Padgett's cat, brought from abroad where cats grow like that. It was perched on a mattress. The mattress was on a email mahogany table with one (nil hanging over against a porcelain lamp shaile. which was resting uneasily against a pair of brass andirons. Alongside of the table was a dressing case, which had evidently been filled up in a hurry by the men with the dis posess warrant. All the drawers were partly open because it was Impossible to shut them on account of the mess of silk waists, skirts and things bulging out. over the edges. As soon as Miss Padgett had taken a quick account of stock she ran down to the Fifth avenue corner and into Sheirys to use the telephone. First sh« called the weather bureau to learn if there was to be rain. Then she called up several newspaper otflces and gave to each just, a brief 10-eent limit synopsis of her troubles. She went back and sat down on a trunk to wait I'or reporters. She could not find a storage house to receive her property last night so she hired a man to watch her goods. Then she paid one 7iiore visit to her property. "I haven t even a nighty," she said, and pulled open a bureau drawer to find one. It was filled with, pictures of angels dressed in clouds. That made Mi*s Padgett impatient. "They've put. everything in the wrong place," she exclaimed. "I won't hunt through that mess to-night, nighty or no nighty," and she wandered up Fifth avenue without bag gage to find ft hotel. The Copper Sensation. Wall street does not take seriously the re cent deliverances of Thomas W. Lawson, the Boston operator In copper stocks, and the prevailing opinion is that the decline in the price of Amalgamated Is not so much a Stand ard Oil war on Mr. Lawson as an attack on much bigger game, namely, the Rothschilds, who are the chief owners of the Rio Tfnto Mining company. The report that the Rio Tlnto company had agreed to reduce Its pro duction, If true, is an Indication that the Standard Oil capitalists have been powerful enough to force the Rothschilds to terms, an Incident In international finance that would be of extreme significance. Brokers com monly acting for Standard Oil people were reported to bo heavy buyers of Amalgamated. On Us speculative side the movement in cop per Is as mysterious as it 1» sensational, and ' k , By CWlotte, * AC<L*ty) there came a clear high whistle, another and then a succession of bird calls. The man lay tingling with delight in the sounds. "Jim!" ho whispered. "God bless you, ladf Thank heaven that I wag with you in time!" When the nurse came in again, she found him tranquilly smiling. "He did whistle, nurso, the same merry old whistle. Couldn't you ask him for ma how Annie is? Only that!" "I can't ask him anything," replied the girl, with forced calmness. "I shall not see him again." The man sighed. "Well, I won't trouble you, nurse. I'd like to know how she Is, though. There Isn't another woman in ail the world like our whistling girl." The nurae did not dare to speak. "You're a stranger to me, nurse,' 'ha went on, "and yet I can't help telling you all about it. Bhe lived near us all her life, but it wasn't until Jim came to me with hi* hopes that I realized what she was to me. I never told her. I could see that she and Jlrn were made for each other, but I couldn't stay there and tamely wait for £ue end. I"— The man was trembling from head to foot, but the nurse.had sunk down beside the bed and burled her face In the covers. "I went away," he resumed, "and I haven't heard a word from them since. I hope she's happy. I'd liko to ask Jim why he's here and not with her. But she has spirit and courage. She's not Ihe one to bid him may idle at home in these times. Nurse, was that a t noehandyrnra fuL,Bt that a tear on my hand? There—l didn't make you cry, did I?" The nurse choked back the tears and re plied in her habitual half voice: "It was the lotion that I use fcr your bandages. No moro talking to-night, please." "Xo more, nurse, but you know now why I wished to hear Jim's whistle. To hear him is to know that he is safe and that no sorrow will come to Annie." The whistle floated up to him each morning and evening at the hour that the nurse went to report. The old airs that -were familiar about his western home came to the patient listener in the darkened room. He grew stronger as the days went by, end the nurse watciied him with dreamy happiness. She htid been away from him one morning, and when she returned she met the doctor at the door. He was talking with a friend, and as she stepped past him the words rang clear ly Into the quiet room: "To replace Captain Jim Curtis, who was killed in that skirmish on the 18th." "AVho—was—what?" The patient had start ed up in bed, his face white with horror. The nurse sprang to him. He fell bark as she reached him. He stiffened in her arms, and the bla~knePß of despair settled down upon the heart and the hopes of the whistling girl. The doctor's abrupt oommands roused her. She was the nurse again, not the stricken wn man. Together they worked to bring the pa tient back out of the shadow, and presently she was alone with him again. "Nurse," he said, with a sob In his voice, "I suppose I must have been dreaming: or may be not quite sane, but I'll swear I heard that whistle. It was Jim's signal. I know. But Jim >.s dead! Oh, Annie!" The nurse was down on her knees beside him. Her strong, soft hands held hi 6; her voice was steady and sweet. "Listen, dear," she said. "Annie Is—Annie is here! You couldn't know me while your eyes were bound; but, dear, you were more blind before. It was never Jim: It never could be. It was you then: It Is you now. Oh, my love, you have lost much, but will you not be brave for my sake, for the sake of a day that may be?" A light cf understanding Fettled slowly upon his changing face. His hands closed tightly upon hers. "Annie." he whispered, "is It a dream?" The nurse laughed in spite of the tears that would flow. "Oh, doubting one," she b&M, "how c*ml<l thla be a dream?" And lizht as en elf'a caress he felt her kiss upon hi« lips. undoubtedly many reports have been issued that have no basis in truth. But on its trade side, the copper situation is pretty clearly denned. The trouble is summed up in one word, "overproduction." Prices of fine cop per have declined In London to an equivalent of 12a4 cents in our money, and yet th« pro ducers of lake copper have heen holding their price at IT cents. Consumption ha* decreased in Englani, France and Germany. Our ex ports have fallen off, while there have been large importations of both new and old cop per. On the other hand, there are said to have been large sales recently that hare re lieved the situation somewhat, and It la ar gued that the consumption Is likely to in crease on account of the new electrical pro jects, including the Pacific cable. Trading in actual copper is one thing, but speculation In Amalgamated Copper stook is quite another. This company is a vast blind pool concern. Noted financiers are on its board of direction, but the company, which has a capitalization of $153,000,0(10, has never Issued a statement of its condition, fand the outsider dealing in its stock is simply playing with fire. Hun dreds who have done so have been badly burned, some doubtless have been ruined, al together, for the depreciation in the stock in the sast few months has amounted to more than $100,000,000. The story of Amalgamated Copper gives special emphasis and point to President Roosevelt's declaration 1n his an nual message In favor of publicity as applied to the great Industrial corporations. John D. Rockefeller is quoted as saying that neither be nor the Standard Oil company In connected with the Amalgamated Copper. TMs is strict ly true, but H is a fact that his brother, William Rockefeller, and his nephew, William G. Rockefeller, are directors of the copper company, while James Stilhnan, president of the City bank, and connected 'by man-lag* with him, is another director, and H. H. Rogers of the Standard Oil company is presi dent of the copper company, "which shows how Intimate is the connection between th« Standard Oil capitalists and tho Amalga mated. The Long: Inland Road.
