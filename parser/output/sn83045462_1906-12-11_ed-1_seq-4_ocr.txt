Church and State. The deplorable Roosevelt-Storer controversy teaches one valuable lesson, by which the natioi? may profit.. We are warned afresh against any sort of union -between church and state, as b^iiig detrimental to the Interests of 'uot-i). So far both church and state have prospered with us. and apparently botft atfe destined for still greater things. As state we are <>asily among the first, while church work with us. largely because of 'the freedom with which it is conducted, ranks with the most notable and successful anywhere performed. Let its note in particular to what excellent feeling among men our arrangement contributes.' Archbishop fretend, whose name figures so prominently in the episode in question, is a stanch churchman?none in America more active or influential. But among his warmest admirers are many Protestants, who have been attracted to him by his high walk as a citizen and a patriot. His views are broad, and catholic ill uic luiger ui liiu ?uiu, auu uc commands general and profounQ wspect. It would have pleased numbers of Protestants and Catholics alike any time these dozen years past had tlie red hat been conferred on this useful and eminent cleric and citizen. This feeling was founded on the American appraisement of the matter. As Archbishop Ireland had labored so diligently and siK-cessfully in building up his church In this country, and held so high a place in tlie councils of the communion both here and abroad, we should have rewarded him in promotion according to his achievements iml ?h<> tulpnta /Manl Q f^kil ' THft rtfflplal church view, however, which Is formed and promulgated in Rome, .goes beyond these considerations and (rives us a different result. For an instance, within the past tSn vears two men have received the red hat for services rendered in this" country? Satolli and Martinelli?but those services, important enough from the church point of view, appear negligible Yrom the state point of view when compared with those at Ireland of St. Paul. Farley of New York. Ryan of Philadelphia, or Keane of Dubuque. The church and tne state move, or, wnere not. should move, in different' Tjrbits. Let us keep our politics wholly free from church influences, and our churches wholly free from politics. The road to heaven is one of free choice in America: and however much we as citizens may admire a churchman and applaud his great and good works, let us not undertake, for fear of injuring him and at the same time ourselves, to influence action with respect to his professional promotion which must come,, .when at -all. from church councils deliberating ffnm thp r?hnpfh'? cirio nf tho mincHnn The Best Shopping Hours. To get the best results from holiday shopping it fs not enough merely to he forehanded and to shop early ih the season. That is good, as far as It goes. It spreads the trade out more evenly through the weeks that precede Christmas, and greatly helps to lessen the congestion in the stores jast before the last day. But there still remains an opportunity for even the early shopper to facilitate his or her own business and to assist the merchants in attending to their trade properly. By choosing the hours for shopping with a little more thought than is bestowed upon the matter by many shoppers the day itself can be adjusted to better advantage. Thus, there are certain hours In each day when the clerks are not as insistently besieged as at otherB. These, it is understood, are from 9 to 11 In the morning and from 2 to 4 In the afternoon. Between those hours it is possible to be waited upon satisfactorily. The rushes come during the departmental noon hours and after the closing of the departments in the afternoon. Owing to the Inconsiderate action of Uncle Sam In keeping his workers at their desks until 4:30 their shopping opportunities are limited and they must necessarily be In a great hurry wh?n they get into the stores, rt is only fair to them to give them all the room possible. Those wlio can get to the stores during the middle of the day, and especially durine the hours when the clerks are all on duty, should do so. for their own sake if not for that of the less fortunate people who are cooped up through the day and have only a few minutes after their work ends in which to buy their presents. But In shopping during the middle of the ilay the patrons oj the stores should bear In mind that the clerks behind the. counters must eat. They are liirtn&n slnd have appetites, and those appetites must be satisfied From ll to 2 o'clock the clerks go off for lunch In -squads, thus lessening the working force by a certain percentage. It im iiit-ictuic iiuyuaBiuie iur me cuHiumers to be as well served between the hours of 11 and 2 as before or after, no matter how i&ige or small the crowd may be. ike average shopper Is a reasonable person, and these considerations, once appreciated, must have their effect In adju&ting the shopping; upon a sensible, effective basis. Mark Twain doffed his summer attire. His comprehensive gifts as a humorist were not equal to accepting the pneumonia germ as a laughing matter. Maxim Gorky appears t? be having trouble with the police almost everywhere oxcei't in St. Petersburg. Populism and Socialism. The following story about the populist party of Kansas comes from Topeka: "Chairman Hanna of tj?e state committee has called a conference of party leaders in the holidays, at which time the effects and good will of the party will be transferred to the republican organisation. "Mr Hanna hns been discussing the party's future with all of those wUo have taken an active part in its affairs, and he says that the sentiment is nearly unanimous in.favor of going into the republican party. V 'We take the position,' said Mr. Hanna today, "that we have been the forerunners of the present republican policy. President Kooseveit is doing the things now that we advocated ten years ago when we were laughed at. We are all for Roosevelt and we are going to^get into his party. We have been John the Baptist for him.' " Seven Cities claimed great Homer dead. Two parties claim the Roosevelt program alive. All that is good in it is democratic. sa> a Mr. Bryan. He insists upon his statement because of his hope to profit by the program in 1908. when, if all goes well with his plans, he will again tempt fortune as his party's national leader. But the populists assert that the President has bur rowed from them, and borrowed so mucli c that they are able now to snuggle under c the same blanket with him. 1 It Is a nice question, but does not stop \ there. "What about the claim that Bryan- e Ism Is simply populism under another e name? The populists advance it, and the I republicans and anti-Bryan democrats con- s firm it. And it is undoubtedly true that ^ Mr Rrvfl n snnnnrtpd Oen. Weaver, the c populist candidate for President in 1892. t So that if Mr. Roosevelt has borrowed t from Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Bryan from the t populists, what is there to do but admit that as the populists are laughing last they 3 are laughing best? t That the laugh was for some time on the B populists we can all recall. The bewhiskered 1 yokel with a straw in his mouth and a t "b'erosh" exDression of face figured in all 1 the cartoons. He failed to get rag money ' I or free silver, or government loans on grain * | and hay and fat cattle, but he did make r himself heard on the subject of railroads * and an income tax. That, today, is beyond 3 dispute. -' 1 The populists, distinctly so-called, haying disappeared?some acting now with the democrats, and some with the republicans? * the socialists appear ais the most advanced 4 critics of the established order. And while * we are not laughing at them as we did at the populists, we consider them just as wide of the American mark. Some of their prop- * osltions are regarded as very wild, and 4 niiitu ImnnGDthla r\? naturnlWotlnn in OUT ^ Ul. scheme of things. But in the light of the populist record is it safe to count them out entirely? May there not be here and there t a suggestion of theirs which, in some form, 1 modified after thorough discussion, will f appear in our future policies? As a matter of fact, we are moving at such a pace, or rather are listening with more than polite- I ness to so many new lines of thought as t respects what we can and should do as a c nation, that he is a bold man who today laughs at anybody, or rejects, offhand, any tiling. I ,.r , . ,v; .? Juvenile Restraint. The suggestion of the superintendent of police that the excise laws be strengthened to prevent the dispensing of liquors to minors raises other questions relative to the care of Juveniles In this District. ' There is now In service a juvenile s doing excellent work In enforcing the laws that nviof n Myl nilmtlnlaf noirxw 1 c^viat uuu auaiutiokci uig ]/unishment to children upon a humane princi- 1 pie and with a view to their preservation from evil lives. Its functions are curative rather than punitive. But its scope Is limited by the lack of statutes covering certain \ conditions. 1 There is, for instance, need today of a 1 law which will prohibit the sending of a s child to a saloon as a medium of purchase fl for an adult. The excise laws do not fully s cover this point, and as a result of the p thoughtlessness of parents children are ex- \ posed to unwholesome Influences from s which they should be carefully shielded. mere is neea, again, 01 a law which will properly punish any person who sends a juvenile, as a messenger, to any house of evil resort. It Is impossible to estimate the moral damage that Is wrought by this practice. The laws today are lamentably weak In this respect. There is need furthermore of a law which t shall properly punish a person who gives o tobacco to a child for his own consumption. The statutes now prohibit the Bale of tobacco to minors, but, as in the case of liquor, they do not go far enough. Many .r people believe that the statutes should -go so far as to warrant the proper officers in ii arresting, for trial before the Juvenile d Court, boys of tender years who are a found smoking. In no other way, it appears, can the evil be reached, or the boys addicted to this habit be taught the destructive effects of nicotine upon them at their age. *- ' If such laws were enacted, separately or together, they would greatly strengthen the hands of those who are now working zealouslv for tiie rescue of the children from contamination. It needs but a visit to the Juvenile Court to demonstrate the good that can be done under a benefl-cent system of laws and an intelligent administration of them in accordance with the principles of prevention and restraint. Washington should have a model system of juvenile laws. It should establish a high standard of intelligent treatment of the younger generation. It must, however, be confessed uiai it u?is uccn uc^iuiaui> a ia.cn. 111 id-King cognizance of the Immense importance of this work and of providing the means of j; caring properly for the moral and physical health of the juveniles. f " li Railroads. ? The report that all the great railroad t systems are to be investigated by the In- o terstate commerce commission Is important f if true. It ought to be true. That body could ? not be better employed. No other subject 0 is so interesting to the public at this time, s What with the railroad rate law going into 'I operation, and the hints thrown out now 0 and then that, for one cause or another, c it may fail of its object, the more we know 'j from official sources about the whole rail- fi road business of the country and how it * has been and now Is conducted the better. ^ Certain it is that if any combinations exist n which will make the new law Impossible, or li even aimcuit, or application tuey enouiu ? be dissolved. In this matter we are not J likely to face about. The course Is straight t ahead, and the goal Is complete emandpa- o tion from railroad domination. , ,,, , c There is something wrong with our nred- ^ ern ideas of romance.

J t McClellan and Tammany. 1 Mr. McClellan has Tammany "on his ! hands." He could not "shake" the organization If he would, and probably he would not if he could. He must hold on in some fashion, and trust somewhat to luck for "a happy issue out of all his- af flictions." It Is at once an amusing and instructive situation. Amusing in that it shows a worthy man of good abilities trying to make silk purses out of sows' ears, and Instructive in that we have another proof of the fact that tliut little thing cannot be done. All who have ever attempted it?and their number is legion, and they range from * 1-1 ? I. 4L. . 1 uie King un me uuuite iu me pauper in r his hovel?have come to grief. It is writ- , ten that a silk purse cannot be made out of a sow's ear. Sympathy is in a measure wasted on tbs young mayor of New York. He deserves about what he is getting, and is about to g get. He should have known where he a would land when he embarked with sueb companions. Mayor McCtellan, however, seems to have expected implicit obedience , from the whole Tammany outfit. He thought that with the patronage of the city i in his hands he could play his own game I n his own terms. He saw himself the captain of the hosts and supreme ruler. iis purposes toward the city doubtless vpre good. He Is a man of character, and ibove all the temptations of graft and very day skulduggery. But It did not take iim long to discover that many of the initruments through whom he must work vere of a very different order, and that he ould not count upon their assistance howha r?.n fnw f V>om Tr* 'n/>f ?Ci U^il US HI 'bill UV 1UI lllUlli.

At last came the open break with Leader lurphy, and that has been followed >y the Murphy-Hearst coalition, which, In ill of Its phases, is strongly anti-McClel-' an. What, then, is the poor mayor to lo?

SHOOTING STABS. Choice. "Could I have my choice," said the pa:riet, "I would be the man who writes the iongs of a nation."
