Mr. Bryan complains that what the president says on the subject of gov ernment by injunction will not be satisfactory to the laboring men, or to those who respect tho right of trial by. Jury. The president's stand on child labor is commended, as is the position he takes on the elgHt-hour day law and the right of the people to criticise a judge. "Hs pays a deserved tribute to the prog ress of the Japanese nation," on of. id says Mr. Bryan. "There will be general disappointment at the war like tone of his message where he discusses the army and the navy. He speaks of the navy as the surest guarantor of peace whldh this country possesses. Shame upon the chief executive that he should place an instrument of brute force above the nation's sense of Justice as a guarantor of peace."
