In another column of the DEMOCRAT (T, will he found a full and accurate syn |! ©p*is of the fourth ami, thank Provi- j Js- deuce, the last annual message which J the present fraudulent occupant of the <s•. Presidential chair will ever present to BCongre.*.*. This message will not dis- P appoint the anticipations of the public. $ It will be found to be no better, and K probably but little worse, than any one Kexpected from the source irom which Bit spring*. It is a long, dreary docu- B luent, and on only a few of the many V topics with which it deals will it rc- Hceive much consideration. Mr. Hayes K is not at all satisfied with tiie attitude B of the Southern states towards the lif- Btccnth amendment. He declares that || in several of them there is still "cou ■ tinued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the right of citizenship iff Con ("erred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to the Consti §®tutioo." Mr. Hayes dues not refer to a E. scintilla of evidence upon which to ju*- I tifv this charge ; on the contrary, hi K even is forced to admit that at the rc- B cent election the South was free from K open acts of violence and intimidation. BCan he say as much of the North? B-Can he truthfully assert that coercion 1' of voters for the advantage of the Re- E|publican party was not rigorously and practiced throughout a K large portion of the North by wealthy 8| and unsrupulous corporation* and hy Hpauy large manufacturing c-tabii.-h- Burnouts? Rut in the North it was the B white laboring man who was obliged B th r< >ugb fear of his selfish and impcri 1| ous master to vote against hi* houost /conviction*, and of course the baleful evil of intimidation amounts to little or nothing in the opinion* of Repub #Sean statesmen when only a person of ■tjihat class happen* to be the victim of it. It is the plantation negro alone ; whose unhappy lot ha* power to excite ' f stalwart sympathy and demand the ■protection of the law. Abandoning ■the charge of intimidation, however, |Bas untenable, Mr. Haves now says that Bit is by "fraudulent practices" in the Bhmumcr of conducting elections that Bth< South "has been successful in de |R|e;uiug the exercise of the right prc- Kncrvative of all rights, the right of and among these fraudulent Bpr;i< tie©.* he specifies the "counting, Br turning and canvassing of the votes.'' BfThis new charge is decidedly refresh- King. The public ha* uot forgotten, Bjbor will it ever do so, that it was sole lipy through the false and fraudulent returning and canvassing Bjpf the vote" in 1878 that the right of Elffrage was then defeated, and that [is by virtue of the successful frauds I the vidian* who composed the ro- I turning board* of that year that Mr. Baye* occupies hi* present position. ■ Upon the question of civil service re- Bm Mr. Hayes plays the hypocrite list as plainly ID he does in hi* treat ment of the people of the Booth, tjon-idering the ridiculou* figure the ■ministration ha* cut upon this *uh fect it would have been well t<> permit ■ now to slumber in silence. A* the Bashington I'ort aptly remarks," Mr. Hayes might have avoided the ridi iule of his own party and escaped augmenting the contempt of hi* polit leal opponents, if he had seen fit to Bnore his civil service policy. During Be campaign of this year the country ■o- seen the civil service prostitute! B the level of th# Grant era.

Hut ; it is never too late to mend, and let us have civil service reform hy all mean*. i . • 1 Ret ( ongres* at ouce pass a bill that , will prevent members of their branch of the Government from interfering with appointments to civil office and also protect the holder of an office from political assessments. Had Mr. Hayes been in earnest upon this mat ter in the first years of his adminis tration the probabilities are that the Republican corruption fund at the last election would have been short a million or a million and a half of dol lars, and bribery would not have been a controlling element in the contest. There are a few good recommenda tions in the message that deserve the attention of Congress, but it is proba ble that an endorsement of them by this administration will not go far to make them popular. The work of Congress w ill not, therefore, be greatly influenced by anything Mr. Hayes has saiil in hi* last annual communication. The Democratic Party of tho Fu ture. Since the result of the election of la-t November has been fully appre ciated in all its hearings, the Repub lican pres.* has entered 

II|H>II its quad rennial ta.-k of consigning the Demo cratic party to oblivion deep, dark and inaccessible. We are told by the supcrserviceable organs of power that the Democratic party has ceased to exist as a great National political organization, ami that its disinte gration and dissolution will lie fully accomplished before another im portant contest engages the attention of the American people. This as sumption is a most violent one, ami if based upon the result of the Into election has no foundation in fact. Ignoring entirely the proud historic record of the grandest political party that ever exi-ted in the tide of time; a party that holds the loyal allegiance lof its followers as well through the darkness of disaster a- in the noontide splendor of success, we pas,* on to look over the field anil see wherein the Democratic party in the late election showed such conspicuous weakness a* to warrant the oft repeated assertion that it will soon cease to exist as an important factor in the affairs of the Nation. General Hancock represent ' ing the idea* and principles of the Democratic party polled on the "Jd of I la-t November almost four million five hundred thousaud votes, an in ; crease in four years of five hundred thousand votes. This surely does not look like decnv or give evidence of political mortality. Of the thirty eight States in the Union nineteen cast their electoral votes for the can didate of this party which is so soon to sink into an unmarked grave. The popular vote east for General Garfield is only one thousand in excess of that given to General Hancock, while Oar- I field on the total poll is a minority president hy two hundred and fifty | thousand votes. This is a had show- I ing hy the triumphant party which j now seek* to convince the country that it has settled the pretensions of j its great opponent forever. The real cause of the defeat which overtook the Democratic party on the thresh hold of success can be found in New York. Here treachery and incompe tency frittered away the fruits of a victory which had been gathered from the plains of New Jersey and the golden slopes of the Pacific. New York is essentially a Democratic Htatc and is only lost to its faith through internal dissensions, the quarrels of faction and the clash of local ambition. In that Slate in a total poll of nearly nine hun dred thousand votes Garfield's majori ty over Hancock is only twenty thou sand. A change of eleven thousand votes would have reversed the result and saved our Republican friends from the trouble of trying to convince themselves that the great Democratic party is dead. Shortly after the presi dential election a few men whose po-' BELLEFONTE, I'A., THURSDAY, DECEMBER !), 1880. lit icii I convictions have always IICCII often to suspicion, and whoe princi ples are understood to he in the mar ket place, indulged in a great deal of silly talk ahout the dishandnient of the Democratic party. These men are mostly confined to tlit; South and are a species of Southern politician whose services the Democratic party would gladly dispense with. Hut when Stephens, Hill and Ijochrane talk ahout disbanding the Democratic party, they should understand that they can us easily pluck the stars from the firmament of Heaven as tear from the hearts and consciences of four million five hundred thousand free men the undying principles implanted there hy the teachings of the patriotic founders of the Democratic party. And now of all other times in the history of the country i> the existence of the great party of constitutional liberty an imperative necessity. The advocates of a strong government have gained a temporary advantage, and it will require the tireless vigi lance of the Democratic party to pre vent the subversion of our form of government. After eighty years the old struggle which ceased li|on the elevation of .Jefferson to the presiden cy is to he renewed. A disciple of Hamilton and a firm believer in his aristocratic ideas of power, is the president-elect of the Tinted States. He comes but a- the forerunner of the Empire, and it will be the aim as well as the duty of the Democratic party to see that the plots of the conspira tors are overthrown. Should they suc ceed there will he no further necessity for its existence. Hut so long us the Republic lives the Democratic party will live to protect and defend it. When it falls, it is over the dead of the party that sprang into existence at the birth of freedom as exemplified by our government of law ami liberty. The Democratic party stand* between the constitution and the hold amhiti on* men who would pervert it* mean ing and override it* guaranties. The battle will rage with desperation dur ing the forthcoming administration of Garfield, who will use nil his power in the interest of centralization, but he will find constantly in hi* front an aggressive and unflagging opposition that will contest the encroachments of the Federal government step hy step. The Democratic party is not dead, gentlemen, neither docs it sleep. .. THK proposition to create a life tenure in the Senate for ex-Presidents has for the present liecn abandoned. As the empire i* only in abeyance, the movement was found to le rather pre vious, hut the endowment, or pension ing of the expectant Kmperor with immense wealth still progresses with ' decided success, and so far the flunkies are happy. An ndditionnl $100,(100 has been subscribed in Philadelphia. C'oNKi.iso lias undoubtedly captur ed Grant, for it is now authoritatively announced that Gov. Hoyt is the Cam eron candidate selected to defeat (irow for senator from Pennsylvania. The Governor will at least make as credit able a Senator as the State deserves at present, and his election will serve as a proper rebuke to the traveling solicitor who can serve upon any side that may probably be in position to contribute to his aspiration*. MR. HAYES, in his invitation to the dinner given to the President-elect at the White House, failed to invite Sena tors Hlaine and Edmund*. They were both in the city, and their friends ex press indignation at the neglect. Ig noring the presence of two such prom, nent Republican senators could scarce ly be the result of accident. - - IT is announced that Senator Wal lace will be called to the presidency of a railroad company when he retires from the Senate. The location of tho road is not indicated, but if it needs brilliant ability, untiring energy and industry in ita management, Wallace is the man to make it boom. WHAT HAYES SUGGESTS.

Tho lust uniiuiil message of Mr. Hayes i which wii* read before the two House* I of Congress, yesterday, opens with the , usual congratulations upon the prosper- I ity of tho country, h then refers at some length to the late election and I the popular acceptance of the results ; ** a significant example of the peaceful : and sit!.- transmission of power trorn i one Administration to another, yet take* occasion to remark that in the I late slaveholding Slates there is still more or lens opposition to the full and , free enjoyment of the r'glits of citizen | ship. Happily, however "the history ! of the late election shows that in many ! parts oi tho country where opposition : to the I dteenlh amendment has here j lofore prevailed, it is diminishing and i* j likely to cease altogether, it firm and ! well considered action i* taken hy Con gress. ' Mr. Haves trusts, therefore, "that the House of K-presentatives ; and the Senate, which have the right to |judge of the elections, returns and qualification* ol tiicir own members, | will see to it tliut every case of violation |of the letter or spirit ol the Fifteenth -amendment i* thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit Irmn such violation shall acrue to any person or party." lie further recommends, in this con nection, " that Congress, by suitable i legislation, and with proper safeguards, ; supplement the loc.il educational luuds in Ihe sever d Slates, where the grave duties and responsibility of citizenship I have been devolved on uneducated j people, by devoting to the purpose ! grants of the public land*, and, if ne j cessarjr, by appropriations from the i I'reHMiiy ol the I'ruled State*." Proceeding to consider the subject of civil service retorm, and alluding to hi* former appeals for tbe reformation of the present system, he says: " My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments for per j tonal or partisan considerations, have I been strengthened hy tny observation i and experience in the Executive ollice, j and I believe these dangers threaten : the stability of the tiovennment. J Abuses so serious in their nature can ! not be permanently tolerated. Tliey j tend to become more alarming with the | enlargement of Administrative service, j a* the growth of the country increases the ruim!>er of officers and placemen | employed. The reasons are imperative 1 for I fie adoption of fixed rules for the ! regulation of appointments, promo i ttons, and removals, establishing a unt form method having exclusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal right of all citizen* and the most economical and efficient administration r,f the public business."' The importance of competitive exam inations is thereupon considered and an annual appropriation of $2.">,000 re commended "to meetßie expenses of a commission to be appointed by the Pre i sident in accordance with the terms of this section, <+bn*e duty it shall lie to devise a just, uniform and efficient sys tem of competitive examinations, and | to supervise the application of the same ! throughout the entire civil service of ilie Government." Further, while every oHicer should be left as free as any other citizen to exprw*s his political opinions and to use his mean* tor their advance ment. there should he some legislation enabling him "to lee! as safe a* any pri vate citizen in refusing all demands j upon his salary for political purposes. | I.he first step, however, in the reform of the civil service must be a complete di ' rorce between I?ongre*s and the Execu tive in the matter of appointments. "It is therefore recommended that an l act be passed defining the relations of members of f'ongress with respect to appointments to office by the President, I and I also recommend that the provis ions of section 1767, and of the sect ions following, of the Revised Statutes, com prising the tenure of office act, of March < 2, 1 Kti7, be repealed." A* to polygamy in i'tah or elsewhere, he says that the system will never be : abolished a* long as the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice and uphold the crime. He therefore j recommends "that Congress provide for 1 the government of Utah by a Governor and judges, or commissioners appointed by tfie President and confirmed by the ■Senate—a government analogous to the ( provisional government established for I the territory northwest of the Ohio, by ! the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue tbe existing lorm of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and •it on juries in the Territory of Utah, i>e confined to those who neither prac tice or uphold |>olygamy." Our relations with foreign govern ment* remain in a condition of undia turned peace, and within a few weeka post Mr. Huyes his received a commu nication from the English government indicatinga disposition toward* a friend ly adjustment of all differences concern ing the rights of American fishermen under the Treaty ol Washington and the subject of indemnity for the out rages ex|>erienced at Fortune Bay. The message further informs us that the United Hlates was honorably repre sented at the Australian exhibition, and very successfully no at the International exhibition of fiah and fisheries, at Ber lin ; that a convention has been ratified for t lie settlement of claims against, or in favor of the French republic; that the international commission on weights and measures slill continues its work at Paris, and thstan appropriation i* need ed to enable thi* Government to com ply with its obligations under the metrical convention, ami thai tho Spanish government is investigating the action of one of its armed cruisers in sear ching several vessels of our merchant marine in neutral waters, with a view to expia Mali bp and reparation. Mr. TrescoV . one ol the commission ers to China from the United States, is now or. hi* way home with the treaties that have been agreed upon, and will probably be able to lay them before the Senate early in January. A convention has been negotiated with •I a pan lor the reciprocal relief of ship wrecked seamen, and the Japanese | government has made suitable provision , lor the accommodation of the American ( legation at ita capital. The recorn | inundations are renewed that whatever portions of the indemnity funds receiv ed some years ago from China and Japan are due to American citizens should be | paid and the residue returned. , There is reason to believe that obsta j cle* which have so long prevented rapid ; and convenient communication between | the United States and Mexico hy rail j way* are on the point of disappearing, 1 and that several important enterprises I of tins character will soon be set on foot | which cannot fail to contribute largely ( to I lie prosper ity of both countries. I he views expressed in a special mes sage to 'ongres*, in March la*t, relating j to the project of an inter-oceanic canal - across the Isthmus of I'anaina, to he j built by private capital under a conces j -ion from the Columbian government I lor that purpose, are reiteruted to the effect "that it is tfie right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain sucli supervision and authority over any inter oceanic canal across tbe isthmus that connects North and South America us will protect our National intere-t." Mr. Hayes "regrets to announce that the measures which the minister* of the I nited States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not success ful. In tfie course of the war some question* have ansen affecting neutral light*; in all of these the ministers of the I nited State* have, under their in structions, acted with promptness and energy in the protection ol American interests." In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitation* have been extended to foreign maritime State* to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning the Ist of I January. The acceptance of this invi tation i.y many prominent l'owers give* promtee of success in thi* important measure, designed to etabh*h a system 'of international notification, by which the spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be more effectively chock ed or prevented. The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge tlie* trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular officers and through ! the dissemination of information ob tained from them, have been unrelax cd. "Especially important is it," says Mr. Hayes, "that our commercial rela lions with the Atlantic and I'acific coasts of South America, with the West Indie* and the (full of Mexico should he direct, and not through tbe circuit of European systems, and should bo carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the I'acific ocean give* to commerce with Japan. China, and the East Indie*, with Australia and ♦be island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, A due pro|>ortiun of thi* trade." As will be seen by the report of the i Secretary of the Treasury, the condition of the financial nfi'sir* of the Govern ment are satisfactory and the views of the Secretary as to prompt legislation enabling him to complete the refund ing ot the debt about to mature, are recommended. Mr. Hayes also repeats what was said in his message U*t year; "that the retirement from circulation of United States notes, there being s34f>,- 681,016 of them still in existence, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress towards a safe and stable cur rency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people." Referring to the question of stiver coinage.it is staled that the Constitu tion, "in express terms, recognizee both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating me dium of exchange to the disparagement of important interests. 'I he United States producer more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metal* which furnish the coin age of the world. It will, in my judg ment, contribute to this result if Con gress will re|eal so much of existing legislation aa requires the coinage of silver dollars containiug only 412j grains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with gold dollars." Mr. Hayes concurs in the recom mendation of the War department that the Army be increased to 30,000 en listed men. He somewhat tacitly suggests an im provement of our National defenses; recommend* a comprehensive improve ment of the Mississippi and iu tributa ries; urge* certain measures for the

The legislation of the Unit ed States contains many precedents for I the recognition of distinguished milita ry merit, authorizing rank and etnolu j nients to be conferred for eminent ser ! vices to the country. An act of Con gress authorizing the ap[>ointrnent of a • aptain-Cerieral of the Army, with suit able provisions relating to compensn | lion, retirement, and other details, j would, in rny judgment, be altogether | fitting and proper, and would be warm- I ly approved by the country." 1 he attention of Congress is invited j to the suggestions ol the Postmaster General in regard to postal savings, to what the Secretary of the Navy says about building up our commercial ma rine and to the recommendation of the Attorney General that an intermediate I court ol errors and appeals be estab lished. Ihe hope is expressed that specific appropriations will be made for the maintenance of the Indian schools, and . the views of the Secretary of the Inte i rior favoring the allotment of reserva j lion lands in severalty to the Indians j are concurrrd in. legislation is also | asked for the codification of the land ! laws, for the protection of public timber ! lands, for extending the operations of the geological survey over the entire j country anil for creating an educational lund from the proceeds of the sales of i public lands,for distribution among the ' Mate* and Territories. In conclusion Mr. Hayes recommends a number of good things for the Ihstrict of Columbia. MB. 

HAYES, having by fraud upon i the ballot, enjoyed the office of Presi dent to which he was not elected, with an aunual salary of $50,000, to which he was not entitled, has now the mo ; dest assurance in his closing address to j Congress to urge the propriety of pro viding for the purity of the ballot Any act of Congress to give due weight to the vote of the people and ! protect them fmm the frauds of the villains who have served Mr. Hayes and his party so faithfully, will obtain the highest appreciation, but to be call 's! to the performance of this duty by the creature of the stujiendous fraud of ■ l*"bis disgusting in the extreme,and is only equaled by its impudence.
