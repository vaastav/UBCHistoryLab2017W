SViittoii and compiled for tbe lit 11.11 I?. Congress has met, organized.and nail the President s message. The .-senate has gone to work \v th Senator Sherman in the Vice PresJ dent's chair, and the 1 loose ot l.fpreseiitatives, svith Mr. Carlisle is presidiug otlieer, is discussing a ie\ ising of its rules. The opening scenes of tho Forty Ninth Congress were similar to those of the Forth-Figbth, Forth -s.seiitli FoitlisiMli, and mans others of the past. There svas the same rush to the Capitol. Ibero ssr)e ciowded galleries and corri? dors, and the same turbulent scenes on the Moor of the House, to svliich members old anil nesv contributed. In tin? Senate tbe old tuno dignity, decorum ami ?luietude prevailed, and the old familiar faces were at their desks. The opening proceedings of this CongWOB wet? necesisarily unexcit? ing, but the session promises to be a lively oue for hiisnii Senate at least will bo a working buis, and it is likely to supply ma teiial lot much excitement bebue its close. The President's message has <>t ourse been tho chief sol'.iect of eomment for several days. Opin ion? expressed even by Democratic Senators and Members have varied so much that it would be imposai ble to tell the drift of their criti? cism. An almost unanimous com iinnt and regret was that the pa? per was too long. Some of tho more conservative Mepubbeau Senators have said that tho mess? age svas Baute valuable for the in foi mation contained in it than for pinions o\pressed or policy advocated, senator I/>gan said he svould express his views on the Hoor of tho .-entile. Tho aggress ive Senator from Kansas, Mr. Ingalls, characterized the d"cu nient an an incoherent mass of dogmatic platitudes, unrelieved by a single novel idea. The sugge? tit'iis about silver, he said, wen old ami shallow. The financial chapter in the m? ?s.igf 1,-d to the most criticism. Tbs ?ilver men of tho South and >v est aie in arms against the views of the President ami the Secretary of the Tieastiry on this a?t The position of tho Administration will has?- no effect in ci the.r polioy. It beiag admitted that the ta)ill and silver (|iieations will be dealt With by this I ougrt'S?, the wide divergence of opiniou upon them, BBBOBg mi n of the same party tends to increase tho inte.-est. The advocates of silver coinage say the President has simply repeated the old won out arguments of Wall street. Mut I)i mociats, as a rule, who ditlei from Mr. Cleveland an? nul inclined to express their antago? nism publicly. \ large list of President nomina? tions made during the recess of the Senate have been sent in for con firBBStiea, Somoof them are like Is to be revoked.
