Half masted flags of red, yellow and black fly from the puolic buildings. Crowds fill the streets and discuss the king's death and. whatever their opinions of his personal life, join in tributes to his greatness. Leopold died as he lived, relentlessly repulsing his opponents and clinging tenaciously to his favorites; and at death's brink, when he insisted upon closing u,d certain private business ne gotiations, he was unable to escape the Influence of his greatest passion, that for work and material gain. r 'f - &A i w " W$A ST" tea 3 fu o" 'o"r::slv fill Prince Albert, Son of Ijeonold s Youngest Brollier, the Late Prince Philippe, Who Will Succeed to the Belgium Throne. Princess Louise of Belgium, eldest of the three daughters, arrived here today. The second daughter, the un fortunate Stephani. was here when her father died, but was refused permis sion to sec him until after dfath. When she was admitted to the chamber she threw herself beside the body in a utate of uncontrolled grief. Prince Al bert, the new kins, was moved with pity, and, seizing his cousin's hand, 1 nelt with her beside tho body, giv ing mute expression to his sympathy for and intended protection of the ban ished daughter. The group of old ser vants, who loved all three, wept at the sad picture. King Leopold fought death as he bad fought the world and struggled to the end. For two days he had survived r.n operation that wmild have killed the average man of hi? age and only a moment before his sudden death he had talked of revisiting sunny southern France and "of the blue skies of the Mditerranean. The funeral will be held next Wed nesday. He had expressed a wish for the simplest rites, but it is understood the ceremonial observed at the burial of his father Leopold I. will be follow ed. Prince Albert will on Thursday take the oath as king. The body,, of the king, cloth ed in the uniform of a lieutenant general, remains in the chambler of the palms" where death entered last night. It is surrounded only by those who in life had won and had retained the king's close friendship. The ex pression on the dead monarch's face is peaceful, as though the end was pain less. The body will be placed in a casket this evening when a period of mourning officially will begin. Dr. Thirir said today: "I knew that the king was suffering from a malady of the heart. This was our chief anxiety when operating, but we decided to resort to surgery in or der to save his majesty from terrible suffering. As a matter of fact he died without suffering at all." Immediately following Leopold's death two nuns laid out the body, and preparations for removing it to the city proper were made. The obsequies will take place at the Collegiate church of St. Gudula. Temporary Regency. This morning early Premier Schol ia ert proceeded to the palace and under his direction the official Moniteur pub lished a special number announcing the formation of a regency council composed of council and ministers which will nominally hold the reins of government until the heir to the throne. Prince Albert, has taken the oath of ascension. I Gofflnet, private secretary to King Leopold, who is greatly affected by tha sudden termination of his majesty's ill ness, described the scene at the palace, "The king's body," said the baron, "rests on his bed. His expression is peaceful. All the household are in tears gathered about the body. WTe have in formed the ministers of the sad event." The newspaper correspondents were Dot permitted in the palace this morn lag. It is said that Leopold's will consti tutes a good sized volume. The Princess Clementine and her sis ter Stephanie, with the Countess of FlanCcrs. left the palace at an early hour. They were followed soon by his majesty's intimate friend, Baroness Vaughan. Death of the King. Brussels, Dec. 17. King Leopold of Leopold II, Kim of Belgium, Wlio Died This Morning. Belgium died at 2:35 o'clock this morn ing, his aged and wasted body being unable to stand the strain put upon it. The collapse occurred suddenly- and at a moment when the doctors seemingly had the greatest hopes for his recovery. Throughout yesterday bulletins issued from the sick room indicated progress ive improvement. The bulletin posted at 6;30 p. m. gave the king's tempera ture, pulse and respiration practically normal. Apparently the drainage of L i iv- n wuini do iicxk, uu L. V. I nasi present during the day,- the king had' been able to take nourishment. The public at large was satisfied th"5 king was on the road to recovery but within the pavillion, where the king lay "there -was a feeling of "anxiety chiefly because of Leopold's great age. - After a restful day the patient was able to sleep for a brief period early in the evening, and the night passed quiet ly. But toward 2 o'clock alarming symptoms appeared. Suddenly the king turned and called to Dr. . Tiriar J'Etouffe, "Doctuer J'Etouffe, I am suf focating." Dr. De Page was summoned and the two physicians did everything possible to prolong life, but without avail. The end came quickly and, after a spell of weakness, peacefully. Prince Albert Arrive. Prince Albert arrived at the death bed about 25 minutes later. He was accompanied by Princess Clementine. Albert kissed" the dead king and left the chamber weeping. Baron Gofflnet. the king's secretary, started immediately for . Brussels to notify the royal family. Shortly after the end came, the min isters were notified. The first official to arrive at the death chamber Mvas the royal chaplain. The ministers remained in the chamber for a considerable time, discussing in- subdued tones the sud den death and matters of state. The king's coolness and courage dur ing the heroic struggle won the ad miration of all, for at no time did he seem to fear the result. Now that he is dead it is believed he was able to Burvive so long by the sheer force of his mentclity. . . When Gofflnet emerged from the high walls of the royal gardens : his pale face startled the newspaper correspond ents who "were huddled together outside. He paused for a . moment and said solemnly, "The king .is dead." The Belgian peoplo are heatedly occur pied with the question as to the posi tion of Earone,s Vaughan in the royal household, as the result of a sensation al article published in the Soir, The (Continued on Page Six.)

ZELAYAJS OUT. President of Nicaragua Tenders Resignation From the Presidency, in a Mes sage to Congress. TO STOP BLOODSHED And Prevent Intervention hy the United States. Successor Will Be Chosen hy . Legislative Body.. Managua, Nicaragua, ' Dec. 17. President Zelaya last night cabled a conciliatory message to President Taft, saying that he had shown his good faith by resigning in order that Nicaragua . might resume friendly relations with the L'nited States. He added that he proposed to leave the country, but stood ready to account for his acts as president. ' Managua. Nicaragua, . Dec. 17. Jose Santos Zelaya has resigned from the presidency of Nicaragua. He has placed his resignation- in the hands of con gress- Apparently there was no other course for him to take. The people were at Jast aroused. . The guns of the rev olutionists threatened, the warships of the United States lay in Niearaguan ports. Managua has been seething for days. The spirit of revolt has spread even to the gates of the palace. Zelaya sur rounded himself with an armed guard. Unchecked, the populace have marched through the streets crying for the end of the old proclaiming the new regime. Who will take up the reins no one knows or cares. It is sufficient that Zelaya as dictator will be known no more. There is no doubt that congress will act quickly on his resignation, for the people have demanded it. Dr Jose Madriz, Judge of the Central Ameri can court of justice at Cartage, who has. been close to Zelaya, and is now his choice for president, is oh his way here. He will arrive on Saturday. Madriz had -hia following strong and in fluential even among the revolutionists, but General Estiada. under whose com mand the great body of fighting insur gents now face Vasquez's : troops at Rama, will have none of him. Estrada's word will bear weight in the choice of president. Zelaya has known, too, that Madriz is not acceptable to the United States, and he has sought to learn who would be looked upon with favor by that government as . his successor, but the American government so far as can be learned, has named no man, and the choice probably will lie with those who lave gained the upper Tiaoid; . ;V An Act of Abnegation. Accoivipariyinr his resignation, - Ze laya sent the following message to con press: . , -' "The painXul circumstances . in which the. country is plunged caii for acts of abnegation and patriotism on the par of the good citizens who are "the wit nesses of the oppression of the repub lic bv the heavy hand . of fate. The country is staggering under a shame less revolution which threatens the na tion's sovereignty and a foreign nation unjustly intervenes In our crisis pub licly providing the rebels with arms, which has only resulted in' their being defeated everywhere through the hero ism of our troops. ' "To avoid further bloodshed, and for the reason that the revolutionists have declared that they would put down their arms when I surrendered the ex ecutive power, I hereby place in the hands of the national assembly the abandonment of the remainder of my term of office, which is to be filled by a substitute of their choosing with the hope that this- will result in good to Nicaragua the. re-establishment of peace and particularly the suspension of the. hostilities of the United States to which I do not wish to give a pre text for intervention." A commission of five deputies was appointed to draft a bill looking to the which is now considered a mere for mality. News of the president's ac tion spread throughout the city and oon great crowds moved through the streets, shouting for the United States and Kstrada and the revolution. Held in control for years by the strong hand of Zelaya. the people have been quick to break through restraint when it was certain that the tlictator could not breast the tide that has been rising against him. During the latter days. Zeiaya has resorted to all the known tricks and contrivances to hold the peo ple of Managua with him. Reports of a; government victory at Rama have been. frly circulated, and rumors that a massacre of revolutionists had oc curred were allowed to spread unchal lenged and under.ied.

A Mexican working with a railroad gang, was r accidentally; .Jcilled by a fellow countryman who'.was handling a - gun. The shot penetrated his heart. The fact that :it -was purely accidental was so evident that no ac tion was taken by the sheriff. SHE COMES TO LIFE. Miss XeUic Burns Had Been Declared Legally Dead. St. Louis, Dec. 17.--Miss Nellie Burns missing for ' eleven years, and declared legally dead three days ago by the St. Louis circuit court, has proved that the court' decree was wrong. As a consequence the girl's foster mother, Mrs. Annie Bosse, 4218 Lucky street, St. Louis, resigned let ters of administration granted her by the probate court and , caused to be dismissed a suit in which she had al ready won a Judgment against a life insurance company. The two women met today for the first time since October. 18, 1898, when Miss Burns disappeared on her way to school. She was only 8 years old then but Mrs. Bosse declared her self satisfied as to the identity of the young woman, i , ., It had always been Bupposed by Mrs. Bosse and the police that Nellie had been kidnaped. Her story dis proved this. "I was on my way to school with a girl about my own age." she said, "when two men, my father and my uncle, seized me and despite my kick ing and screaming, placed me in a buggy and drove to a house on Day ton street. Father told me this was to be my home and that .1 would never see mother Bosse again- "I grieved over, the change for a time. then, like most, children forgot my troubles'. A few years later, we moved ' across the river to East St. Louis and when I became older I went to work in a department store." ; The girl s father is Daniel Burns, an engineer. He and his wife were living apart when the latter died, di recting that Nellie be given into the care of Mrs. Bosse.. , . i Both -Mrs. Burns and Mrs. Bosse had taken out insurance policies on the girl's life.

President Taft left Washington this afternoon for Watertown, Conn., where he will to morrow attend .the funeral of Mrs. Horace B. Taft. wife of his brother. Mrs. Taft died last night in a hospital at Baltimore. The president probably will return to Washington Sunday- morning. It is probable that the presi dent will cancel nearly all social en gagements for the White House for some time to come. The president was deeply grieved to learn of the death of his sister-in-law, although it was not entirely unexpect ed. It was said formal announcement of any changes that may be decided upon in the social program at the White House will be made after the president returns to Washington Sun day morning. HER 

DIVORCE STANDS. Mrs. Guggenheim's Petition to Annul It Is Denied. Chicago, Dec. 17. Judge Honore today entered an order in the circuit court de nying to Mrs. Grace B. Guggenheim the right to file a petition asking that the decree of divorce obtained by her in 1901, from William Guggenheim, one of the Guggenheims of smelter fame, be set aside. The woman who married again short ly after the decree was entered has been seeking to have the decree an nulled on the ground that it was ob tained by fraud, she not having been a citizen of Illinois when the case was tried. The attempt to annul the decree was combated by counsel for William Gug genheim, who also has married again. MERCURY TAKES A DROP Down to Seven Degrees for Three , Hours TWs Morning. The efforts of the mercury to get down to zero were unsuccessful this morning. The minimum was reached a few minutes before 8 o'clock this morning, when C above zero was reg istered. . The forecast is for a continu ation of below freezing weather, accom panied by "snow storms tonight and Saturday. This afternoon the wind blows 12 miles an hour from Medicine Hat and the hourly temperatures are recorded thus: 7 o'clock 7 I 11 o'clock... 8 8 o'clock 7 i 12 o'clock 10 i- o'clock 7 I 1 o'clock 11 1(. o'clock 8 I 2 o'clock.... 12 Sending Christmas Packages. Patrons of the Topeka postoffice are taking advantage of the suggestions offered by the postmaster with regard to the early dispatch of Christmas gifts and packages. Postmaster A. K. Rodgers said this morning that they are. adapting themselves readily to the proper thing to do along this line, and that much of the congestion several days before and a week after Christ mas, will thus be obviated.-- -' MAY BE MURDER. County Attorney Decides to In vestigate Richards Deaths. Bodies Will Be Exhumed and Examination Made. MYSTERY IN TRAGEDY. Douht Whether Gas Could Have Caused Deaths. Coroner's Inquest May Be Held Following Autopsy. The suspicion entertained by County Attorney J. J. Schenck and Sheriff J. D. Norton that foul play figured in the strange death of the Richards . family last Sunday afternoon at the home at 1225 Lincoln street, has resulted in the decision of the attorney to have the bodies exhumed and a thorough post mortem examination held under the supervision of Coroner H. H. Keith. The uncanny sight which met the sight of Mrs. Thomas P. Richards, a daughter of E. H. Hewins, when she returned from a visit to her father's house her husband lying at the foot of a window, dead, his father, John P Richards, sitting dead in a chair and his mother lying dead in another room cn the beck -and which- has- given her nervous prostration, has- impelled the officers to a more thorough investiga tion. The deaths were readily attributed to gas fumes and so plausibly that the coroner decided that an inquest was unnecessary. Yet there was a suspic ion that the older Richards had been robbed. That, too. was finally scouted, however, and the matter was apparent ly dropped. County Attorney Schenck made the following statement: "The case has been one of the most peculiar on record and at first there did not seem to be a suspicion as to any thing criminal. Later developments, J however, as various conjectures have been thrown aside as improbable if not impossible, make me believe there may have ' been something criminal behind the deaths and if that is true, we want to know it by all means. "I accuse nobody. It is possible I never shall accuse anybody. But the circumstances surrounding the death of three grown persons in broad daylight at their home in the city is so strange and the manner of death has lacked so much of a satisfactory explanation that I believe the only thing to do will be to exhume the bodies and subject them to a severe examination." One of the points seriously considered as -discrediting the theory that death resulted .frpm,. inhaling . gas fumes is that the bodies when found had been dead several hours. They ..were discov ered by Mrs. Richards at 5:30 o'clock. She had left all three well and uncom plaining about noon. Hence if they had been dead several hours they must have expired shortly after she had gone out.- Suppositions differ as to the length of time in which gas fumed would cause asphyxiation. Many questions have arisen since the tragedy in many minds and both Sheriff Norton and Coroner Keith have been plied with questions of those who are not satisfied with the earlier decisions. The thousands of people using gas for fuel have also been questioning them selves and friends concerning the ad visability of continuing to do so. "I can not believe," said the county attorney, "that three persons in their right minds should nave Deen asleep in the middle of the day and that the gas fumes should become so strong as to asphyxiate them without any. of them detecting the danger. The fumes did not prevent Mrs. Richards from en tering the rooms several hours later when they should surely have been much stronger. And why did not the gas explode when Mrs, Richards struck a match." "An inquest will not be called," said Sheriff Norton, "until after a thorough examination of the bodies and their Vital organs has been made and rea sons found for such action. No specific time has yet been set for exhuming the bodies but it will likely be soon." STILL IN A DEADLOCK. No selection of National . League President in Sight. -New York, Dec. 17. The mag nates of the National league were ap parently in a complete deadlock to day when they met again to select a president, and Charles W. Murphy, president of the Chicago club, ad mitted his readiness. to sit all winter if necessary to elect John M. Ward, as the head of the organization. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Brooklyn presented today an un broken front for the selection of Ward, while Cincinnati. Pittsburg, Boston and St. Louis were seeking to elect Robert W. Brown of Louisville, or some compromise candidate. As suggested by Ward yesterday the magnates 'will -likely become hope lessly deadlocked and Mr. Heydler will continue to-hold the office of president while a board of three regents would probably be appointed to conduct the affairs of the league. The move of Garry Herrmann in bringing forward the name of Mr. Brown for president yesterday instead of Mr. Heydler was regarded today as an extremely strategic one in asmuch as it assured Mr Herrmann and his friends the absolute support of Stanley Robison, who favored Mr. Brown. Mr. Herrmann Is now in a position to ' offer the name of Mr. Heydler as a compromise candidate. Mr. Herrmann said today: "You know - as much about' the election as I do I think it a shame that a good man like Heydler should be thrown out of a job or,, if , he is thrown out. not taken care of., The present situation is ridiculous, because we can not elect our board of direc tors until after,; we have elected our president." Herrmann said he proposed to look after Mr. Heydler in case he was not elected. - . As the day wore on - prospects, of a break in the deadlock over the presi dency did not improve. Statements of some of the magnates made it look as if each of the two sides to the contest was more bitter than ever. . Garry , Herrmann, president of the Cincinnati club, declared . that an iron clad agreement had been reached by Brown's supporters not to vote for Ward in any .circumstance. "The Pittsburg, Boston. St. Louis and Cincinnati clubs' representatives - have pledged themselves not to vote for Ward, whatever happens," said Herr mann. "Ward can . not possibly be elected." 4 "Then if his supporters stick togeth er there . can be nothing but a dead lock?" was suggested. "That seems to be about the size of it,'' replied Herrmann. It was understood that the anti-Ward men got together in conference to de cide their future course. No one show ed signs of weakening, and the adoption of the pledge to stand pat against Ward was cheerfully taken. . , - . . Heydler's stock took a sudden boom this afternoon when it became known that the National league by-laws had received an important amendment. Finding themselves deadlocked over the election of a president, the mem bers yesterday voted that in the event of a vacancy either In the presidency, either from death, resignation or fail ure to elect, the directors should be empowered to name a president to act until the league members should have a chance to elect. Since the directors of the league are Dovey of Boston, Herrmann of Cincinnati, Dreyfus of Pittsburg, Murphy of Chicago, and Ebbetta of Brooklyn and the first named three are Heydler men, it is evident that If the meetine oroved hopelessly deadlocked Heydler might De cnosen as nis own "acting" suc cessor, and would hold office in definitely as long as the representa tives of the eight clubs remain the same and retain their present opinions.
