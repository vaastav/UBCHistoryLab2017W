REPEAL THE INCOME TAX. Congressman Bnrtlett Introduces a Dill for that Purpose. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, The first bill Introduced In the House to-day was one by Mr. Bartlett (Dem., N. Y.) to repeal the Income tax provisions of the Tariff law. Mr. Curtis, of New York, Introduced a bill to restrict the appointment of cadets to West Point and the Naval Academy to one actual resident of the Congres sional districts, one from each Territory and the District of Columbia and ten to be appointed at large by the President. Representative -McMUlln, of Tennessee, who was the prime mover for an Income Tax law, says there Is no danger that It will be repealed or that there will be no appropriation for It this year. Chairman Sayers, of the House Com mittee on Appropriations, says that the Income tax will be provided for In the Urgency Deficiency bill. AT THE 

WHITE HOUSE.- President Clerelnnd Leaves 'Wood ley for the Executive Mansion. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-Presldent Cleveland camo to the White House from Woodley at 10 o'clock this morning. It was the first visit he had mado to the city In two weeks past. He came alone and was met by Mr. Thurber when he entered. The Presi dent looked very well, considering the severe Illness he has suffered from, and the only outward sign of his ailment was tho pronounced limp which charac terized his walk from the carriage Into the house. Probably because his coming had not been generally expected, there were very few callers at the White House In the morning, the only one of note being Representative Catchlngs, of Mississippi, who. In behalf of the Speaker, came to Inquire whether the President would re ceive the Committee of Notification at the White House. 

HAVEMEYERS SPEECHLESS. They nrfnse to Comment Upon the President's MeiMge, The President's message was In the hands of the Sugar Trust officials long before Us publication In the afternoon papers. When an "livening World" reporter saw the secretary, John E. Searles, at tho offices, 117 Wall street, the latter was visibly excited. He had Juet come from a conference with Theodore A. and II. O. Havemeyer. "You must see Mr. Havemeyer either of them will do.'he said. "I have notic ing to say concerning - the i President's message." " When 11. O. Havemeyer was .seen im mediately afterwards he said:,..'", "See my brother, Theodore. I cannot talk about It." . - When Theodore A. Havemeyer was seen he said:, "See my brother, H. O. He will talk. J "annot." Both Havemeyrs were seen together half an hour later. When approached they cried In unison: "I have an Important business meet ing to attend." Isaac Sellgman, of the firm of J. & W. Sellgman Ci Co., brokers, 21 Broad street, said: "President Cleveland's attitude on the drain on our gold reserve. Its cause and remedy, Is perfectly sound. His remarks on the lack of elasticity in our currency circulation and Us frequent concentra tion In financial circles, when It ' Is most needed In other parts of the coun try, are equally sound. "I believe that Congress should promptly authorise the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a gold bond, say a 3-por-cent bond. This would relieve the drain upon our gold reserve and make solid our credit" Henry Clews said: " The President's message Is of com paratively little Importance. It will have but little effect upon legislation during the present short session of Congress, as under the existing circumstances, alb measures that may be Introduced will be Inspired by members of Congress and not by the Executive. " No pop-gun legislation, or other dis turbing measures can possibly become law during this term of Congress." HIS

Bishop Cotter, of Winona, In an Interview, de nies that Archbishop Ireland Is finan cially embarrassed. He says that Archbishop Ireland's vast property has all been given to diocesan usages, and the panic has helped to make It difficult. to pay the tax's and Improve ments.

Rtook Fricea Bulod Higher in Into Trading. Sugar Rallied and Coalers and Grangers Were Stronger. A rise in sterling exchange to 4.S71-J and 4.89, which revived the talk about gold shlpmonts by this week's steamers, wa availed ot by the bears to hammer the stock market at the opening. Prices yielded 1-1 to 1 1-S per cent.., with Sugar and Chicago Oas In the lead. The sellers were getting along swimmingly, when suddenly heavy buy ing orders appeared and the complexion of affairs underwent a complete. change. A feature of the dealings was the ac tive demand for Northwest, over 10,000 shares being taken during the first hour from 9S1-S up to 99 8ugar was purchased In blocks from 84 5- up to 80 f-4. Chicago Oas rose. 1 3-8, to 701-8; Burlington 5-8, to 697-8; Canada Southern 7-8, to 81; St. Psul 1-2, to 891-8; Bock Island 1-2, to 611-1; Louis ville & Nashville G-8. to 54 6-8: Manhat tan, 5-8, to 106 3-4: Missouri Pacific S-4, to 281-4; Jersey Central 1-2, to 94, and Western Union 8-8, to 87 1-2. In the In active Hat American Tobacco jumped 3, to 95. The sharp Jump In Sugar gave rise to rumors that the directors of the Trust would override President Havemeyer and would declare the regular dividend of 3 per cent for the quarter, but this seems hardly poailble.

The early rise In Sucar Induced sales for both accounts and the price ran off 2 6-8, to 84 1-8. The decline was due to advices from Washington that the Presi dent, In bis annual message recom mends the abolition of the one-eighth differential on refined sugar. The stock market gained strength as the day drew to a close, and still higher prices were made. Sugar, after selling down to 82 3-4. rallied to 84.

I would not hesitate to heed any intima tion that our friendly old ror the honor able termination ot hostilities would be acceptable to both belligerents. A convention has been finally concluded for the settlement by n mutation of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing out of the proceedings against Kmlllo Santos, a naturalised citizen of tho United States. Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever In r.'trgoes of American cat tle, the Qermah prohibition against Im portations ot live stock and fresh meals from this country has been revived, it Is hoped that Germany will soon become convinced that the Inhibition Is as need less as It Is harmful to mutual Interests.

IXCIDKNT. Prominent among the questions ot the year "vat thu nideflelds Incident. In what Is known as the Mosquito Indian Strip, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and nlthln the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of '800 between Great Drltaln and Nicaragua the former Government expressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the Strip, and a limited form of self-government was guaranteed -o the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to t.ielr customs, for them selves ond other dwellers within Its llmts. The so-called native Government, which grew to te largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sov ereignty of Nicaragua over the Strip and claimed the right to maintain there in a practically Independent municipal fovetnmnnt. Early In the past year ef oris of Nicaragua to maintain sov ereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances culminating In the suppression of the native Govern ment and h attempted substitution of an Impracticable, composite atlmlnstra tlon, In which Nicaragua and alien resi dents were to participate. Failure was followed by an insurrection which for a time subverted Nfcaraguan rule, expel ling her officers and restoring1 the old organization. This, In turn.' gave place to the existing local government cutub llshed and upheld by Nicaragua. Although tho alien Interests arrayed agaltiBt Nicaragua In these transactions have been largely American, and the commerce ot that region for some time has been and still Is chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot for that reason chnllenge the rightful sover eignty of Nicaragua over this Important part of her domain. For some months one, and during part of the time two, ot our naval ships have been station at Dlueflelds for the protection of all legitimate Interests of our citizens. In September last the Government at Managua expelled from Its territory twelve or more foreigners. Including two Americans, for alleged fiartlclpatlon In the seditious or revo utlonary movements against the re public at Blueflelds already mentioned; but through the earnest remonstrunce of this Government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management ot their business Our naval commanders at the scene of these disturbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good Judg ment, contributed largely to the pre vention of more serious consequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. I regret that In the midst of these occurrences there happened a most grave -and Irritating failure of Nlcaraguan justice. An American citi zen named Wilson, residing at Rama, in the Mosquito territory, was mur dered by one Arguello, the acting Gov ernor of the town. After some delay the murderer was arrested, but so In securely conflned or guarded that he escaped, and, notwithstanding our re peated demands, It Is claimed that his recapture has been Impossible, by rea son of his flight beyond Nlcaraguan Jurisdiction. The Nlcaraguan authorities having given notice of forfeiture of their con cession to the canal company, on grounds purely technical nnd not em braced In tho contract, have receded from that position.

Trance, rortugil, Spain and Sweden In my last annual message I referred briefly to the unsatisfactory state of af fairs In Bamos, under the operation of the llerlln treaty, as signally Illustrating the Impolicy of entangling alliance with foreign powers; and. nn May 9, 1K94, In response to a resolution of the Senate, I sent a special message and documents to that body on tho sarno subject, which emphasized my previously expressed opinions. Later occurrences, the corre spondence In regard to which will be laid before Congress, further demorntrnte that the Government which was devised by the three powers nnd forced upon the Ramoann against their Inveterate hos tility can be maintained only by tho continued presenco of foreign military forco and at no email sacrifice of life and treasure. The Suppression of the Mat.inf.-t Insur rection by the powers, snj the subse quent banishment of the leader ami eleven other chiefs, nn recited In my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the Islands. FormlUable upris ings continued, nnd finally a rebellion broke out In the capital island, Upolu, headed In Anns, the ncstrn district, by the younger Tamaseee, and In Atua, the eastern district, by other leaders.. Tho insurgents ravaged the country and fought the Government's troops up to the vtrv doors of Apia. The King again ap pealed to the powers for help, nnd the combined Hi itlsh nnU German naval forces reduced the Atuans to nppsrent subjection not, however, without con siderable loss to the natives. A few days later Tsmasese and his adherents, fear ing the ships and the marines, professed submission. TIIOMILES I.Y SAMOA. Reports received from our agents at Apia do not Justify the belief that the peace thus brought nbout will bo of long duration. It Is their conviction that the natives are lit heart hoatllo to the present Government; that such of them as profess loyalty to It do so from fear of the powers, and that It would speedily go to pieces If the war ships were withdrawn. In reporting to his Goernment tin the unsatisfactory situ ation since the suppression of the lato levolt by foreign armed forces, the Ger man Consul at Apia stated: "That peaco will be lasting Is hardly to be presumed. The lesson given by firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp and Incisive to leave a lasting impres sion on the forgetful 8amoun tempera ment. In fact, conditions aro existing which show that peace will not last lletoa, the King, and his chiefs are con vinced that the departure of the war ships will be a signal for a renewal of war. The clicumstance that the rep resentatles of the villages of all the districts which were opposed to tho Government have already withdrawn to Atua 'to hold meetings, -anti that both Atua and Anna have forbidden Inhab itants of those dlstrlots Which fought on the side of the Government to return to their vlllagcs'and have already partly burned down the latter. Indicate that a real conciliation of the parties Is still far off." And In a note of the 10th ultimo. In closing a copy of that report for the in formation of this Government, the Ger man Ambassador Hald: "The contents of tho report awakened the Imperial Government's apprehen sion that under existing circumstances the peace concluded with the rebels will afford no assurance of "the lasting res toration of tranquillity In tho Islands." The present Government has utterly failed to correct. If Indeed It has not aggravated, the very evils It was Intend ed to prevent. It has not stimulated our commerce with the Islands. Our participation In Its establishment against the wishes of the natives was In plain defiance of tho conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and patriotic! men who laid the foundations of our free Institutions, and I Invite an expression of the Judgment of Congress on the propriety of steps being taken by this Government looking to tho with drawal from Its engagements with the other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of our existing rights.
