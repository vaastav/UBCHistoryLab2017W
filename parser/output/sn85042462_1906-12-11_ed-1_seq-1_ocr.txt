VOL. XXXIV. NO. 71. GIGANTIC PROJECT STARTED Harriman Interests Ask Franchise of Council Two Ordinances Passed and Others Referred to Attorney Business Men Pleased with Prospect of Railroad Magnate Expending Millions to Better Service to Beaches With E. H. Harrlmnn ns the new dominant figure in Los Angeles street car affairs tho leglslntive machinery has been set at work to regenerate two of the trolley systems here. While H. E. Huntingtou Is in New Tork on business connected with the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Rail way company affairs the Harriman lieutenants are equally busy at the other end of the continent carrying out the reconstruction program here. Whether it be a fight for control of the Huntington lines or whether a merger Is planned, neither fact ap parently will delay work on the hun dreds of miles of rail within Los An geles county controlled by Harriman. The order is to cut the tlmo between Los Angeles, the beach cities and Hollywood, and orders by Harriman are Invariably carried out. While the law department, engineers, trackmen, contractors ami supply firms are rushing to begin Immediate opera tions in tunnels, s' bways and exten sions, Harriman architects are drawing plans for the monster nine-story sta tion building for Hill and fourth, which ■nill ellipse tho Huntington building at Sixth and Main streets. All interests are to dovetail in the cause of speed. All this bears on the trolley situation alone. Port Is New Factor A newer factor is the nlan to bring to Port Los Ancreles much of San Fran cisco's commerce. It is another Harriman Idea, ihat a second San Pedro should be established at the famous long wharf north of Santa Monica. There are natural harbor facilities there now which require only a break water to make adaptable for ocean steamers. Dredging and other en gineering will come later, r>ut the In stallation of a breakwater will make Port Los Angeles an immediate port of no small proportions. Men close to the Harriman clique hnve for two months bought property at Port Los Angeles, which doubtless foreshadows btg railroad yards and warehouse sites. It has a bear! -v too on the latest Harriman i aup In buying control of the Santa Barbara and Ventura railroad systems. This doubtless Is a forerunner of a plan to run electric cars into the rich districts near Santa Barbara, "Ventura, Hueneme and Oxnard. It is even an nounced that water rights and irriga tion works will be developed and land sold In acreage tracts to farmers by a Harrlmnn syndicate. Introduce Ordinances AVithout loss of time the Harriman Interests had four ordinances intro duced in the Los t ngeles city council yesterday furthering their project of connecting and extending the lines of the Los Angeles-Pacific and Interur br.n systems. Two ordinances for the construction of tunnels under the Temple and First fitreet hills ami on Fourth street were introduced first. The council Instructed the city clerk to advertise for bids for the franchises on those. The other to ordinances providing for extensions were also introduced and rflerred to the city attorney to report or. all the legal features connected therewith. No Obstacles Expected It is understood about the city hnll that no obstacle will arise to delay ■work on these gigantic measures as far as legislation Is concerned, and it If thought that within ten days the legislative way will be clear for the Harriman interests, provided they fur nish the usual safeguurds which go w Hh franchises. Judge John D. Pope of the legal de pertment of the Los Angeles-Paelflo and Interurbavn |n *erests was on hand to watch proceedings yesterday. The first petition for a franchise was tor a tv 1 from Hill and Fourth etreets west to Vermont avenue and a private right of way between Fourth n ml Fifth streets for a four track elec tric roail. This ordinance also Includei another tunnel from the north boundary of vi rmont avenue louthweat to tho city 11 itß. This calls for a perpetual franchise. The second perpetual proposition in cluded a proposed tunnel xtenslou from KuiiHet boulevard on Hill street tv Temple. Safeguards fo- City Both of these measures carry safe guards for the city. They require that no cars be permitted to stand on the tracks and obstruct traffic: that (lumen and water pipes be relate!: that roads and walks be regraded. regraveled and repaved If necessary; that the streets he paved for two feet beyond the rails, and that failure to comply with all provisions will work forfeiture of the ordinance. The city also reserves the right to purchase the properties at a valuation to be Heed by a board of arbitrators, one named by the city, another by the railroad company anC a third member ii be chosen by these two., i It the city wishes to buy the franchise It must give. notice to the company at .least a mill In advance.

SAVE B IG SALTON SINK Southern Pacific Will Build New Tracks on High Ground Out of Reach of the Waters By Associated Press. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10.— In re gard to "the break in the Colorado river endangering the Southern Pacific tracks General Manager E. B. Calvin said to day that the reports from Yuma were not encouraging. "I suppose we will have to build a new road," he said. "I received a wire this mrtrnlng stating that the river could again bo controlled, but not In time to save our main line. This means that we will have to go to work at onco and fculld. We have not decided as yet whether we shall build a temporary track for the use of our trains unUl such time as the permanent road Is built. We will have to get closer to the hills an,l so keep out of the reach of the water." By Associated Press. IMPERIAL, Cal., Dec. 10.— The news of the break in the Colorado river proved a serious blow to the spirits of the people, who have yet no plans for the future. There will be no Interrup tion in Irrigation here, excepting pos sibly for a year or two, even though the break is not closed. The entire river has worked back into its channel to the Salton sea, cutting behind the dam. The strength of the da in is shown hy the fact that it is uninjured, the water A-orking through the earth dikes that reach f< r ten miles on either side of it. What is to be done to check the stream is a matter thnt is before the Southern Pacific officials. The present ■work, which has proved inefficient, was the result of two years' experimental work and the expendit-re of thousands of dollars. Unless the channel Is turned before next summer, when the floods from melting snows come, it is practically certain that the waters will have worn such a deep channel for themselves that the Irrigating supply the Im perial and Coachella valleys will be cut off, leaving the farmers there with out any means of carrying on their work. In such an event Yuma would be let I hlifh 'Hid dry and It is possible that the waters would eventually un ilernilne the Laguna dam. General Manager Cory left last night for Tucson to confer with President K|hs Randolph of the California De velopment company as to the next sttps to be taken. The people can only await the action of the Southern Pacific or possibly the government. There Is no farming land near the Sulton sea, so there is no fear of inun dation of any farms for several years, but unless Immediate action Is taken to effect it closure it Is only a question of time when all of the Imperial and Coachella valleys will be inundated.

STORER REPLIES Quotes Letter From Roosevelt Flatly Denies President's Assertions Asks the Calm Perusal of His First Statement, Which, He Says, Was Written for Cool, Careful, Deliberate Judgment By Assoclntrrl Prois. NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—Arch bishop Ireland, who was a central figure in the correspondence of President Roosevelt and Bellamy Storer, just made public, is in the city at the Murray Hill hotel. When visited by reporters last night the archbishop stated that everybody should understand the delicacy of his* position and the impropriety on his part of doing any talking in regard* to the sub ject. 

CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 10.—Bel lamy Storrr, former United States am bassador at Vienna, today gave to the Associated Press the, following state ment in reply to the letter of the presi dent made public yesterday: "My letter to the president and his cabinet whs written for the cool, de liberate Judgment of men who should be kept Informed of the true facts In the conduct of the administration. It was not written for the public or hur riedly given to the press to anticipate public opinion. It stands, when taken in full, as my statement and should be taken as nn entirety, and as such I ask its calm perusal. In itself it Is an an swer to many things the president has seen fit to say, but as new matter has been put forward by Mr. Roosevelt I feel compelled to speak. "There was no need of violent and insulting abjectlves to show that the president dislikes me and did not wish me to remain in the service or retire in the customary way. "While the past has shown that few men can differ with either the wishes or the memory of Mr. Roosevelt" with out at once becoming a scoundrel and a liar, I must make some comments on what he has given out at the White House. "That anything -was ever written to the president by my wife to the effect that 'Mr. Choate and General Porter were not proper persons to be ambas sadors' is news to both of us. For both these distinguished men we have and have had nothing but respect and good will, personally and officially. "As to Mr. Root, the press of 1901 wast full of statements that he might not be able to remain in the cabinet owing to poor health and might be suc ceeded by Mr. Porter, which would leave Paris vacant. "I give a letter from the president In answer to what ho said was written by my wife. I do this both because It is a letter for him to be proud of from its full appreciation of eminent public men (apart from any reference to my selO, and also to show that my wife's letter, to which this was an answer, now spoken of with a sneer, was con sidered differently by Mr. Roosevelt at the time it was received. Roosevelt's Letters " 'Executive Mansion, Washington, Oct. 4, 1901. " 'My Dear Maria — You need never bo afraid of writing me or asking any .thing. If It Is in my power to grant It I shall do so. If for any reasons, whether political In the narrow, or in the larger sense, I cannot, I shall tell i you so frankly. Personal reasons can never exist when I do not do anything you say. Bellamy was right about Its j being needles* to write me In order to j Keep him in Madrid. J "I think of both of you all the time niicl have gone over several times pos- I sible plans. First, as to the cabinet, it is very unlikely now that I shall' change any member of the present cabinet. You have probably seen that T have asked them all to stay. Secre tary of War Root is the very strongest man before the people In our whole party. His Canton speech was the most effective delivered In the cam paign last year. His advice is Invalu able, not merely In reference to his de partment, but in reference to all branches of the service. " 'It may be that If after carefully looking over the matter I should con clude that Bellamy was the man for the purpose It may he that I should have tci conclude that lome one else of whom I have no thought at present | WOUld be the best man. and If so I| should be In honor bound to take him and not to consult any personal prefer ence (if mine In a matter so vital to the country. " 'As to foreign affairs, my Inquiries speedily develop the fact that a Cath- C-fic just at present would not be a man whom it would be wiie to send to Ger irany For wholly different reasons it WOUld not !»• wise to send liini to Italy. I hud not thought of or known either I of theßC facts when I advocated Bel lamy going to Italy. As soon ag I made Inquiries to the effect both here and abroad of app< Intments to Ger many and Italy. I found what the facts j were In no other country would the { question of Catholicism cause any serl- ■ out trouble; but I have not the | slightest Idea whether any man intends at present to leavi 'Is position. Praises Porter "Of Porter In France 1 hear nothing but the strongest praise. He seems to have done particularly well. It would bcb be Injustice of a flagrant kind to turn him out at the present time. It Is, of course, always possible that I may make a shift, and it in doing bo Prance should become vacant I should offer it to Bellamy at once, unless II happened that I whs oble to offer him a ftiblnet position; bin as things are Just at this time I do not see the likelihood of su<-h n condition ai lalnj I have written In inlnut' s I to uu derstand exactly how the thing now stand*.

THEODORH ROOSEVETVT.' "Tim president nays," continued Storer, "the assertion that I authorised him to make such » statement no he flays he was authorized to make to the pope, In untrue. . I Rave him no such authorization.

YORK, Dec. 10.— Eugene A. Phllbin, formerly district attorney of New York, was named in one of the letters sent by Mrs. Bsllainy Storer to President Roosevelt as having been an emissary .to Rome with a request from the president to the pope that Arch bishop Farley be raised to the cardln alate. Mr. Phllbin was quoted today as saying: "I will not discusn the matter further than to brand the statement as a false hood. I was never Intrusted with such an errand, and indeed was not In Rome at the time referred to." The letter in which Mr. Philbin's name occurs Is one of November 20, 1905, and is from Mrs. Storer. It is dat ed from the American embassy at Vi enna and addressed "Dear Theodore."

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10.— When a motion of Mayor Schmitz' and Abra ham Ruef to quash the indictments against them for extortion "on tho ground of prejudice and bias" came up for hearing In Judge Dunne's court today the attorneys for the accused men asked for further time on the ground that subpoenas are to be Issued for members of the grand Jury as in the Nicholas-Duffy case. Though the defendants Interposed a joint motion, their lawyers explicitly stated that this does not mean a joined Issue or a single trial. The proceed ings in Judge Dunne's court today were purely perfunctory, but the usual curious crowd gathered to watch the proceedings. Attorney Henry Aeh supported his motion to set aside by affidavits. Among the claims made were the "fol low Ing: That the defendants had not been given an opportunity to appear before the grand jury and answer the charges contained In the Indictments. That Heney and Langdon were pres ent during the taking of much of the testimony, which fact was prejudicial to the defendants. During the consid eration of the evidence Heney In the presence of the jury vilified and abused the defendants and demanded thai they be Indicted. That Heney gave prejudicial advice and threatened witnesses with indict ment for perjury and fourteen years' Imprisonment. "There was nothing at all In this but an attorney's fee of $5000 paid to A. Ruef, an attorney of this court," said Ai h, referring to the charg<\» of extor tion. Judge Dunne look Ihe matter under advisement until tomorrow.

Will Take Weeks to Reach Them By Associated Press. BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Dec. 10.— The six miners who were entombed at the Edison Electric company works in the Kern river canyon late Friday morning at 7 o'clock by the caveln of the shaft In which they were working were alive at 11 o'clock this morning, 118 hours after the accident occurred. An old miner, C E. Moore, came down from the' works late tonight and states positively that at 11 o'clock this morning the signals of the minors' code transferred over the Bteel rails of the tramway leading down the shaft were exchanged between the helpless miners and a party of rescuers working from the top of the shaft. Saving the lives of the unfortunates, If they arenot dead already, is looked upon as next to impossible. Three res cue parties have been at work since. Frlduy and little or no progress Una been made. One party, working thorugh the shaft from the bottom, passed through one caveln bulwark, but were unable to pass the second beyond which the miners are imprisoned. Blasting this bulwark and allowing men and rock to pass down the sha?t and pipe to the power house below Is the only means of rescue. Moore states that despite the plead ing of the miners and workmen the Edi son company will not issue, orders to blast. Moore believes that the entombed miners have broken one of the water pipes running down the and aro keeping alive by drinking water. JAPANESE TELL THEIR SIDE OF CONTROVERSY By Assochitoil rrrss.
