PAY IN THREE YEARS FOR>»-3R STATE TREASURER BOB LETER HAS MADE AN OFFER OF 15.1.000 ACCEPTANCE IS RECOMMENDED Attorney Genernl Thinks the Offer Is Eminently Reasonable—Much Sympathy Expressed for the Ex-Treasurer. Attorney General Douglas yesterday submitted to Gov. Van Sant a proposi tion from. Col. Joseph Bobleter, formei 6iate treasurer, in_ regard to the settler iiicnt of the $5,000 that will be due the etate after the bondsmen have paid the $22,000 which they have offered in settle ment. Col. Bobleter's letter is as fol lows: ' "I have been advised that the bondsmen on my official bond as state treasurer have prepared a proposition in accord ance with chapter 212, Laws of 1599. for the settlement of the state's claims against them for losses sustained by the etate while public funds w:ere on deposit In banks during my term as state trees. urer, and in arriving at such proposition the said bondsmen figured that 1 shoulu pay $5,000 in addition to the amount they propose to pay, to-wit. $22,000. "In regard to this I would say, I am Hot financially able to pay $"i.OOO at this lime, or any part thereof, and if a judg ment were entered against me by the Mate for that amount, it Would entirely deprive me from earning any money In the future with which to pay the state, or even earn a sufficient amount to sup port myself and family. "I would therefore respectfully make the following proposition, towit:*That 1 be allowed to enter into a stipulation with the state of Minnesota to allow me three years' time in which to pay said ?r>,oo!>, With a reasonable rate of interest there »n, and if I fail to pay said amount and Interest on or before the expiration 01 Baid three years, that then judgment for Our Wines and Liquors are unequaled for table or medicinal use.

"I feel confident that if I am granted this time I will be able to earn enough to pay the same." Attorney General Douglas recommends that the proposition be accepted, and It is very likely that it will be. There is a very general sentiment at the state house that the legislature ought to take some action which would relieve Col. Bobleter of this liability, and in all probability a bill will be introduced at the next session with that end in view. Sympathy lor Bobleter. There is a very widespread sympathy for Col. Bobleter, because of the fact that he is entirely free from blame in the matter. He was in no wise responsi ble for the loss to the state through the failure of the banks in which the state money was deposited. At that time there was a board of deposit which designated the banks in which the state should keep its funds, and also the manner of invest ing state funds. Col. Bobleter had no discretion in the matter. Although legal ly liable, he was not to blame in any sense. A prominent member of the legislature said yesterday: "I certainly should be in favor of the legislature taking some action in this matter, if there is any way in which they can legally give Col. Bob leter relief. I am sure there would be no opposition to such a measure on the part of any member of either house. *t seems unfair that so good a man as Col. BoLietcr, who has served his state and country in so faithful a manner, shoulfl suffer, through an unfortunate combina tion of circumstances of mis kind, w-hen he is not guilty of negligence or official romissness. If we can legally appropriate money for this purpose we ought to do it; at any rate there ought to be some way in which we can render the as sistance needed."

NOVELTIES IN TOYS DEALERS HAVE AMPLE SUPPLIES O-X HAND FOR THE HOL IDAY TRADE DEMAND FOR THEM IS LARGE American Ingenuity Has Supplied All the New Varieties—lmport ed Goods Are of Stereo typed Patterns. Local dealers in Christmas toys do not expect any unusual demand for their goeds this year, but they look for a sale that will at least be equal to thft average of previous years. Large quantities of Christmas goods are already on the market, notwithstanding the fact that Christmas is yet nearly three weeks dis tant. All of the large department stores have put in heavy stocks and are ready for the demands of their customers. There are not a great many new features among the toys this year. All the new varieties that are on the market are of American manufacture, tne im ported goods being of the same patterns as for several years past. . Among the novel toys this year are a number of hill-climbing vehicles. These were first introduced last year, but were made only in small articles. This year they are made in all styles of vehicles including the locomotives, freight, pas senger and flat cars, automobiles and the like. They work upon the principle of the heavy balance wheel and when once started In motion will travel many feet even through gravel or up an incline. They are proving quite popular with the children and are having a large sale. Another novel toy is a top which was invented by one of the professors of Columbia college. It is called the sci entific top, and by its use a child can paint some of the most beautiful designs. The top is so constructed as to hold a piece of paper which it revolves rapidly, enabling the child to paint the paper in artistic figures. Another novelty is a self-registering bank which will record the amount of coin placed in it. One of the features of this bank which distinguishes it from other self-registering banks is that all the money is placed in the same slot, out the bank registers the amount, whetlier the coin is a penny, nickel, dime or quarter. The wholesale dealers say that the trade with country merchants has been exceptionally good this year and many consignments have been sent out. The retail trade In the city is principally con trolled by the department stores, all of which carry a large stock. SOUP FOR THE SOLDIERS REGULARS WILL HAVE SOUP EV- ERY TEN DAYS. For some time to come Uncle Sam's regulars will receive a can of prepared soup one day in ten, instead of the usual issue of canned salmon. This order goes into effect at once and the department of Dakota has been busy making up the re quisition for the troops In the depart, ment. The commissary department has the soup on hand, it having been returned from the Philippines where It was sent to be offered for sale to officers, enlisted men, hospitals and such civillana as are authorized to purchase suppHes from the commissary department oC the army. The hospitals are allowed 40 cents a day for each man In the haspltaj for the purpose of purchasing: such delicacies as patients may desire, or can eat. A large amount of the soup was contracted for at a most reasonable figure aud Uic depart- ment has decided to distribute it amor.g the army. This is the first timfe that soup has ever been issued as regular rations to the army, but the general opinion seems to be that the men will relish the innovation. The poup will be distributed as sorm as the division is made. In the lot there ia ox tail, chicken, mock turtle and beef, all of a fine brand of soup. The only bank in St. Paul exclusively for savings is The State Savings Bank, Germania Life Bldg., 4th and Minn. sts. Deposits made there' now will be enti tled to 6 mos.' interest July 1, 1902. SNOW GUARDS NEEDED ENGINEER CL.AISSEX SAYS COLRT HWISE MIST BE EQX'IPPED If an Icicle Were to Drop From the Cornices Chances Woulil Be Good for a Fn nernl. No one, as yet, bas fallen a victim to the tons of snow and ice that often come thundering down the steep mansard rocf of the court house, and crash with a roar on the walks beneath but City Engineer Clatfssen intends that no one shall. Yes terday he notified the city hall and court house commission that it.would have to equip the building with snow guards. Only last winter the work house van, and a team of valuabie horses narrowly escaped destruction from an avalanche of snow that dropped from the roof above, and literally filled the court with its moisture-soaked debris. As a precautionary measure, the roof at all times is relieved of its covering of snow whenever any falls, but the removal of icicles which cling to the cornices !s an impossibility. Fatal results would at tend their striking a pedestrian below. It is expected that the commission in charge of the building will attend to tha matter at once, and supply the necessary guards. MISCHIEF MAKER. A Surprise in Brooklyn. An adult's food that can save a baby proves itself to be nourishing and easily digested and good for big and little folks. A Brooklyn man says: "When baby was about eleven months old he began to grow thin and pale. Thi3 was, at first, attributed to the heat and the fact that his teeth were coming, but, in reality, the poor little thing was starving, his mother's milk not being sufficient nour ishment. "One day after he had cried bitterly for an hour, I suggested that my wife try him on Grape-Nuts. She soaked two teaspoonfuls in a saucer with a little sugar and warm milk. This baby ate so ravenously that she fixed a second, which he likewise finished. It was not many days before he forgot all about being nursed, and has since lived almost ex clusively on Grape-Nuts. Today the boy is strong and robust, and as cute a mis chiefmaker as a thirteen months old baby is expected to be; "We have put before Wm other foods, but he will have none of them, evidently preferring to stick to that which did him co much good in his time of need—his old friend Grape-Nuts. "Use this letter any way you wish, for my wife and I can never praise Grape- Nuts enough after the brightness it has brought to our household. These state ments can be verified by anyone who wishes to make a visit to our home." F. F. McElroy, 256 So. Brd St., Brooklyn, N. Y. Grape Nuts Is not made for a baby food, but experience with thousands of babies shows it to be among the best, if mat entirely the best in use. Bein* a scientific preparation ~of Nature's grains, it is equally effective as a body and brain builder tor frown- upa. JUNKET CALLED OFF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS DE CIDE TO ABANDON TRIP TO "WASHINGTON FRICTION WITH GOVERNOR Whispered That Executive Objected to Commission Cutting; In at Twelfth. Hour— Two of Them Sore. I Gov. Van Sant, probably aided by Com missioner Staples, scored once on the state railroad and warehouse commission yesterday, and as a result of the many conferences held the railroad commission called off their little junket to Washing-, ton, where they were to have had a con ference with the interstate commission. There is every evidence of an official coolness between part of the commission, and the governor. Gov. Van Sant does not like the idea of the commission "cut ting in" at this late date, especially when it contemplates an action not in harmony with the plans which Gen. Douglas and himself have decided upon. Judge Mills has contended from the be ginning that the matter should be left to the federal authorities. The governor and attorney general have been prepar ing to get the matter into courts at the earliest possible moment and with as little hurrah as possible. Commissioner Staples is a very warm friend of the governor's, and while he has said noth ing to indicate that he was not in entire harmony with his brethren on the com mission, there is every reason to believe that after his little conference with the governor on Friday night he went back to tell his colleagues that the governor was right and that the Washington ,trip ought to be postponed. The governor pointed out to the members of the com mission that they could accomplish no good whatever by going to Washington, while they might do much harm. If they were to go down to Washington and dis cuss the matter with the interstate com merce commission, and a decisicm was rendered against their position, it would be hailed by delight by the railroad in terests and the country would hear that Minnesota had lost the first round in its fight. He told them plainly what he proposed to do, and he was desirous of doing it in a quiet way, without making a. great advertisement of it. He said if the federal authorities were desirous of acting In the matter they would do so without any urging upon the part of th» state officials of Minnesota. One of the commissioners did not try to conceal his displeasure at the governor's attitude, intimating that the govern* was jealous of the commission's cutting in, and he said that from now on the governor could do as he pleased without assistance from the commission. Gov. Van Sant would make no state ment as to what had taken place between himself and the commission. He re ferred all those who asked to the com mission. He said that as far as he knew the commission was composed of "very pleasant gervtlemen." The commission did not return the compliment in speak ing of the executive. STREETS REMAIN DIRTY NO MOXEY AVAILABLE TO PAY STREET CLEANING FORCE Only Three Men at Work at Present —Old Practice of Puymcut Knocked by Gen. Pope. Much filth and slush now encumber the streets in the business district, but it will have to continue until there is money available for its removal. Three men are now engaged in cleaning street cross ings, but even they may have to be let out because of a ftck of funds. "I know the streets of St. Paul are In a frightful condition now," said City En gineer Claussen yesterday, "but it cant be helped. I expected to hear lots of kicks, but I guess tha public, more than myself, is acquainted with the condition of things and lets me alone. I may not be able to do anything before the first of next year." Last 1 year' the streets, and: heavy, falls 'of snow, were taken care of by hiring men, and anticipating the following year's money to the extent of ; placing the men on the January ~ pay roll,: but this Gen. Pope frowns down, and it will in all probability not be,repeated. ; On the Robert street and ""Yabasha street bridges, and especially on-Seventh street, where .Christmas traffic la the heaviest, mud snow, and filth have been" churned into a sickening and sticky mass, so much so that on some 'of the streets, business men have clubbed together and cleaned places in front of their build ings.
