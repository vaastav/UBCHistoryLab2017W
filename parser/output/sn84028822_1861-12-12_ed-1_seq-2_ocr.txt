Tlio first Annual Message- of I'rcsldunl I. in col.v does not coiiiu up to wli.it wo had nx peeled of him. It In, in many tespects, a singular document. Of It the Sitilrtmin nays , tlio omissions .ml ilultciunclus on sonii) points nrc as Mtnarlsalilo as Is the want ol clearness iukI fullness on otliets. Tlio message gives no satisfactory Informa tion .is to tho statoof our relations with Hiiro- pean powers. What h s.ild on tills toliio seems to bo chiefly an argm.,6nt adilrened to those powers to show them that It would be agilnst their Interest to- (iiterferj In our national quarrel by siding with Iho ruhjl Con fedtracy. It Is strange that not a word Is droprd In the message about tho proposed intervention of Kngland, Trance and Spain In the affair of Mexico. Although tho llects of Ihcsc powers aro already fitted out and on their way to take formal i.o.esIoii ol Mexican potts, tho l'resldent has no remonstraiice to make, and no indications to glvo as lo what should bo our course In regard to tbe.se "tJ- gioislous upon a sister Republic. Although allusion Is made in the message to events of more tficent occurrence, that document is cntitely iilent npnii the seizure! of Miso.v and Sl.iiiKt.t,. It would seem that) the clicui.ifctaticc was woithy at least ol a parsing rcinaik, mid sot.iu slight indication as to whether the Administration was picparcd to justify tho act of Oapt. 'ilkes In captur ing tiro rebel Commissioners on board a liilt isli vessel. Hut tho most supprlslng nnifssfon of all Is, that, though the Tresident speaiti of tho loy alty of Western Virginia, ho does not deign to mention the organization and proposed ad mission into thu t'nioii of tho new Statu of Kanawha. No more Important question than this will probably come before Congress thu present sessions jet its coustItullon.il adviser has no suggestion to oiler as to what should lie lis course on Ibis and kindred topics. Those who have been hoping that the mes sage would ilecl.nu, lu plain, unequivocal terms, tho nettled policy of the Adiiiinlilr.itliin in legaid to Iho propriety of omaiiclpallng and aiming the tlaves in aid of tho Union cause, must feel solely disappointed. Thu Tresident says that "all indlspenslblo means must be employed" lo "preserve ibu L'l.ion," but that "we should not bo lu hastu to deter in t ii u what radical and extreme measures, which may reach tho loyal as well as tho din. loyal, aro liullspenslblu." If a now law, relation to Ihocuiifiscatiun, emancipation and employment of slaves by tho United States, should be iiopo3ed, Its -pinpilefy will bo duly considered." Hut whether any new law Is needed, or whether any "radical and ex trenie nieasuies, which may leach the loyal as well as tho disloyal," will be tegaided "indlspenslblo," thu Tresident gives Congiess or Iho country, no sign or lutlmalloii, unluss by Implication, lu tho part of tint niessago wo are about to notice. Tho Tresident senilis to havo in contempla tion Iho emancipation of slaves on a largo cnle, and this lo bu accomplished in Iwo ways first, by confiscation undur United Stales law; and secondly, by prolublo acts ol confiscation and emancipation passed by In dividual States. How to dliposo of these emaclp.ilcd slaves is with him, as It must with every other man, a reilous and perplex lug question, llu proposes the aquisltlou now territory in some congenial clime, for thu pmposo of their colonization. It must, then, of couiso, bo a territory In or near (he ton Id zono. Hut how and where such Imii toiy Is lo bo acquired, h MU to indicate. Must wo fllllhuslur fur It; mid Unit our justifi cation in a "milllaiy necessity " This colonization schumo Ii oua of long standing. Tho Abolitionists lu Iho party which placed Tresident Lincoln in his seat will as a general thing, hilterly oppose and denounce It. They will say that whun thu blicks aro oneo freed, limy will h.ivo as much light to slay in the country wheio they were born and reaied, as Iho w lilies. An attempt, outhupait of the Government to remove them without their consent will be ilctiomi- can as opprcssliu an I cruel at to minimi them'bjeU Into slivery.
