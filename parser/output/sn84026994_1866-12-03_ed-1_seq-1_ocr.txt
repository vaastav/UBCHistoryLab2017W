Slavin and School. Thoro woro not many poisons in court, and no unusual intorest in tho cases of tho Eriaoncrs was manifesto I. In tho ca se of Mc Mo on, tho Chief Justico expounded at length tho testimony given at tho timo at which the prisoner was tried. After disposing of tho objections rained by prisoner's counsel against tho indict ment, hiB Lordship road the evidence given at tho trial, showing tho prisoner's connection with tho Fenians, andstated that, nftor a caroful and delib erate consideration, ho ngrood with tho loarnod Judgo whe tried the case: that although tho pris iuor carno ovor with the Fenians, ostensibly with tho propose of administering spiritual consolation to the wounded, ho was aiding and assisting tho raiders, aud was oiiually guilty with thom. Tho affidavit put in by tho prisonor was then road, and a new trial domed. In conclusion, his Lordship stiiti-d that he was ol' tho opinion that all tho grounds taken by the prisoner's counsel for grunt ing the rule had failed, and that, had it hcon grant ed, it would morely havo boon losing timo and words lo no purpose, as the Court would not havo made it absoluto. After a most caroful considoro Lion ho could arrivo at no other decision than to rel'iiao the rule. Mr. Justico Hagorty then delivered judgment in tho case of the Queen vs. Lynch. Having recapit ulated tho objections of tho prisoner's comisol se rialtm, ho statod that ho perfectly concurred in tho viows which had been oxpre?sed by tho Ohiof Justico, and having dovotodmuch caro to tho study of all tho diflcronc points involved and objections raised, ho had come to tho decision that no suffi cient grounds had boen mado to warrant tho Court granting tho rule nisi. Mr. Justice Morrison doUvered judgmont in tho coso of tho Qncon vs. School. Ho statod that ho perfectly concurred with the learned Chief Jus tico and Justice Hagorty, and that ho had no ioubt on tho subject, aud must therefore refuse tho rule. Mr. McKonzio, the Queen's connsol, thon moved or leave to appoal. Tho Chief Justico of tho said Court bad anticipated such a motion. Having ro used tho rulo, .hoy did not considor they would io warranted in granting tho application. Chief Justico Richards dolivorod judgment in lie Court of Common Pleas, in the caso of tho .noon vs. Stephen?., to grant tho rulo nisi, and re ut, ed the rule on tho same grounds as thoso urgod >y his learned brothrou on Queen's bench.

Trials l?y military Conimlsalons In tho StMiili since tin? Close of tue War. The Wilmington (Dol.) Gazette gives tbo follow ing account of tho trial of a caso boforo Judge Hale, in tho United States District Court, ou a writ of Jiabea3 corpus, on tho 16th idt. : On Sunday night, October 8, 1865, three Unitod Statos soldiers, who, at tho request of one James Crawford Kays, had boon placed to guard some cot ton, woro murdered on tho banks of tho Savan nah River, in South Carolina, about sixtcon milos from tho r?sidence of tbo said Roys. Thir horses, oquipmonts and tho cotton were stolon, and havo never been recovered. A largo number of persons woro arrested by ordor of the military, and tho caso investigated. A ?root many woro discharged, but James Crawford Keys, Franois Gains Stor?ors, I'liaba Byram and Robert Koys woro hold, charged erith tho murdor. On tho 10th of January last an ordor was iasuod for their trial by a Military Commission, at Charles ton, S. G. The trial lasted through January, Feb ruary, March and part of April, and the above namod prisoners woro convicted, condemned and ordered to bo huug. Tho prisoners protosted, de clared their innocenco, complained of unfairness In the trial, and tho shortness of the time between tho conviction and tho timo appointed for their ex?cution. Tho sonteneo was passed on the 21st of April, tho prisoners notiilod on tho 24th, and the day of ex?cution fixed for tho 27th. Meanwhile, tho sonteneo in tho cases of Elisha Byram and Robert Keys bad boon commuted by lion. Sickles to imprisonment for lifo in the poni tontiary of New Hampshire. Boforo the sonteneo of death still pending against tho others could be executed, the President^ after hearing tho state ments and argumonts or tho counaaLfor the pris oners, ordorcd that the sonteneo of death bo re mitted, and that tho prisoners bo held in confine ment until further orders. After tills, the prisoners wero onihiod at Charleston. While boro an attempt to effoct their rolooso, or to procuro an investiga tion of tho caso by a writ of habeas corpus, was modo. Gon. Sickles, Military Commander of tho District, refused to oboy the writ, and an ordor was issued for his arrost for contempt of Court. Whilo tho caso was ponding tho prisoners woro removed, by order of tho Soorotary of War, to tho Dry Tor tugas, and havo recently boon ngoin removed to lort Delaware. The caso is one of importance, as tho question of the jurisdiction of a military commission in tho late rebellious Statos, after tho surreudor of the rebel armies, and the legal status of these States, oro involved. Tho guilt or innocence of the pris oners was not at ?bsuu, but tho jurisdiction of tho Court which tried and sentence?- thom. Thccaso was arguod on Friday by Col. Tompkins, of Nash ville, Tcnnosseo, nnd Thomas F. Bayard. Esq., for tho prisoners, and United States Distiiot Attorney Pratt and James R. Booth, -feo., for the United Slates. On Saturday Judge Hall delivered an opinion, deciding that tbo Military Commission had no jurisdiction in tbo coco, as the Courts wore open, and the prison-re should have boen tried in a civil Court. The entire number of soldiers onrollod in tbo a. 8. At-ay dui-j", the late war was 8,2o-I679. BY 

LAST NIGHT'S MAIL. From -Vi-f-Uiigtoi!. [From the Special Correspondence of the Baltimore Omette.] Wasuinoton, November 80.-Ipo President's Message was not completed al one ojclock to-day. Tho delay has boon caused, it n prestnaicd, by tho altered condition of Um Mexican question. 11111 ?lorstand tho reason assigned, wHu'- a day or two, for tho failure on the part of Fn_.ce to Withdraw a portion of her troojis, agreeably to provious stip ulations, is that it could not havo been dono with safety to tho remainder, and would bosides, as stated in ono of my recent letters, havo left the country in a stato of anarchy. Tho mossage can not, therefore, I fuel authorized to state, bo deliv ered to tho nowspaper ogcuts hore, or sent to dis tant points, boforo its transmission to Congress at 12 o'clock on Monday next. Doubtless tho Presi dent would greatly prefer to have his Mossogo printed correctly iii the papers published at a dis tance from tho Capital, rather than that it should bo presented to tho public through telegraphic roport.s. But tho difficulties seem to bo insur mountable. Thoro aro nono of tho Reports of tho Secrotarios vet in typo except that of tho Soci .tory of tho Tronsnrj", which will not, for obvious reasons, bo given to the public press until its delivery to Con gress. I am informed, however, that copies will at onco bo sont to the mib-troasurors, collectors, lind other treasury officials, et tho different points throughout the country, who will bo telegraphed at what hour to deliver thom. Tho copies for tho Baltimore press will ho .sent for distribution to Collector Webster. It is probable that the Reports of the SccrotaricB of War, Navy and Interior, and that of tho Post master-General, will bo ready by to-morrow even ing. If so, the press will doubtless bo provided with copies on the usual conditions. Tho purpose of tho ultra Republicans, by'Con gressional action in the matter or tho Constitution ill Amendment, to ignoro tho existence of tho Southern States and the constitutional authority of tho Federal Executive, i"b assuming definite shape. The Chronicle of this morning, in an arti llo moro than live coluimiB in length, foreshadows tho mode determined upon by a few lcadora to avovthrow oven the forma of tho existing govern ment. It sums up the main foaturo of the plan as Follows : ! 1. To pass a law or. resolution recognizing the ratification of the Amendment by throe-fourths of ;he Legislatures of tho Stak s now represented in L'ongress. 2. To provide for tho ratifications already made jeing handed over to tho President of the Senate tnd all futuro ones to Uko tho same course, and ill tho duties heretofore imposed on tho Secretary if Stato to be transferred to the President of tho tanate. Foreseeing that such a pa .pablo violation of the Constitution could not re?oive a two-thirds voto, * ?ven in tho proscnt Congress, the Chroniclo pro- ] H-i-i-H to consummate its treasonable purposes by a limpio ''resolution'' of tho majority of the Sonate tnd House, without affording the President an op portunity of interposing Inn veto. This moro state- j nent of tho proposition is sufficient to show the ab- \ lurdity of supposing for a moment that tho sohomo , ould even command a majority of either Tlonso. j V. gigantio soetional war has resulted from a doubt is to the constitutional power of a State to sopa ato itself from tho rest of tho Union. If tho Con ititutiou had explicitly provided that it might, irobably no cause or protence would havo existed; j V if it had, in so many words, prohibited a sepn ation, it is canally probablo that tho South could never, at loast in tho present generation, lavo invoked a collision of arms. But boro it t ib proposod to migrait upon tho fundamental law ] provisions, not only of such phraseology as to ron- < 1er it doubtful whether even the power of all tho . ?tates to regulate their own Huffrngo ia not sur ondorcd in Congress, but to rccognizo tho torrito ial condition ot tho South as a Constitutional faot, ud to proclaim thoso provisions a part of the Con tention, by means which a largo majority of oven ho Northern people woidd not regard as inipart ng to them any validity whatever. It suroly would ?lily need an occasion on which such provisions ronld bo practicality tested to produce-not a soc ional- but a civil war, tho ?eat of which would not >o at tho South, but ?it tho North, and tho omi ol' rhloh no one will attempt to foroseo. And I am -lad to havo it in my powor to writo that this viow t f tho audacious project is taken by membors of t he Republican party, counted upon by Thaddous levons um instruments in his hands in the present j .ongresa, to carry out his revolutionary pro-1 ranime. The Republican, of this city, regarded as asemi fficial paper, says: "Somebody has tolographod o the country that President Johnson will pro ose sovcral amendments to tho Constitution in is forthcoming Message.

Tho reason why the first dc ?chmont, or ono-third of tho troops was not om arkod in Novembor, according to the Emperor's wn programmo io, that tho other two-thirds i i gb I h a vo boon seriously damaged by tho Liberals, bo woro presistently pressing thom.

But since tho rocopticn of 10 Emporor's intentions with regard to tho re- g uwal of his army, it is not thought that such a 5 ooessity will occur.
