Thodlsposltlon Urefuscit prompt nnd hearty obedience to tho equal rights amendments to tho Constitution is ill that now stands in tho way of a complete obliteration of sectional tines lu our political contests.

A conlln banco of those labors gratuitously ought not la no oxpcctcd, mid, without im appropriation by Longress for compensation. It is not practicable to extend tho syst inn of examinations generally throughout tho Civil Service. It Is also highly Imporianl that ail such uxnmhmtlims should bo conducted upon a uniform sys tem mid under general supervision. See. 1,751 of tho lluvlsnd Statutes authorizes tho I’rusldonl to proscribe tho regulations for ad mission to tno Civil Servleu of tho United States, nnd for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct tho requlslt Inquiries with refer onco to “ tho tltnesH of each candidate, in re spect to nife. Health. cliaraeter, knowledge, and anility, for tho liranuh of service Into which ho seeks to outer ”i but Ibo law Is practically mop orallvo fur want of (ho rmrnlsß appropriation. I tliorofnro recommend an nppruprhitioii of fwVOOO per annum to meet the expenses of n Commission, to bo appointed by tho President In accordance with tho terms of this section, whose duty It shall be to devise a Just, uniform, und elilcient system of competitive examinations, amt to supervise tho application of the same throughout tho entire Civil Service of ihoGov ormnent. I tun persuaded that tho facilities which such a Commission will afford for testing tho illness of those who npply for nlllco will not only ho as welcome a relief to mouthers of Congress us it will Im to tho President mid heads of Departments, but that it will also greatly loud to remove the causes of embarrassment which now Inevitably and constantly attend ihoconlllutlng claims of patronage between tho Legislative and Execu tive Departments. Tho most olTcclunl check upon the pernicious competition of Inlluonco und nllleial favoritism, In tho bestowal of olllee, will bo tho substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicants, In which every nnocan make his own record with tho assurance that hls success will depend upon thin alone. I also recommend aueli legislation us, whilo leaving every ollleer an free as any other citizen to express hls political opinions mill to use Ills means for tholr advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen In re fusing nil demands upon hls salary lor political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty mid Justice to all who are engaged in tho public service, and likewise contain strin gent provisions against the usoof ollielal author ity to coerce (ho political action of private citi zens nr of ollielal subordinates, Is greatly tube desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to mi Im provement of tho Civil Service, mid especially to u reform In tho method of appointment mid removal, tins been found to be the practice, un der what Is known as “the spoils system,’'by which tho appointing iwnvor has been so largely encroached upon by members of Congress. Thu llrst step In tho reform of tho Civil Bervleomust Im a complete divorce between Congress and tbo Executive in the matter of appointments. Thu corruptlngdootrino that “to the victors belong tho spoils,” Is Inseparable from Congressional patronage ns tbo established rule nnd practice of parties in power. It comes to be understood by applicants for olllee, mid by tho peoplo gen erally, that Representatives und Senators areen titled to disburse tho patronage of their respect ive districts mid Slates, it is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this In vasion of tho Executive luuctlons. Tho truo principles of government on tho subject of an noliilmcnts to olllee, as stated In tho National Conventions of tbo lending parties of .tho country, have again and again been ap proved by tno American people, mid have not been called In question In any quarter. Those authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all-important subject iirutho statement of principles that belong to tho constitutional structure of tho Government. “Undertho Constitution, tho Presidents ami heads of Departments are to mnko luuniuationß for olllee. Thu .Senate Is to advise and consent to appointments, mid tbo House of Representa tives Is to accuse mid prosecute faithless olllccrs. Thu best Interest of the public service demands that those distinctions bo respected; Unit Sena tors mid Representatives, who may bo Judges nml accusers, should not dictate appointments to olllee.” To this end tho cooperation of tho Legislative Uopartmont of tho Government is , required, alike by tho necessities of tho caso 1 nnd by public opinion. Members of Congress will not bo relieved from tho demands mndo upon thorn with reference to appointments to nlllco until, by legislative enactment, tho perni cious practice is condemned mid forbidden. It Is therefore recommended that an act bo Passed dullnlng tho relations of members of nngrcsswlth respect to appointment to nlllco by tno President, and I also recommend that tho provisions of See. 1.7(17, und of tho sections fol lowing, of tho Revised Statutes, comprising tho Tenuro-of-Oll'co act, of March 2, h&7, bo re pealed. Relieving that to reform tho system nnd methods of tiw Civil Service Is onoof tho high est and most ltn|H>rutlvo duties of statesman ship, and that it can bo permanently done only by tho cooperation of tho Legislative mid Exec utive Departments of tho Government,. I again commend tbo whole subject to your considerate attention. POTjYGAMY. It la tho recognized duty out] purpose of tho pcoploof tbo United States to suppress polyg amy where It now exists In our Territories, mid to provont its extension. Faithful and zealous ciTorts tmvo boon, made by the United Htntcs autborltlcs In Utah to enforce tbo laws against it. Experience bns shown that tbo legislation upon this subject, to bo Directive, requires ox* tensive modiilcution and amendment. Thu longer action is delayed tbo more difficult it will bo to accomplish wbut is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. Tito Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has tbo whole power of making and executing tbo local legislation of tho Territory. Uyils control of tbo grand and petit Juries It possesses largo in* lluonco over tbo administration of justice. Ex* orolsmg, as tbo bends of this sect do, tbo local political power of tbo Territory, they are oblo to make effective their hostility to tbo law of Congress on tho subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not bo abolished if tbo enforcement of tbo law depends on those who practice and uphold tho crime. It can only bo suppressed by taking away tbo political power of tho soot which on*, courages and sustains it Tho power of Con* gross to enact suitable laws to protect tho Terri* ties is ample. It is not a ease for half-woy measures. Tho political power of tho Mormon soot is increasing, it controls now ono of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. Ills extending steadily ' into other Territories. Wherever It goes It establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. Tho sanctity of mar* rlugo and tbo family relation uro tho corner* stone of our American society and civilization. Uoliglous liberty and thu separation of tho Church and Bialo uro among tho elementary ideas of tree Institutions. To reestablish tho interests and principles which polygamy and- Marnmnlsm have imperiled, and to fully rca|Km to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which hits been, In a grout degree, closed Pi general immigra tion by Intolerant and immoral institutions, it is recommended that tbo Government of tbo Ter ritory of Utah be reorganized. 1 recommend tbut Congress provide for tho government of Utah by a Governor and Judges, or Cummlsalonors, unpointed by tbo President and eonttrmed by too Heimto,—a Government analogous to tbo Provisional Government estab lished for tho territory northwest of tho Ohio by tho ordinance of 1787. If. however, It is doomed best to boiulnuo tho existing form of local Government, 1 recommend that tho right to vote, hold uillco, and sit on Juries In tho Ter ritory of Utah be ounllncd to ttioso who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures arc adopted, it is believed that within a tow years tho evils which now atillot Utah will bo eradicated, ami that thlsTerrltnry will in good time become ono of tho most prosperous and attractive of tbunnwHtaiosof tbo Union. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have pre sented no occasion for concern as to tboir con tinued maintenance. THE 

FISHERY QUESTION*, My antlcipaUun of un early reply from tbo UriLJsU Government to the demand of indemnity to our tlsbonnon for thu injuries suffered by Uiut industry ot Fortune liny, in January, lb7H, which 1 expressed In my last annual message, was dis appointed. This answer was received only In tho latter part of April In (ho present year, and, when received, exhibited a failure of ao coni between tho two Governments ns to tho measure of the inshorc-llsblng privilege se cured to our fishermen by tho Treaty of Wash ington of so serious nchamotcr that I nmdo it tho subject of a communication to Congress, In which I recommended the adoption of thu measures which seemed to mo proper to bo taken by this Government in maintonanyo of tho rights accorded tp our tlsbormcn under tho treaty, and towards securing un indemnity for tbo injury these interests bud suffered. A bill to carryout those recommendations was under consideration by tbo House of Iteprosoututivcs at the time of the adjournment of Congress In lust. Within a few weeks 1 have received a commu nication from her Majesty's Government, re uowipg tbo consideration of the subject, both of the ludoiaulty for tho injuries at Fortune Day and of the interpretation 6t tbo treaty in which tbo previous correspondence had shown tho two Governments to bo at variance. Upon both these topics tbo disposition towards a friendly agreement Is manifested by a recogni tion of outright to un Indemnity for tho trans action at Fortune Day, leaving tbo measure of sueti Indemnity to further contcronco, and by an assent to tho view of, this Government, pre sented In thu previous correspondence, that the regulation of conflicting interests of tho shore hsacry of tbo Froviuclul sou-coasts, and tbo voa THE 

CHICAGO TRIBUNE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, ISSO—TWELVE PAGES sel Hshnrv of our fishermen. should bo mndo tbo subject of conference and concurrent arrange ment between tho two Governments. I Mnccrolv hopo tlmt tho basis may bo found fora speedy adjustment of tbo very serious divergence of views In the Interpretation of tho fishery clauses of tho Treaty of Washington, which, ns tho correspondence between tho two Governments stood at tho close nf tho lost ses sion of Congress, seemed to bo Irreconcilable. In tholmporlnnt exhibition of arts and indus tries which was held Inst year at Hydncy, New South Wales, as well as lit that new In progress nt Melbourne. tho United States have lieen ellielenlly mid honorably represented. Tim ex hibitors from this country at tho former place received a large number of awards in snmu of tho most considerable departments, nnd tho participation of the United .stales was recog nized by a special mark of distinction. In tho exhibition nt Melbourne tho share taken bv our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of success Is confidently expected. COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. Tho slalo of peace nnd tranquillity now en joyed by all tbo nations of tho Continent of Eu rope has Its favorable Inllucnco upon onr diplo matic and commercial relations with them. Wo have concluded mid ratllled a convention with tho French llopublle for tho settlement of claims of tho citizens of oltlior country against tho other. Under this convention n Commission, presided oror by n distinguished publicist, nppoliited, in pursuance of tho request of Imth nations, by hls Majesty tho Emperor of Rrnzll, has been organized and has begun Its passions In this city. A congress to consider moans for the protection of Industrial property has recently been In session In Paris, to which I have appointed tho Ministers of tho United Btatcs in France mid In Rolglnm ns delegates. Tho international Commission upon Weights mid Slcasures also continues Its work In I'arls. 1 invito your attention to tho necessity of mi ap propriation to bo made In time to enable this Government to comply with its obligations un der tho Metrical Convention. Our frlondly.rolations with tho German Em pire continue without Interruption. At tho re cent International Exhibition of Fish and Fish eries at Ilerlln, tho participation of tho Uiiited Btatcs, notwithstanding tho haste with which tbo Commission was forced to make Its prepara tions, was extremely successful nnd meritori ous, winning for private exhibitors mniorons awards nf a high class, mid for tho country at largo tho principal prlzo of honor offered by hls Majesty tho Emperor. Tho result* of this great success cannot but bo advantageous to this Im portant mid growing industry. There have been some questions ralsed'belween the two Govern ments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but recent dispatches from onr Minister nt Ilerlln show that favorable progress is making toward mi understanding, in accordance with tho views of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction whatever between tbo rights of a native mid a naturalized citizen of the United. Btatcs. In practice, tho complaints of mnlesta-' tlon suffered hy naturalized citizens abroad buvo never been fewer than nt present. ' There Is nothing of Importance to unto In our unbroken friendly relations with the Govern ments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Hwedon and Norway, Turkey, und Greece. During tho last summer several vessels be longing to tho merchant marine of this country, suiting In neutral waters of tho West Indies, were tired at, boarded, mid searched , by an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government. Thu circumstances, ns reported, involve not only n private Injury to thu persona concerned, hut also Deemed too little observant of tho friendly relations existing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to tho attention nf tho Spanish Government In a serious protest nml romontUnmce, and the mat ter is undergoing investigation by tho Hoyul au thorities, with a view to such explanation or reparation ns may lie called for hy the facts. The Commission sitting in this city for tho ad judication of claims of our citizens against tiio Government of Spain is, I hope, approaching the termination of Its lalmrs. Thu claims against tho United Slates under tho Florida Treaty with Spain wore submitted to Congress for Its action at. tho Into session, and I again invite your attention to this long-, standing question, with a view to a (Inal disposi tion of tho matter. At tho invitation of tho Spanish Government, a conference inis been held nt tho Citynf Madrid to consider tho protection by foreign I’owcrs of native Moors in tho Umpire of Morocco. The Minister of tho United States In Spain was di rected to take ppre In tiio deliberations of lids conference, tlm result of which is a convention signed on behalf of nil tlm Powers represented. Tho instrument will be laid before thu Somite for Its consideration. Tho Government of the United States bus also lost no opportunity to urgu upon that of tho Kmperor of Morocco tho necessity, in necodanco with tho iiunmnu and enlightened spirit of tiio ago, of putting an end to tho persecutions, which have boon no provident In that country, of persons of u faith other than tho Moslem, mid especially of tho • Hebrew residents of Morocco. The Consular trentv conulmled with Ilolglnm has not vet been olllclally promulgated, owing to tho alteration nf a word in tho text by thu Senate of tiio Uulted States, which occasioned a delay, during which tho time allowed for ratifi cation expired. The Senate will ho usked to ox tond the period for nitillcation. Tho attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradi tion with Denmark failed on account of tho objection of tho Danish Government to thu usual clause providing tliut each nation should pay tho expense of tho arrest of tho persons wlioso extradition It asks. Tho provision made by Congress, at it last ses sion, for tbo expense of . tho Commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with thu Imperial Government of China, on sub jects of great Interest to tho relations of tho two countries, enabled tho Commissioners to proceed at once upon thoir mission. Thu Imim rlnl Government was prepared to give prompt and rcspcottul attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and tbo conferences pro ceeded with such rapidity and success that, on tho 17lh of November last, two treaties were signed at Pekin, ono relating to tho introduction ot Chinese into tlds country and ono rotating to commerce. Mr. Treseotr, ono of tho Commis sioners, Is now on his way homo bringing tho treaties, and it is expected that they will bo re ceived In season to bo laid before tho Senate early In January. Our Minister In Japan has negotiated a con vention for tho reciprocal relief of shipwrecked seamen. 1 take occasion to urgu once mnro upon Congress tho propriety of making pro vision for tho erection of suitable fireproof buildings at tbo Japanese Capital for the use of tho American Legation, and tho court-house and jail connected with it. Thu Japanese Govern ment, with great generosity and courtesy, has ottered for this purpose an eligible piece oflrmd. In my lust annual message 1 Invited tho atten tion of Congress to tho subject of tbo lndo|nnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. 1 renew tho recommendation then made, tbut whatever portions of theso funds are duo to American citizens should bo promptly paid, and tho residue returned to tho nations, re spectively, to which they Justly and equitably belong. i Tbo extradition treaty with tbo Kingdom of tbo Netherlands which has been for somo tlmo In uuurso of negotiation has, during tho post year, been concluded and duly ratHlod. Kouitluns of friendship and amity Imvo boon established between thu Government of tno United mates and that of Kaunimila. Wo have sent a diplomatic representative to llucharcaU and have received at this Capital tho tipeelal Envoy who has boon charged by hU Koval High ness I’rliico Charles to announce tho indu|)ond cut sovereignty of Hminmnla. We hone fora »l>cody development of commercial relations be tween tho two countries. • 

MEXICO AND SOUTH AMEUTCA. Iu iuy last nimuiil message I expressed tho hope thut tlio prevalence of i|ulot on tho border between this country and Mexico would Boon become so assured ns to justify tho Diodlllcallon of tho orders then hi force to our military com* maudora in rctmrd to crossing tho froutlor, wlthoutoncouraging such illslurbnnccana would endanger tho douco of tho two countries. Events moved in accordance with those ox* peetutious, and tho orders woro UL'cmillugly withdrawn*to tho entire satisfaction of our own 'citizens and. tho Mexican Government. Subse quently tho poaoo of the bonier wan again dis turbed by a savago foray, under tho command of tho chief Vletorlo, but, by tho combined and harmonious notion of tho military foreoß of both countries, bis band bus boon broken up and substantially destroyed. There Is reason to boliovo that tho obstacles which have so long prevented rapid mid con venient communication between , the United States and Mexico by railways are on tbo point of disappearing, and that several Important en terprises of this character will soon be set on foot which cannot fall tu contribute largely tu tbo prosperity ol both countries. /Now envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, I)oiivin,Vonezpola,aud Nicaragua have recently arrived nt this Capital, whoso distinction and on* ilgbtenmoiitutford tbo best guarantee of tbo continuance of friendly relations between ear solves aud tboso sister Republics. Tbo relations between this Government and . that of tho United Status of Colombia bavo en gaged publio attvmrun during the past year, mainly by reason of tho project of un Inter oocunto canal across tbo Isthmus of Panama, to bo built by private capital under n concession from the Colombian Government for that pur pose, Tbo treaty obligations subslstlngbotwoon tbo United States and Colombia, by which wo guarantee tho neutrality of tbo transit and tho sovereignty uud property of Columbia in tho Isthmus, make it necessary that tbo conditions under which so stupendous o change In tbo re gion embraced in this guarantee should bo ef fected,—transforming, us it would, this Isthmus fnuu a barrier between tho Atlautlo and Pueltlu Ucouuslutoa gateway aud thoroughfare be tween them for tbo navies uud tbo merchant- rhlps of tho world,—should receive tho oppmvni of tho this Government, us being enmpatiiuo with tho dlsehurgoof those obligations on our part, mid consistent wlih onr Interest* ns tho principal commercial Power of the Western Hemisphere. Tho views which I expressed In a s|»eelal message hi Congress In March Inst in re lation to this project I deem it my duty again to press upon youD-nttonllan, > Bubscquenl consid eration has but confirmed the opinion “that It Is tho right and duty of tha United Btatrs to as sert and maintain suclr supervision and au thority over any Intern,-lamlc canal affixes tho Isthmus tlmt connects North mid Boutli America as will protect our National Interest.” Thu war between the Repuiillc of Chill on tho one band nnd tlio allied Republics of Peru and Rollvln on the other still continues. This Gov ernment has not felt called upon to interfere In n contest that Is within tho belligerent rights of tint parties as Independent Htales, We have, however, always held ourselves In readiness to aid hi neeommodating Undr difference, and Imvo at different times reminded both belligerents of our willingness to render such service. Onr good olllees In this direction were recently accepted by all the belligerents, nnd it was Imped thoy would provdeDlcaclotis; but 1 regret to announce llmt the measures which the Min isters of Uio United States atßantiugomid Lima were authorized to take with the view to bring about a peace were not successful. In the course ol tho war some riuofltions have nrHcn affecting neutral rights: in nil ol these the Min- Islers of the United Stales have under tholr In structions acted with promptness und energy in protection of American interests. Thu relations of the United .Stales with tho Empire of llrazll continue lu be must cordial, and their commercial Intercourse steadily In creases to tholr mutual itdvantnve. Thu Inturimi disorders with which tho Argcn tine* Itepuhlfe has lor some Hmu past born allllnled, mul which hnvo more or less hillutmced its external trade. itro imdnri’lood to have horn tirotiffht ton close.

A Com mission for thu revision of the judicial code of tho Uufonn Tribunal uf Kgypi Is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Furman, Consul-General, and J. .M.

Thu organization of tho reform tribunals will prob ably bo continued for another period of livu years. in pursuance of tbc net passed nt tho Inst ses sion of Congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime States to Join hi u sanitary conferenco in Washington, beginning on tho Ist of January. Thu acceptance or this;invitutlon by many prominent Powers gives promise of suc cess in tills important measure, designed to establish a system of international mmilcathm by which tho spread of Infectious ur epidemic diseases may bo more elfecllvely cheeked or pruvonti.il. The attention of Congress is Invited to the necessary appropriations fur carrying' in to cifcct tho provisions of thu nut referred to. Tim efforts of tho Department of Statu to en large the trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of Consular ollleursuml through tho dissemination of Infor mation obtained from Ilium, have been intro iaxed. The interest in those ellons, as cloud oped in our commercial communities, and Iho value of tho information secured by this means to tho trade and manufactures of tho country, .were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for tho more frequent publication of Consular and other reports by tho Department of State. The first Issno of this publication Ims now been prepared, and subse quent issues nmy regularly ho expected. Thu im portance and interest attached to tho reports of Consular oilieers are witnessed by the general demand for them by nil classes uf merchants and mmmfuctnrurs engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that tho system uf such publications Is deserving of the approval of Congress, and that tho necessary appropriations for its continuance and enlargement will com mend itself to your eonsidenitlou. OUU CAUIIYING TRADK. Tho prosperous energies of our domestic In* dustrlos, um) tholr Immense production uf tlio subjects of foreign commerce, Invito, and even require, nn nutlvo development of the wishes and Interests of our peoplo in tbat direction. Especially Important Is It that our commercial relations with tho Atlautlo and I’nuldo const* of South America, with the West Indies and tho Gulf of Mexico should l>o direct,and not through tbo circuit of European systems, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. The full apure* elation of the opportunities which our front on .the I'iicllle Ocean (rives to commerce with Japan, China, and tbo East Indies, with Aus tralia and tbolsland (croups which llu along those routes of imvitcntiun. should insplro equal ettorta to appropriate to our own’ehlpplng and to administer by our own capital a duo propor tion of tbls trade. * Whatever modulations of our regulations of trade and navigation may bo necessary or useful to meet and direct tbeso Impulses to tbo enlargement of our exchanges and of our currying trade I am sure tho wisdom ul Congress will bo ready to supply. Our Initial measure, however, scorns to mu so clearly useful and ciliclent tbat I venture to press It upon your earnest attention. It seems ,to bo very evident tbat tho provis ion of regular steam-postal communication, by aid from Government, bus been tbo forerunner of ifco commercial predominance of Grout Britain on ail tbeso coasts ami seas, a greater share In whoso trade is now tbo desire and tbo Intent of our people. It is also manifest'that tho efforts of other European nations to con tend with Great Itrltulu for a share of Ibis com merce have been successful In proportion with tholr adoption of regular steam-postal commu nication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and tho States of South Amer ica are anxious to receive such postal communl callous with this country, and to aid in tholr development. Similar cooperation may be looked for in due time from tho Eastern nations and from Australia. It tsdiillcult to see how tho lead in this movement can he expected from private interests. In respect of foreign com merce, quite ns much us In Internal trade, postal eouimunleutlon seems necessarily u matter of common and nubile administration, and thus IMirtainlng to Government. 1 respectfully rec ommend to your prompt attention such Just mid ullielcni measures ns may conduce to tbo development of our foreign commercial foreign exchanges and tho building up of our carrying trade. Ju this connection 1 desire also to suggest tho vory great service which might bn expected lu enlarging and facilitating our commerce in tho I'acillo Ocean, weru u tpinismariuo cable latu from Ban rnmclseo to tho Sandwich Islands, and theiico to .Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great hillueucuuf such means of communication on those routes of naviga tion, lu developing and securing tho duo share of our I’acillo Coast In tho commerce of the world, needs no Illustration or enforcement. U may bo that such an enterprise, useful mid in tlio end pmlltanle us it would prove to private oatonirlse, may need to bo accelerated by pru dent legislation by Congress in lisahl.mid 1 sub mit tbo matter to your careful consideration. An additional, and nut unimportant, although secondary, reason for featuring mid enlarging tho navy may bo found Imho unquestionable service to* the expansion of our commerce, which would bo rendered by tho frequent elr.-u --lullou of naval ships In tho seas and ports of all quartan of tlio globe. Ships of tlio piopm* con struction aud equipment, 10 bo of tbo greatest oillclepoylu casuof maritime war, might bo made constant aud active agents In time of pence In tho advancement and protection of our for eign trade, and In tho nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would, naturally, in some numbon; mix with anti Improve tho crows of our.merchant ships. Our merchants at hnmu mid abroad recognize tbo value to foreign com moroobf an active movement of our naval ves sels, ami the Intelligence aud patriotic zeal of our naval oltleors lu promoting every Interest of their countrymen, Is a Just subject of iiaUomU pride. \ _ \ TUB FINANCES, Tbo condition of tbo llnunelul affairs of tbo Oovdrmtent, ns shown by tbo re|tort of tbo Secretary of tbo Treasury, ia very sntUfuctory, It la hollered that tbo presentUmmclal situation of tbo Utiitcd Ututes, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or tbo extent and variety of our re* sources, U more favorable than that of any other country of cur time, ami bus never boon sur passed by Urn*, of any country at any period of its history, A'J our industries are thriving; tbo rate of intorostis low; new railroads are being constructed? a vast immigration is increasing our tiopuluUon. nupitul, and labor: now enter prises In yreat u«ml»cr are in progress: and our commcrclttl roluUous with other countries are Improving.

This presents n very favorable op portunity not only to further reduce tho princi pal of tlso debt, but also to reduce tho rale of interest on that wlileh will remain unpaid. I call the attention of Congress to tho views ex pressed on tills mil Ject by the Secretary of tho J reusury in his annual report, and recommend prompt legislation, to cmtldn tho Treasury De partment to complete tho rclundingof tho debt which is about to mature. Jho continuance of specie-payments has not been interrupted or endangered since Iho date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to tho revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity. The fears that preceded and accom panied resumption have proved groundless. No considerable amount of United Slates notes have been presented for redemption, whllo very largo turns of gold bullion, both domestic and tmiHirted, tiro taken to tho mints mid exchanged for coin or notes. Tho increase of coin and bullion In tho United (Stales since Jun. 1,157». is estimated at &£7.:r/j,4&i. _ There tiro still in existence, uncnncolcd. $-'1I(I,CkS1,01(1 of United States legal-tender notes.

In tho Judgment of Congress, an issiio of legal-tender paper money. That it served well tho purpose for wlileh if was created is not questioned, lint the employment of tho notes as paper money indeflnltiy. alter tho ac complishment of tho object for which thoy were provided, was not contemplated by thu framers of tho law under which they were issued. Theso notes long since became like any other pecuni ary obligation of tho Government,—a debt to ho paid, and, when paid, to lie canceled us mere evidence of nn indebtedness no longer existing. 1 therefore repeat whut was said in tho nnmml message of last year, that tho retirement from circulation of United Suites notes, with tho capacity of legal-tender in private contracts, is a step to he taken in our progress towards a safe and stable currency, which should be ac cepted ns tho trolley and <tut v nf the Govern ment and thu interest and security of tho peo ple. 

SIUVISU. At tlio time of tho parsago of tho act now in force requiring tlio coinage of silver dollars. fix ing their value and giving thorn legal-lender cimrnotor. It was believed by many of tho sup* porters of tho measure tlmt tho silver dollar, which It authorized, would speedily become, under tho npcratloriH of tho law, ot equivalent value to tho gold dollar. There were other sup porter* of tho bill, who, wbllo thoy doubted as to tho probability of tills result, nevertheless were willing (ogive tho proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to stop tho coinage, If experi ence should prove that tho silver dollar author ized by tbo bill continued to be of less commer cial value than tlio standard gold dollar. Tbo coinage of silver dollars, under tho net re ferred to, begun In March, IHTH, and has been continued as required by tbo act. Tho uvomgo rate per month to tho present time has tiecu 27rt,«sj. Thu total amount coined prior to tbo Ist of November last was ??J,Hi7,7W. Of this amount $47,0fti,450 remain In tbo Treasury, and only 7(£l£Ul are In tho bands of tho people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable ex pense bus been necessarily Incurred for this pur pose, but Its return to tbo Treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to tbo confident anticipation of tbo friends of tho measure at tho time of Its adoption, tho value of tho silver dollar, contain ing 4124 gralnbof silver, lias not increased. Dur ing the year prior to the passage of the bill au thorizing Its coinage tho market value of tho silver which It contained was from (M to m cents, as compared with tho standard gold dollar. Dur ing tho last year tho average market value of tbo silver dollar Ims been WO4 cents. It Is obvious tlmt tbo legislation of tho lust Congress in regard to silver, so ferns it was bused on an anticipated rise in tho value of sli ver as a result of that legislation, has failed to produce tbo effect then predicted. Tho longer tbo law* remains hi force, requiring as It does tho coinage of u nominal dollar, which, in reality. Is not a dollar, (bo greater In-conies tho danger that this country will bo forced to accept a single metal as tbo solo legal -standard of value In mr eolation, and this a standard of less value than It purports to bu worth lit tho recognized money of tho world. Thu Constitution of tho United .States, sound lltnmelul principles, and our l«?st Interests, all require that the country should have us its legal tender money, both gold and sliver coin, of an Intrinsic value, ns bullion, equivalent to that which, upon Its face, it purports to possess. Tho Constitution, in express terms, recognizes both gold aud silver as tho only true legal-tender money. To banish either of those metals from mir currency Is to narrow mid limit tho circu lating medium of exchange to tho disparage ment of important Interests. Thu Unlted'Btates produces move silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining It as oneot tho two precious metals which lurnbii tbo coinage of tbo world. It will, In my Judg ment, contribute to this rcsuliif Congress will repuul so much of existing legislation us re quires tho coinage of silver dollars containing -only i\a\i grains of silver, mid in its stead will authorize the Secretary of tho Treasury to coin silver: dollars of equivalent value, as bullion, with geld dollars. This will defraud 110 man, and will bu In accordance with familiar preeo dopts. --Congress, on several occasions, bus altered tho ratio of value between gold mid sliver, In order to establish It inert- nearly in ac cordance with tho actual ratio of value between tho two metals. In llnunulal legislation every mcnauru m tbo direction of greater fidelity la the. dlscbanru of pecuniary obllinitJona has been found by ex perience to diminish the rates of Interest which debtors are miulrcd in pay. and to incmiso tbo facility with which money can obtained for every* legitimate purpose.

AUMV. Tbo Socrolary of War reports that tbo expend itures of the War Department for the Uscaiyear ended JunoJJU, last), were su,lt!(,TtU.tn, Tbo U|h proprlationa for this Department, fur tbo cur rent lineal your, amount to fll,uuj,G;KUO. With respect to tbo army, tbo Secretary in vites attention to tbo fact that its stremrih Is limited by statute (See. 1,115, Ucvltod Biatutua) to not more than UO,OOO enlisted men, but tluit provisos contained In appropriation bills buvo limited expenditures to the enli»lmont of but 85,000. It la believed tbo full strength is the least possible force at wblcb tbo present organ isation can bo maintained, having in view etU cluney, discipline, and economy. While the en listment of this force would add somewhat to tbo appropriation fur pay of tbo army, the sa.v» Ing made In other respect* would be more than nn equivalent for thin additional outlay, and Uio efficiency of tho nrmy would bo largely In* creased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of thn Mississippi Hiver, and tho great tide of settlers which has flowed In upon new terri tory, Impose on tho military an entire change of policy. Tho maintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel Is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters nt points se lected. of a more sulistantlal character than those heretofme constructed, will bo required. Under existing laws, permanent building* can not l>e erected without die sanction of t.'oiigivs*, and when sides of military sues and buildings have Imen authorized, die money* received have reverted to tbe Treasury, and could only Itocomc available through u new appropriation. It Is recommended that provision he tmuie, by n gen eral statute, for dm sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings ns are found to tie unneressary. and for tho application of tho pro ceeds to thu construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight val ue for military purposes, owing to the changed condition of thu country, their occupation is continued at great expense and Inconvenience, because they nttonl die only available shelter for troops, Tho absence of a large number of officers of the line, In active duty, from their regiments. Is a serious detriment to tho maintenance of tho service. Tho const ant demand for detachments, each of which should be commanded by a com utisdoneU officer, and dm various details of officers for necessary service away from their commands, occasions a scarcity In the number reunited tor company dudes. With a view to lc««enlng tiilsdrutn to some extent. It Is recom mended that the law authorizing the detail of officers from tho active list as professors of tactics and military science nt certain colleges and universities, bo so amended as to provide that all such details be made from thu retired list of tho army. Attention Is asked to tho necessity of provid ing by legislation for organizing, arming, and dlrclplliuug the iirliir, militia of the country, and liberal appropriations am recommended In this behalf. The reports of tho Adjutant-Gen eral of die army uml the Chief of Ordnance touching this subject fully sot forth Its Impor tance, 16.U*i The report of the officer In charge of educa tion lb the army shown that them are seventy, eight schools now hi operation In tho army, with an aggregate attendance of 'J.iioj enlisted men and children. Thu Secretary recommends tho enlistment of liiO schoolmasters, with the rank and pay of ComniH sary-Hergeants. An appropriation is needed to Mipply the Judge Advocates of the Army with suitable libraries, and tho Secretary recommends that the corps of Judge Advocates be placed upon tho same footing, as to promo don. with tho other stall corps of thu army. Un der existing laws, tho Human of Military Jus tice consist* of one officer, tho Judge-Advocate General, and tho Coro* of Judge Advocate* of eight officer* of equal rank (Majors), with a pro vision that tho limit of the corn* shall remain nt four, when reduced by casualty nr resigna tion to dial number. The consolidation of dio Human of Military Justice and die Corps of Judge Advocate*, upon tho name ba.-d* with the other staif corps of thu army. would remove an unjust discrimination against deserving officers, and subservo tho best Interests of die service. Especial attention 1* asked to the rejmri of the Chid of engineers upon tho condition of our National dermises. From n personal In spection of many of the fortlllcatiun* referred to, the .Secretary Is able to emphasize the rec ommendations made, and to slate that their In complete and defenseless condition 1* discredit able to the country. While oilier nation* have been increasing their means for carrying on of fensive warfare and attacking maridme cldcs, we havo been dormant in prepara tion -for defense; nothing of Impor tance Ims been done toward* strengthening and tlnlsblug our casonmted works since our late Civil War, during which the great guns of modern warfare ami tho heavy armor of modern fortification* and ship* came into use among tho nations, and our earthwork.* left, by a sudden failure of appropriation* some year* since, in all stage* of IncuntplcUon, are now being rapidly destroyed by (ho elements.
