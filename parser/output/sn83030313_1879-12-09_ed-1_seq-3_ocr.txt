Washixotox, Dec. 8, 1879. WADS HAMPTON ON MR. BAYUBD'S LEGAL TEN- I DBU RESOLUTION. Be as tor Wade Hampton Maya that be not only approves of Senator Bayard's resolution for the repeal of. the legal tender clause aa right, timely and necessary, bat that he think* it offera a very great opportunity to the democratlo party to perform an important aervico to the country, and in doing so to eatahllah a thoroughly democratic principle He adda the democratic South ought ?*pecially to rally to tho support of Mr. Bayard's resolution, because it opens the way for them to effectually allay the suspicions of the Nortli against tho South. He beli***0Lthat Northern capital has become alarmed leot the South, if the democratic pacty should oome f&to power, should Insist on a huge tnlatton and watering of the currency as a means of scaling and to a great extent repudiating war debts and private debts, and that the Bayard resolution, if it had no other importance, would be a measure of great political moAniit, because ainoere and zealous Southern support ?f it and its passage by Southern votes would allay ill these Northern suspicions. He hopes, therefore, ' hat the Southern Senators and members will ?e found supporting the reaolution. He added co the gentleman who with his permission reports this conversation that the Western wing of tho democratlo party had given Inflation and their other crude financial notions a full trial, and had only brought defeat on them eLvea. He thought it not disrespectful or unjust to th^m to now uk them to support difleront policy, one that had In It the elements of success for which they could vote Without violating any democratic principles. Ho evidently bolieves that the South ought to remember the fall defeats in the West and make its allianoe with the East. FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT. Washikoton, Deo. 8.1879. THE INDIANA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION? CONTEST FOR MB. ORTH'8 SEAT AT AN END? THE PRESIDENTIAL, QUESTION. Mr. MoCabe, who was expected to vigorously contest the seat ot Mr. Orth ir the House, the latter baving leu than one hundred majority, has, in the opinion of the House Committee on Eleotions, forfeited all claims to a further extension of time, and tt is understood that the committee will report asking to be discharged from the further consideration of the case. Thia ia the caao whtah H.jcm Mid wm to bo decided in favor of IfcCabe in order to change tho political complexion Of the Indiana delegation in the House. At present it stands six democrats, six republicans and one greenbacker. Tbe Importance o? tbe change might Ue in the event that the Presidential election should devq^re upon the House, when Mr. De La Matyr would have it in his power to tie tho State by voting with the democrats or give the casting vote which would enable tbo republicans to elect their candidate, as there is no probability of a third party carrying the vote of any State. The necessity for guarding against such a contingency has been settled, so the hard money democrata say. by the fall lections, and Mr. De La Matyr will be allowed to hold the balanoe of power the remainder of the session. tMDOCLIKO AMD CIVIL SERVICE BEFOBM IN THE SOUTH. Tbe report that has reached tho Treasury Department to the effect that there is a good deal of smuggling along tbe Atlantic and Gulf coast has warranted the.Secretary or tbo Treasury in despatching special agents to investigate the truth of the statement. It is said that tbe ngenta will also look after the preferences of federal officials in Southern States for Presidential nominees, and that the civil service rules will bo enforced strictly to prevent any officeholder from taking an active part in the selection of delegates to tbe National Convention.

THE CONFEDERATE INVASION OF PENNSYLVANIA?SUFFERERS BEKKINO INDEMNITY FROM THE GOVERNMENT?BAD OUTLOOK FOB WAR CLAIMS. The effort which was made In every Congress since 1868 bv citizens of tbe border'countie* of Pennsylvania to securo payment for property destroyed by the Confederate invasion of 1HA3 is to b? repeated in this Cousrcss. The papers bare already been withdrawn from the files to be re-referred. AU this would seem to be labor spent In vain, as Congress has repeatodly declared that those claims are not of t class which lmposo any liability upon the government. These claims havo never been regarded as more meritorious than tho claim of Dr. Best, of Kentucky, and tho bill for his relief was vetoed. In the Forty-third Congress Judge Lawrence, of Ohio, then chairman of the Committee on War Claims, submitted an elaborate report taking strong grounds against those and kindred claims, and his conclusions were indorsed and actod upon by the committee in tho Forty-fourth an<l Forty-fifth Cougresses. As this Congress will try to niako a big record for oconomy, In view of tho coming Presidential contest, people who expect to be benefited by pushing war elaims may mako up thoir minds that they will have but a sorry ihance.

Senator Voorhees introduced the following preamble and resolution in the Senate to-day, and it was ordered printed and laid on the table, to be called up by its author:? Whereas the restoration of ailver money to the lawful currency o( the country by aot of Congress of February 28, 1878, wua demanded with singular unanimity by the American people and is now sustained by the public interests and by the full force of an intelligent public opinion; and whereas by the act of May 31,1878, the circillation of the Uuitad States legal teuder notes, commonly known as greenbacks, was fixed at the amount then in existence, to wit, $346,000,000, and the Secretary of the Treasury was prohibited from reducing it below that amount by any prooess or upon any pretext whatever; and whereas the aforesaid United States legal tender note or greenback circulation having been accepted by the government for customs duties, became at once and is now equal in value to gold and, in certain transactions, at a premium over both the previona metaU, anil whereas these financial measures, forced upon the present administration and adopted by Congress over its most strenuous opposition. have restored the confidence of the business world In ths character, the amount and the stability of the mosey of this country, thereby creating a general revival of trade and of business prosperity; therefor* be it Resolved, Tbat the Senate has heard with profound astonishment and deep regret the proposition of the President of the United States in his recent annual message, and of t&e Secretary of the Treasury, to 1 inaugurate a new and uncalled for financial agitation with a view to the destruction of the most necessary currencies now in use in the hands of the people. Kesolvwd, As ths sense of the Senate, that such an agitation Is detrimental to the public interests, calculated to unsettle all values, confuse and disturb business, shake public and private confidence, and that it calls for immediate and unqualified condemnation. Beaolved, Tbat the true interests of the country require the tree and unlimited coinage of both gold ana silver on conditions of exact equality, and that it is the part of a wise financial policy to maintain the United States legal tender circulation, commonly known as greenbacks, in volume not less than now exists, and to preserve its legal tender quality unrestricted as to amount and unimpaired in legal effect.
