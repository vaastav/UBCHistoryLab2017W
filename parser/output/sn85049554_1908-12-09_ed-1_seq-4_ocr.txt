"POTATO 0NEY." Iowa newspapers have been exploit ing Grundy county's big potato crop t£is fall and calculating the money thus brought into the county very much as the farmer counts the "egg and chicken money," as an incidental accretion to „rQW the common receipts of the farm. We cattle belt, to look on all except the corn crop as a side line and when some shrewd and progressive farmer drops Into potatoes# sugar beets, pop corn, or the like and gets immense re turns from hiis acreage, we are still prone to consider it as freak farm ing, a side line somewhat out of the avocation and business of real farm ing. We note that "they raise good potatoes up in Grundy," "get lots of popcorn to the acre in Ida," and that those German and Norse farmers "up in Bremer and Winnebago make mon ey on sugar beets but we don't take time to realize that Iowa is a vast field of potato soil, that popcorn grows in other parts of the state as 'it does in Ida and Sac and that the sugar beet soil is not confined to Bremer, Black Hawk and Winnebago. In the matter of potato culture the average farmer gets perhaps the smallest returns from his seed of any crop he plants and thru simple care lessness as to seed, seed bed and at tention. Were the same carelessness attendant upon corn culture there would be no $100 an acre corn land in Iowa until some farmer who had gumption enough to select seed and take care of a crop appeared and took charge of the farm. And yet, good po- the face of the globe, has been com pelled to import large quantities of po tatoes. from Belgium and Germany The reports show that tho yield of po tatoes in this country -for the last sea s. averaged only a little more than eighty bushels to the acre, while the German growers are accustomed to se curing from 200 to 250 'bushels iper aero, on a soil that is not nearly so fertile or woM adapted to potato culture as most of the farming section of the United States. The Grundy county potato grower, the popcorn grower of Sac and the Nor wegian who took $90 worth of sugar beets to the acre off his Winnebago firm, worth on the market perhaps $75 an acre are only doing what the de pntlmenl of agriculture with its wide v.'orld view of the situation advises.
