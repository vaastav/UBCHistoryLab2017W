That the American line* of *te->m-*hip* h?re been abandoned by n* to an unequal contest with the aided line* of other nation* nntil they hare been withdrawn, or. in the few rases where they are *till maintained, are anbjeet to vdriou* disadvantage!, is matter of common knowledge. The present aitnation is such tbpt traveler* and merchandise find Liverpool often a necoe sarv intermediate port between Hew York and some of the Soath American capital*. The fact that some of the delegate* from South Ameri can Htnte* to the Conference of American Na tion*. now in session at Washington, reached our shore* by reversing that line of travel, i* very conclusive of the need of *nch a confer ence, and very suggestive as to the first and mo t necessary step in the direction of fuller and more beneficial intercourse with nations that are now our neighbors upon the line* of lati tude, but not upon the lines of established commercial intercourse. 

MAIL SUBSIDIES RECOMMENDED. I recommend that such appropriation* be made for ocean-mail service, in American steam ships, between our port* and those of Central and South America. China. Japan, and the important islands in both of the great oceans, as will be liberally remunerative for the service rendered, and as wilt eucourago the es tablishment and in lome fair degree equalize the chance* of American steam-ship lines in the competition* which they must meet. That the American states lying south of us will cordiallv co-operate in establishing and maintaining such lines of steam-ships to their principal ports I do not doubt. A KATAL RESERVE. We ahould also make provision for a naval reserve to consist of such merchant ships, of American construction and of a specified ton nage and speed, as the owners will consent to place at the use of the Government, in case of need, as armed cruisers. England has adopted this policy, and as a result can now, upon necessity, at once place upon her naval li.it some of the fastest steam-ship* in the world. A proper supervision of the construction of such vessels would make their conversion into effective ship* of war very easy. A LIBERAL AMD PROGRESSIVE POLICY. I am an advocate of economy in onr national expenditures, bnt it is a misuse of terms to make thia word describe a policy that with holds an expenditure for the purpose of ex tending our foreign commerce. The enlarge ment and improvement of onr merchant marine, the development of a sufficient body of trained American seamen, the promotion of rapid and regular mail communication between the ports of other countries and our own, and the adaptation of larg? and swift American merchant steam-ships to naval use*, in time of war, are public purposes of the highest concern. The enlarged participation ot our people in tho carrying of trade, the new and increased markets that will be opened for the products of our farms and factories, and the fuller and better employment of our mechanics, which will result from a liberal promotion of our for eign commerce, insure the widest possible diffusion of benefit to all the States and to all our people. Everything is most propitious for the present inauguration of a liberal and pro gressive policy upon this subject, and we should enter upon it with promptness and decision. The legislation which I have suggested, it is sincerely believed, will promote tho peace and honor of our country and the prosperity and security of the people. I invoke the diligent and serious attention of Congress to the con sideration of these and such other measures as may be presented, having the same great end in view. Besj. Habiusox. Executive Mansion, Washington. JMceniber 3. 1889. The North llaptist Church Property. Messrs. Cole A Cole and A. C. Richards have filed a bill in equity for Zalmon Richards to en join sale, nullify a deed and for a decree for title against Brown, Glass and others. The complainant states that he held the property now occupied by the North Baptist church un der a lease, and in 1875 he assigned the lease to E. H. Gray for the purposes ot a church, and, although the consideration recited is ST,600, he did not receive a cent.
