Army Bill Reported. Mr. Hull (Iowa), chairman of the mili tary affairs committee, reported the army rorganisation bill. In doing so he called attention to the urgent necessity of imme diate action upon this bill. The volunteers under the present law, he said, must be mustered out July 1, and every one must Representative Sulzer. feel the imperative need of providing for a, new army. He asked unanimous consent that the bin be taken up tomorrow. "I object," said Mr. Sulzer (N. Y.) "If the gentleman desires to consider the.bill he can bring in a-rule." Mr. Hull ther&upon introduced a resolu tion for a speolal order for the considera tion of the bill tomorrow Immediately after the reading of -the journal and providing for a vote after three hours' debate on each side. The preliminary report of the isthmian canal commission and the report of the expenditures of the Paris exposition com mission were laid before the House.

When the committee on military affairs was reached Mr. Parker (N. J.) called up a bill to "prevent the failure of military jus tice." After some explanation that Its pur pose was to amend the laws relating to military courts-martial and the civil trials of soldiers, the bill was passed. Mr. Marsh (Ill.) called up from the same committee a bill "to assist military instruc tion in the public schools." The bill au thorized the Secretary of War to detail commissioned officers upon the retired list. not to exceed 100. and non-commissioned officers, not to exceed 300. as military in structors in the public schools of such cit ies as should adopt military Instruction as part of their curriculum.

CANAL BiLL. Senator Morgan Not Disturbed Over Prospect of Postponement. The Senate committee on International ca nals held a meeting at the instance of its chairman, Senator Morgan, to consider the status of the Nicaragua canal bill. The bill is the special order in the Senate for next Monday. but there is a desire on the part of the republican managers to have it post poned, for a time at least, pending the con sideration of the subsidy shipping bill and the Hjay-Pauncefote treaty. Senator Han na, who is especla..y interested in the ship.. ping bill, sat with the committee, present ing the views of the reapublican managers on -the relative claims of the various meas ures to precedence in the matter of con sideration. The committee did not reach any definite conclusion as to the line of action to be pursued. When the committee adjourned, however, the members felt from the expres slops of the friends of the canal bihi, and especially from Senator Morgan's attitude as developed at the meeting, that there would be no effort on the part of the friends of the bill to obstruct the suosidy bill with the canal bill. Senator Morgan admitted that If the sub sidy bi5. should be made the regular order of the Senate. as conte~mplated, that action would hav the effect of displacing the spe cial order. He did not seem disturbed over this fact, but, on the contrary, appeared hauite satisfied with the virtual assurances *f other members oi the committee that the canal bill should follow the subsidy meas ure for consideration. He also expressed his willingness that the Hay-Paunoefote treaty should be acted upon In advance of action upon the canal bilL. Admsral Eade.tt's TuIp. Rear Admiral Endicott, chief of the bu reau of yards and docks, returned to Wtsh lzngton this morning from a visit to Port Royal and Charleston. He reports the work at Charleston completed and at Port Royal nearly so. PraoticaHly all the dat'a collected by the Port Royal board is at hand or will be in a day or tWo, and It is ~ ed that the decision of the boed1 is'tb hoaaion of the nayat station will be nide within a 

NATIONAL VEMORIAL Gen. Brekinridge 8aggets an Arh and Court of Ron LOCIL Euffm TOUCHE uPO Post Exchange at the Soldiers' Home Advised. HIS ANNUAL REPORT Several local matters are touched upon In the annual report of General Breckinridge, Inspector general of the army, in an Inter e,:Ung way. Chief of these is "a national memorial." in regard to which Generar Breckinridge says: "As the centennial in commemoration of the transfer of the national government to the Distrlct of Columbia is approaching, it may be appropriate to invite attention to the lack of adequate artistic outdoor me morials In the national capital of any of those men who did most to establish, preserve and maintain our country and liberties, except men on horseback, which, of course, does not Indicate a lack of ap preciation. The beginning of a new cen tury would seem a fitting time to recog nize such distinguished public services, in a manner fittingly commemorative of our country's history in the nineteenth century; and it has been suggested that a memorial arch flanked by a court of honor would be a suftable form for such a national and im ficsing work of art, naturally adding to the attractiveness and dignity of the architec tural and historical features of our national capital, which now lacks such a feature, though it is familiar in foreign capitals. Some recognition seems also due the heroes of the eighteenth century, who laid the foundation of this great republic; and their last resting place and the battlefields where they fought for independence deserve to be as carefully preserved and legally guarded as those of any other of our wars." Post Exchange at Soldiers' Rome. Regarding a recent inspection of the Sol diers' Home in the District of Columbia, he briefly suggests .he advisability of the establishment of a post exchange at that institution. "The discipline," says he, "seems to have greatly improved during the year, and a decrease Is noted in the number of both offenders and offenses. But even among these diminished offenses the des1re for liquor continues to be the princi pa, cause of most derelictions. In the army and at the volunteer homes post ex changes are generally In favor, but such an institution has never been tried here. It would doubtless. as elsewhere, conduce to the comfort, economy and good behavior of those who benefit from it." Recommends Increased Pay. In concluding his report Gen. Breckin ridge pays a high tribute to the efficiency of the members of the clerical force of his office and recommends an Increase in their pay. On the subject of the retirement of clerks, he says: "Many of these valuable public servants have devoted their best years to the public service, and some consideration seems due them when years of constant and faithful application to their work have rendered them helpless and dependent upon others. Their pay Is hardly sufficient to acquire a compOence In old age, and the deserving cannot always be promoted for lack of op portunity. It is believed that the public service would be greatly improved if a s;,.all increase were granted deserving cerks every five years. or if they could be retired on some such plan as was proposed In House bill No. 1.5 of the Fifty-sixth Con gress. which contemplated the creation of a retirement fund without expense to the government. In Europe some of the na tions maintain a civil retirement list at their own expense,:and In this country some of the more progressive corpor4tignA havq found It advantageous ro.adopt similar sys tems. Surely when the efficiency of the service can be increased by such a con siderate plan, and that without expense to the, goverument, if should receive fair aid favorable attention." Retirement With Higher Rank. Gen. J. C. Brecklrridge earnestly recom mends that the benefits of the law of March 3, 1219, providing for the retirerment of offi cers of th, navy, under certain conditions, with the rank and- pay of- the next higher grade, be extended to include officers of the army. Most of our wars have been fought on land, says the general. and' as a matter of simple justice rewards for army officers should be no letss extensive than those en joyed by officers of the naval branch. He touches upon the disadvantages Imposed by inferior rank in the army, citing as an in stance the China campaign. when Gen. Chaffee, a junior smorl"tie iinterna.tional commanders, was advanced from a-briga dier to a major general to give him the rank requisite to his status as commander-in chief of the United Sta-tes forces in China. Gen. Breckinridge also notes that the grade of brigadier general is abolished In most of the European armies, and is nearly as ar chaic as the rank of commodore afloat. STEAMI RAILROADS. Rouse Subcomnmittee to Inspect Pro posed Sites. The subcommittee of the House District ecmnmittee having in charge steam rail rcad legislation held a meeting today with reference to the Baltimor'e andi Ohio and Pennsylvania terminal bills. No action was taken exccpt to make arrangements for the subcommittee to visit the sites of the proposed changes. Saturday the suab committee will drive over the route of the two roads where the changes are pro posedl, and look over the lots of land In v(lved. It Is proposed to ask the House to p(.stpoine DIstrict business from next Mon day to the Monday following, when the committee expect to be. ready for action on the steam railroad question. ON NAVAL RETiIRED LIST. Bill to Bie Introduced to Place Repre sentative Bontelie There. A bill has been prepared, whic'h will be introduced in the House this week, to place Representative Boutelle of Maine on the re tired list of the navy, after which it is pro posed that Mr. Boutelle shall retire frem Congress. Mr. Boutelle's record i.n the navy was a gallant one. He returned from a foreign voyage In the spring of 18til, volunteered and was appointed acting master In the United States navy. He served in the North and South Atlantic and West Gulf squadrons; took part in the blockade of Charleston anid Wimington, the Pocotaligo e-mpedition, the capture of St. Johns Bluff and occupation of Jacksonville, Fla., and while officer of the U. S. S. Sassacus was promoted to lieutenant "for gallarrt conduct in the engagement with the rebel ironclad Albemarle," May 5,. 186t4; afterward, in command of the U. S. S. Nyansa, partici pated in the capture of Mobile and in re ceiving the surrender of the confederate fleet, and was assigned to command of naval forces in Mississippi sound; was hon. orably discharged at his own request Jan uary 14. 1866i. It has been ascertained that there arei precedents for the propcsed action. An actI approved March. 3, 1871, authorised the ap pointment on the retired list of Henry C. Keene and Edward E. Bradbury. Still an other case is that of R. H. Lamson, whomi the Preeident was authorised to restore to the navy by an act approved March 27, 1871.1 The restoration of Commander John N. Quackenbush of thtis city, by act approved February 4, 38W,. Is the most recent prece dent which Is believed to ie In line wit Captain Boutelle's ease.

December 4. 2900. The circuit court for Alexandria city, which opened its December term here yes terday, continued the session this morning at 10 o'clock. The first case taken up was that of W. H. Smith, administrator for Frank E. Lloyd. against the Washington, Alexandria an.Xount Vernon railroad. This is a suit for damages in the sum of $30.000. It is alleged in the declaration that Frank Lloyd, a child about twelve Years of age, was drowned by falling inta Hunting creek about two years ago while crossing the railroad bridge spanning that stream. . Attorneys- . Edmund Burke and Samuel G. Brent represent the-plaintiff and Attorney James R. Caton appeared for the defeidant. Judge Nicol rendered a decsion in the case of the Commercial- National Bank of Chicago against the Consumers' Brewing Company, stating that he considered. the property of the company of great value; that Its affairs seemed to be well managed and that he believed it would prove unnec essarily injurious to the company to place it in the hands of a receiver. The financial condition of the company, he thought, was ground under the law for the application for an injunction and receiver, but instead of granting the petition the court decided to allow the defendant company ten days in which to give a bond of $30,000 to answer any decree or judgment that may hereafter be rendered for the complainant when the case comes up on its merits. Trials Tomorrow. The cases of R. W. Coleman against the Southern Railroad Company and T. A. Gay, administrator, against the Southern Railroad Company and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Com pany were set for trial tomorrow. Counsel for the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon railroad filed an- appli cation to have the case of Watkins against the railroad company removed to another place on the ground that prejudice existed in this city against the defendant company. Attorney Gardner L. Boothe, for the plain tift, secured a great 'number of affidavits from prominent citizens to the effect that a fair and impattial jury could be secured in Alexandria, and the judge reserved his decision until Mr. Boothe's list is sub mitted. Epworth League Union. The Epworth League Union of Washing ton, Alexandria and vicinity met in the Washington Street Southern Methodist Church today. The afternoon session was devoted to a discussion of the work of the devotional department of the league. It was presided over by Rev. H. A. Beach of Falls Church. The services this evening will begin at 7:30 o'clock, and will open with devotional exercises, conducted by Rev. W. S. Hammond of Epworth Church, Washington.

SHIP SUBSIDY IILL. It Will Have a Rough Passage Through Congress. It appears that the ship subsidy bill is going to have a rough passage through Congress. It is given a parliamentary ad vantage through the influence of the men In both houses who support it, and the fact that Mr. Hanna is determined to secure its passage and the President recommends it greatly increases its prospects. The an nouncement by Pettigrew that he will vig orously oppose it and the knowledge that there will be cpposition. propositions to amend radically by republicans as well as democrats, make its situation critical, not withstanding the promptness with which the question has been taken up in the Sen ate. The time is so short that a hard, pro tracted fight would mean failure. The friends of the measure count confidently upon the ability of Mr. Hanna to overcome republican opposition. Yet the Senate com mittee on order of business, in deciding to make the bill the unfinished business in place of the Philippine resolution, recog nized the difficulties in the way of securing actio,n and guarded against an extra session by providing that the shipping bill shall give way to the appropriation bills, the army bill and the Hay-Pauncefote tr4aty. The Preaident and all the party managers are' deftermined to avuid the necessity of an 'extra session; therefore the precaution' was taken of giving right of way to these meas ures. whose failure would ivolve an extra session. This leaves the shipping bill in a poisition where it can be opposed until the end without involving serious consequences to other legislation. Of the important propositions chiefly dis cussed in the program of the session the Nicaragua bill is the only one which is in a posItion to be injured by a dilatory fight on the shipping bill. The failure of these two measures would not involve an extra sesin but their being thus placed in an attitude of interdependence is probably de signed to secure the assistance of the friends of the canal In preventing a filibus ter against the shipping bill. 

1NAIUURHAL CHAIRMAIUSHIP. No Solution Yet of the Question by Senator Hauna. The identity of the gentleman who will be selected for chairman of the inaugural com mittee has not yet been disclosed by Sena tor Hanna, who has the appointing power, an.d the delay in making a choice has in creatsedi lnterest in the question as well as inspired wide sepeculation.' There were no developments today that pointed toward immediate settlement. The probabilities are that Senator Hanna will reach a conclusion before the week is out. Mr. B. H. Warner stated to a Star re porter today that he had announced several weeks ago that he could not accept the chairmanship of the inaugural committee. even if the position were tendered him. He had not changed his mind, and regretted the use of his name in connection with the chairmanship, as he was in favor of another gentleman. Sub District Coannmittees.

Robert L Leitch, Jr., fty-two yeors old who was formerly prominent in busname circles, was arrested late yesterday after noon by Detectives Weedon and Parham an charges of false pretenses preferred by George W. Driver, who keeps a restaurant at No. 606 Pennsylvania avenue. It was alleged that he obtained $15 from Mr. Driver last week by giving him worthless checks on the National Metropolitan Bank. Mr. Driver, however, announced 'that he would withdraw the charges when he learn ed of certain peculiar actions.of the ac oused man. Mr. Leitch's brother called to. see. him. and relatives in Brooklyn were Informed of the circumstances. As the defendant had never been arrested before, ad Lieut. Ams th9ught he needed .better care than he could get in the police station. he, direct ed that he be sent to the hduse of- deten tion. which .was- done. This morning the charge against Mr. Leitch was nolle prossed. Sanitary Officer Frank arranged to have the police surgeons examine him, but be fore they called at the house of detention he had been released. His brother and son took charge of him and will-convey him to New York. It Is stated that Mr. Leitch received a sunstroke about three years ago, and since then he has not been entirely well. Alleged False Cheeks. Last week Mr. Leitch, It is alleged, passed checks for $5 and $10 on Mr. Driver, and one for $10 on Joseph Auerbach. It is stated that he afterward went to Brooklyn to visit relatives, returning Sunday night. He rode in an auLomobile from the depot to the Arlington Hotel. where he registered and was given one of the best room In the hc.use. Five additional rooms were desired by the guest later on, as it was his inten tion, he said, to entertain a number of friends. Yesterday Mr. Leitch hired an automo bile and made the rounds of the city, fall Ing into the hands of the detectives about 5 o'clock. He started out,1n the morning by calling at Ogram's drug store and purchas Ing toilet articles, which were sent as a present to a lady friend. He paid for them with a check. When Itwas found that the check was worthless the articles were re turned to the druggist by the person to whom they vere presented. Later Leitch called at the 'building of the Washington Loan and Trust Company, where he made known a desire to rent a number of rooms. A,.messenger boy was called and given dl rections to hire a number of clerks, Leitch boasting of his wealth and business connec tions. He also attempted to negotiate a loan with Mr. J. Gales Moore, assistant cashier of the National Metropolitan Bank, and concluded by requesting the loan of R1. Mr. Leitch carried a stamped check book, and, It is stated, gave a number of checks on the National Metropolitan Bank, although he had no money in the bank. "I have $180,000 in bank," he told a num ber of people yesterday, and many of them believed his statement was true. To the detectives he said. "I'm a rear admiral In the United States navy, and the Oregon is my flagship. I won the battle of Manila bay." Request for His Release. After his arrest last night Mr. Driver called- at police headquarters and asked that Leitch be released; that he desired to withdraw the charge that had been pre ferred against the prisoner. Sergt.

ADVERSE VIEW. kttorney Duvall Opposes Application in a Matter of Taxes. W. H. Manogue recently made application to the CommIssioners that the owners of the west ten feet of lot 25, square 1212, assessed in the name of Charles L. Reint cell, be allowed to pay the general taxes lue from 1880 to 1900, inclusive, without penalties and costs, which, with report thereon by the assessor, was referred to the attorney of the District for an opinion. The latter informs the Commissioners that it appears from the papers presented that the east twenty feet of said lot was conveyed to Reintzell by Richard Crulk shank by deed recorded January 9, 1864, and the present a~pplication is based on the claim that the assessment of the west ten feet thereof to Reintzell was erroneous, because he never had any title thereto, the title being in Cruikshank, and after his death in his heirs. There is no claim that the owners were in any way misled by the assessment in the name of ReintselL. The attorney further states that It fur ther appears that the west ten feej of lot 25 was sold to William Manogue at tax sale In 1898 and in 1900. The attorney thea :motes section 156, revised statutes of the LDiktrict of Columbia, which provides: "That so sale of real property fior taxes shall be impaired or void by reason of such prop irty not being assessed or advertised in the name of the lawful owner. The attorney .next refers to laws passed, respectively, on March 3, 1883, and April ?.4, 18961, in which it is made to appear that if the act first referred to was repealed by the law of 1883 the taxes could be reas iessed under the law of 1896, After thus iumming up the facts and the law appli sable to the case the attorney states that tie is of the opinion that the application should be denIed. 

LIEUT. MALLISON'S CASE. rhe Attorney General Says That There is No Bar to HIs Prosmotion. The Attorney General has just rendered a.n opinion in the case of LUeut. George Ilallison, U. S. N., of great interest to na ral officers. He says "there is no reason wthy an officer, wounded in the servi.ce, should not be promoted as well as his for tunate brother, if there are duties. in the afigher grade which he can satisfactorily a.nd sufficiently perform."~ When an ensign attached to the Olyispia In 1896, Mallison, while assisting in docking the ship, was struck by a breaking anchor chain and lost a leg. He has since beern unable to perform sea duty, -but has ren dered satisfactory service on, detail -duty. ashore. -Now he csomes up under the law and. must either be promoted or retired. The Attorney General says he may be .pro moted. Reward for Capt. Clark.

I8 AYCII This Proved an Aid to the Bear Attack GENERAL MAAKET REPORrS Speelal DIMp- to e vening Star. NEW YORK. December 4.-A concerted sLttacs upon the industrial department, un der the leadership of the trading element, had a depresnd* Infiuence on prices In all parts of the list this morning. London sold moderate amounts of the railrQad shares and sent'over little new'business. The nur ry in Money Yesterday and the 4% per cent rate today discouraged. the advance and helped the professtonal decline. The movement of money to the south and west has emphasized the fears of the usual December stringency and enthusiasm has dwindled to a degree which precludes ac tivity at higher prices. The south is draw ing on the local banks in record volume as the result of the enormous demand for Cot ton. As a result of this new activity in the south values have risen throughout that section and the teipporary reduction of money balances In this city must be con sidered as a necessary evil. The movement would cause no concern were It not that the ordinary demands of the country require an unusual sum for disbursement at the end of thft year. Call money at the legal rate is to be expected, but the recording of such a rate should oc casion no alarm outside of the purely spec ulative issues. Investors are not likely to throw over their securities as the result of a money market condition acknowledged as being the logical outcome of the prosperity which has given new value to the standard snares. The demand for money may and prob ably will necessitate a shifting of loans, and In this event the Industrial shares oc cupy the least desirable position. Being taken in tranquil. times only as a matter of favor, industrial collaterals are easily crowded out in an active money market. Because of this fact traders have taken ad vantage of the passing money condition to force concessions in the industrials. The larger Interests have not contested the effort, but have favored it rather in the hope of a general sympathetic decline which would permit of the purchase of the railroad shares to better advantage than at present. The feature of the market was a sharp decline of 6 per cent in American Sugar as the result of 'the company's failure to pay more than 1% per cent for the current quarter. The stock had been held up at 134 and thereabouts in order that it might be sold, no matter what action was taken by the directors. Had the dividend been increased It would have been sold for both accounts, just as It was, because of the failure to sanction such increase. Long stock was sold In advance of the announcement and short stock for a con siderable time thereafter. The railroad list, in view of the weakness In sugar and the industrials, held relatively firm. The Investment shares were well taken, and only the Pactiic stocks showed positive liquidation. The Denver issues, Texas Paciftc and similar specialties were given rather better support than the aver age. FINANCIAL AND COBME CIA. New York Stock Market. rurnished by W. B.
