The month opens warmer with reac? tionary storms due about the full moon on the 2nd. Much colder, with heavy westerly gales from about 2nd to 4th? beginning in the west by the 2nd, and reaching the east by the 4th. Mean? time the Vulcan period will begin its work in the far west with rising tem? perature, falling barometer, south winds, then storms. From about the 5th to 9th the storms of rain and snow will make their transit across the con? tinent from west to east. See if there is a tendency in the storms to center about moon's last quarter and Perigee on the 9th. Another cold wave will bring up the rear of this period. The effect of the December solstice will begin about tie 9th, as shown by the earth's brace in the storm diagram. From this time to near the close of the month there will be a constant ten? dency to storms and threatening weather. But few causes bear on the month, but winter solstice alone assures us of many storms, especially on the high seas. About the 12th and 13th, look for warmer, with squalls and visi? tations of rain and snow. The cold dash behind the storms will be of short duration, as the storm period begin? ning on the 16th is ushered in by a new moon. The indications are that about that date it will be quite warm, and tbat heavy Stomas, turning to snow, will set in promptly, and cross the country to the east before the ?Qth. A severe cold wave will fall in behind the storms, beginning in the northwest almost simultaneously with the storms. The 23d and 24th are reactionary centers, around which will gather warmer temperature, ending in more storms of rain and snow, and followed by a cold wave for Christmas. Decem DRY
