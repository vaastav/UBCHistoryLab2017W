Some remarks in the Issue ot Nov. otb, discussing mining engineers, their re quirements, qualification, etc , have beon widely reproduced. A writer In a recent issue of the British Columbia Mining Record speaks thus on the subject of "M. E'o, E. M's and Experts." "That there are many men practicing as mining engineers in this province and elsewhere who have never had the nec essary training is unfortunately too true. Real estate men, drummers, fishermen, insurance agants and so forth are all to be found here and elsewhere in this western country posing aB M. E's or E. M's, and In more than one of the pros pectuses which have been Issued for the purpose of obtaining subscriptions from the British Pacific, the statements made to influence subscribers are those of men belonging almost entirely to the classes above. Should failure await such enter prises, can any one wonder? Omy at the stupidity and gullibility of the sub scribers. The so called mining engineers may be to blame; as a rule there is an absence of evidence on that point, but the subscribers we know are (o blame, and much more than they the promot ers who, in cases of the kind named, are only anxious to put before the public opinions that will induce subscriptions, altogether regardless ol the merits or de merits of the properties offered. In this connection let me repeat a story which may or may not be literally true. I give it as told to me. Within a hundred miles of the town of Roesland is a so called mining engineer or expert who, when approached by a client aB to the making of a report on any mining property puts the very pertinent ques tion: "What do you want, a report on tbe facts or only a favorable opinion?" Asked as to his fees, he rays: "A report on facts will cost you 500$, a favorable opinion 2,000$." So long as there are people who want merely favorable opin ions which will enable them to sell their "wildcats" and unfortunately such peo ple are not rare so long will experts of tbe stamp alluded to find a vocation." There is no t fleet without a cause, and where there is a supply it Is almost in variably in response to a demand. To glyea iavorable opinion on a mining property it is not necessary to have tbe elaborate training of a mining engineer Those most familiar with mines can give a favorable opinion, and generally the appreciation Is inversely proportional to their knowledge. The opinions so given need not necessarily be dishonest, for the so called expert who has prob ably never seen tbe inside ct a mine, or, at most, only been In a lew short tunnels driven into tbe hillsides, Is as easily gulled as the most ordinary layman who does not effect the expert's garb and initials. "Salting" for such men would be a waste of time. Other types of so-called mining en gineers are they whose vocation is, or has been, more or less associated with mines. It may have been as assayers or surveyors. Both these classes of men may, some day, make engineers, with other and more varied experience, as both of tbetn have had part of the train ing necessary for a mining engineer, but to speak ot either of them as a mining engineer would be as inaccurate as to call the tall board of a violin an instru ment of music. This class of men usu ally realize, to somo extent, their weak ness, and by way of safety, if not pre pared to sell favorable opinions, they "turn down" most of tbe properties in spec ted. Of course, between mining engineers, who have bad tbe necessary training, there are great differences; some have had much more experience than others, and even between those having equal ex perience there fs frequently great dispar ity. A man's ability is compounded of two factois heredity and environment. The latter includes education or experi ence, the former tboee mental and I nhvaipnl mini t a. l.ll.

"We do not come into existence as sheets of white paper on which tbe world can write anything it pleases" -either technically or morally. Let us B3e wbat is required of a min- irtlumkf&a. ing engineer. lie may have to make topographical, geographical and mineral ogical surveys, for which purpose it is necessary that he should have a thorough knowledge of surveying, stratigraphies! geology and ralnoralogy. He frequently has to say whether certain ore deposits are or aro not workable commercially, and to do that he roust have a thorough knowledge of stratlgraphical geology, mineralogy, the various operations ot mining, the several processes of ore treat ment, the nature and uses ot mining machinery, and the average life ol differ ent kinds of deposits. Or, again, he may have to conduct the operations of a mine already part'ally or wholly opened out. In that case, It is necessary that he should be a good stratigraphlst, have a thorough knowledge of mining opera tlons, the processes of ore-treatment, the uses of mining machinery, .and also of the numerous subsidiary books required about a mine. Of all tbe various kinds of work that a mining engineer is called upon to do, there is not one which demands such a wide range of knowledge as that of re porting on undeveloped properties, and yet that is tbe very kind of work so called experts, who have had no exper ience in mining, profess to do. "Gill" alone could not biace itself to such pre sumption. Ignorance might, but ignor ance and gall combined assuredly could and do. It is of the first importance that a min ing engineer should be practical, and that there may be no mistake about this statement we will define. By practical, as here used, is meant tbe faculty of aptitude that comes to a man from con stant practice of the particular pursuit in which after proper training he is engaged. A mining engineer cannot be produced in a college of chemical laboratory, al though in both these places be will ob tain part of bis preliminary training; but It is on tbe mountain sides and in and about the mine and workshops that he learns these branches of bis profes sion hat are of the greatest commercial value. And let it never be forgotten that the mining engineer who is a commer cial failure cannot be moro than a very partial technical success. Tbe man who cannot make his mining pay had better become an expert at something else. It is sometimes contended that the beet person to direct the operations of a mine is a practical miner. Let us see what truth there is In this contention. The experience of a practical miner is con fined to pounding a drill, shot firing, driving a shovel and setting up timbers These operations bear about tbe same re lation to tbe complex requirements of a mining engineer that unconnected bolts, rivets and plates do to a finished steam ship. If by a display of extra ability, or for any other reason, tbe miner finds himself acting as the foreman of a mine, his experience is a Utile widened, but not much ; and if in later vears he should chance to become a superintendent, he has then an opportunity of familiarizing himself with one or more of the various processes of ore treatment, and the erec tion and use of machinery. But it will readily be seen that his experience even then fal's short of that necessary to the mining engineer. Not only so, but his preliminary training is altogether insuf ficient to enable him to discharge tbe duties of tbe latter. A raining engi neer's general training should include besides a good ordinary scholastic edu cation mathematics, physics, chemistry and geology." The President Still Hopes for Bimet allism. A Herald dispatch from Washington says: President McKinley and Secretary Gage are not In entire accord on tbe sub ject of monetary reform. Tbe President is still in favor of international bimetal lism, while his secretary of the treasury haltncoa (hat with lha fatlnra nf M.a Wl Mlt mlmloa t0 Europe all ho pe of an in- ' r ternational agreement for the enlarged nf .iir rtah,i There is no suggestion of international bimetallism, or any other kind of bimet allism, in tbe plan which Secretary Gage will submit to Congress in his annual re port. The message which President Mc- Kinley will send to Congress will not endorse Secretary Gage's scheme In Its entirety. The President will not give hie approval to the goldbond feature of Hip scheme, without which the whole struc ture is valueless. Since his return from Europe 8enator Wolcott has had several long talks with the President and has succeeded In I in pressing him with the belief that there is n possibility of bringing about an agreement between the United State and the principal commercial nations of Europe for a larger nee of silver. But for the influence of Senator Wolcott it if believed the President would have in dorsed the plan of his Secretary ol tin Treasury In Its entirety. Messrs. Brice of Chicago, Emmons of New York, Brazelle of St. Louis and .Marshall of Nebraska have each declared the'r ability to manufacture gold, thus, obviating the necessity of mining it. Mr Brazelle alleges that "from common clay" he can "turn out gold, silver, Iron, calcium, aluminum, and a number of other metals as yet unknown to science." His investigations have demonstrated that "there are but three primary met alscopper, lead and Iron which cannot be separated ihto component parts." He believes that by his process gold and sil ver will be turned out in such Urge quantities that all governments will be compelled to demonetize them. The company which has been formed to work Mr. Brazelle's process will, however, considerately confine its operations to tbe manufacture of aluminum, calcium, glacium, and zerium, one of the new metals, which Mr. Brazelle says is da stined to take the place of steel. Ac cording to tne dailies Mr. Brice is about to begin the manufacture of gold in Chicago In such quantities as to destroy the yocatlon of the miner. Duly mind ful of the requirements ot tbe situation, Mr. Brice baa begun contracting for an timony and has already engaged three carloads a week from Utah. There are possibilities in that direction in the Coeur d'Alenes, and, if Mr Brice, is financially able to purchase all tbe anti mony offered, ho may at least occasion increase market for that useful metal. M. & 3. Press. Rev. Dr. Henry Frank of Dover, New Jersey, recently made a tour among some of the churches in greater New York and was very much surprised to discover that a number of them favor an aristocracy of wealth that seeks the humiliation ol the masses and manifests the utmost con tempt for tbe poor. He went In the garb of a respectable mechanic to see whether any wealthy church would receive him cordially. In one church he stood 17 minutes, and then went out because no usher offered him a seat In another church he took a seat, but very soon a large man laid a heavy hand upon his shoulder and brusquely demanded to know what right be had there and ordered him ont. In another be stood eleven minutes waiting, hat in hand, to be asked to take a seat. Tbe ushers eyed him from bead to foot, and, judging from his appearance tbat he was a poor mechanic, superciliously passed him by. Every movement they made seemed to say, -'Get out of here," and therefore he left. He visited five churches and was treat ed similarly by all. At the close ol the day he was fully convinced that, while mechanics may be exemplary Christians, their presence in the wealthy churches of greater New York is not tolerated.

What would you do if war should be declared tomorrow with a European power? How would it chango your home life, the lives of your brother and other relatives? How would it nffect your business connections and business? What change would it make in financial, city, state and national sff-iirs? It is these interesting problems which a writ er in the December Cosmopolitan has undertaken to sketch under the holding of "A Brie! History of Our Lite War With Spain," at the same time vividly describing the exciting scenes which would attend the opening of hostilities.

Copper production in the United States in October, as reported by John Stanton, statistican for the producing companies, reached, Bays the New York Engineer ing and Mining Journal, a total of 17,511 tons and was closely up to the average ol the ten months of the present year. It shows, however, a decrease of 3J per cent from October of last year, and is considerably below that of the earlier months of tbe present year. The total United States pioduction for the ten months ending with October was 170,388 tons, which was greater by 4 per cent than in tbe corresponding period last year. Exports of copper from the United o atea showed a considerable decline as compared with previous months, and were 2580 tons lens than in October, 1890. The total this year has been 108, 975 tons, which Is 8384 tons more than last year. Our exports this year have been G2 per cent of our production. The foreign production shows little change this year; but the consumption abroad seems to keep up very well, in spite of the long strike in Great Britain and causes for decreased demand. The problem of how to utilize the vast quantities of mesquite beans that grow on the prairies of the Bouthwest has, it is believed, been Bolved. Numerous experiments at converting the bean Into a marketable commodity havo been made In recent years, but havo been pro ductive of no permanent results. A. J. Conley, manager of the Luting cotton oil mill, believes he has solved the problem. He had gathered a ton of mequite beans and treated tbem in the same manner as cotton Beed. From the ton of beans he seenred 16 gallons of clear, amber colored oil, very rich and with a very pleasant, aromatic smell. Tbe cake is dark brown, quite oily and Is eaten greedily by stock It is a well known fact that Btock fatten rapidly on the beans uu umt iiib year wnen mo crop is a heavy one is always a prosperous one for stockmen. This year the beans are very plentiful, thousands of tons of tbem fall ing from the trees and rotting. If they could be saved in tbe shape of ol! cake, there would be almost enough to carry stock through the winter. Stockman. Mark Twain's New Story Mark Twain's new humorous story, which he is now writing in Vienna, is to go to The Ladies' Home Journal, which magazine has also secured F Marlon Crawford's new story, which is a tale of the unreal, with the strikingly uncanny title of "The Dead Smile." 

MARK. . iV4w turn ivi jii s j ar The Oasis truly eaya: During the school days the parents should bo very careful how they tpeak of teachers be fore children. If there is any fault to bo found with the teacher by parents it should be talked in private and not in the hearing of children. They are won derful imitators, and it they hear any thing of tbe kind they very naturally will do the aarae, many times injuring both teacher and pupils, but the pupils most. Teachers, as a rule, are compe tent or they would not be employed. They have a great responsibility on tbeir shoulders, and parents should do all in their power to help them, Instead of to hinder. It would be well to consider these subjects carefully, and to co oper ate with the teacher and pupil in their work. The result will be better work and progress l.M...J-.J.J.n..Vnaflnj1lnjVWJ AN IDEAL INVESTMENT! TJUNDREDS and thousands of our 1A shrewd busines men all over the conntry are looking for an ideal invest ment. Impelled by this impulse they visit distant regions and Investigate many possibilities. Some put their nionev Into mines, some Into lumber lands, some into ranching, others into orange groves, or corner lots In cities not yet bullded and perhaps never will be, others pur chase stock m industrial enterprises, or become silent partners In business firms. or Interested in patent rightB or tbe for mation of syndicates. What a spectacle do these men, found by ecorea in every city and sizable vilUge, present who thus convert the noble race for eolid wealth into a wild scrabble for immediate and rapid gaina? Tbey are all seeking an ideal invest ment; something better than the ordin ary. That is what they re after. But what is an ideal Investment ? An ideal investment of money, whether for one's self or his heirs, is one, in the first place, that is absolutely safe. This is a prime essential. Without it no in vestment is worth a moment's atten tion from a prudent man. In the second place, it must yield a good rate of interest, and if the interest can be compounded, so much the better.
