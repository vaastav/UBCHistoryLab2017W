(*., DEC. 12. 1000. Current Events. The Republican Congress is pushing things--giving Democrats little time for ta k and protest. The army bill and the ship subsidy aro pot measures. . n army of a 100,000 and nine millions 8 year to ships as a 'onus to steamers carrying the mails to foreign countries. The committee, ways and means, pro pose to reduce the taxes forty millions, whlh the Democrats insist on sixty. | There is war talk between Portugal and Holland about a small matter and the several ministers La\ been with drawn. The quet n of the Dutch is just passing .ier terns and about to cele brate her nuptials and the quarrel is at an awkward time, but the Dutch will bo an over-match for the Southerners. The commission having in charge the Nicaragua canal report226 millions as the probable cost. The figures are a littlo'st irtling, but they call Ibis the great Republic and Uncle San, has a stout Btomaoh. The Senate promptly passed the Bill giving the South Carolina Charlestion Exposition a quarter of a mil ion and the House will probably follow suit. In the Senate, Executive session, Morgan, of Alabama, discussing the Isthmian canal, favored nout'-a'itv by this government und opposed fortify ing it (Tl > British Lion would lash his tail and roar.) It would he war. But Morgan 's a peg-leg eonfedand insisted that wc are not afraid. But a better way would bo to i nveigle the English ers to I ui d the canal at a half billion. We could then seize it, drive thes-i Is- I landers from the ocean, sink their uiighty men of war, seize on their West and East Indian possessions and the earth and all that is therein is "ourn."

Tho President under the constitu tion Is required from time to time, to deliver to Congress his recommenda tions as to the needs and condition of the country. His message sent down to Congress on the 3rd Is very full, en couraging in some r. ppectP. doleful and gruoM.ine in others. He congratulates the country upon its mighty expansion and prosperity, und then plunges i-ito a historj of the Chinese troubles. The storj re. da i;ke novel and it is only the ti'sL chapter, us the problem is still unsolved. He wants an army of from GO 000 to 100,01 0 to keep the peaco In the Philippines and for contin gences. The credit of the country is mighty, the treasury growing, and he recommends a fractional reduotlon in taxes. He gestures at true**, but does cot expect Banna to take, the hint. As a republican, speaking from a repub lican standpoint the President Is in high good humor and vaults into the new century upon a high horse. The paper is very business like and per functory no line writing, with strong ear mark.- of 'innocuous desuetude." Things are left to party managers large.y. McKinley will allix his Signa tur? and draw his saUry. * # * In ? m rising the important and succes>lu. industries of our city last week wc made several omissions: The Laurena Laundry<jrunder the supervb ion of Mr. T.

He suggested that the city fathers might put their beads togothor. Tho Bamberg Herald says that a pro position to er. ai.e now circuits and ad itlonai .Judge': will not go down and that we have enough of them. And there are others who swell the chorus. Twenty-five years ago a thief stole tho Judges chair from our Court Boom and the Court Room clock. The county commissioners replaced tho chair, It has been gracefully filled ever slnco, but tho clock has nevor been restored and tho Judge is mastor of his time. * Prosperity (not MoKin'ey's, but tho New-berry town) has hosten tho Dis pensary.
