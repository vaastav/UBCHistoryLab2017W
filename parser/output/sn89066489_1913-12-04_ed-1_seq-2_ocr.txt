- H; THE PRESIDENrS ANNUAL MESSAGE No Peace in Mexico Until Gen. Huerta Lets 60. WANTS MONEY BILL PASSED Mr. Wil3on Also Urges the Enactment of Legislation to Make Farming a More Efficient Business Other Important Points. Washington, Dec. 2 The following la a summary of President Wilson's message, delivered to Congie.-:s In pursuance of my constitutional duty to "ftivo to the Congress in formation of the stale of the I'nion,' 1 tane tne liberty ot addressing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to engage the attention of your houorable bodies, as of all who study the weliare of the nation. I shall ask your indulgence if 1 venture to depart in some degree Irom the usual custom of gelling be fore you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the at tention and called for the action of tne several departments of the gov ernment or which look to them lor early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which 1 should have to subject it. 1 shall sub mit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your com mittees and of all members of the Congress who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious impor tance, as constituting the very sub stance of the business of the govern ment, makes comment and emphasis on my pan unnecessary. The country, I urn thankful to say, Is at. peace with all the .world, and any happy manifestations multiply obout us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of of settled peace and good will. Hue.-ta Must Let Co. . There is but one cloud upon our horfc-.n. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. Ther can be no certain prospect ol peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurptf authority in Mexico; until it is under stood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the l'nited States. We are the friends of constitutional gov ernment in America; we are more than its friends, we' are its cham pions: because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we wouh' wish in "every way to make prom ol our friendship, work t.ut their own development in peace and libeity. Mexico has no government. The at tempt to maintain one at the t'ity ol Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism lias been set up which lias hardlv more than the semblance of national authoi ity. Currency Reform. I turn to matters of domes! ic con cern. You already have under con sideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with impati ence, as Tor something fundamental to its whole business life and neces sary to set credit free from abntrary and artificial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early enactment into law. I take leave to beg that the whole energy and atten tion of the Senate be concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully disposed of. And yet I feel that the request is not needed that the mem bers of that great house need no urg ing in this service to the country. I present to you, in addition, the argent necessity that special pro vision be made also for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers of the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with other business men and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon Its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit. Let Sherman Law 8tand. Turn from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city and in the factory, and I t&lnk that all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe the business communities of the country la to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has been pre vented. I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti trust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, hut that we should aa much as posst Me reduce the area of thai debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also supple ment that great act by legislation which would not only clarify it but r aJee facilitate its administration and I" auk It fairer to all coneeraed. nees lor the presidency ol the United States. 1 feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or the expectations of the country when 1 urge the prompt enactment of legisla tion which will provide for primary elections throughout .e country at which the voterstif the several parties may choose their nominees for the presidency without the Intervention of nominating conventions. I venture the suggestion that this legislation should' provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for" the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties. Philippine Independence. We can satisfy the obligations of generous justice toward the people of lJorto Rico by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges ac corded our own citizens in our own territory and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions of self-government al ready granted them, but in the Philip-, pines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, and we must move to ward the time of that indeepndence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid. Double Duty Toward Alaska. A duty faces us with regard to Alaska which seems to me very press ing and very imperative; perhaps 1 should say a double duty, for it con cerns both the political and the ma terial development of the territory. The people of Alaska should be given the full territorial form of govern ment, and Alaska, as a storehouse, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of railways. These the gov ernment should itself build and ad minister, and the ports and terminals it should itself control in the interest of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the coun try and its people. Specially Important. Three or four matters of special im portance and significance 1 bes that you will permit me to mention in clos- ng. Our bureau of mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service than it renders now in improving the condi tions of mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more safe. We owe it, in mere justice to the railway employes of the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act; and a law that we can stand by in this matter will be no less to the advantage of those who administer the rain-odds of the country than to the advantage ot those whom they employ. An international congress ior the discission of all questions that affect safety at sea is now sitting in London at the suggestion of our own govern ment. So soon as the conclusions of that congress can be learned and con sidered we ought to address our selves, among other things, to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust and burdensome conditions which now surround the employment of sailors and render it extremely difficult to obtain the services of spirited and competent men such as every ship needs if it is to be safely handled and brought to port.
