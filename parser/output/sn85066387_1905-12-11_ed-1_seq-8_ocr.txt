SAN FRANCISCO MONDAY ....DECEMBER n, 1905 CONDITIONS IN WALL STREET. IT is now almost the middle of December and the winter lull in trade which usually appears about the last of November has not yet appeared, except here and there. On the contrary, the reports to the different commercial agencies speak of a continually expanding volume of domestic commerce, with a holiday trade which bids fair to exceed all previous records. The bank clearings testify to this, the total in November being the largest ever recorded for The immediate result of this brilliant exhibit has been to lead the public into all sorts of speculations, based upon a widespread optimism which no admonitions appear to shake. This is seen in continued excitement in Wall street, where the daily sales have run about on an average of 1,500,000 shares per day, with prices rising on the whole, and some stocks advancing by leaps and bounds, in several instances from $5 to $10 per share a day. The situation in this great mart has become very peculiar. Gen erally a violent advance in the interest rates for call loans has been sufficient to check undue speculation, but the rule is no longer work ing at present. Like a deranged clock, it has stopped. With a money market ranging from 10 per cent in the morning to 27 per cent in the afternoon, closing at 4 and 5 per cent, and the same wild fluctuation repeated on the very next day, speculation in rail way and industrial shares has gone on with an expansion which savor 6 of recklessness. In fact, the violent advances in the interest rates have been received by the street with defiance and incredulity, and many doubts of their genuineness have been expressed. Prominent and posted operators have loudly proclaimed that there is no reason for any such rise in rates, and that they are merely the manipulation of the money market by financiers who want to discourage speculation at present. This is as loudly denied by opposing interests, who assert that the advances are genuine and caused by an actual scarcity of funds, which are being used to move the crops, and by the refusal of Secretary Shaw r to come to the re lief of the market with some $25,000,000 or $30,000,000, as he, was expected to do several weeks ago. The Secretary in his turn says that he is willing and ready to relieve the market whenever he finds :t necessary, but that thus far he does not see that the market ac tually needs his assistance. The situation seems to be that large financial interests are ar tificially advancing the interest rates to restrain the present feverish speculation, but that they are not succeeding. The cry of continued prosperity and more to come, with a persistent expansion of-trade based on large crops and a brilliant statistical situation, is the re sponse of the speculating public to the warnings of the banks and financiers, and the long interests have fhe whip in their hands and are lashing the horse into a gallop. It is remarked in this connec tion that the very interests who are warning the public not to get excited into excessive buying are quietly unloading their large hold ings of securities on every advance, and thus making hay while the sun shines. At the present pace the public will soon have all the stocks and incidentally the experience, and the great bankers and other large holders of stocks, having got rid of them at boom value?, will sink back in their office chairs and with a broad smile of satisfaction wait to see what the market will do next. It is not hard to guess, the result. Aside from this wave of speculation in Wall street conditions throughout the country continue encouraging. The bank clearings still show an increase over corresponding periods last year, and while the weekly gains of late have been smaller, the volume of *the clearings has run high, generally over $3,©00,000,0003 ,©00,000,000 per week. Those last week were $3,436,575,000, and the net gain in the coun try was 1.6 per cent, most of the important cities and towns showing" an increase. The money in circulation is reported at $88,000,000 more than at this time last year. While funds are expected to rule high the rest of the year, there is a general agreement among posted observers that relief is in sight: that while speculation has defied -all rules during this remarkable year the bankers say one precedent still holds good, and that is the January return of currency from the interior to New York. But this may be offset by the large demands upon the market then for the usual January interest and dividend disbursements. The staples have been rather more interesting during the week. Continued estimates by the Government and Southern associations as to the volume of the cotton crop have kept the cotton market excited and fluctuating with the general tendency toward advancing prices. Hides are quieter, as the leading tanners have supplied their needs for the time being. Wool is also quiet, the high prices check ing the demand for the raw material. Provisions show no features worthy of remark. Trading in grain at Chicago has developed no striking features beyond an immense demand for oats and a good export movement in corn. Dun's reports an advance in its index number for commodity prices to $105,312 on December 1, against 8103,858 the preceding month, and the past week has brought still another advance. Conditions on this coast at the moment are largely hinging on the weather. While the recent rains have enabled the plows .to start in many localities the current cold nights and frosty mornings have kept green feed and other vegetation back, and the general desire now is for more rains and softer weather. Otherwise condi tions are fully as promising as at any time during the past six or eight years. . THE 

CHICAGO RATE CONVENTIONS. RATE-MAKING is the one clear cut issue which caused a split among the delegates who went to Chicago to attend the as sembly called by President Bacon, with an intent to impress upon Congress the demand of the people of all parts of the country for legislation outlined in the President's last annual message. So explicitly did the call make plain that the meeting was to be an indorsement convention of the President's rate-making. policy that the break awa3' of a, minority of the delegates to form a non-indors ing and adverse convention was manifestly absurd. To make this plain it is necessary only to quote some words, from the speech of the leader of the dissenters, D.-M. Parry, presi dent of the National ; Association of Manufacturers, who said : "Rather do I prefer to believe that this crusade to endow a political commission with a socialistic and czar-like power to fix transporta tion prices is what is popularly and very aptly termed a hot-air movement." "I am more inclined to take the view that Government rate-making is an impracticable and dangerous scheme." "A propo sition that is not a whit better than Government ownership." "It is from the populace 2nd demagogues that we have come to, expect propositions that the Government shall interfere with the rights of property." • For a reply to Parry, we get it briefest and best from Governor Van Sant of Minnesota, who said: "The President is right The people will not submit to the misuse of the vast powers of corporate wealth : it will not long submit to the dictation of its creatures. The great trust corporations exist, in fact their life depends, upon special privileges granted them in the various . States." He quotes with approval this: "You cannot disguise the fact that it is to be either Government ownership or Government control." Among the Republican statesmen who arc not in favor of a third terra for President Roosevelt doubtless may be counted Senator. Foraker of Ohio.— Philadelphia Record. Tammany is a, pretty bad proposition,' but . nobody has ever claimed that it was as bad as the Philadelphia "gang."— Chattanooga Times.' ,' Senator Platt is a horrible example of the man who refuses to let go until he has to. — Chicago News. jPHE SAN
