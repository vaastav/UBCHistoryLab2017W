Lynch Law Is Still Supreme Short Shrift for Brutes STATE BOVERNQR' SPEAKS HIS MIND ON BLACK OWE Blease of South Carolina An nounces Officially That Women Must Be Protected RICHMOND MEETING RICH IN RESULTS Theories of Penology Are Discussed at Conference of Executives RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 3.—-In the name of the state of South Carolina Governor Blease served notice to the governors' conference here today that lynchers of negro assailants of white Wp en in his state would go un punished. Governor Blease warmly defended his use of pardoning power as well aa declarjng that In 22 months he had pardoned or paroled approximately 400 persons and that he hoped the number at the end of the second term would be 800. "I have said all over South Carolina, and I say it again, now," he declared, "that I will never order out the militia to shoot down their neighbors and pro tect a black brute who commits the nameless crime against a white woman. ONLY GET THE RHiHT MAN "Therefore, in South Carolina, let it be understood that when a negro as saults a white woman all that is needed Is that they get the right man, and they who get him will neither need nor receive a trial." * Governor Blease justified the use he had made of his pardoning power, he Bald, by conditions he had found in penal institutions in the state. Flogging, in some cases, for chll tflren; the whipping post for violators of certain laws, and sterilization of assailants of women, were advocated by Governor Baldwin of Connecticut In an address delivered this afternoon before the governors' conference here. In his speech Governor Baldwin de clared that he was more in sympathy With the "classical school of penology" than the "new or noisier one. mainly jmade up of sentimental humanitarians or theoretical psychologists." The former school, he said, maintains that criminals should ordinarily be punished by subjection to some form of suffering; the other that they should ordinarily not be made to suffer for their misdeeds except as nature forces it upon them through the mind, but that their treatment by the state should be aimed primarily at their moral im provement. Governor Baldwin's address followed address hy Governor Shafroth W <f~ ->rado. In which Governor Shafroth ■ rated lenient but certain punish ment to criminals and cited his own state as an example where this system had worked well.

FATHER, 80, SUES SON . FOR MONTHLY SUPPORT Parent, Bent and Crippled, Seeks Court Order Requiring Heir to Keep Promise of Aid An appeal to the superior court to compel hia son to pay a share with three others toward his support was made yesterday by Jacob Miller, who describes himself as a bent and crip pled man of 80 years.

DECEMBER 4. 1912. FOREIGN POLICY OF THIS NATION TO BE VIGOROUS In Annual Message Presi dent Points Out That the United States Has Be come World Power AMERICAN CAPITAL MAY AID DIPLOMACY This Country Assumes Po lice Powers Over Central American States WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. —President Taft's first message to the last session of congress in his term was received with close attention by both branches when legislative business began today. Dealing entirely with foreign relations and American progress in foreign trade, the message paves the way for others the chief executive will send later deal ing with the big questions of legisla tion and government. A note of warning to European powers, which, by indirect means, con tinue tew discriminate against American trade; a strong appeal to congress to uplift the great foreign policies of America above mere questions of par tisanship; a triumphant vindication of the diplomacy of the administration, which is characterized as that of "dol lars versus bullets"; a masterful pride in the enormous expansion of American trade as a, result of the foreign policies of his administration, and an earnest appeal for joint action by congress and the executive to open new markets for American industries —these are the more striking features of President Taft's fourth annual message sent to congress today. 

GOOD RELATIONS ABROAD The message Is the first of a series of such communications which he will make to congress in the early days of the session, and deals entirely with the foreign relations of the United States. Beginning with the usual reference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the president adds that these have been strengthened by "a greater Insistence upon justice to American citizens or Interests wherever it may have been denied, and a stronger em phasis of the need of mutuality In com mercial and other relations." For the first time in Its history, says the president, the state department has obtained substantially the most favored nation treatment from all of the coun tries of the world. Therefore, he says, it is only natural that, competitive countries should view with some con cern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning: "If in some in stances the measures taken by them to meet it are not entirely equitable, a remedy should be found." To this end the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the government, instead of imposing the full maximum rates of duty against discriminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties up to the mixlmum of 25 per cent. "Flat tariffs are out of date," says the president. "Nations no longer ac cord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, irrespective of the treatment from them received. • * • It Is very necessary that the American gov ernment should be equipped with weapons of negotiation adapted to mod ern economic conditions." 

STATE DEPARTMENT ARCHAIC The state department, "an archaic and Inadequate machine," at the be ginning of this administration, the president says, has become a new or ganization, with highly specialized bu reaus and experts dealing with every phase of American trade and diplo macy. Holding that the essence of this reorganized service is found in the merit system, which President Cleve land is credited with having intro duced, President Taft makes a strong appeal to congress to make this ma chine permanent by giving the force of statutory law to the executive orders governing admission to and promotion In the doplomatlc and consular services. To show that these appointments are already largely nonpartisan, the president points to the fact that three of the present ambassadors are hold overs; that of the 10 he has appointed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister; that of the 30 ministers appointed, 11 were promotions; and that in the consular ser-ice no less than 55 per cent of the consuls ap pointed by him were from the southern states. "The diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern ideas of commercial , inter course," says President Taft. "This policy has been characterized as sub stituting dollars for bullets. It is one that appeals alike to idealistic humani tarian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and strategy, and to le gitimate commercial aims." The president adds that "because modern diplomacy is commercial, there has been a disposition in some quarters to attribute to It none but material istic aims. "How strikingly erroneous Is such an impression may be seen from a study of the results by which the diplomacy of the United States can be Judged," says the president. 

FRIENDLY OFIHCES EXTENDED He mentions the arbitration treaties with France and Great Britain, which ailed of confirmation in the senate; the , successful tripartite mediation of the i Argentine Republic, Brazil and the J United States between Peru and Ecua dor; the arbitration of the Panama- ' Costa Rica boundary dispute; the inter vention between Haiti and the Domini- I can republic on the verge of war; the suppression of the Nicaraguan war; the halting of internecine strife In Hon- j duras; the adjustment of the celebrated > Tacna-Arlca dispute between Peru and j Chile, and the adjustment of the Peru- | vian-Ecuadoran boundary Issue. In consequence of these things, says ' the president, there has been a general I easing of international tension on the ! west coast of South America. He also adds that the diplomacy of the United States is active in seeking to assuage Oroville Orange and Olive Show Visit Oroville's big exposition, De cember 3 to 7. and see where Cali fornia's earliest oranges and finest olives grow.

CASTOR IA For Infants and Children. The Kind You Have Always Bought Signature of (^a^yTA&^Mi "Dollar Diplomacy" Defended Tariff Is Weapon of Trade War "Substitute dollars for bullets," was the phrase used by President Taft in his message on foreign relations, urging that the government support American enterprise abroad. He recommends help by Amer ican bankers in Central America to remove the menace of foreign creditors and revolutionary disorder, and financial investment in China. The amendment of the maximum and minimum provisions of the tariff to allow the president to apply duties so as to meet nations dis criminating against this country was urged, as was also the enactment or an opium law to stamp out the traffic. "Patient nonintervention" was the characterization of the govern ment's policy in the Mexican troubles, recognizing constituted and attempting to care for American interests. In regard to Chinese conditions, Taft stated that he United States maintained full and friendly de facto relations with the provisional government, while for the present Balkan situation he referred to the protection of American interests by sending a squadron to the scene. His general recommendations include a merchant marine, good American banks in South and Central America and a permanent and well paid foreign service. the remaining ill feeling between" this country and Colombia. Taking up some of the details of the year's diplomatic work, the president refers with expressions of pride to China, where "the policy of encouraging financial investment to enable that country to help itself has had the result of giving new life and practical appli cation to the open door policy." The consistent purpose has been to encour age the use of American capital in China, says the president, to promote the reforms to which that country 1b pledged by treaty with the United States and other powers. There has been a vigorous assertion also, he says, of the equal right of the United States to a voice in all questions pertaining to Chinese loans and developments. 

AFFAIRS IN NICARAGUA President Taft. makes the direct charge that the terrible events recorded in Nicaragua recently, the useless loss of life, the devastation of property, the bombardment of the principal cities, the killings and the tortures and suf fering, "might have been averted had the department of state, through ap proval of the loan convention b$- the senate, been permitted to carry out its now well developed policy." "In Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nicaragua and Honduras to help themselves," says President Taft. While they are the immediate bene ficiaries, the profit to the United States Is twofold, he adds. The Monroe doc trine is more vital In the neighborhood of the Panama canal, and such coun tries should be relieved of the jeopardy of heavy foreign debts likely to pro voke International complications. The financial rehabilitation of these countries by American bankers and the protection of their custom houses from being the prey of would be dictators, says the president,, would remove the menace of foreign creditors and revo lutionary disorder. Furthermore, the United States would profit largely In a business way through the development of the great natural resources of Cen tral America. 

PROFESSIONAL REVOLUTIONISTS Commending the successful results of the application of the new neutrallty Jaws to Mexico and other troubled countries, the president suggests that means be found in addition to prevent the professional revolutionists from making American ports "foci" for rev olutionary intrigue. He reiterated his determination to adhere in the case of Mexico to the "patient policy of nonintervention, steadfast recognition o*f constituted authority, and the exer tion of every effort to protect American interests." Other paragraphs of the message point to the increase of American do mestic exports by $200,000,000 during the last y*ar, making the greatest total ever known, $2,200,000,000; to the agricultural credit system which he thoroughly indorsed; to the probable necessity of an amendment of the fur seal act to permit limiting killing of seals; to a meeting of the arbitrators In Washington next year to adjust the pecuniary claim between Great Britain and America; to negotiations with Mexico for the distribution of the waters of the Colorado river In the Im perial valley section, and to the finan cial rehabilitation of Liberia. There is merely historical reference to the Chinese revolution; to the Santo Domingan troubles, the rebellion in Cuba and the Balkan war develop ments, in which it is said the United States is not involved. The message concludes with an earn est appeal to congress to co-operate with the executive in Its efforts to apply the old principles of diplomacy which have governed the country, to the momentous new situations of today, when America finds itself at the thresh old of her middle age as a nation: "too mature to continue in Its foreign relations those temporary expedients natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern."
