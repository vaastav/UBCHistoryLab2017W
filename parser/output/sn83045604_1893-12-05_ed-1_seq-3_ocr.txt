Dec. 4.— The riewa of both bouses concerning the message are freely expressed. Ex-Speaker Reed said: "It is exceedingly disappointing, both in matter an<l manner, on the Hawaiian question. We are left as much in the dark as ever and must wait news from the next steamer, just as we have been wsiting ao Song. That part of the message which relates to the tariff asseverates that the house committee in chsrge of that subject has formulated p.ens and devised meth ods of taxation which, as s member of the committee, I hare not even beard pro posed. It is a rather unusual senaation to *earn of the deed* of a committee, not in tbe committee but from the presi dent of the United States. lias that com pi it tee ceased, in form, to be composed of both parties, and has it without even the formality of a word in open committee informed tbe president of its determination in such a way that the president can officially com municate it to tha house? How long has it been a part of our system that a com mittee of an independent branch, and above all a committee which controls the purse, shall report to congress throurh tbe president? Is this the resuit of the ru mored blending of the appointive with the lecislattve power? "It is bad enough to have the tariff bill made up by a little coterie, but to have it communicated to the president before it reaches even the committee, still less the house, shows a deterrn.nation to be moved by no facts and modi tied by no arguments, and make« apparent the aosurditv of ap pointing? Republicans on the committee of ways and means at all." Mr. Springer approved of the reference to Hawaii as tbe only course consistent with international honor and comity. Holman—lt is an able and forcible docu ment. McCreary—lt is sble and aopropriate. Doltivsr of lows—lt is wanting in de finiteness and makes no pretense to lead ership of pubiic opinion. Wilson of Weal Virginia—Ths message is all right Tracey of New York—l am heartily in accord with it. Gear of lows—The president gives sway the ways and means committee on the in come tax, saya he will restore Liliuokalant and agrees with Hancock that the tariff is a local issue. Hynum of Indiana—lt Is a clear and concise statement. Boutelle— It is the first executive docu ment which chsrges a United States min ister with malfeasance and treason. l'sine of New York—lt is a remarkably disappointing document Dingiey of Maine—lt is volnmlnoua and wearisome. Dalzell of Pennsylvania—^That portion on the tariff shows that facts wsigh nothing with tsnff reformers. Hepburn of lowa—The discuasion of the Hawaiian policy is disappointing. Cannon of Illinois —The message will not tend to restore confidence to the pro ducing and commercial interests of the country. Voorhees of Indiana—ln tbe main it is a sound, strong doenment Mcpherson—ExceLent all the way th rough. Murphy—lt is s good messsge. Palmer—Ths president's impressions ars wide of the mark regarding fraudulent pensions. Kyle—l sm pleased with the Income tax portion, but not about Hswali and ths issusnce of bonds. Morrill—The indorsement of a tariff bill not yet acted upon in committee is unex pected and remarkable. Hoar—lt treats important questions feeblr and briedy. The reference to the tariff report is a breach of privilege. Mitchell—l am surprised to learn the restoration of tj ieen Liliuokaiani is really contemplated. Hswley—lt lacks vigor and is a dissp pointnif-nt. Dubois—lt is Iscklng in force, strength and Americsniam. Jones of Nevada—There Is no hope for silver while the present administration is in power. Piatt—lt scarcely deserves comment. Slump— I am disappointed at the absence of any recommendation of the recognition of silver. Dixon—lt is wearisome and without aug legations a* to the immediate interests of the country. Manlerson of Nebraska—With dogged obstinacy and mulish stubbornness that persists in wrong-doing when fad enlight enment shows a w ser course, the admin istration, bavin* hau ed down the flag in Hawaii, now proposes to trample it in the dust We are a*feed to trade the goddess ol liberty for a harlot.

The inference from Mr. Cleveland's facta and figures, whether in tended or not, la that it is the true policy to cultivate close relations with us. It seems generailv ajrreed that the new tariff proposals will not larireiy affect our trade with the I nited Statea." Tne < »-.V says: "In tha references to Itraxil and Bering sea in I'raaident C evt-land's mesaaite there is nothing that might not have be*n fathered by i'res.- dent Harrison. It is otherwise with refer ence to Hawaii.

The Slmndard says: "From oar point of *** wd in spite of Mr. Cleveland's friendly attitude toward Eng.snd. we mtgbt aim oat regard the proposed new tariff aa the work of an enemy. Ita natural consequence is to create a new competitor for old Business abroad, and we can only hope experience and the benefit of cheap raw materia may lead to better thin pi in other directions." NEW Toss, Dec. The World says: "The messsge a* a wbo e. while it will not add grestly to Mr. Cleve.snd's fame as a writer or leader, is a sensible, sincere, patriotic document." Tbe Morning Advertiser says: "The peo ple know what they may expect. A great tight ia before them, beaded by Presi dent Cleveland himself. The free traders will make a desperate effort to pass the W.lson bill, which, while it is not a free trade meaaure, has in it a menace of destruction of our industries which all have feared." The Herald says: "The dominant note of the message is prompt tariff revision. All other matters are subordinated to this, which Mr. Cleveland pioperly regards as now tbe overshadowing issue before con gress and the country." SmisoritLp, Mass.. Dec. 4.—The CV.»o» •ays: "The president stands squarely for tariff reform of the Wilson variety, but ignores the lesson taught by the last elec tion and assumes that the people are anxious for radical revision of the existing schedules. His allusion to the work of aiding tbe people through the work of tariff reform is misleading, for it is per fectly clear that the people are suffering today as a result of general fear that the policy which he advocates will be carried out." 

CHICAOO, Dec. 4.—The Tims*, Dem., severely condemns the president's position on the Hawaiian question, and says hs is to be congratulsted on the astuteness with which he has laid pat lines of retreat from an unpopular and untsnabls position. The general tone of tbe comment is very un favorable. The Inter Orenn says: "The general tone of this message is as commonplace as the one of IRB7 was sensational." The Record says: "The general motive of the message as a whole tray be said to be economy." 

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 4,-rThe TfU/rraph says: "The document makes a wilderness of words covering every possible subject before the executive for his official cog nisance, and gives far more attention to divers snd sundry irrelevant and unim portant things thsn it does to others which sre not only foremost in the public mind at this time, but which must be esrnestly considered snd, for the time being st lesst, definitely settled." The Bulletin says: "The message is dis appointing in its fsilure to deal explicitly or closely with impartant questions of policy which interest ell his countrymen. Even those subjects on which he expresses emphatic opinions are disposed of in sweeping general conclusions rather in exact statements. Cleveland's mental re luctance or inability to grasp grest ques tions st short range or in specific detsll has never been more evident than in this jejune document" ST. Locta, I>ec. 4.—Ths Glttbe-Demoerat ssys: "It is on tbe whole a clear, well written and business-like document snd except on the Hawsiian and silver ques tions, will prove fsirly satisfactory to the country. The Hawaiian mstter is destined to make trouble for the administration, snd Mr. Cleveland sppesrs to have s fore boding of this, but be proposes to sdhere to the policy he has marked out. His views on the tinsncisl question are wise." FT. PACL. Dec. 4.—The J'tonerr Prttt says: •'We csn find in this message evidence only of the unsdmirable qualities of dull ness and jealousy that lesve even to his psrtisans no room for enthusiasm over ths beginning of this.sdministration." SAS KRASCISCO, Dec. 4.—The OrU, Rep., says editorially of Cleveland's message: "It covers a great deal of ground, but on points upon vhich information was looked for little light is thrown. In respect to ths tariff, as was expected, the result ot the elections of 1*93 is disregarded. In respect to the Hawaiian problem the mes sage assumes as facts statements which are evidently disputed. Not less than nine-tenths of the message is a summary of department reports and sreststement of known facts." The Examiner, Dem., says: "One of the most important duties of trie present ad ministration seems to be reversal of the various policies initiated by Harrison. On the whole Mr. Cleveland has given us a good, businesslike message, one that promises a session of congress fruitful in results t»f value to the country." The I'hronisl', Rep., says: The message d<»es not rise above the dead level of medi ocrity. It would be difficult to conceive mom unsatisfactory treatment of the sil ver question than that in the message. The president has nothing new to say about the tariff.

"Tbe unpropriety of an ex-president dis cusaing publicly the president's message,'' said he, "is very palpable, and I do not care to do so. I am a Republican and President Cleveland is a 1 niocrat, conse quently we differ radically in our views and opinions, and his suggestions and rec ommendations are not in accordance with my ideas.
