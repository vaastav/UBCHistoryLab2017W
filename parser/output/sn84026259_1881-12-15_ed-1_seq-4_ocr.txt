TRIAL OF GUITEAU. On the eigiitoonth dsy pnbllo Interest In Ihe trial was unabated, and the court-room fM crowded notwithstanding It was the opening day of Congress. The following eight doctors, who hare mado a study of mental disoasos, wore called bv the dofensei Doctors J. Q. IUeman, Charles H. Nichols, superintendent of the bloomingdale (New York city) insane asylum ; Chwlos Folsom, of Boston ( Bamuol Worcester, of Salem, Mass.; W. W. Oolding, superintendent cf the govomment insane asy lum at Washington; James 1L Mclirido, of Milwaukee; Walter Channing, of Brookline, Ultra.; and Theodore W. Fisher, of Boston. A hypothetical qnostion, in which tho points relating to the prisoner's mental condition as sot forth bv the dofonse, including the insanity in his family, and his alleged belief that he aoted upon inspiration, wore assumed to be ma rmrl tn the fnrnffninT and thov were asked whether upon the state of things they thought Guitean was insane. Seven of them repuoa tuai n me propusiuoiu, no u tho man was insano. Dr. Worcester would no) txpross an opinion, becauso ho wanted I nxnlanation of the word Inspiration tha Itr. ScoTUle gave him. Gnitcau constantly rter.irea in mo prucceuiugH. o ucguu u.y sarin? that he wanted the experta to pass npon tho question whether when a man claims he is impcllod to do an illegal act by a power beyond him he is sane or insane. He showed a protty clear understanding of the testimony given, and once pointed out how well it fitted his case. Aa usual ho was Bensitivo on tho question of his mental powors, and was angry when a witness stoke diBConraeingly of his Gar field speech, declaring he would rather be nangRd as a sonsiDie man man auqiuueu t r it fool, lie was also attended by a Question Implying that he was a vulgar criminal. There was nothing vulgar about this case, he ei rlaimed ; it was all high-toned. At the end of Ihe dav's proceedings, when Mr. Sooville an lonnced that ho expected to have President Arthur as a witness, Guitean insisted that 3encral Grant, cx-Senatora Conkling and Tlatt. tx-Govornor Jowoll and others should bo called tn 1mw what was the political situation before the assassination. He also suggested that President Arthur would do well to appoint Smory A. Btorrs as attorney-general. Tho first w itness called for the defense on ffio nineteenth day was Congressman Charles B. Farwcll, of Chicago, who tostifled that he bad bad one or two interviews witn uuitcan, and regarded him as insano; but on cross-ex amination he said Guitean could distinguish betwoen right and wrong. After a short exam ination of George C. Gorham, editor of the Washington Republican, during which Guitean constantly and violently interrupt ed and asked questions, at ono time saying that his counsel, Sir. Scoville, was "getting cranky on this business." tho dofense closed, Mr. Scovillo saying, however, that he expected some testimony from President Arthur and Dr. Bpitzka. Mr. Scovillo explained that what ho wanted to show by tho President's tes timony was that in October last Guitean wroto him a letter on public business, and he im plied that ho regarded this lottor as proof of ihe prisoner's insanity. It was arranged that Ho should sena written quostions to tho I'resi dent. During tho close of tho session a curious scene occurred when Mr. Scoville proceeded to read from Guiteau's book, "Truth." Mr. Scovillo eaid he would have to read tho whole book, and ho was boginning to do so when the ririsonor called out to him: "Do not read it ike a schoolboy. Read it with some spirit." Thereupon Mr. Scovillo proposed that tho Erie oner himself should do the reading, and e proccoded to do so, with rather a poor effort at declamation and with occasional illustrative remarks, such as, " That is the way that Paul got in his work." When a slight diaturbanco was caused by some of the spectators trying to get out, the prisoner commanded ordor and said: " Some of this book is interesting. It is rood religious talk. It will do people good to hear it read." After about threo-quartcrs of au hour spent in this way tho district-attorney in tervened, representing that this was a war-'to of Ihe time of tho court, and as the result o( some discussion it was agreed that Mr. Scoville should tho next day mark tho portions of the book to which ho proposed to call tho attention of tho jury. Gniteau began proceedings on tho twentieth day by declaring himBelf dissatisfied with the development of the facts relating to the politi cal situation, wherein lay Uie gist of tho al legod offense, and he renewed his demand for tho testimony of Grant, Conkling, Piatt, "and those kind of men." lie announced also his purpote to make the dosing snoech for the defense. No answer hav ing been received from the half-dozen 3uooUono aulimittod in writing to 1'rnni ent Arthur the couit said that the defense should have tho benefit of this testimony when obtained. Guiteau disclaimed a wish to bring the Prosidont into court, expressing a high re gard for him and claiming tho credit of havii.g mane mm rrcsment. 'ine prosecution called to the witness stand Genoral W. T. Sherman, who identified the letter that was placed in bis bauds after the shootinsr written bv Gui teau, and said that he suspected at the timo that thcro might be a conspiracy, but afterwards ho concluded that tho shooting was tho act of ono man. Guiteau hero thanked tho general for protecting him with tho military, at which the warrior smiled grimly. Tho pioseoution then put upon the witness stand ten citizens of Frecport, 111., who icBiiucci to tneir intlmato acquaintanoo with tho assassin's father, and declared their belief in his perfoct sanity, which they never hoard questioned until after July 21ast Their names are Edward P. Barton, a lawyer; A. T. Green, a collector; G. W. Tandy, boot and shoe dealer; JJr. v. 1. uuckiey, who had been the family physician of Guiteau's father; 8. D. Atkins, editor Freenort Jtevublican: J. 8. Cochran, a lawyer; G. W. Oiler, a justice of the roace; A. A. Babcock, a lawyer; State Senator u. u. Hunttonaua, ana uoraca raruox, capital ist. Wbilo ono of these witnesses was being examined, the prisoner took occasion to com ment upon the President's message, saving: "I am glad that General Arthur has rapped those miserable Mormons, and I hope he will . do it again. I want him to make it a specialty of his administration to destroy Mormonisni, The message shows that he is a very fine man in his administration. I expect he will give us tho best administration we have ever had. The message has the true ring to it" Uuituau camo into court on the twenty-first day escorted in tho usual fashion-an officer walking in front, a secoud one behind him, holding him by his left arm, under which there was a bundle of newspapors, and behind still another officer. Tho day was more exciting than any recent day of the trial, and the mass of evidence taken was exceedingly damaging to the defense. The first witness called was Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, a cousin of the assassin, a daughter of tho Mrs. Julia Maynard whom the defense had sought to make out insane. Mrs. Maynard was a sister of Luther W. Guiteau, the assassin's father, and the purpose of the defense was, of course, to Bhow parallel oases of insanity in that generation of the Guiteaus. Tho witnoss eulogized her mother with a quivering voico, and testified that she had never seen the slightest trace of flightiness in her conduct. In the course of her testimony Mik. Wilson stated that her father was lneaue bofore he died, and this led to scene between the assassin and his brother. John W. Guiteau rose, and addressing the court asked that the question and answer be stricken out as irrele vant. He protested against having things of this kind, not affecting any blood relation of the prisoner, go out to the world. The dis trict attorney intimated that the testimony was valuable as showing that if Abby Maynard (one of the two members of the Guiteau family who have been members of insane asylums) was in sane, she probably inherited insanity from her father. Mr. Scoville was now on his foet, angrily objecting to any interference by John W. Guiteau. This fired the assassin at once. "I think he's a perfect nuisance," he shouted, banging his fist on the table in front of him, while his eyca gleamed hatefully. "He'd better go back to Boston. I haven't known anything about him for years. He just crawled into this case, and he's try ing to got a little notoriety out of me. I never recognized him aa a brother. He's not of coun sel in this case and don't know anything." Several other witnesses next gave testimony tending to disprove the plea of insanity. This displeased Guitean, who accused some of the witnesses of bias, and claimed that the testi mony of others was irrelevant. President Ar thur's reply to the written questions sent him by Mr. Scoville waa read. The President said be had seen Guitean at least ten and perhaps twenty times, but had no conversation with him eioept to return the ordinary salutations, and once or twioe in answer to his request to be employed as a speaker by the Republican State committee, of which he was chairman. Guiteau had never rendered any political service that the President knew of to the Republican party in the last campaign. There was nothing in the prisoner's relation to himself or to General Grant or Senator Conk ling or any other leader of the Republican party, socially or politically, to give him any grouud for supposing he would receive polit ical preferment, and he had never given Gui teau any reason to think he could have any po litical or personal influence with him. The President added thai in October last lie re-1 eeived a letter from Guitean, containing tome claim to having rendered important set vices to the Republican Trty, and an appeal for the postponement of his trial. Ho did not preserve the letter. The Rev. Dr. Mc Arthur, of New xorK city, or whose church Guiteau and his wife wore members several yoars ago, de scribed his acquaintance with the assai sin and the circumstances under which Guitoau was ex pelled from the church. The prisoner alter nately contradicted this witness outright and addressed him with an air of familiarity. On the twenty-second day the proceedings began with the continuation of the examina tion ol the Rov. Dr. MmArtliur, of Now York, who testified that he had seen no indications of unsoundness in Guitean. The prisoner, as usual, constantly interrupted and used aousive language, at one moment snowing anger at tho witness, at another making an on slaught on a local reporter, and then again at tacking District-Attorney Corkhitl, saying : "If your record was dug up, colonel, it would stink woree than mine. 1 understand you are booked for removal. Yon had better go slow. The President is only waiting to get this thing off his mind before you get your ticket-of-leave. I want the absolute truth about this." Stephen English, of New Y'ork, editor and proprietor of tho Insurance Tune, next detailed all the cir cumstances connected with the prisoner, procuring bail for him while ho was in Ludlow Street jail on a charge ol libel. Ho was interrupted at cvory stop of his narrative by the prisoner ejaculating! "That is not true;" "Confine yoursolf to the facts, English ; " "He got me arrested by actual perjury; " "That is abso lutely false. I can convict yon that you are lying. There is not an insuranco presidont in New Y'ork who does not know that you are a first-class fraud ;" "That is the biggest lie you have spoken. Why, I would not spit on you in the street, yon old scoundrel:" "The insur ance presidents of Now Y'ork would not believe yon under oath, you old fraud." In reply to the question whether he had any doubt as to the sanity of the prisoner, the witness said : " Novor. On the contrary, he appeared to be a man of remarkable keenness ol intellect, be causo ho completely outwitted me. He waa shrewd, active, Intelligent lawyer." Several New Y'ork lawyers woro then examined, and testified eithor as to the. prisoner's sanity or rascality, Guiteau con tinually interrupting in bis usual abusivo stylo. Judge Hawes, of the New York marine court, in whoso oftico the prisoner occupied a desk in 1871, testified that they had never seen any indication of unsoundness of mind in Guitoau. Senator Benjamin Harriion. of In diana, testified that tho prisoner asked him in Washington last spring to help him get office, but tho witness told him he was already overloauou witti applications irom ins own State. Ho had never questioned Gui teau's sanity. Guitean patronizingly said of Senator Hnnison: "iouare a good lellow, Senator. I remember yon very woll. Our con versations were generally social." Tho wxt witness was Isaac F. IJoyd, of New Y'ork, sec retary of the Mutual Life Insurance company. Ho presonted applications for insuranco -four from John W. Guiteau. two from the pris oner, and one from the prisoner's father. The point mado was that those applications con tained negative answers to the question whetbor there was insanity in the family. Upon objec tion by prisoner's counsel the court excluded the applications of the prisoner's father and brother. But the great sensation of tho day was created when D. McLean Shaw, a Now York lawyor in whose office Guiteau had a desk ten years ago, testified that tho prisoner told him iu 1872 that ho (Guitean) was bound to be notorious before ho diod ; that if ho could not get notoriety for good, he would got it lor evil ; mat no wouiu shoot some Of our big men, and would imitato Wilkes Booth. As the story was told, and tho spectators felt how completely it ntteu tiiepop. ular conception of the assassin's character, i profound sensation was visible. The assassin was beside himself with excitement. "You lie," ho shouted, shaking his hand at tho wit ness. "You're a mean, low, dirty liar. I never had any such conversation, you low. dirtv. low-lived whelp. My wii'o and you' know something of each other. Sue told mo vou camo up to visit her. he said, with a grin of pure malice; " I'll show you up." The assassin went on to pour out a torrent of abuse on tliowitnesn, which lasted almost without a break through both tho direct and croBB-cxamination. Mr. Scoville did his best to break tho effect of thn evidence by showing that Mr. Shaw had not allowed the ex pression of euch eentiments to alter his rela- tions with Gniteau, but tho witness explained that he had not really supposed the niun would tlo what lie said. A C In isttnns Farm Scone lu Montenegro. Arthur J. Evans in his account of Chmtrr.as in the Black mountains w'tos : The ceremoay in the church over the congregation wem'.ed their way to their respective hemes, there to find the Christmas roast meat done to a turn, Before, however, sitting down to the festal meal, some further rites had to be performed. First, the Domachitza, tak ing with her a dish containing corn, a cup of wine and a pomegranate, begged me to accompany her to the cattle stall, She then entered the stall set apart for the goats, ana Having nrst sprinkled them with coin, took the wine cup in her hand and said : " Good-morning. little mother I The peace of God be on tliee I Christ s born ; of a truth He is born. Mavst thou be healthy. I drink to thee in wine ; I give thee a pome granate ; majstthou meet with all good luck 1 " She thon lifted the cup to her lips, too a sip, tossed the pomegranate over the herd, and throwing her arms around the she-goat, uttered a blessing. At the end of the service the beauti ful old Slav rite, called the " Peace of God," was performed by the whole con gregation. Every one approached his neighbor and kissed him or her on both cheeks, saying, " Hristos se rodi " (Christ is born)!" To this the other replied: va istinu se rodi (Of a troth He is born)!" and returned the kisses, and this was repeated till each had kissed and been kissed by all present. In Northwest Bosnia, and I believe other districts, it is usual for the house ather, there generally known as Mary eshina, or elder, to take a bit of cheese, and of the Christmas roast meat to be consecrated by tho pope at the end c f the service, and the consecrated morsels are eaten on the way back. Tet for Wuter. A simple test is to cork up a 6mall bottle nearly full of it, in which a piece of lump sugar has been put. If by thus excluding the air and letting it stand in the light for two or three days there is not a milky cloud seen, but the water remains clear, it may be consid ered free from the phosphates with which sewage water is impregnated. To ascertain if water contains iron, take a glass ol water aud add to it a few drops of the infusion of nntgalls, or suspend a nutgall in it by means of a thread for twenty-four hours. If iron be present, the water will become of a dark-brown or black color. Prussiate of potash is a still more delicate test for detecting iron. If a crystal, or a drop of it, when dissolved, be added to a glass of water containing iron, it will immediately become of a blue color. To ascertain if water contains magne sia, take a quantity of the water, and boil down to a twentieth part of its bulk; then drop a few grains of car bonate of ammonia into a small glass of water. Mo magnesia will yet be pre cipitated; but on adding a small quan tity of phosphate of soda, if any magne sia ba present it will then make its ap pearance and fall to the bottom of the glass, in this experiment it is neces sary that the carbonate of ammonia be in a neutral state.
