flelff Ulm Review ERNST WICHERSKI, IF. W. JOHNSON, PROPRIETOR EDITOR Wednesday, December 7, 1898. Official paper of the county of Brown. The sword which eongres3 intends to jgive Admiral Dewey will cost $10,000. Congressman McClear.y is almost cer tain to be made chairman of the com mittee on banking and currency. Josh Billings' remark ttkat "heoe is a hen that Lays more eggs than she can .hatch out" will com* home to a whole lot of office-seekers after the rirst week in January. To the wives of those who are dis franchised It you can't think of any thing else to buy your husbands for Chnstmas present them with certificates of citizenship. Snobs in high places assume great airs and are pretentious in all they do, andties, the higher the elevation the more con spicuous is the incongruity of their po sition.—Samuel Smiles. A Mormon polygamist lias been elect ed to congress from Utah. If he holds his place as long as Breckeiiridge did he will do well. Old Breck had the advan ige, however, of not having declared his exact position. Some young men can stand at the front gate a long time without their feet getting cold.—Madelia Messenger. But they wouldn't stand at an elec tion booth on a cold day five minutes to help a friend into office. The republican members of the legis lature from the Second district held a meeting at Mankato last week and en dorsed Gilbert Gutterson of Lake Crys tal for speaker. Thus far Mankato con feiences haven't been followed by desired results. It takes moie courage to speak to your neighbor about Christ than to go to Africa as a missionary.— Madelia Messenger. Of course it does. Nine times out of ten your neighbor knows you don't practice what you preach. Prof. Carlson, of St. Peter, is men tioned for congress two years hence. Carlson for congress and McCleary for gov«rnor, they say.—Lamberton Star. Then give us Lind to do up Mac, andcustoms Johnson of St. Peter to finish the man with the, stentorian voice and Webster ian brow. Whenever the referendum comes into use, the people will learn something about their government. The questions of the day will be discussed from a dif ferent standpoint from what they are now. The elections ot individuals to office will have nothing to do with it.— Populist Banner. The democrat who seeks the nomina tion foi president, to run against Presi dent McKinley, will be an air-chaser tne first magnitude.—Madelia Messen ger. If the Beview's memory is good, the Messenger gave voice to a similar pre diction when John Lin-1 was nominated for governor to run against Eustis. The St. Paul Globe twe years ago got up a big sensation over( the alleged mismanegement of the state prison. The question naturally arises, will it re new the attack now that it has the gov ernor with it?—Lamberton Star. No, it won't be necessary, The new governor will in all probability tackle the question of his own accord. Admiral Dew«y writes that iie is too busy to furnish a magazine article for $5,000. We had always labored under tiie impression that Dewey had been hav ing a picnic at Manila all this time and* that his work with the Spaniards had been undertaken for no other purpose than recreation-r-just to break the mon otony and incidentally to show them what he could do. Mrs. Eddy, a noted disciple of Chris tian Science, claims that a boil is not painful. She contends that the boil sim ply manifests belief in pain through in fUmation and swelling and this belief is called a boil. Mrs. Eddy may possibly be right, but we would prefer to have the theory demonstrated 6n someone else than ourself. We positively draw the line at experimenting with boils. A New Ulm dispatch states that Lind has offered to L, A. Rosing the position of piivate secretary, and to P. M. Ring dahl a place on the railioad and ware house commission. These are two most excellent appointments, which will meet with general approval throughout the state. If Mr. Lind now appoints Gen. Pope of Mankato as public examiner, as it is said he contemplates doing, be will have made a start in the re-organization of the state government which will be a credit to him.—St. James Journal. mm^^MsmmmhA^ THE 

OPEN DOOR. Senator Chandler Thinks the Adminis tration Policy is Misunderstood. "The're seems to be a general misun derstanding of the proposed open-door policy of the administration as regards the government of the Philippine is lands," says Senator Chandler. "The phrase in its present application is some what misleading. I have heard it con tended that if we inaugurate this policy, foreign nations who are in closer prox imity to the Philippines will have a great advantage over the United States in the matter of trade. As a matter of fact, it is not &t all certain that this pol icy will eontinue for any length of time. The president, it must be remembered, has no authority to prescribe permanent tariff laws of the Philippines. This is a congressional privilege, and must be dealt with exclusively by congress when the islands have reached their normal pesce conditions. "The president, in execution of his du has the right only to demand that Spain must evacuate the islands, and that they mvist be turned over to the United States. He communicates with the Spanish government and tells the Spanish people to get out of the Philip pints. Then he establishes a military government for the islands until such time as congress may act. Further than to declare to Spain that she must leave the islands, and that we will pay her $20,000,000, he has no authority. It then rests with congress as to what the commercial conditions shall be. After Spain has left the islands, the military branch of the government takes charge of them. Then comes the open-door policy. Tariff lates are prescribed by the military government. These rates ap ply not only to European nations, but to the United States as well. No nation on earth has an advantage. The object JS solely to raise the $20,000,000 which we are to pay to Spain. That money must come from the revenue derived from England, Prance, Germany, America, and, in fact, every other nation. It can be seen, therefore, that foreign nations, on account of their convenient situation, will have no material advantage over the United States. We want to raise $20,000,000 to pay to Spain, and instead of bting to our disadvantage, it will be to our benefit if foreign nations can in crease their trade iu the Philippines for the time being, thus increasing the receipts. The open-door policy, therefore, will prevail only so long as is necessary to raise $20,000,000 *vhich it is agreed to pay Spain. "After this money is raised, then it will be time tor congress to act. We will enact such legislation as is deemed proper. If it is decided to annex the is lands, then customs duties will be pre scribed which will not give any foreign nuion an advantage over the United States. We will have free and unre stricted intercourse with the islands, while foreign nations will be obliged to pay a duty. Hence it can be seen that the open-door policy is only a tempor ary measure, and,instead*of being to onr disadvantage, will redound to our bene fit. If congress decides to grant the Philippines their independence, then they will probably be obliged to pay us $20,000,000, which we are to give to Spain. I find that the main opposition to the annexation of the Philippines comes from people who have always beeen opposed to the independence of Cuba. They are disappointed in the fact that Cuba has been freed, and, in line with their views ou this qutstion, they are opposed to the acquisition of the Philippines. The cry of imperial ism is misplaced, and is not only mis understood, but entirely unwarranted." Pleasure is like a hornet—generally ends with a sting,—Josh Billings. Josh must have written this after some good friend had bet elected to office. Narrow waists and uarrow minds are often found on the same body.—Madel ia Messenger. Not only often, but nearly always. One is the direct result of the other. John A. Johnson will add both decen cy and ability to the democratic side of the state senate.—Midway. News, Aud we trust that some of your re publican senators may find time to pat tern after his g*od example. President McKinley's annual message will contain sixty thbusand words. Sure ly, he will have something to say. The only man we know of, who can squander that amount ef language without saying anything, is Dar Reese of St. Paul. Editor Starr of Lamberton remarks that he has been solicited to use his in influence in behalf of certain aspirants for legislative positions and adds that the country editor has but precious lit tle influence after election. Brother Starr hits the truth occasionally aud he certainly did on this occasion. QuicKtoAct Diamond. Christmas is coming: and we are continually
