Jaabary, Thindaf, Oec. , tt9Q It may be a merely accidental coin cidence and it may be with well-considered intention that just about the time the Legislature adjourns and its members are to be let loose upon the state the Northfield News makes t his plea : There is one institution we need in Ver mont, and must have, and that is a school for idiots. Now we must send to Massachusetts or elsewhere to have our idiots taken care of, and the consequence is that in order to make a jjood apjear anee we do not send away nearly so many of these unfortunates as we should educate if we had a school of our own. The Iiellows Falls Times has been sold again, the third time within the year. K. C. Allis, who has owned it for the past eight months has sold thepaier to A. W. Emerson, who will be its editor and manager, and D. H. I'lumer, a hotel man of Lake wood, X. J., who is a silent partner. This change is for the letter. Mr. Emerson was assistant editor of the Times while it was edited by Edwin A. Start, now of the Caledonian. He is a young man of energy and ability, a clever writer, with excel lent ideas of what goes to the mak ing of a good newspaper. He is popular in Bellows Falls and will succeed there as the head of a paper which enjoys one of the lest fields in the state. The departure of Gen. E. Burd Grubb of New Jersey to his new post as minister to Spain is important in view of our present relations with that country. All the great com mercial bodies of Cuba are demand ing a reciprocity arrangement with this country. The commercial situa tion in Cuba at present is of so seri ous a nature that some relief of the sort is necessary and the Spanish government, hitherto deaf to any suggestions of this kind, -has been compelled to give attention to these demands of its Cuban subjects and to consider the acceptance of a reci procity treaty for its West Indian colony. On the other hand it is understood that Gen. Grubb goes to Spain with full instructions from the state department so to act as to bring about if possible the arrange ment of some such treaty. Every thingseemsfavorableto a reciprocity arrangement which would be espe ciallv desirable to all concerned in this case. The annual report of the na'3r de partment begins to be more interest ing and to savor less of ghastly skeletons and mouldy hulks than it has for some time past. The present report states that since March 4, 1889, nine new modern vessels have been completed and put in commis sion, while during the winter four more will be added to the list. Five others are more or less advanced in construction. The secretary an nounces that we have now attained a speed standard of our own, a standard unsurpassed in any navy of the world. The secretary speaks of thegreat superiority of nickel stee armor, as shown by recent tests, and of the success attained in making rapid firing guns of large calibres The plea for a naval militia is re newed, as is the recommendation that the revenue marine service be consolidated with the navy depart ment, where it properly belongs The report gives gratifying evidence of progress. Late advices from the seat of the Indian troubles show that there has been some criminal lying bv reckless correspondents at Pine Ridge agency and that if there is now any danger of bloodshed it is the result of the extraordinary measures which have been taken to overawe the savages measures which would not have been deemed necessary' had the Pine Ridge agent understood the Indian char acter as he should to be fit for his position. So far as the religious propaganda among the tribes is concerned there is no evidence that it has in it the seeds of trouble. It is a close imitation, from the savage standpoint, of Christianity as the Indians have learned it from their missionaries. The real trouble with the Sioux is that the paternal gov ernment which pretends to care for them has not hall fed them and hun ger has bred discontent. Let them be put to work and taught to main tain themselves, instead of to live in idleness on the nation's allowances and there will be little danger o trouble. The platform upon which the Farmers' Alliance is substantially unanimous embraces the following planks : 1. The abolition of national banks and the calling in of their notes. 'J. The issue of legal tender United States Treasury notes "in sufficient vol ume to do the business of the country on a cash system. 3. The free and unlimited coinage o silver. 4-. The prohibition of the alien owner ship of land, and the reclamation of all lands heretofore ceded to railways and not now actually used by them. 5. The prohibition of speculation in agricultural products, and of dealing in "futures. 6. The restriction of jrovemmen revenues to the actual exjenses of the government economically administered 7. Thegovernment control and opera tion of railways and telegraphs in the interests oi the jK-ople. 8. The prohibition of trusts or "com bines" among corporations, and of usuri ous interest. With this the Northwestern Alliance and the Farmers' Mutual Benefit association of Illinois are in har mony.' How far the Farmers League, which is the political organ ization of the farmers in the eastern and middle states, subscribes to some of these points of doctrine we do not know, but it has been stated that it too is in harmony with the Alliance. 

RETROSPECT. ! It is not an agreeable task to pass n retrospect the work of the late Legislature, which did its best ser vice to the state by adjourning. The Caledonian has frankly expressed tself upon the leading matters that have come up during the session and does not need to repeat itself now, as it has nothing to take back on any of these points; but a general survey of the results, as closely sum marized by our correspondent in an other column, may not be unprofit able. The only important progressive measure, of all that were before it. which the Legislature can be cred- ted with having enacted into a law was the ballot reform law. This, after standing in pickle all through the session, went through in its last hours. That it passed at all was owing to the promptness of a demo cratic member of the house, Mr. Marshall of Brattleboro, who got his bill in promptly at the opening of the session and kept it lefore the Legislature steadily. Against this one piece of positive legislation put this array of meas ures killed : Separate agricultural college bill; bills for insurance and immigration bureaus; to regulate fares on railroads; to prevent the organization of bogus medical col leges; providing for weekly payment and fortnightly payment of wages; to prevent double taxation; grant ing municipal suffrage to women taxpayers. In school legislation the law was tinkered again in a way that gives no assurance of satisfactory results but rather appears like a retrogres sion for which sufficient reason can hardly be given. The corporation tax law, one of the most important measures, will have to be tested before judgment can le passed on it. It was given little consideration by the members as compared with its importance. Two acts of the session should be tamped as highly discreditable, the election of two of the members to vacant judgeships and the shameful penuriousness of the appropriation for the world's fair. Against the gentleman chosen to the bench we have no word to say, but this docs not excuse the reprehensible custom of making the highest judicial posi tions in the state a matter for politi cal trade and dicker. We hope the time is not far distant when such a practice will be given up. The Legislature of 1890 was not one of the kind that begins such high- minded reforms. The appropriation of five thou sand dollars for the world's fair will, as one disgusted member expressed it, just about provide for an exhibit of one of Commissioner Valentine's abandoned farm maps, and perhaps no more appropriate exhibit could be found for a state so niggardly in the matter of advertising itself. A summary of the legislation of 1890 might be added to the exhibit. It would help explain the abandoned farms. No, this retrospect is not a pleas ant one for the people of Vermont to take. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The president's message is a good document. We may or may not agree with all the president says, yet no one but the blindest partisan can deny that he covers concisely and fully the various interests touched by the general government The message seems in some sense to bean attempt to assume a leader ship in his party which the presi dent does not and probably cannot possess. It is a courageous docu ment, maintaining firmly as it does the republican position on the tariff and the federal elections bill, in the face of the recent party defeat. Especially noticeable in the docu ment is President Harrison's urgent appeal to Congress to go to work at once on important legislation and push it. The first part of the message, deal ing with foreign affairs, is especially satisfactory, indicating the existence of a definite and dignified American policy in the state department. The statement of finances is fairly satisfactory, showing that without any extravagant increase in expendi tures the surplus, that bugbear of re cent years, is reaching a vanishing point. There will doubtless be found those, however, who have complained because there was a sur plus and have denounced it as a source of danger to the republic who will now denounce the party in power with equal vigor for extra va gance in getting rid of it. Of such stufl" is partisanship made. The presentation of the case for steamship mail subsidies is one of the most forcible arguments in the mes sage, which is really worth reading, for the general idea it gives in brief compass, comparatively, of the af fairs of government, and the leading questions now up for consideration. A 

LOST-LEADER. We know of nothing in recent po litical "history comparable to the sudden fall of Charles Stuart Pamell from the dizzy height to which he had climbed by reason of his remark able abilities. Here is a man whose achievements as the leader of his people in a great political struggle have fixed the attention and com manded the admiration of the wes tern world ; whose firmness, moder ation and dignity have commanded the highest respect; and who has been the honored associate and co laborer of one of England's greatest statesmen and best men. There he stands with the eyes of millions upon him. Suddenly, as by some Jekyll and Hyde transformation, this hero stands revealed as the destroyer of a home, the betrayer of a friend the committer of a crime darker than blackness. It matters not what the decision of his followers may be. Pamell has fallen, fie is "a lost leader" indeed. The people who have trusted him can trust him no longer, since the breach of trust of which he stands confessed is the grossest of which man is capable. It may be that personal purity and high moral living are not to be insisted on in the men we exalt to high places, but when they are no longer considered requisite for high honors and leadership, may God help the people that scorns them. Senator Hoar's manifesto to the republicans of Massachusetts is a weak document, unworthy of the able statesman who wrote it. Its appeal to precedent and its failure to recognize anything as involved in the recent elections are unfortunate for his party. It is for such men as Senator Hoar, men of principle and patriotism, to snatch from petty politicians the direction of the repub lican party and redeem its great reputation, making it equal to the demands of the hour by recognizing its shortcomings and striving firmly to correct them. An apologetic tone is best neither for the party nor for the nation. There has been a deep significance, not apparent perhaps to the casual observer, in the interchange of cour tesies during the past week between the visiting Brazilian embassy and naval officers and the officials of this country. These courtesies have been marked on both sides and far beyond the strict requirements of interna tional etiquette. They are the evi dences of the peculiarly cordial feel ing that has arisen between the two countries as a result of the prompt recognition of the Brazilian republic by the United States and the sending of the White Squadron to Rio Janeiro, at a time when its moral support was worth much to the new govern ment. These things augur well for the promotion of reciprocity and of closer connections between two coun tries which can be of great use to each other. Postmaster General Wanamaker in his annual report earnestly urges the establishment of a postal tele graph and combats the objections to it by instancing the success and economy of government mail service Regarding the assertion that it would be corruptly managed by the party in power, the postmaster-gen eral says that "stringent law and penalties hedge around the postal system, jealous eyes watch it and it is ever open to public observation and inquiry." Probably Mr. Wana maker knows something about this. "The telegraph business," he con tinues, "in the hands of private in dividuals, is not so hedged about and is much more likely to be used for corrupt purposes." There is something in this. An official liar is under more restraint than an unoffi cial liar. It appears by the report that 14,072 postmasters were re moved during the past two years and 26,680 appointed in the same time. The report criticises the ten dency to appropriate money for cost ly buildings merely for the sake of display. The deficiency of the de part men t for the year was $5,786, 300, a small net gain over the previ ous year.

A TEMPORARY TRIUMPH. Long Memories. "Politicians and demagogues," said Senator Smith of Windsor, "are the only ones clamoring for the passage of the agricultural bill." Politicians and dema roirues we thank you for the classifica 'tion. The people will not forget what they remeniljer. Alontpeiier uauy jour nal. The End Not Vet. Let not the managers of the University lay the nattering unction to their souls that the successful namuoozienient or a few faint-hearted senators ensures to them the permanent and peaceful enjo- ment of the Ixjodle involved. 1 he larm crs, who make up the mass of the voters. were simply disgusted before with the bad taith of the University. Now thev are mad. They have seen the funds in tended by Congress for their ljenefit de voted to the purpose of maintaining at the capital a lot of lobbyists, if not to baser uses; they have seen, partially as vet, perhaps, the depth of the humbu which iKjses as an agricultural college but enough to open their eyes. It will lie known, in advance, two years hence whether a candidate for representative or senator proi6ses to support the inter ests of his constituents or to be made the tool of a ring of back-number statesmen alleged educators and leeches who prey uj)on the body politic. The troubles of the University have just begun. tMia dlebury Register. LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. What Was Done and Not Done and How Jt Was Done. Special Correspondence of the Caledonian. Montpelier, Dec. 3. The Legislature of 1890 having accomplished its labors, a birds-eye view can now be taken of the whole field to see to what extent the expec tations of the people have been real ized and to compare the work done with that of previous legislatures. It must be admitted that the record has been disappointing in many re spects. The keynote of the state campaign was reform and retrench ment in the matter of expenditures. It cannot be denied that this was borne in mind, as was attested in debates nearly every day. Yet econ omy manifested itself too often in cutting off expenses in wrong direc tions and in continuing expenses which might as well have been cur tailed, if not abandoned altogether. If members came with a firm deter mination to work hard and conscien tiously during the session, that good resolve was soon lost sight of. No improvement was -shown over pre vious legislatures in this respect. Till the very last of the session only three days in the week were utilized to their fullest extent. Friday after noon sessions presented a thin atten dance, there were no sessions Satur day and Monday afternoons gave sparse audiences and little of impor tance was transacted then, lrw-4-ue- anxiety to escape the censure which the Legislature of two years ago in curred, the opposite extreme was reached and the Legislature which has just adjourned will go on record as doing nothing of importance. One of the most boyish freaks devel oped toward the close of the session was the slamming of desks when an uninteresting speaker had the floor. After the speaker had restored par tial order by rapping vigorously with the gavel, members were taken usually with a violent fit of cough ing. Although this practice was to be condemned, it caused several dull speakers to abbreviate their remarks much to the comfort of the listeners. The unpleasant feeling which cropped out toward the close of the session between the two branches of the Legislature is sincerely to be re gretted. Each body thought the other was killing rather too summa rily its own pet schemes. The House declared it would oppose anything coming from the Senate and the lat ter body reciprocated. It served as a hindrance to bad legislation get ting through but at the same time prevented some meritorious meas- uies from being enacted. There were introduced in all 576 bills, 233 of which have become laws. By far the greater part of these are acts of incorporation and bills of a private nature. The appro priations call for something like $8S, 000, about half the amount raised two years ago. The state tax for 1891 will be 18 cents. This is a slight reduction from what it has been heretofore The Senate was much more liberal in its views than the other branch of the Legislature. Members of the House could not divest themselves of the oath they had sworn to their constituents to keep expenses at the lowest possible point. The non-con tinuance of the bureau of immigra tion and industrial interests is an instance in question. The Senate was quite ready to continue this work but the House refused point blank. The niggardly policy of the House was shown in its refusal to make a suitable appropriation for the world's fair. A great mistake was made by the committee in asking for $30,000 at first. When the process of cutting down began it was easy to keep on until the lowest point was reached. If $10,000 had been asked for at first it could have been obtained in all probability. It has been suggested that the Vermont Legislature be taken to Chicago and put on exhibition as a natural curi osity. What can be done with the $5000 appropriated is not yet deci ded upon. The bill was got through at the urgent request of Gov. Page who explained that if Vermont took no part in the celebration it would be a serious disadvantage in getting appropriations from the federal gov ernment for our harbors. It is hoped the next Legislature will be more liberal in the matter of appropria tions. The corporation tax law is one of the most important measures en acted. When the bill was first intro duced several corporations entered formal complaints against the rate at which thev were to be taxed. The rates were revised and made accejv table to the interested parties. The reduction in the number of supreme court judges was a reform universally demanded all over the state. The House did its duty in this matter but the wisdom of the Senate again intervened to circumvent the public expectation, l ne action on the weekly and fortnightly payment bills shows that the state is not yet ready to place arbitrary restrictions on the business relations between the employer and the employee. The valued-policy bill was a metsure much agitated but the bill was never reported from the committee. This was done out of senatorial courtesy to the author, Senator Dow. It was seen at once that the bill could never pass the Legislature owing to the great amount of opposition devel oped in the weight of evidence pro duced. The question of double taxation is one of the most difficult and intricate to deal with. Senator Nichols intro duced by far the best bill bearing on the subject. This passed the Senate safely but the House believed it a piece" of legislation of doubtful ex pediency, consequently the bill was consigned to the company of the great majority. The passage of the ballot reform bill was quite unexpected. Being introduced at a late hour in the ses sion there was insufficient time to give it the consideration its impor tance deserved. However, the com mittee labored zealously to urge its merits on the minds of the mem bers a majority of whom received it favorably. While there is not such a crying need in Vermont for this re form as in other places where corrup tion in voting exists yet it is hoped that by it many of the flaws in our present voting system may be rem edied. The greatest fight of the session was over the agricultural college and the final outcome is a serious disap pointment to the state at large. Several senators voting against the bill will have a chance to explain matters to their constituents. In this as in other matters they seemed to labor under the delusion that they were representing themselves rather than those who sent them. At any rate the institution at Burlington has been given a tremendous shak ing up and the authorities promise to make some showing during the coming two years in comparison with what has been achieved for the past twenty years. It is reasonably sure, if this is not done, that the larger portion of both branches in the coming Legislature will be pleged for separating the college in spite of the 'isacred compact. The school question took an unex pected turn at the last moment. It was supposed that the bill drawn up by the committee would satisfy every one. After listening patiently to the complaints and views ol mem bers a bill was prepared removing the objectionable feature ot county supervision and providing for the town system. No sooner was this bill before the House than it met with a storm of opposition from those who recommended the changes adopted. The demands of the clam oring mob were complied with and the hated town system was dispensed with. Great surprise was manifested that this bill should pass the Senate as it finally did about three hours before adjournment by a majority of one. The enactment of this law is to be deplored. While some features of county supervision may be advan tageously corrected, the main prin ciple is right and the results achieved have been all that could nave oeen expected for the short time the law has been in operation. 11 the law had remained in force two years longer it is reasonably certain that no change would have been effected two years hence. The office of county examiner is instituted. When this official is allowed to give three per mits to one applicant the stringency of examinations which the past law brought about is weakened so the standard of teachers' qualifications must be lowered. His other duties are to assist at teachers' institutes. It is doubtful if persons can be found in all the counties to till the offices. No one can afford to devote his time exclusively to this work for the sal ary paid. The action of the Senate in reject ing the constitutional amendments proposed is open to censure. Nearly- all possessed more or less merit and this Legislature would have done well to allow them to go through and let the public pass judgment on their feasibility. It is safe to assume that none would be adopted which were not demanded by the people. Now none can be introduced again till ten years have elapsed. In the promotion of Judge Thomp son to the supreme bench the Legis lature loses its ablest debater and wisest counsellor. His leadership in the last House is unquestioned and his familiarity with every detail of lawmaking rendered his services in valuable. The democrats have given a good account of themselves. The side they took upon the leading issues was well maintained. Messrs. Mo loney of Rutland and Bullard of Underbill were brilliant speakers and quick to catch any point which could be used to their advantage Senators Roberts, Nichols and Har vey showed the most ability and did the greatest amount of work for the other branch. The real effect of the work done cannot now be given. The results of the operation of the laws put into effect, and the platform ot the next campaign in regard to the issues of this year not settled, will give evi dence of the people's verdict on the legislation ot 1890.
