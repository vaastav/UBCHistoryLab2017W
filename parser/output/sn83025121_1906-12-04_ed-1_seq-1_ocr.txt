On the contrary, If they showed that thoy were alive, by offering hospitality to mercantile representatives, furnishing halls for their meet, lngs, etc, their action would attract ntlention to tho great commercial advantages of Honolulu. A consular congress would likely bo more easily brought aboJt than tho other. If they obtained favorable consideration for it In Washington, Root would call It. A commercial congress would glvo merchants having Interests In Pacific trade an opportunity of coming together and getting In touch with the interests of eommeree at all ports of tho Pacific. If taken up It must be done well, like everything else In Hawaii. Here tho Governor described tho Importunity of the managers of the Transmisslssippl Congress at Kansas City In their endeavors to havo Hawaii represented. He believed that at least onco every month for four "If the community wishes It we cer tainly ought," the Governor replied. "I think It is a matter in which tho taxpayers aro Interested.

Tho Goyernor said that Secretary Tait had found some fault with the government about Its declining to Bell tho market building to H. Hackfeld & Co.

CONGRESS HERE GAMBLERS LOSE CASE Tile criminal charges against A. P. Taylor and 11. O.

After many delays and postponements, the cases came up for trial yesterday afternoon, Judge Gear and. E. W. Sutton appearing us attorneys to assist tho prosecution und Frank Thompson uppearlng for the defense. Two of thf ehaigos ugaiiist lay lor weie taken up together, that of Impersonating a pol co oilUer und assaulting a Chinaman Willi a lo ided lovolvei.

The badge had been issued, and It had been the intention of the Shetlff to also tssuo a commission. That he had not done so had been an oversight. Ho had been undei tho that tho commission had been Issued until lie had looked up the records In connection with the present case. Tuvlor went on the stand on his own behalf, his testimony being corroborated by Mutheson These witnesses gave explicit denials of the eliargr"?. They admitted that they had visited the premises of the gambleis on tho night In question nnd had entered the gambling joint. Both denied thnt there mid been any force used, that any re volver had been produced or had been in their possession at the time or that tho police badge had been dlsplaved by either. Counsel for tho prosecution appeared to be rather nonplused when it was sliown that tho revolver" produced at the trial and which tho Chinamen had so nearly Identified, had been procured an hour or two before at E. O. Hall & Son's to assist tho Chinamen In perjuring themselves, an object which it accomplished most satisfactorily to the defense. The cases were submitted without argument on either side, Judge Whitney piomptly finding Taylor not guilty of cither charge. Judge Gear then wished to proceed with the cases against Taylor and .Mutheson, those of trespassing at night At tills point of the proceedings Prosecuting Attorney Andrade inter vened. ' I think this mntter has gono quite far onough," ho said, addressing tho bench. "As tho prosecuting attorney for the county I ask that a nolle prosequi be entered against these cases of Taj lor and Matheson und that their cases be stricken from the calendar." This request was promptly grunted by tho Judge, Tuylor wns given back his police badge by Judge Whitney, which had been turned In as an exhibit or the prosecution, and tho matter, so far ns the reporters are concerned, wus concluded.

"We admitted the Honolulu Portuguese to the planters' shed to sec the new arrivals nnd a gnut many departed for "Punchbowl nnd staved overnight. It is very much to tne credit of the Honolulu Portuguese that these people turned up so well today und took employment.

No restrictions were placed upon them there, and oven at tho Bishop wharf, where thoy boarded tho Island steamers, they were free to do as they wished. "All day Sunday about 25 men were qunrtcred on the steamer Heleno, which, after nil, did not go until yesterday They were contented on board and did not come ashore. They were well treated aboard and preferred to stay there to coming ashore, which speaks well for tho Inter-Island service.
