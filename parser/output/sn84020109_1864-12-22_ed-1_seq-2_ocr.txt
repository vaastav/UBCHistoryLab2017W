Nebraska Usycviiscr . JOHN 1 COr.IIAPP, EDITOR. -lit? nHOWNVILLE, THURSDAY iEC. 22, 1S54. Again do we appear before the ii'imer ous readers figuratively speaking of the Nebraska Advertiser. Having, in connection with Geo. W. Hill, bought out the entire establishment fcf W.H. Miller his good will thrown in occemore do we assume the honorable,- if ijot lucrative, position of editor. And, as is customery, it behoovos ts to brieflly itate the prin ciples upon which the paper thaii be run while in our control. First, then, we shall always bear in in;nd, and tling firmly to our motto : 'Liberty and Union one and insepara ble now and forever !" Second, we shall fuslain the Adminis tration cf Abraham Lincoln, in its every attempt to whip the rebels. Loyalty ha triumphed over northern dough-faced traitors in Abraham Lincoln's re-eleciicn and it will triumph over southern treason only in sustaining Lim. Ve are opposed to party strife until the strife against treason is ended, and do not think any man, or set cf men. trully loyal who will eiop to quarrel over petty party issues while our common enemy treason is ttill alive. Third, vre shall do all that lies in our power to further the best interest of our City, County ad Territory. Fourth, we shall keep our readers posted in the Iastest news of importance, either foreign or local. Fifth, and last, we shall do all in our power to make the Advertiser worthy of the support of every loyal citizen of Ne maha, or any other county. Being both of us practical printers, we will give you . as much reading matter as we can possi bly set up, We expect To "build up" the Advertiser, and to that end we .respect fully solicit the patronage and assistance of every Icyal citizen of this county. The prospect'of Missouri becoming a free State is very good, and must be gratifying to all who truly love freedom. But, aa there is a culminating point to all good, which, when once reached, makes ny step beyond rediculous and abortive of the main object, so, even this act of mcdrn progress may result in a serious injury to the white race in that State. These ideas were induced by a perusal of argument in favor of negro suffrage in Missouri. Radicalism has accomplish, ed much for Missouri, and the border States generally; a wide field is still left for its operation ; but if this stand is tsdeen, and they should succeed, we be lieve that its consequences would dim the glory of their first great achievement. But a few few years eince, in many sections of that State, it was almost as much as a man'slife was worth to even mention abolition, and, yet, now the ques tion ef negro suffrage is seriously dis cussed. Th:r3 is a vital question to the white race generally, as the benefit is all on one tide, and desirable only to the negro and a few (we hope) who are willing to barter their self-respect in order to increase the population of Missouri by making her a negro colony. Advocating the enfranchisemen of ne groes in Missouri, the Philadelphia Am erican and Gazette says ; 'If this change were made in the laws cf Missouri, there can hardly be a doubt that thousands of educated colored men of properly and standing would emigrate thither from States which, like Pennsyl vania and Illinois, refuse thera.the right of suffrage. Thousands' of colored peo ple would also go thither from Kentucky. Tennessee and Arkansas; and with an abundance of cheap labor, a vast amount ef land would be broughrdnder cultiva tion, railroads built and mines opened. The movement is therefor one of prime importance to the future of Missouri, end marks a new era in the history of the nest.-' Yes, with a very black "mark." The fellowing we find in the Nebras ka City Daily News, of the 19th : a "And so come our abolition friends and demand a change among the "loyal" lists of oxhce-holding patriots in Nebras ka. Among other schemes there is one to oust Mr. Paddock from the Secretary ship and put in some man who can be made more subservient than he can to the faction now rulirg among ihe faith ful." This canard was doubtless intended, by its auther, to create a profound sensation among "the faithful," perhaps it may, but in this section, we know it will be one of contempt for the snarling dispo fition of Ajax, Sec. Paddock's administration of our financial affairs, gentlemanly conduct, and ability displayed in every depart mant of his office, have stamped him as one "honest and capable." We know that such a move, as. that spoken of above, will meet with no favor in this county. Ajax : Don't you think Sec. Paddock will administer such an "oath" to the members of the next Legislature as will "ccmpell" thitn to remain f ix session in definitely ? The Bermuda Advocate, of Nov. Oih, announces the arrival of the pirate Chickam.iuga at St. George's Bermuda. It mentions with evident pleasure an attempt made by her crew to pull down the American Consul's flag, w-ich was only prevented by a colored man, the police'faking no notice of the outrage. .

Washington, Dec. IB. The following has been received at the War Department : f Nashville, 9, p. m., I5ih. We attack ed the enemy's left this morning and drove it from the river below the city, very nearly to Franklin pike, a distance of about eight- mils, and have captured Chalmer's headquarters, a train of about 20 W8gcns, between eight hundred and thousand prisoners, and sixteen piecss of artillery. Our troops behaved splendidly, all ta king a share in assaulting and charging the enemy's breastworks. I shall attack the enemy'again in the morning, if he staods to fight, if he re- Ltreats dunag the night I shall pursue. I have, been throwing a heavy cavalry force in his rear to destroy his trains if possible.- Signed, . THOMAS. Baltimore, 16. The American's Annapolis special says: The steamer Havana has just arrived with the news that Sherman had cap tured Savannah, with 1500 prisoner, af ter eight hours hard fightiig. Washington, 16. Richmond papers state that on the 9th Sherman captured Ft, McAllester, commanding the entrance to Ogeeche river, that the capture of this position puts Sherman in communication with the Yankee fleet and necssitates reinforce ments to Savannah. The following unofficial dispatch has been received at the War Department : Nashville, 16, 2 p. m. Hood has fal len back, apparently doing his best to get away, while Thomas is pressing him with great vigor ; frequently capturing giins and men. Everything so far perfectly successful. Signed, STANTON. Washington, 17. The following official report of the great victory achieved yesterday, by Thomas and his gallant army, over the rebel forces under Hood, in front of Nashville, was received this morning al the War Department; I have the honor to report the enemy has been pressed at all points to-riay on his line cf retreat to Bectwood Hill. Brig. Gen. Hatch of the Wisconsin corps of cavalry on the right turned the ene my's left, and captured a large number rf prisoners. Number not yet reported. Maj. Gen. Schofields corps, next on the left of the line, carried several hills and captured many prisoners and six pieces of artillery. Brevet Msj, Gen. Smith, next on the left of Schofield, carried the salient points of the enemy's line with MuNellis' brigade of McArthur's divi sion, capturing 16 pieces cf artillery, two Brig. Generals, aud about 10C0 pris oners. B'ig. Gen. Garrard's diviaion of Smith's command, next on ihe left of Mc Anhur.s division, carried the enemy's entrenchments, capturing all the artille ry aud troops of the enemy on the line. Brig. Geu. Wood's troops on Franklin pike, took up the assault, capturing the pnemv's entrenchments and two pieces of, artillery and something over 600 pris oners, aaJ drove tbe enemy wimin one mile ef Brentwood Hill. . , Maj. Gen. Steadinan, commanding de tachment of different military divisions, most nobly supported Gen. Wood's left, and bore a most honorable part in the operations cf the day . 1 have ordtred the pursuit to be con tinued ' in the morning at daylight, al though the troops are very much fatigue d The utmost enthusiasm prevails. I must not forget to report the epera tious of Brig. Gen. Johnson, in success fully driving the enemy, with the co-ope ration of gunboats under commodore Smith, from their established batteries on the Cumberland river, below the city of Nashville ; and of the success of Brig. Gen. Caxon's brigade in covering our right and rear in the operations of yes terday and to day. THOMAS. Since the above was in type we have have received news more definite: The total number of prisoners captur ed during the two days fight near Nash ville was 6,500, and on the morning' of the 19ihour forces in pursuiet captured 3 00C. During the battle 30 guns anl 7,000 small arms were captured. Hoed' army is reported entirely demoralized and at Duck river, crossing as fast as possible. His loss is at least 15.000 since he advanced from Columbia to Nashville. From Sherman the news is most en couraging. There is no doubt of his having opened communication viith Fo.s tef and the fleet. The city of Savannah is completely invested, and even Rich mend papers admit that its fall is inevita ble. Sherman started from Savannah with only 200 and retched Savnnnah ; so much was capturod on the way that it be came an embarrassment. Seven tfcoui sand able-bodied negroes came away with his army. Ilia whole loss, during the march from, Atlanta, from all causes, is only about 1000. Everything is progressing favorable before Petersburg. Graat got off his joke again in honor of Thomas's victory, by firing a salute of .100 shotted guns in to the rtbel lines. There is a large amount of counter feit postal currency in circulation at pres ent, especially twenty-five cent pieces. They are of the new issue, and the pa per and printing poor, tut when they be come worn, it is difficult' to distinguish them fr6m the genuine. One of the most dangerous counter feits we have yet seen, is a S20f green back shown us yesterday by J. L- O'NeiL Cashier of. the Western Bank. It is fur superjor.to tne old counterfeit, na is well calculated te deceive. The engraving is coarser than the genuina, and the- red star on the face beats a dull brick color1, while the genuine is a bright scarlet. Look well to your S20's. St. Joe. Her ald. Navigation of the Yellow Stune River. Captain Hutchison, commander of the Idaho fleet which left the Upper Mis souri last spring- with gold hunters by way of the Missouri and Yellow Stone, has returned to St. Paul. He has open ed up a new water highway towards the North-west Pacific slope which promises to be of great value in developing the re source or. thai almost unknown region. One of his fleet, the Chippewa Falls was the ' first . steamer whose paddia wheels ever stirred the waters of the Yellow Stone. Captain II. run up feme fifty miles the first trip, finding about four feet of water and the navigation of one of the largest rivers of the north west practicable. The river is described ftsalout tue size of the Mississippi above the falls of St. Anthony, and about as crooked. It is not so inuidy as the Mis souri, nor so full of snags, has some bars, but the most obstructions arise from, rocks, however, not dangerous. It is bordered with heavy timbered bottom lands, back of which are bluffs which seem quite barren. The Yellew Stone is thought to be navigable for small boats as far as the mouth of the Big Horn, where a town is growing up. The second trip up the Yellow Stone was made by two steamers of the'fleet to the old trading post, ninety miles from the Fort.- One of the fleet ran up the Missouri to Fort Benton several hundred miles above the mouth of the Yeilow Stone. The crew and engineers ran off te the gold mines, and the steam er was left tied up to the bank under the Fort. In the spring an effort will be made to bring her down. Omaha Rep According to the report of the Com missioner of Agticulture, the wheat crop this year is 18,703,213 bushels less than last year, rye 909,807 bushels less, barley 750,827 bushels less, corn 77, 613,454 bushels greater, buckwheat 2, 994, OSS bushels greater, potatoes 3, 903,782 bushels less, tobacco 69,799,691 pounds less, hay- 1,629,096 tons less, hogs nearly 2,000,000 less. There is a large decrease in oats and cattle, and in crease in sorghum and cotton. Another natural bridge has been dis covered in Virginia. It is situated in Up shur county, and spins a stream called Franch Creek, is fifty feet in length, six in breadth.and beautifully arched ia solid rock. Brig. Gen. Morgan L Smith has sue-? ceeded Maj Gen. Dana In command of the troops at aud around Vicksburg. Ihe President's Message. We give below that portion of the Message devoted to our own country and the war, in which we presume our read ers feefthe" greatest interest: '; The war continues. Since the last an nual message, ail the important lines and positions then occupied by our armies have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in the rear, so that Mis souri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States, have again produced reasonably fair crops. The most remarkable feature of ihe , military - operations of ihe year is Gen. Sherman's attempted march cf 300 miles dirtctly through" the insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the euemy and yet to de tach a well appointed army to move on such an expedition. ' The result not yet being known conjecture in regard to it js not here indulged. Important move ments have also occurred during the year to the effect of moulding society for durability in the Union, although' ehort of complete success it is much in the right direction that 12,000 citizen in each of the Slates of Arkausas and Louisiana have organized loyal State Governments with free constitutions and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer theuu yhe movement in the same di rection, more extensive, though les3 defi nite in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennes see should not be overlooked but Mary land' is secure to liberty Union for all the future. The. genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland like another foul spirit being driven out, it will seek to tear her, but it will woe her no more. ' At the last session of Congress a pro posed amendment of ihe Constitution, abolishing slavery throughout the United States, pnaatd the Senate, but failed for a lack of a two-third vote in the House. I venture to recommend tha passage of the measure at the present Congress. Of course the attract question is not changed, but au intervening election shows almost certainly that the next Con gress will pass the measure if this dees not. Henca there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amend ment will go to ihe States fcr their ac tion, and a-i it is to go at all even's, may we no agree that Hie sooner the better? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their vot s aiy fu ther than as an additional element to be con sidered. Their Judgement maybe af fected by it. ' It is the voice of tha People now for the first time heard upon the question. In a great National crisis like ours, una nimity of action among those staking a common end is very desirable almost in dispensable, and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some de ference fchall be paid to the will of. the majority, simply because it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end is the maintenance of ihe Union, and among the means to-secure that end, such will, through the election, is m jt clearly de clared in favor cf sich constitutional c-wlavact. ..Tho ut re liable indiea-. tion of public purpose in this country is derived through cur popular elections. Judging by th9 recent canvass and its result, the purpose ef -.he pecple within ihe loyal States to maintain the integrity of the Union was nevermore firm, nor more nearly unanimous than now. The extraordinary calmness aud good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls, gave strong assurance cf this. Not only those who support the Union ticket so called, but a great majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed lo be actuated by the 6ame pur. pose. It is an unanswerable argumen that no candidate for any office whatev er high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that was for giving up tne Union. The election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of the na tional resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves, and caused mourning to so many homes, it is some relief to know ihat, compared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps and divisions brig ades and regiments have formed and f aught and bled.Snd gone out of exis tence, a great majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is true of the Naval service. The election returns prove this. So many States regularly holding elections, both now aud four years ago, to-wit: Cali fornia, Cojineiicut. Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mary land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minne sota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Ore gon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ver mcntjlVes; -Virginia and Wisconsin cast 3.9S-2. UU votes now against 3,770.222 cast, then, showing an aggregate now of 3.39S.211, to which is to be added 33. 762 cast now in the new states of Kan sas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860; thus swelling the aggregate to 4,075,773, and the net .increase du ring the three years and a half of war to 145,951. To this, again, should be added the number of all soldiers in the fieid from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jer sey, Delavvare,Indiana, Illiuois and Cal ifornia, who, by the laws of those States, could not vo:e away from their homes, and which nimb-jr cannot be less than 90,000. Nor yetis this all. The num ber in organized Territories is tripple now what it was four years ago, while thousands white anl black join U3 as the national arms press back the insur gent lines.- So much is shown affirma tively and negatiyelly y the election. It is not material to squire how the increase has been produced, or to show that it would have been greater but for the war, which is. probacy true, the important fact remains Remonstrated that we hava more men nowhan we had when, the war began; that Ve are not exhausted nor in process of Vxhaustion; that we are gaining strengthjand may", if need, be, maintain the comes, jndefin itly. This is to a man. ' Natural resources ore now mie com plete and abundant than ever. The na tional resources, men, inexnausiaoie. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the national authority is un changed, and, as we bejieve, unchange able The manner of continuing the ef fort remains to chpose. On careful con sideration of al: the evidences accessible, it seems tome that no attempt at nego tiation with the insurgent leader could result any good: He would except or nothing short of the severance of the Union. His dec larations to this efleot are explicit and oft-rf peated. He does not attempt to deceive us. Jlo affords us no excuse to deceive - ourselves. We cannot volun tarily yield it. Between him and us the issus is distinct, simple and inflexible. II is an issue which an only be tried by war, and decided by victory. If we yield W8 are beaten; If the Southern people fail him, he is beaten: either way it would be the victory and defeat following war. War is true.how ever, of him who holds the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who follow. Although ha cannot reac cept the Union, they can. Some of them we know, already desire peace and re union. The 'number of such may in crease. They can at any moment have peace, simply by laying down their arms and submitting to ihe National authority un der the Constitution. After so much the Government could not, if it would, main taiti waragaiust them. The loyal peo pie, would not sustain or allow it. If questsons should remain we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legisla tion, cjnference, courts and votes. Operating only in constitutional and lawful channels, some certain and other possible questions are and would be be yond the Executive power to adjust; for instance; the admission of members into Congress, and whatever might require appropriation., of money. The Executive power itself would be deminished bv the cessation of actual war. ' Pardons and remissions of for feiture, however, would still , be under Executive control. In what spirit and temper this centre! would be exercised can by fairly judged of by the past. A year ago general terms were offered to all except -certain designated classes,and it vvaJ at the same time made known that the excepted class were still within con teinplation of special clemency. During the year many availed them selves of the general provision, and many more would, only the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary meas ures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time also, special pardons have eeen granted to individuals of excepted class es, and no voluatery application baa been denied. . Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all, except such as rwere not in condition to make free choise; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still open to all, but the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall de mand that it be closed, and that in lieu more vigorous, . measures than hereto fore shall be adoptedl In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance of the National au thority uu iLe pari of ihe insurgents condition to ending the war on the pari of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to Slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, and and that while I remain in my present position. 1 shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation Nor shall I return to Slavery any per son who is free by the terms of that Paclamation or by the Acs of Lon grt3. . If Mie people should, by whatever raoda or taeans, make it as executive du ly to re-emlave such person?, another, and net I, must be their instrument to perform it. In staling a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say, that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever .it shall have eeased on the part of those who began it.
