COAL MINE DISASTER OVER 500 LIVES DIS BY AN EXPLOSIO ROYED Terrible Calamity in Coal Mine at Monongahela, W. Va. —Two' Ex plosions in Different Mines at Same Time From Cause Unknown—Prop erty Loss Over a Million Dollars. Pittsburg.—A terrific and disastrpus explosion occurred Friday in mines Nos. 6 and 8, of the Consolidation Coal company at Monongah, W. Va. Mine Superintendent Malon says at least 500 men are entombed. It is believed a majority of the en tombed men were killed. Mine No. 6 is located on the east side of the Monongahela river and mine No. 8 on the west side. How the explosions- occurred simul taneously in both mines can not be explained. The explosion was heard for eight miles. After the receipt of the news physi cians and special cars were despatch ed from Fairmount to the scene. The mine was too full of gas and smoke for rescuers to enter. It is said the explosion started in No. 6 and spread to No. 8 mine, the two being connected. Another special says the first ex plosion was followed by the blowing up of a boiler in No. 8. Some idea of the force of the explo sion may be gained from the fact that props from the mine were not only blown out of the entry, but were hurled clear across the west fork of the Monongahela river. Wires are down. It is feared that the accident will turn out to be the worst in the his tory of mining in this country. Superintendent Malon telephoned that of the 500 men who were in the mine at the time he does flot think any could escape with their lives from the force of the explosion. The fans were started to clear out the foul air and the rescuers were expected to reach the men by 2 o'clock this aft ernoon. The management declares that it must have been dust. A hospital was arranged at the opening of the mine, where the wound ed will receive attention. Several men were practically blown out of mine No. 8 through the force of the gas explosion. Possibly the largest coal-producing mines in the state are located at Monongah. The mines are both shaft and slope mines, being worked by the rope and haulage systems. They lie on both sides of the West Fork and are connected by a steel pier bridge owned by the coal company. Until about 10 years ago only American miners were employed. At that time the miners of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio were on a strike. The coal company is one of the largest companies of the kind in the country and is capitalized at about I $20,000 000. They have upward of 100 ; producing properties. Clarence W. ! 8 the P. resident - with head-1 Baltimore.
