The aldermanic board put it at four thousand and the council manic board at three thousand dollars per annum. It is asserted by the politicians and vote calculators, that the mayoralty candidate who g"cures three thousand votes at the January election, will walk over the city race-track and take in the mayoralty purse. The following cases in bankruptcy were filed in the office of the United States district court clerk yesterday: C. B. Rogers, M'Nairy county; E. G. Ivev, Gibson county; Alexan der Sternberger, Llaywood county". At tha chancery court on yesterday Chan cellor Morgan ordered a decree for divorce to be entered in the case of Peabody Wilson r. Oliver Wilson, on the grounds of refusal to cohabit, abandonment, failure to support, etc If the Democrats and Conservatives of the city poll twenty-five hundred and thirty votes at a primary election for delegates, what will they poll when their convention puts forth a condidate? About four thousand votes, and "don't you forget it." Many weather prophets predict a mild winter, but many odcr weather prophets a severe one. Without regard to the prophets Denie Nature will fix the winter up to suit heroeif, and in the regular order of nature. The days of prophecy are past and gone. A newspaper jpan who knows how it works, says that many clergymen do not yet know where their winter overcoats are to come from, but they feel a sweet and solemn faith that they will get seventeen pairs of slippers each abont Christmas time, andtJiat none of them will fit. In the Shelby county circuit court, yes terday. Champ Carter, colored, filed a bill of divorce against Nancy Carter. The plaintiff alleges that he intermarried with the de fendant in January, 1872, and cohabited with her till March, 1876, when she left and abandoned him. Plaintiff further allegro that Nancy was quarrelsome and disagreeable while they lived together. People cannot b too careful about fires at this season of the year. Kemember what 1 r. Walcott says : Fire, permitted once lo rule. Conmimelh all it bandies. From the palaces of kings Down to a pound of candles." Winter and summer follow each other every few hours in Memphis at this season of the year, and coughs and colds are the con sequence. Whether to wear your ulster or your duster is a problematical question dis turbing the mind of many a health and com tort-seeking philosopher. In the case of F. l. Paradise r. Annie E, Paradiso, on hearing before Chancellor Mor gan, a decree for divorce was entered of re cord on yeste -day, on the grounds of adultery, ana that the custody ot their only cnua J- rancis A. 1'aradise. be decreed to complain ant, but defendant baa the right to visit said child at convenient and proper times. The case of the Missouri Valley life in surance company r. Brooks et al. is still on hearing before the Shelby county circuit court. The attorneys engaged in the case are at follows: For the plaintiff, J. A. Taylor and Wm. II. Carroll, and tor the defendants Colonel Henderson, of Knoxville, Tennessee Humes & Poston and Judge Wm. M. Smith The election for delegates on yesterday to the Democratic and Conservative mayoralty convention of to-morrow, which will open up at Cochran ball, progressed quietly and in good style. The voters seemed to be in the best of humor. The "simon-pure" Flippin men refrained from voting, but yet many Flippin delegates were elected in the wards by the Democracy of the city. Some nickel thief broke into and plun dered the car boxes of the street railroad company where the cars laid up on Sunday night, at the Hernando street depot, near Elmwood cemetery. Several nickels were captured by the thieves, and the tickets were carried off, the latter to be used over again by the thieves or their friends when they wish to take a free tride from Fort Pickering lo Chelsea and back. At the criminal court, yesterday, the case of the State rs. Tom Bolton was taken no for trial and seven jurors were obtained The case will be further heard this morning. The defendant, and Steve Caldwell. Terrell Gouldsby. Moses Bolton and West Harrison. were indicted on the charge of killing one Jack Stinson. near Kandolph, lennessee, on the third of December, 1875, by shooting him with pistols. I he case ot lorn Jtsolton iS now on trial, the other defendants having obtained a severance ot the joint indictment. The United States court adjourned on yesterday over to to-day, owing to the fact Judge Trigg was unable to attend. On to morrow an adjournment will be had to Mon day next, and should Judge Trigg be still unable to attend, an adjournment will be had indefinitely. Every day, while the United States court is in session, a United States flag will be Hung to the breeze over the upper story ot the courthouse. Marshal Waldron obtained the flag from the department at Washington, and it will be used as a signal- flag. The attorney, who is either down or up town, can see at a glance whether or not the United States court is in session by watch ing the signal-flag. . Yesterday forenoon a bridled horse coolly walked into the coffin establishment of Hoist & Bros., on Main street, and after winding his way amdhg the metallic and other cases, arrived at the door of the business office in the rear. On being invited in, he attempted to enter, but he reconsidered the idea. and. turning around, walked back out of the store. but not until be had examined, with eyes and nose, all the cases and comns on exhibition. The animal may have contemplated suicide. and desired to secure a receptacle for his re mains when the brief candle went out and nothing is left but what is not. The animal may have had in its body the soul and spirit o' some ancient hero or philosopher, which was seeking rest in a modern wav. The doctrine of Pythagoras, that the souls of men often pass into the bodies of the brute creation, is not a novel one in this world of ours, although the doctrine is not by any means orthodox. Sbakespeaie speaks of the doctrine or theory in several of his plays. Many men play the hog and the dog in this world of ours, and this goes far to comnel thinkers that their souls formerly inhabited the frames of the animals whose dispositions and peculiarities they exhibit so clearly in their dealings with their fellow-men. 

PERSONAL. Colonel Geo roe W. Polk and wife are in the city on a visit to their daughter. Mr. Pact, Nicholson, formerlv of the New York World, is in the city making ar rangements for the Frver-Wairner orjera company, which will appear at the Memphis Theater for four nights during Christmas week. Mr. Bernard Lowknstein. of the mon- ter establishment of Messrs. B. Lowenstein & Bros., is, we are pleased to notice, again a resident of our city, having returned yester day from New York and the east. Immense stocks of all that is new, choice and elegant, suited to holiday trade in the dry goods and tancy goods lines, will be the result ot his trip. Call at the ever popular corner of Jefferson and Main streets and inspect the novelties. We know that many a sigh followed the announcement, made yesterday, of the death of the senior Joseph Barbiere. Who that knew him in past years had failed to contract regard for him ? Lively and cheer ful with the proverbial gaiete du eoeur of his native France, he had that kindness and courtesy of manner that distinguished the Frenctrof the old school. Nothing could be more agreeable than a chat with the professor. as he was called, about incidents in his ear lier days. There was something about him of the simplicity of the "Uncle Toby" of Tristram Shanau, -which gave a fascination to his conversation when his bright eyes sparkled and a cordial smile lit up his expressive coun tenance. Dear old man! eunny days and briirht thouchtn revive in our minds as we re call y ou, as you were when at your pleasant residence at the corner of Vance and Main streets. Monsieur Barbiere was a native of Marseilles, on the Mediterranean coast of France, where he was born in 1810. As a musician he acquired considerable fame, and he came to this country in the troupe of the celebrated Madame Celeste, landing at Bos ton in 13-30. He was a good violinist, but a quarter of a ct ntury ago he excelled on the guitar, and had considerable power as a com poser of music He came to Memphis while the place was yet a small town, and was almost universally known as a skillful teacher of music. He removed to Paducah, Ken tucky, some years ago, and afterward to Col lierville, in this county, where he died on Wednesday last, i arewell to Professor Bar biere, and in the language of the Irish peas ant, "light be the sod that covers his grave!" The professor left several children, among whom his son, Major Joseph Barbiere, is known to most of our readers. AMUSEMENTS. Hilton ATobles in The Phoenix. At the Greenlaw Operahouse. last night. Milton Nobles, supported by a good dramatic combination, appeared for the second time in l he rhirm.r. i he drama contains a well- conceived and skillfully-developed plot, strongly-drawn types of American character, abundance of wit and humor, and innumer able thrilling situations. The sensation story of the "Chambermaid's Own." is mirth-provoking and a fair sample of the productions of the literary fiends of the day. The Phcr- mx will be presented at the matinee to-day and at the closing performance to-night. Mr. Bowers aa "The Woman la Bed." Last night The Woman in Red. a new plav. was presented at the Memphis Theater be fore a large and fashionable audience. The play was well put on the stage, and was fine ly presented. It is an adaptation trom a t rencb play entitled Lm J treatise des Cortes. and it is full of good situations and dialogues. As "Alanam and as " Kudiga. a dual role. Mrs. Bowers appeared to excellent advan tage, and received well-deserved tributes of applause from the audience. The scenes of the play were laid in France and Italy, the times being 1686 and 1687. a neriod of much commotion in the history of those countries. Mrs. Mowers was well supported by the stock company. 1 rot. Handwerker s orchestra played several nice selections from the best masters of music, and these selections were executed in good style. To-night The Wo man in Red will be repeated, but on to-morrow night a change of programme will be had, and the Hunchback, a standard drama, will be the attraction. LAW BEPOUTS.

At half-past three o'clock yesterday after noon, the Cotton News association met at the association rooms, on Madison street, for the purpose of attending to unfinished business. The following board of directors, consisting of five members, was elected: - Messrs. F. M. Townsend, Ed L. Topp, L. B. Suggs, J. J. Shoemaker, Ed R. Hart. The vice-president, Mr. Curtis, stated that Mr. W. Brown, as chairman of the commit tee from the cotton exchange, appeared be fore the Cotton News association, and desired to know what arrangement could be made to induce the members of the Cotton News as sociation to return to the cotton exchange. Mr. Brown appeared informally aa chair man of the meeting, and wanted to know if the Cotton News association 'woe' I receive a proposition looking toward ft t... etl of the troubles. The aaaoaaJjoa resolved t t ft J Brown, and that a propoeikic"- ceived and considered when it was presented officially and in writing. The question of adopting by-laws was con sidered, and it was resolved that a committee of three be uppointed by the vice-president to draft suitable by-laws, and report the same to an adjourned meeting. The vice-president reserved the selection o the committee to a future time. v On motion, the association adjourned sub ject to the call of the president. THE SILVEH BILL. f X Ioakt of it Panaajge by the Kewaxr. nad a Majority Alaaoat Assarcd Mafnrleat to Paaa it Over a Veto. The Chicago Tribune, of Saturday, com piles the following facte and figures showing that the passage of the silver bill, even over the President's veto, if necessary, is almost assured: "The preliminary votes on the sil ver bill in the senate leave no doubt that a large majority of that body is in favor of the passage of the bill. That question being de termined, the other one arises. Will the Pres ident veto the bill f it u not otten that a President has the opportunity, or. having it. avails himself of it, to inform congress of his personal opinions as to the expediency ot a measure. In this case the President, in his annual message, laid before congress, in strong and unmistakable language, his ob jections to a bill which had already passed one house by a four-fifths vote, and was then pending in the other bouse. 1 be theory ot a veto is, that the President, in returning a bill without his approval, may give such reasons for his negative that members of congress shall be influenced to vote different ly after hearing these reasons than they voted on the first occasion. In this case, however, the President's objections have been heard in advance. He and the secretary ot the trea sury have in tact .exhausted their reasoning in opposition to the bill, and a veto message with any expectation of changing votes will be a vain del usion. So vain would such a proceeding be, that it is more than likely that should the bill pass the senate by a two- thirds vote, the President would confine his action to a protest such as other Presidents have done under similar circum stances. Should he, however, veto the bill, what aie the prospects of its receiving the two-thirds vote necessary to make it a law ? With the admission of Eustis, of Louisiana, the senate will consist of seventy-six mem bers, and, if all are present, fifty-one votes will be required to pass a bill over a veto. The senators have, by their votes and other wise, nearly all expressed an opinion on this question, and the senators may be classified as for or against the silver bill as follows:

Yeas 47 Nays 25 Doubtful 4 Total Of those put down as doubtful, the two senators from Oregon, and Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, luugina- iroui ineir antece dents and the opinions in their States, will vote for the bill. Mr. Spencer may vote the other way. Included in the negative vote, however, are Messrs. Hill, ot Georgia; La mar, of Mississippi; Kellogg, of Louisiana, and Christiancy, of Michigan, all of whom represent constituencies overwhelmingly in favor of the unlimited remonetization of sil ver. There is hardly an opponent of silver in either Georgia. Mississippi or Louisiana and the policy of increasing the value of gold by making it the exclusive metallic currency will receive no favor in those States. The only senator from the west and northwest who has intimated an opposition to the silver bill is Judge Christiancy, of Michigan. That he is opposed to the bill is not yet certain. ana it win oe a surprise ana a regret to uie whole people ot Michigan if he shall separate himaelt from the mass ot his countrymen to vote with the sectionalism of New Xork and New England to reduce the metallic currency of the country te gold, giving to that metal an increased value, and causing a correspond ing depreciation in the value of land and all .i , m, 1 i . omer property. 1 ne goou peopie 01 luictu- gan will perhaps be somewhat astounded if the passage ot the sliver bill, over all forms of opposition, shall be defeated by the vote of one ot tneir senators, in tne meantime, a week nearly has to elapse before a vote can be taken on this subject, and in that time it will be ascertained how many senators who are now classed as doubtful will vote on this question, which is now a national one the people on one side, the money-lenders on the other.

The Mark Lane Express's weekly review of the corn trade says: In spite ot the heavy imports ot foreign wheat and the absence ot speculation, the trade seems to possess an inherent strength. It is worthy ot note that the exports ot wheat during the past six weeks were nearly forty eight thousand quarters, and should the pe tition of the French millers and merchants be granted, with respect to the tax on wheat I imported from this country, a much larger uulwulu movement may uunuuenuy ue touaeu lor to supplement the acknowledged de- to ficiency of the French cereal crops. In spite of the dullness in trade, the holders evinced little disposition to press sales, and prices have undergone but trifling changes. Russian wheat has occasionally given way six pence to a shilling a quarter, but American remains firm, and while sorts have generally maintained their values, a decidedly strong tone has been apparent in maize, of which imports continue light, and a further rise in this valuable feeding stuff appears imminent, Sound corn on the spot is almost exhausted. and thirty-one shillings six pence, per four hundred and eighty pounds ex granary, is asked for mixed American. In barley and oats business was quiet at about previous cur rencies. ANOTHER ARRIVAL CHOICE AND ELEGANT CLOAKS RLOWK.sTEIS( &. IIHOM. These goods are now being offered at won derfully low prices.
