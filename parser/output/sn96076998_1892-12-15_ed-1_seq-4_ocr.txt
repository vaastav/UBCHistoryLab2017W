If he wanted free silver, they said he should have hU pockets filled; if he said d n the National Dank, they also said It: If he wanted a bank of Issue at every cross-roads, they said he should have It; If he wanted the public schools abolished, they said the "little red schoolhouse" should go; If he wanted to import his dinner buck et and tin pans without paying duty, they told him he eould do so; and if a laboring man said he was crushed un der the heels of the capltallst,they said they would crush the capitalist; If he wanted to engage in the sale of liquor and wished to avoid paying the tax, they said vote tor our candidates for prosecuting attorney and they will not prosecute you; and to Illegal voters they said register and vote the demo eratio ticket and thereby elect officers who will not prosecute you for violat ing the law. In this manner, with the aid of the Prohibition and Third par ties, they accomplished a work which was a sumrlse to themselves.

Some of them favor protection secretly, others open ly. Among the latter is Represents tive Boatner of Louisiana, who says of the tariff bill to be prepared by his partv: "There should be incidental protection for certain American Indus tries, and I believe that President elect Cleveland will make known when the proper time comes that be favors this system of tariff." The republican Senators held a con f erence this week, not to decide upon anything, but merely for an exchange of views as to what policy they should follow in dealing with the legislation of the session. One of the subjects discussed was whether the House bills for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico, now on the Senate calendar.
