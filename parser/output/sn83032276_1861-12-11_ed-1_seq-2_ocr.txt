We publish to day the highly conserva tive message of President Lincoln, a docu ment which we think will meet with the approval of ail right thinking men. In truth it would be difficult for any one to find fault with its sentiments, for while it contains some suggestions of more than or dinary importance, it by no means urgrs their adoption with that pertinacity whieh has characterized several of his predeces sors. It is free from all partizau feeling, the preservation of our country from im pending rain being evidently his sole aim and object. It is somewhat remarkable that while wc have been making treaties with western savages, half civilized nations in the Pa cific and Boutli Atlantic Oceans, with Chi na, • pan. and other races not of the Cau casian order, oar government lias hitherto - t'l i .-<>-!\ avoided recognizing Liberia or Hart- ••- in dependent govc -nments, though '■ "• "vi a pet of the illustrious Clay and the 1 . r a location where an irupor rm ?r.vl„ prevailed for many years.— 1 in.- act of injustice—unworthy of any Christian nation—was yielded to those now in rebellion; who for so many years ruled our destinies, and sacrificed everything to the slave power. The colonization project recommended in the message was a favorite project with Virginia after "Gabriel's revolt,'' and was warmly endorsed by 31 r. Jefferson. If.sec onded by the government, either by estab lishing a monthly steamer to such a loca- i tion, or a bonus for emigrating, there is no doubt that thousands of colored people would be ready at short notice to leave this country.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. lu the Senate on Wednesday Mr. Sauls bury, of Delaware, submitted a resolution proposing the appointment of commission- ; era to confer with like commissioners irom the seceded States " for the preservation ' of the Union." The resolution was laid over. Mr. Chandler o ered a resolution declaring that John C. Breckinridge iscir , polled from the Senate. The resolution was adopted unanimously, several Senators not voting. Mr. Kennedy, of Maryland, voted for the expulsion. The subject of the confinement of free persons ol color, and fugitive slaves in the District jail, was brought up on a resolution by Mr. YY ilson, and the matter finally disposed of by order ing the Marshal to report the names of such persons, causes of arrest, <fcc. After some other unimportant business the Sen ate adjourned. In the House of Representatives, reso lutions and bills relating to various sub jects were introduced and generally refer el. A Homestead Bill reported from the committee on agriculture was referred to the committee on public lands A resolu tion requesting the President to institute a system for the exchange of prisoners was 1 referred to the military committee. In the Senate on Thursday Mr. Bice, of Minnesota, registered his vote in favor of the expulsion of J. C. Breckinridge. Mr. Chandler moved the appointment of a com mittee- to inquire into the causes of the disaster at Ball's Bluff. Motions were made, to extend the inquiry as to other dis i asters, and the subject was finally postpon ed until next day. Mr. Wilson gave no ; tiee of a bill to abolish the post of sutler i in volunteer regiments. Mr. Trumbull in- ' troduced his bill for the " confiscation of the property of rebels and giving freedom to the persons they hold in slavery." The bill referred to committee on theJudic-, iary.

After a brief executive session the Senate adjourned till Monday. In the House of Representatives the President's Message was referred to differ- ' ent committees. Those portions referring to the colonization of slaves taken from armed rebels, and the fortifications of the coasts, were referred to special committees. Mr. Gurly introduced a resolution of in quiry in relation to "the telegraphic cen sorship of the Press." Referred. The ! j House adjourned until Monday. BtsuAs some of the patent democratic papers are publishing Riddle's infamous, tirade, we give the following antidote : [From the Philadelphia Pre.-,.-.] "This, too, we may say for the Democratic ! party—while it maintained its sway, ' Seces sion' was a little baffled clique ; as the Repub lican party rose, ' Secession' became ' an tr my with banners."'— Chas.

None but a physician knows how much re reliable alterative is needed by the people, tin all sides of us, in all communities every- j where there are multitudes that suffer from complaints that nothing but an alterative cures. Hence a great many of them have ' been made and put abroad with the assurance "f being effectual. But they fail to aceotn plish the cures they promise because they have not the intrinsic virtues they claim.— In this state of the case, Dr. J. C. Ayer & Co., : of Lowell, have supplied us with a comj ound Extract of Sarsaparilla, which does prove to be the lung desired remedy. Its peculiar difference from other kindred preparations in market is that it cures the diseases for which it is recommended, while they do not. We are assured of this fact by more than one of our intelligent physicians in this neighbor hood and have the further evidence of our i own experience of its truth.— Tennessee Far-! liur, Nashville, Tenn. LOCAXj affairs. correspondents late up some of our local room this week, but as everything from our soldiers is read with unabated ; interest, no one will regret it. Besides, little of interest ba3 occurred. The weather continues remarkably plea sant, resembling spring far more than stern winter. Dr. VanYalzah cut out a wen from the j ear of Leah, a daughter of Win Keller, aged about six years, without much incon venience or restraint, she being about as usual. Correspondents occasionally complain of errors. We are in fault sometimes; they in others. Having a Started time forgoing to press, we are often compelled to read, hastily and perhaps at night, several col umns of proof sheets. Occasionally we find our corrections overlooked by the com positors; but on the whole, are free to say that where one glaring error is overlooked, we correct ten of a majority of correspon dents. A number of letters weie received last evening from the emigrants to llayti from this place. They arrived at St. Marc on the 2d November, after a pleasant passage of 11 days, and speak favorably of their i reception and the country. - • ! 

COUNTERFEIT SMALL NOTES. —Several counterfeit Is and 2s on the Farmer's Bank ! of Schuylkill county were passed in this place on Monday. The print is rather faint, though otherwise calculated to dc- j cieve the unwary. Our friends in the country who have little knowledge of notes, had better refuse oil small notes on this bank. jfeiyThe railroad accident at Newton Hamilton, briefly noticed last week, was caused by an explosion, and not by running off the track. It appears that the train was standing on the siding at Newton Ham ilton station, when from some cause or oth er, as yet not explained, the boiler ex ploded with a tremendous report, shatter ing the locomotive to pieoes and partially wrecking one or two ot the foremost cars : ' The engineer, Daniel Fisher of Altoona, , and the fireman, Benjaman Gushard, of Patterson, were both on the cngiuc at the time, and were blown high into the air, j their mangled bodies failing souie seventy I'eet from the wreck. Both must have been instantly killed. Wc notice that a j similar explosion took place last week be j tween York and W'rightsvil e, also with j ' fatal results. F-r thr L**w:i*t<>wn ftazett*. Mr. EAitor. —l had the pleasure of I spending two nights last week in the camp of our Pennsylvania soldiers oil the"sa | ered soil ' of Virginia, one night enjoying i the hospitality of Capf Zollinger, the oth er night the tent of (.'apt. Warner. Af ter sleeping only just court' rtnbly, and hav ing my eyes smoked into copious tearful- j ncss, 1 was a little surprised to see the met: looking so hearty and cheerful I "so would j doubtless, soon enable uie to sleep as j soundly as they do, and to enjoy the smoke ! as philosophically. They have abundant j rations, and, with a very few exceptions, ! are in fine health, and declare their satisfac tion with a soldier,s life. Capt. Zollinger spoke flatteringly of his men, and iutima- ; ted that his company was about as steady I and well disciplined as any that could be j named, and I have no reason to doubt it. 1 ' However that may bo, the Capt admin is ; tered to me a most wholesome and hearti ' ly relished breakfast, which Dr. Atkinson i helped me to dispose of with characteristic \ 1 good cheer. Burr, Bratton, Swain, and i 1 othars looked good natured and hearty, i 1 perhaps because breakfast drew nigh. Cupt. Maolay 1 found in comfortable I health and rejoicing—as well as he might I 5 —in the fact that not one of his company had ever been under arrest. Milroy can j reasonably cherish a little pride over this j honorable fact, as well as over her intelli ! gent Captain and his creditable company. ' Sergeant Major Dickey messes with Capt. ! Maelay, and between the eatables and his 1 patriotism thrives remarkably well; it was ! suggested that he would soon be promoted, I he has done so satisfactorily hitherto. A full 1 faced, large man came up to me, and after i a second thorough look, I saw it was an I old acquaintance but not a familiar face* I j at home he might fitly be called J. Shad - j oic McKwen, now he should be named J. ' Stout McKwen. " Music hath" not only ■ "charms to soothe the savage breast," but ' in Ins case, when combined with camp life. ' seems to have a splendid influence in ren- 1 dcring the face full and fresh. William 1 McKwen, too, looks in very good condition, 1 all the better for having recently helped in i ' the capture of a fine South Carolina gen- j i tleman. ) Capt. Taylor, of the Cavalry company, j j seemed as genial as ever, and would be ' a foeman worthy of the best Southern steel , —I am glad he his on our side. A. B. j , Sellicimer lookod very healthy, just a little ' flushed over his esprit in capturing an am- j ' bushed Sccesh, one of the gang whose un- ' expected attack snatched the lamented Dr. i 1 Alexander from a field of great usefulness, j 4 and from a regiment whose hearty confi- ' dence he enjoyed. 1 i Capt. Warner seems very much as when he lived in Lewistown, only is a Captain 1 now, not a teacher or Supt.. He has i a splendid company, and shows himself fully competent to lead it. He has the en tire respect of his company, and, if the } war continues long, he will have a yet high er title than he now hears, and *ill de serve it. I cannot name all tfife Mifljiti co. men I saw, but I remember well the hear ty grasps they gave. They do val iant 1 y when the time for valorous action comes. Col. Irwin and Major Hillings were in Washington at the time of my vis it; I saw them at Willard's, gentlemanly and soldierly as ever. Much more might be said, but this is probably ail your read ers will thank me for. A. s. : . Far th' O'l.-fttc. ADJUTANT WILI.IAM MUKWKN. —This gallant young officer, who was with the Mifflin County Cavalry. Bayard's Kegiment, in the affair near Draine.-ville, Ya., on the 27th ult., was riding near the Colonel when they were fired upon by the rebels from an ambuesende, on their return. He had the honor of taking a rebel lieutenant prisoner, one of the South Carolina "chivalry." The fellow, who was a large fat man, weighing more than two hundred pounds, begged earnestly for "quarters." Adjutant Mc- FiWen, who served five years in the regular army, in Texas, under Capt Oakcs, is an efficient and highly e teemed officer. Mif flin county has reason to be proud of her sons who are battling for the great cause of civil liberty, on the banks of the Potomac. We will not be unmindful of them when the storm of war lias passed away. From a letter to his parents we are permitted to make the following extract: CAMP PisaroKT. YA , ) December 2, 1861. j Dear Father and Mather: —l received your very welcome letter but one hour since. 1 had the pleasure of meeting with A. Mayes and Mr. Aults the other day ; and to day ] met Mr. A. Smith, of the Academy, lie will call and see you. I am always glad to see any of our friends from Lome. Theodore Waream is still very poorly. Our men are in very good health. Capt. Taylor is mending; Lieutenant Mann is very well; he left here on Friday night with the remains of our much loved and much lamen ted young Surgeon, Dr. Alexander, of Mil roy. Poor fellow ! He was shot in the abdo men by the same rebels who tired at me. 1 : made a very narrow escape, indeed : I was riding at the time, in advance, with the Col. of our regiment, whose horse was killed un der him, being pierced by eleven bullets. Col. Bayard was slightly wounded in two places. Our young townsman. A. B. Selheimer, cap tured Capt. Farley, one of the South Caroli 1 na chivalry, with his own hands. Our C' lonel has confided to me the com ' maud of one hundred picked m n of our rcg imrnt, who are armed with Sharpe's breech loading carbines. I am to employ them as j skirmishers. 1 had brother Stewart for din ner to day—thanksgiving day. I had eaptu red a very tine duck—secesh contraband— and Stewart enjoyed him very much. I don't need gloves, stockings nor blankets: I have supplied myself with plenty of good warm I clothing, and with a full suit of oilcloth fr-m head to foot. My love to all friends and relatives. I will write as often as 1113" duties permit. It is snowing a little now, but the weather is re markably line. Our friends would do us a great kindness il they would lorward us the Lewistown papers occasionally. Your affectionate son, WJI.I.IAM T. MCKWEN". Correspondent - .: of the Gazette. CAMP NEAR Mi nor BRANCH. Ml>. 1 December 4, 1861. j Mr Editor: —Gen. ll.inks' DivFion of the army, this day took up line of march for Frederick City, leaving the Logan Guards, under command of Capt. 1 i irry Eisenbi-e, and a company of the Connecticut sth, the whole under command of a Field Officer of the 46th, to guard the Potomac the whole ex tent of the Division, being some 7 miles, un til relieved by Gen. Stone's Division. Wheth er this is considered a post of honor or not j you and your readers will judge, but leave us to be the judges of the coldness of the wenth er, and the diagrecableness of the duty.— Lieutenant Weber is just starting off ■with 40 1 of our boys to relieve Lieut. Selheimer and his 40, and upon my interrogating them as to how they liked it, they answered in the lan guage of an old 3 months' Logan—"why did you go for a soldier?"—and then were called to an attention by the cross Sergeant, (all Ist Sergeants are cross,) and away they went, in 1 the faithful discharge of their duties. Poor fellows ! the night is their own to make the ! best of it. Every one of thetn feels that the safety of the lives and property of this little command rests with them, and faithfully and | aealou.sly will they guard us against any sur prise from foul Secession's hordes. The why i we are moving to Frederick is not known to us. Soldiers are not supposed to know any thing about the movements of an army. They are only required to move at the command forward, and halt when bade to bait. They may "think," but all "thinking" must be done in an undertone. Officers of a high grade 1 arc paid to think for us, the result of which thinking is conveyed to us in the commands march, or halt. It is probable, however, that we are moved to Frederick so as to be nvaila ble in any emergency thnt may arise either west or south. Ihe Division may now Justly be considered fit for any duty, having under gone months of discipline and drill. Gen. Dix and Stone will he left to guard the Poto mac. Upon their arrival, this rear guard will rejoin their Brigade, at Frederick, from which place you will hear from us again. It may he gratifying to our friends at home to know that this Division is styled " Gen. Banks' cold water Division," because of the total pro hibition of all intoxicating drinks. Some of us, who never designed joiniug a temperance society, now fiud ourselves consistent mem bers of the aforesaid institution; and although we did not stipulate for such results, we nev ertheless believe that the rule applied is a good one, and redounds to tho economy and health, as well as the discipline and morality of the entire army—to which all of us, with you, say amen ! While the great leader of hlfcw jp-and^eotuntee*" army IS laboring assidu ously. to perfect Its organization and efficien cy, the army is rapidly gaining confidence in j itself, and all agree in believing that the Uni - ted States North has now as fine ao army in j the field as the world has ever witnessed.— j 1 While the strong handed, brave hearted sons of America arc thus learning the arts of war, j and being inured to the hardships of camp ' lite, the prayers of the pious thousands of, christian friends we left behind us, are sis ! cending to heaven for their safety and pro tection, and we jirrl them and believe in their efficacy. The saddest thought of u'l, to a soldier is. that if the unhappy condition of afl'.iirs in our beloved country continue, sorrow may soon take the place of happiness around the henrthetones of many happy homes—but this is not the language of a soldier. The \ 700,000 gallant men of the free states, now in arms, must move on to victory, though the heavens and earth should clash! Amer ica must be preserved, with all her institutions of civil and religious liberty, and if to effect i this object lives must he lost, the world knows that America's sons are willing for the sacri fice. Thanksgiving day was generally observed ! (on the 28th nit .) by the soldiers of the j Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut j Regiments. Religions exercises were had in I most of the camps. Most of the companies, j if not all in our Regiment, feasted themselves j ! to the utmost of their capacity, while the Ln. gan boys gluttoiiized on as fine specimen of Maryland turkey as one would wish to hear f gobble. The health <>f our Regiment is generally j good. We have less sick than many of our neighboring Regiments. We hare had but i tour deaths in ail, one of which was in com- j pany A—poor Motzcr. Our Brigade is composed of the Connecti cut sth, Col. Ferris, New York 28th, Col. O'Ronald, New York 19th, and Pennsylvania dGih. under command "f Gen. A. S. Williams, of M ichigan, aided by Capt. Wui. l>. Wil kins, nephew of the venerable Judge Wilkins. of Allegheny county, Pa., both as good sol diers and fine gentlemen as Cnole Sam </<;/> boast of. From the Brigadier Gen. down to Tom Ilyer, alias Klias Link, I opine that the 3d Brigade of Gen. Banks' Division is com \ posed of about as good material as the ser j , vice requires. This, however, is more than | ' we can say of Uncle Sam's horses, for of all j the apologies for horses the world could pro ! duee, I think these the meanest. We are glad to believe that honest little Mifflin has j none of these horse furnishers, that leech the . good old Government in its declining days, j The life of a soldier is so much of a same ness that it scarcely affords material for a I publication; besides, our experience shows • that the newspaper correspondents of the old j Logans, while in the J month service, gener ally hung themselves, which said fact makes us somewhat weak in the knees. I will try i and inform you, however, of all important changes of position, address, £c , that mav occur. Yours truly, Lou AX. I' S Our address until further notice will be Frederick City, Md.

The Perry Freemen says: On Wednesday ' afternoon last a sad accident occurred in the house of Win. 11. Henderson, wagon maker, in New Bloouitield. It seems he had been digging a well, aDd had put about two and a half pounds of powder, intended for blasting on the mantel piece, in the kitchen, nearly over the cook 6tovc. Mr. Henderson, whilst j I 6*iog the clock on the mantel piece, displac ed the paper of powder, which fell on the top i of the stove and floor; and as Mrs. 11. swept it off towards the stove hearth, it ignited, bursting out the sidos of the house several inches, shattering the furniture, and setting on fire the clothing of Mrs. Henderson and her youngest child, a boy perhaps nearly two ! years of age, burning them vory severely.— ■ Mr. H. was also severely but, it is believed, i not dangerously burnt.
