THE PRESIDENT'S Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. INCOME-INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth of Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions, His Views on Negro Question for Currency Reform, and Shipping Bill—Would Make Citizens of Japs —Many Other Important Subjects Discussed. Asks Washington, Dec. 3—The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt's annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment into law of several bills Introduced into congress last winter and spring; his views or. the negro problem; the scoring lie gives those whom he terms "preachers of discontent;" the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the Interstate commerce clause of the constitution, and his recommendation for sn inheritance and Income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the one3 mentioned are by far of the greatest importance. He es pecially urges the passage of tHe bill prohibiting corporations from contribut ing to campaign funds, and aiso that one which would give the government the right of appeal in criminal cases, this he says: "Another bill which has Just past one house of the congress and which is ur f jently necessary should be enacted into aw is that conferring upon tho govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the ■congress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should bo set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant s demurrer; while in another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A failure to pass will result in seriously hampering the government ln Its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong: and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the Judgment of an inferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion." of Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of In junctions ln labor disputes, he says: "In my last message I suggested the en actment of a law ln connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of Injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be Ineffective. Moreover, I believe It would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It Is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands ln upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment ■of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated •last year. The Negro Problem. ' The negro problem is given considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country Is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchlngs, and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago. and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne ? ;ro criminal who commits the dread ul crime of rape; and it should be felt as ln the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fall to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with in tent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization; that the spirit of lynching Inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part ln the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it. and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. "Bet justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. Capital and Labor. On the subject of capital and labor •the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preach hatred to the rich man, as such, . . . to seek to mislead and inflame to mad ness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to ap preciate the danger in tha doctrines preached is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of Amer toan national life." Continuing on this ■ubject he says: . .. . . .. "The plain people who think—the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work era with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can he given pop ular government Is to elect an worthy and platform of violence Whenever such an issue is this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such case dem ocracy is itself on trial, popular self government under republican forms Is itself on trial. The triumph of tho mob Is just as evil a thing as tho tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped ono danger avails nothing whatever if we aucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man.whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing, or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who. for his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of men of either of these two classes, we shall shotv ourselves false to America's past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand in hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law, or who seeks to mako them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being the the mob to plunder the rich, nothing to choose between such a re actionary and such an agitator: funda mentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even Justice to all." Railroad Employees* Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should he to steadily reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight-hour day, but in sist that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, ''Just about as ab surd as it is, so far as the isthmus is concerned, where wiiite labor cannot be employed, to bother 'as to whether the work is done by alien black men or alien yellow men." He urges the enactment of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions In the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called tho compulsory Investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." un sinlster agitator on a and hypocrisy, raised in even more objectionable than violent agitator who hounds on There is Control of Corporations, A considerable portion of the message is devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of inspection on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations by the federal government he says: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex perience has conclusively shown the im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far moro complete control than at present over these great corpora tions—a control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosures by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the secur ing of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. As a matter of fact it is these reactionaries and ultraconservatives who are them selves most potent in increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of dangerous agitation, which is SO per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the agitation is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways is to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate com mon carriers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain ln con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system—or rather no system—of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as If the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf Indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fall to >ut a premium upon individual initiative, ndlvidual capacity and effort; upon the energy, character and foresight which is so important to encourage in the individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its extreme form communism, and the destruction of individual character which they would bring about, are in part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results in a single individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all others until his or its rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position of utter inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer in some way to his belief the necessity for the curbing of enor mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both in come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should impose a graduated inheritance tax, and, if possi ble, a graduated income tax. He says: "I am well aware that such a subject this needs long and careful study in order that the people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and eelf-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators can work out the project in necessary detail. But feel that In the near future our nation legislators should enact a law provid ing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any Individual or corporation. may be well to make the tax heavy proportion as tho individual benefited remote of kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase the amount left to any one individual after a certain point has been reached. is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well off. This object can be attained making the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object should be to put a con stantly increasing burden on the Inher itance of those swollen fortunes which Is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There can be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining the conditions upon which any gift or Inheritance should be received Exactly how far the inheritance tax | would, u an Incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise gift of the enormous fortunes In question It Is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress In this direction should be gradual. At first a oennanent national Inheritance tax, while it might bo more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation, to what such tax should ultimately be. Agricultural Interests. He appeals for every encouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural Interests of the country, points to the good that is being done by the various forms of grange organiza tions, and says: ''Several factors must cooperate In the Improvement of the farmer's condition. He must have the chance to be educated in ttie widest possible sense—in the j He sense which keeps ever In view the intimate relationship between the theory of edu cation and the facts of life. l n all education wo should widen our aims. is a good thing to produce a certain num ber of trained scholars and students: but the education superintended by the state must seek rather to produce a hun dred good citizens than merely scholar, and it must be turned now and then from the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself. This is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again and again by all observers most competent to pass prac tical judgment on the problems of our country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people and to confer more real significance uj)on the phrase "dignity of labor," and to pre pare the pupils so that In addition to each developing in the highest degree his Individual capacity for work, they may together help create a right public opinion, and show ln many ways social and cooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business world; and it has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. It Is no less neces sary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement is good in itself and is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It is kept to its own legitimate business. Tha benefits to be derived by tho association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological. Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are inadequate because of the wide fluctuation charges, he says: "The mere statement of these facta shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension. and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially impair the value of the United States two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should one of interest rectiva your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary of the treasury, the es sential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According- to this plan national banks should be per mitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital ln notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit tho issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency pre sented by times of stringency. He again asks for free trade with this country for the Philippines and in the same connection reviews the work done by this country in the islands, and says "if we have erred in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly in the direction of granting a large meas ure of seif-government." Naturalization of Japs. President Roosevelt scores San Fran cisco and other Pacific coast cities for their treatment of the Japanese, and makes the following recommendations: "I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provding for the naturalization of Japanese who come here Intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our in ternational obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States gov ernment are entirely inadequate. They fall to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens ln the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible in our international rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by the federal government toward this end. and in the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that it is in my power to do will be done, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. The city by itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and If Inde pendent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the United States government, thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed it against the conse quences of their own wrongdoing." American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan In Porto Rico should be dredged and Improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rfco should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other insular possessions, should all be direct ed under one executive department; by preference the department of state or the department of war. It Is un Cuban Intervention. The rebellion in Cuba and the inci dents leading up to the establishment of the provisional government is reviewed, and the president says; "When the election has been held and the new government Inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the imperative need of pre serving justice and keeping order in the island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed in the island, it is ab solutely out of the question that the island should continue independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorship before the civilized world Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to Intervene and to see that government was managed ln such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-gov ernment is always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the Cubans as they tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started it shall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the one hand, and from Insurrectionary disturbances on the other." On the subject of the Panama canal he promises a special message in lbs near future for the Greater Mississippi Bn- li. E. BIjAKKSLEB. While the writer was urging action on the part of those present at the meet ing of agricultural commissioners and workers at Jacksonville, Fla., recently toward concerted action for broadening the cotton market both at home and abroad, and in discussing the proposition to cover our cotton with goods made from low grades and making sacks for fertilizers and similar uses from storm eotton, a distinguished gentleman in the party took issue and pronounced the proposition a sophistry. 3tated that it was wrong to try to force manufacturers of fertilizers to use goods made from eotton if they did not want to, etc. Ibis is just us it has been for years. When an effort is being made to do something for the farming classes there is always some one to object and claim that the plan is not reasonable or just to the manufacturer. They for get that the same manufacturers do just as they please, forcing on the farmer what they choose, and he In course in the matter, force the manufacturer of fertilizers to employ only their labor in the plant, but when the consumer, the cotton planter, wants a little concession to benefit him self in furnishing a market for what he raises with the fertilizer bought there is y of forcing them to do something they ao not want to. The trusts and combines nave defenders everywhere that are always anxious to take up the cudgel in their defense, many of them coming from sources that should have supplied defenders for the agricultural people. As the writer stated in his address before that body, every interest has been fos tered by special legislation, donation concessions except the farmers, and it is now high time that they were being recognized by a government that has its very foundation and sinews of perpetua tion upon the results of their labor. lie further is no re Union labor can is a c h or • * • The best proposition being advanced in the interest of Mississippi fanners is to establish standard warehouses at cen tral points for the storing of cotton til a price justifying the sale is offered. Several have already been built and oth ers are projected. This is a highly prac tical and sensible solution of the Ull per plexing question of marketing the cot With only one such warehouse each county with a capacity of 1,000 bales, 77,000 bales could be held until the manufacturers demanded it and were willing to pay a fair price for the staple. The first cost of a standard warehouse is considerable, but after having been built the expense of main tenance is small. The house should be of brick, according to underwriters' rules. Sprinkling devices where there are water systems greatly lessen the danger from fire and materially lessen the cost of insurance. The cost of in surance and storage in such a warehouse should not exceed twenty cents per bale per month. With cotton stored and in sured iu such a place the owner needing money could secure loans from the banks upon the warehouse receipts if he was in need of it. Cotton is better subject to manipulation at the hands of specula tors than any crop grown, from the fact of its being gathered and all dumped upon the market in a short time. When our people prepare themselves to market it in an intelligent manner they will be free from improper influences that have controlled the price in the past. The start made is a good one and should be pushed to perfection. ton crop. in once * • • Amory has organized a $10,000 com pany for the purpose of building a com plete canning plant to care for the fruit and vegetables raised in that section with so little effort.

Let us hope for its complete success. And now Greenville is talking of a fail for next year.

MISSISSIPPI NEWS December Weather. The following data, covering a pe riod of eighteen years, have been com piled from the weather bureau records at fifty-six observation stations in Mis sissippi. They arc issued to show the conditions that have prevailed in the State during December for the above period of years, but must not be con strued as a forecast of the weather con tious for the month: Mean or normal temperature, 48. The warmest month was that of 1889, with an average of 00. The coldest month was that of 1903, with an average of 43. Some of the highest temperatures re corded were as follows: 83 at Port (lib son in 1892 and 85 at Crystal Springs 1904. Some of the lowest temperatures re corded were as follows: Zero at Ripley and Holly Springs in 1901. The greatest average monthly pre cipitation was 8.54 inehes, in 1897. The least average monthly precipita tion was 0.94 of an inch in 1889. • Some of the greatest monthly amounts of precipitation recorded were as fol lows: 14.78 inches at Edwards in 1897 and 13.70 inches at Ripley in 1904. Some of the least monthly amounts of precipitation recorded were as fol lows: 0.30 of an inch at Batcsville in 1889 and 0.29 of an iuch at Greenville and 0.31 of an inch at Water Valley in 1896. The average snowfall ranges from about two inches in the extreme north ern counties to a trace in the gulf coun ties. In December, 1894, snow fell to a depth of six inches in Clay county. Prison Population. The rate at which the population of the prison farms and institutions is in creasing is calculated to paralyze the management in their policy of economy aud reduction of expenses. The popu lation report of the secretary of the board of control shows that the actual increase exceeded the estimates by 50 per cent, at least on the operations of the past month. The month closed with a population of 1,351 convicts against 1,311 for the previous month, a net increase of 40, the total number received during the mouth of Novem ber being 03, the largest ever known at any time. Sixteenth. Section Lands. According to a decree of Judge Niles of the Federal court, lessees of land belonging to the sixteenth section can legally remove therefrom as they will the timber and other products indige nous thereto without restraint at law. In general conclusions the opinion fol lows the majority opinion of Justices Truly and Callioou of tho State supreme court and concludes: "A conveyance of all right, title, interest, use and occu pation to complainants for a term of ninety-nine years gives them full and complete ownership, subject only to the condition that the holding was to ter minate at a specific date. 11 Farmers' Union Cotton Sale. The biggest cotton movement in the history of Y'alobusha county occurred at Water Valley when the members of the Farmers' Union pooled 2,000 bales and invited foreign buyers to come and bid on it. The city had the appearance of circus day. Vehicles of every de scription congested the streets, and for a time they were impassable. Cotton from a distance of forty miles was brought to the sale. Some disappoint ment was felt at the non-appearance of buyers who had been requested to at tend, and as a consequence fully 1,500 bales remained unsold when the day's work closed. Mississippi Industrial Exposition. The directors of the Mississippi In dustrial Exposition and Fair Associa tion of Jackson have decided to fix a specific date for the opening of the ex position hereafter, and selected the first Tuesday in November as the date.

When I began taking Dr. Willmma* Pink Pills," says Mrs. Nathaniel Field, of St. Albans, Somerset county, Maine. *'I was the palest, most bloodless person you could imagine. My tongue and gums were colorless and my fingers and ears were like wax. I had two doctors and they pronounced my trouble anaemia. I had spells of vomiting, could not eat, in fact, did not dare to, I had such dis tressaftereating. My stomach was filled with gas which caused me awful agony. The backache I suffered was at times almost unbearable and the least exertion made my heart beat so fast that I could hardly breathe. But the worst of all was the splitting neuralgia headache wliioh never left me for seven weeks. About this time I had had several numb spells.
