SYNOPSIS OF THE MESSAGE. The president's message opens with a re minder that this session of congress will mark tho closo of a century of constitution al existence. Ho reminds congress that the constitution was tho chart of puidaneo laid down by tho fathersof tho country, and that departure from it means failure of our institutions. Ho draws a bright picture of the country's growth, but says that "upon more careful inspection wo und tho wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unremuner a tire labor. A crowed und constantly in creasing urban popui .tkm suggest tho im poverishment of tbti rural sections and dis content with agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's Eimplo and laborious HU joins tho eager chase for easily uc mired wealth, and so economic conditions have become difficult of solution. Wo discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no long er solely a reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from tho discriminating favor of tho govern ment and are largely built npon undue ex action from the masses of our ieople. The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening and classes are rap idly forming, one comprising tho very rich and powerful, while in another are found the toiling poor. "As wo view tho achievement of aggro pated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while tho citizen is struggling farin the roar or is trampknl to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the ser vants of tho people, are fast becoming tho people's masters. Still, congratulatingour selves npon tho wealth and prosperity of our country, and complacently contemplat ing every incident of change inseparable from theso conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to Inquire, at tho presort stage of our progress, how the bond tho Sovernment made with the people has been ept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to tho necessities of its economical administration, tho government persists in exacting from tho subsUinco of tho people millions which, unapplied and useless, lio dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation aJd to tho extortion and tho Innrrar nltmillnf? tl.n rllrprsinn ftf lhf prr. rency of tho country from tho legitimate channels of business. Under the samo laws by which theso results are produced, tho government permits many millions more to bo added to the cost of tho living of our pcoplo aud to bo taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell tho profits of a small but powerful minority. Tho people must still bo taxed for tho support of tho government under the operation of tariff laws; but to tho extent that the mass of our citizens nro inordinately burdened be yond any useful public purposes and for tho ticneSt of a favorol few, the government, under pretext of nu exercise ofitstax-ng power, enters gratuitously into partnership with thesti favorites, to their advantage and to tho in urv of a vast majority of our fteoplc. Tl.ii ii not equality before the aw." After the prelmlo tho president argr.ei that such conditions at e injurious to the nation, making the government an instru ment for private gain; and -ho says that tho farmers aud laborers will see ouly too noon that they are being fcixed under nn unjust theory of taxation, without compensatory favor. When this discontent and tho self ishness of the benellciaries of protective tariffs are realized, we will realize that tho beneficent purpo of our government aro endangered. "Communism is a hateful thing, and a menaco to poace and organled government. Uut'tho communism of com bined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selllshness.whieh ins.duously undermines the justlco and in tegrity of freo iostitu lions, is not less dan gerous than tho communism of oppressed Ioverty, which, exasperated by injustice und discontent, attacks with wild disorder tho citadel of rule. "There aro people whe proposo that tho government shall protect the rich and that they in turn will caro for tho laboring poor. Any intermediary between the people and their government, or tho least delegation of tho caro and protection tho covcrnmcnt owes to tho humblest citizen in tho land, makes tho bonst of froe Institutions a glit tering delusion, and tho pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposi tion. "A Just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should bo made for the relief of those of our countrymen who suffer under pres ent conditions. Such a revision should re ceive the supjwrt of all who lovo that Jus tice and equality duo to American citizen ship; of all who realize that in this justice and equality our government finds its strength and its power to protect tho cit zenand his property; of all who bollevo that Iho contented competence and comfort of the m ny accord better with tho spirit of our institutions th:in colossal fortunes, un fairly gathered, in the hands of the few; of all who appreciate that tho forbearance and fraternity among our people, which recompense tho valuo of crery American interest, aro tho surest guarantee of our national progress, and of all who desiro to see tho products of American skill and in genuity in overy market of tho world, with a result ng restoration of American com merce." i Paternalism of government is stronily do r.ouncod, and tho pretext of tho wealth of tho government being sufllelent excuse for extravagant expenditure combated. In this class of false theory comes pensions granted on no other ground than the appli cant's liced, private relief bills, etc, which have con.'.-e-tted congressional work and prevented consideration of really import ant puoic urn... Among me Dusiness o avoided wer j measures for the relief of tho supremo court ; for United States prisons; ror an onuiublo land law: and for revision of the pension laws. Furthermore, under ploa of serving tho puoiicgooo:, there has been great laxity In observing tho parti tions that dlvldo proper fields of federal and state legislation: and closing this por tion of his message, ho quotes Andrew Jackson's peroration on tho constitution. Tho president argues then on the neces sity of tariff reform being patent to all and aysltsnouia Dononcsuy nieiiinucuocuve j.v rouit-d.eu. A plun Bhotwd bo effected, "fair and conservative toward existing in dustries, but which wilt reduce tho cost to consumers of the necessaries of life, while it provides for our manufacturers tho ad vant go of floor raw m terials and permits no injury to tho interests of American la bor." Dealing with tho stato of tho;unlon, the prcsideut says foreign relations havo been strengthened. The in'emational questions which still await settlement aro all reason ably within tt.o domain of a tapablo nego tiation, and there is no existing subject of dispute between the United States and any foreign power that is not susceptible nf satisfactory adjustment by frank diplo matic trcatmc-nt. "The questions between Great Urltiln and the United States relating to tho rights of American fishermen under treaty and international comity in tho territorial waters of Canada and Newfoundland, 1 regret to say, aro not satisfactorily ad Justed." Ho recites the diplomatic history of theso disputes. He then goes on and says: "Having essayed in the discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation tho settle ment of u long standing cause of disputo and to remove a constant menace to the good relations of tin two countries, and continuing to bo of thu opinion that tho ,'ire.ity of Februury last., which failed to rccoivo the approval of tho senate, did sup ply a satisfactory, practical and linal ad justment upon n basis honorablo and just to both parties of tho di Moult and vexed question to which it related,' and having subsequently and unavuilingly recommend ed other legislation to congress, which I hoped would suffice to meet tho exigency created by tho rejection of tho treaty, I now a -rain in vole a tho earn est and immediate attention of tho congress to tho condition of this important question as it now stands before them and the coun try, and for tho settlement of which I am deeply oolicitious. Near tho closo of tho month of October last, occurrences of a deeply rcgretablo nature wero brought to my krowicd-;o which mado it ray painful but imperative duty to obtaiu with us dtUo delay na possible, a new peruonal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the government of Great Hritain. "Tho corrcspondeneo in relation to this incident will, in duo course, bo laid before you, and will disclose tho unpardonable conduct of the ollicial referred to, in his in terference by advice und counsel with tho suffrages of American citi.ous in tho very crisis of tho presidential election nenr ct hand, and aho in his subsequent public declarations to justify his action, superadd ing impugnment of tho exeeutlvo and sen ate of tho United States, in connection with important questions now pending in contro versy between tho two governments. "The offense thus committed was most grave, involving disastrous, possibilities to tho good relation of tho United States and Croat Llrltaln, constituting a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of tho purely domestic affairs and essential soverignity of the government to which the euvoy was accredited. Having first fulfill ed the Just demand of lutcrnational comity, by affording full opportunity for her majes ty's government to act in relief of tho situa tion, I considered prolongation of the dis cussion to be unwarranted, und thereupon declined to further rccogule the diplomatic character of tho person whose continuanco in such function would destroy tho mutual contldcnco which is essential to tho good understanding of tho two governments, and was inconsistent with the welfare and self respect of the government of tho United States." A survey of tho Alaskan boundary is recommended. An arrangement with Great Hritain looking to tho romoval of obstacles to the humano relief of shipwrecked sailors on the great lakes is suggested. The relations with Franco on tho im pressing of American citizens into its mili tary servief, and tho relations with Samoa and China on the restriction act. are retold. The convention with Japan is still in prog ress. A ct nsular couit in Corca Is recom mended. Uur representative in Haytl has been lnstruetel to abstain from interfer ence in tho revolution now to there, while duo precautions for tho observance of neutrality laws have been taken. Sub marine telegraph connection with Honolu lu Is roeommeuded. A precise location of tho Mexican boundary line is urged to avoid future complications. Claims of American citizens against tho foreign gov ernments have been amicably settled. Tho president then takes up tho question of naturalization, dealing with It thus: "With the rapid increase of immigration to our shores uud tho facilities of modern travel, abuses of tho generous privileges afforded by our naturalization laws call for their careful revision. Tho easy and un gu'i'jed manner in which certificates of American citizenship can be obtained has induced u clans, unfortunately largo, to avail themselves of tho opjortunity to be come absolved froai allegiance to their nativo land, aud yet by a foreign resideuco escapo any Ju&t duty aud contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus, while evading the duties of citizenship to tho United States, they may muke prompt claim for its national protection, and demand its intervention in their behalf. International complications of a serious nature arise und tho corres pondence of the stto department discloses tho great number and complexity of the quostions which have been raised. Our laws regulating tho issue of passports should be carefully revised, und tho insti tution of a central bureau of registration at the capital is again strongly recommend ed. LJy this means full particulars of each case of naturalization in tho United States would be secure! and properly re corded, und thus many cases of spurious citizenship would le detected and unjust responsibilities would be avoided. "Tho reorganization of the consular ser vice is a matter of serious Importance to our national interests. Tho number of ex isting prinoipal consular officers is believed to be greater than is at all nocessary for tho conduct of the public business. It need not bo our policy to maintain more than a moderate number of principal officers, each supported by a salary sufficient to enable the Incumbent to live in comfort and so distributed as to secure convenient super vision over a considerable district. I re peat tho recommendations heretofore mado by me, that tho appropriations for tho maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should be recast; that theso called notarial or unofficial duties which our rep resentatives abroad are now pcrmrttod to treat as personal perquis'tes, should bo lor bldden;that a system of consular inspec tion should be instituted ; and that a limited number of so :i etaries of legation at largo should bo authorized." Tho preparations for a centennial of tho inaugura ion of Washington, to bo held at New York, aro adverted to. The message thea goes on to deal with tho reports of the various departments, heretofore sent out ly the press. The sur plus io tho treasury is put at $104,000,00'.). The money saved by purchase of bonds not yot duo is put at t.T.l.tt.OiX). At first sight this would sce.n to be a prolitable and sen sible transaction on tho part of tho govern ment, but as suggestod by the Eccrotary of tho treasury, the surplus thus expended for tho purchase of bonds was money drawn from the peoplo in excess of any actual need of tho government, and was so ex pended rather than allowed to remain in tho treasury. "If this surplus under the operation of Just and equitable laws had been left In tho hands of tho people, it would havo been worth In their bus'ness at least six per cent per annum. Deducting from the amount of Interest upon tho prin cipal end premium of theso bonds for tho timo they had to run, at the rato of six per cent, tho saving of two per cent made for the people by tho purchaso of such bonds, the loss will appear to l.o $V,7(V),000. "With regard to silver coinage, tho sec rotary of the treasury recommends the sus pension of the further coinago of silver, and in snch recommendation I earnestly concur. For further valuable information and timely recommendations, I ask tho careful attention of the congress to tho sec retary's report." Tho reports ot tho war department are given In abstract und the recommendations concurred in. Tho death of (len. Sheridan is spoken of thus: "Tho death of Gen. Sheridan in August last was a nutlnnal affliction. The army then lost tho grand estorits chiots; tho country lixtnbnve and experienced soldier, a wiso and discreet counselor and a modest and sensible nir.n. Thoso who in any marinor cumo within the range of his personal association will never fail to p iy deserved and willing horn ago to his greatness and the glory of hiscareor; but they will cherish with moro tender cnsibllity tho loving memory of his simple, generous und considerate nature." Tho movement for tho return of tho Apa che prisoners to their reservations is spok en of as a dangerous and ill-Judged piece of philanthropy. Tho report of tho secretary of the navy Is plven in abstract and tho recommendations upproved. The same disposition is mado of the postmHster general's report, published to-day, and rocoiiimcndationsmadoof legis lative read ustment of much of its machin ery. The president favors Mr. Dickinson's plan t o place the erection of postonico build ings in tho hands of the department, on a basis of busiuess done. Much legislation, reasonable and proper at tho timo it was made, is out of dato to day, and should bo rcviBod for the benefit of the postal estab lishment. Tho work of tho department of Justlco Is related, special attention being oiled to the prosecution, in Utah, of offenders pgainst ant. -polygamy laws, and tho opinion is ex pressed that under such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws, and the advance of ideas opposed to the forbid len practices, polygamy within tho United States is virtu ally at an end. Secretary Vilas' report has ono f.'aturo called attention to, that relatin-r to publio lands "Wo havo no excuso for tho vio a lion of principles cogently taught by reason and example, uor for the allowance of pro texts which havo sometimes exposed our lands to colossal greed. Laws which open tho door to fraudulent ncquisition.or admin istration which permits favor to rapacious seizure by a favored few of expanded ureas that many should enjoy, are accessory to offenses against our national welfare and humanity.not to bo too sovcrely coudemned or punished. Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urgo the ppeedy tuactment ol measures of legislation which will conlino tho luturo disposition of our remaining agricultural lands to tho uses of actual hus bandry and genuine homes. Nor should our vast tracts of so-called desert lands be yield ed up to the monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals, as appears to bo much iho tendency under tho existing statuto The hinds require but tho supply of water tobeeomo fertilo und productive. It is a problem of great moment how, mot wisely for the public good, that factor shall bo furnished. I cannot but think it perilous to suffer either these lands or tho sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies." Legislation for tho adjustment of stato grunts is recommended, in the equal inter est of the nation, the states and the set tlers. The failuro of the Sioux lnnd treaty is soTatcd. The number of pensioners added to the rolls during the fiscal yoar ended Juno 3), lsv, is 'o.2Vj, and tho increase of pensions was granted in 45.7(H) cases. Tho names of 15,7() pensioners were drepited from the rolls during the year for various causes, ard at the close of tho year tho number of persons of aM classes receiving pensions was 452,.ro5. Of theso thero were KX1 survivors of the war of 10,707 widows of thoso who served in that war, pi.oo soldiers of tho Mexican wur and 5,104 widows of said soldiers. Ono hundred and two different rates of pensions aro paid to these beneficiaries, ranging from $J to filtt 00 per month. Tho amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was $75, 777, btil O'J. being an increase over tho preceding year of $.,:,08,NX) 27. "I am thoroughly convinced," the presi dent says, "that our genernl pension laws should bo revised and adjusted to meet as far us possible, in tho light of our experi ence, all meritorious cases. The fact that 10J different rates cf pensions ar- paid cannot, in my opinion, bo mado consistent with Jus tice to tho pensioners, or to tho govern ment; and tho numerous private pension bids that are passed predicated upon tho imperfection of tho ge""ral laws, which, whilo they increase, in many case., existing Inequality und injustice, Und ; ddltional force to the recommendation fo:' a revis'en of tho general laws on the sub.eet. "The laxity of the ideiis prevailingumong a large number of our people regarding pensions is beomim; every day moro marked The principle. upon which they should b3 granted uro in danger of beln altogether ignored, and aire ul.v pens.tns ure often claimed becuuvo the applicants ari as much entitled as other successful uoplicunts, rather than upon any disability reasoLAbly aitiibutablo to military service If tho etab:ishment of vie ot.s precedents bo cont.niK d and the gran tin of pens! ins bo not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant considerations, and if the honorable name of veteran un fairly boeom"s bv theso means but another terra for ono who consti nt y clamors for tho aid of tho government, tnero s danger that injury will bo done to tho fame and patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor, und that a prejudice will bo aroused un;ust to meritorious applica tion for pensions." The work of tho asrioultural bureau is rclated,and co-operation with tho states rec ommended. The adjustment of tho relations between the government and tho railroad companies which have received land grants, and tho guaranty of the public credit in aid of tho construction of their roads, should rocoive early attention, and be treated as a purely businoss proposition. After making recom mendations relative to tho District of Col umbia, tho president concludes as follows: "Tho consciousness that I have presented but nn imperfect statement of the condition of tho country and its wants occasions no four that anything omitted is not kuown and appreciated by tho congress, upon which rest the responsibility of intelligent legislation in behalf of a great nation and u confiding people. As public servants, we shall do our duty well ir wo constantly guard tho rpctitudoof our intentions, main tain unsulied our love of country, and with unselfish purposo strive for tho public good."
