KdUors of the Kcowcc Courier: My associate, Mnjor Dendy, gavo your readers an nccouni of thc proceedings of ho General Assembly up to tho past week. This week thc Assembly hos been going on ?arncstly with tho determination to act .brough by thc 23 d instant. Tho general iuprc?aiuii uinuo by tho moiuDCfs Di turo Legislature is# that it ia moro conservative ind business like than any gathered herc anec tho odventof thc Democratic party to power io 1870. Thc disposition of thc members is to do that work which is only ibBolutcly necessary. Tho overllooding tho aalcndars with bills of incorporation hus been discontinued by striking out tho en acting oluuso of tho hills, and forcing par ties to incorporate their companies under thc general st ututos, by applying to tho Clerks of tho Courts. ]Jy this means muuh burdeusomo work is gotten rid of. A bill to repeal tho lien law was voted dowu in the House by 20 to 70. The ar gument was that thc hom os toad and neces sities of thc people demand thc continu anco of thc law. Tho homestead takes away tho credit of a certain class of our people, and tho lien law must supply it. Tho ooudilion, too, ot tho peoplo of thc lower counties is very different from that in thc upper counties. They deal in cotton and rice almost exclusively. Upon these crops os a basis tho merchants and tho factors in tho cities ?'run" thc planters and tonanta. They aro almost universally be hind. Ono crop is oonaumcd beforo another is made, and henee they argue that they must have tho lien law to gaiu credit in this deplorable condition. A bill providiog fora commission to codify tho statute law of thc State has passod three readings in thc House. Tho bill provides that thc Associate -Justices and tho Chief Justioo of tho Supremo Court shall appoint thrco persons, loamed in tho law, to do this groat and important work. They oro charged with the labor of sys tematising thc law, making BUCI) ohuuges as aro necessary, and reporting, if practicable, to tho next, Goncral Assembly, at its session in 1881. This work is a vory important one lt is difficult to find a lawyer, howovcr learned, who understands thc statute luw, so grcut is its confusion. Thc oiti/.en who j does not tnnke law a profession, when ho attempts lo look up tho law, on any sub jeot, in our statutes, becomes bewildered and confused and gives up his labors as n fruitless ono. Tho law should bo so simplo that ovcry ono who reads may know it This commission is appointed to simplify and abridge tho compass of thc law, so that all may know it who will. Tho com missioners will bo paid a salary of two thousand dollars each for their work. A bill has also boon introduced into tho House, which hatf not yet been aotcd upon to suggest changes and amendments to our constitution. Thia bill proposes to amond tho constitution by such provisions ns thc liOgislaturo may suggest, without tho risks and expenso of a convention. I do not know what will bo thc futo of thia bill. Tho difficulties in tho way of a cull of a constitutional convention suggest this as tho most practica] way of amending tho con stitution. Tho constitution requires tho call of a oonvontion to bo submitted to o popular voto at a general election. Tho next gonoral election would havo to bo passed beforo tho convention could bo called, and it is said that our prcsont ne cessities demand a ohango of that law, in ?omo respects, which con bo no longer de layed. A bill to reviso tjjo tax laws of tho Stato hus ulso boon introduced. This bill will be refcrrod to tho commission to codify tho luws. lt seeks to ubolish tho office of County Auditor, aud to so simplify tho modo of collecting taxes os to rcduoo tho oxpenses of this department of thc government, a much needed reform. I havo also bills under my charge to require Couuly Commissioners, School Dommissioncrs and Treasurers to mako uinunl reports to tho spring term of the Courts of Gcucral Sessions, in all tho jountics, of tho amount of taxes levied and jollected for county purposes and school purposes, tho amount of olniuiB allowed and laid and to whom paid. It requires 'also rho publishing in county newspapers, two vecks beforo opening of court, all oluims illowcd and ordered puid by theso officers. LMiO object of tho bill is to d'aw these -fficors under thc immodiuto supervision of ho court und people. This law olso pro 'idos tho mode of paying county claims, lt equircs tho Clerks of thc Boards of Com oissioncrs to number tho claims in tho rder iu winch they oro filed from number mo continuously upward, it also forbids [Vcusurcrs from paying any claim, except ipon order of tho County or Sohool Com iiissioncrs. Thus tho bill prohibits any latin from being preferred. The attention of tho Legislature is being .rooted especially to county matters. It i said that whilo thc Stato expeutea havo cen cul down one fourth, county expenses ro ns great as under Radical rule. This i in u great mensuro D uo. The expenses of nrryiuj; on the oounty governments aro too kJi*nd ?hould an4 will ba curtailed. Tho re high and under our prcsont system aro urdensomo, and thc system ought to bo cmodcled. The expenses of our county ho Inst year hnvo beeu very high indeed, nd this, too, when accounts of tho County Jouimis?ioiiers, for their own salaries, and nidge expenses have boon less by half han any (Jommissioncrs who have ever erved thc county. Tho system itself of he courts ?R burdensomo and ought to be o changed that thc laws oan bc ndmiu?3 ercd more cheaply. Major Dendy hus also introduced a bill 0 chango thc time of holding courts in ho 8th Circuit. This bill has been rcfer .cd, after favorable report, from tho Judi siary Committee to o special committee, ?onsistiug ot tho members of tho 8th Cir ?uit. Tho objoot of thc bill is to fix such 1 time for holding our oourts as will bc Bonvcnicnt to our people and not interfere with their fall and spring farming. The bill to repeal tho law allowing plain tiffs and defendants costs was also votcc down by on overwhelming vote. Tin theory of the Jaw allowing costs is that hi who ls ut fault shall pay thc costs to wi.?ol by his wrongs ho has put his opponent This luw is just. Ho who sues his neigh bor unjustly or carries him to law withou right ?hould pay for his folly. If thi was not so tho oourts would be orowdei with all kinds of oluims without fouuda lion. Tho codo has been amended in ono o two particulurs by bills whioh hnvo passe three rcudings in tho IIouso and sent t Senate. Ono amendment was tho limit! tious of actions for tho recovory of rei estate. 'Ibo law, us it now stands, forbii any ono to bring an action for scouring i real cstato unless ho or his ancestors wet in actual possession within ten years fro tho time tho right of action aocvued, a though ho may have tho legal titlo thcret This amendment seeks to remedy this d< feet. Tho law in relation to an execute being un executor of tho will of a first tost tor, beoause ho happons to bo tho executor tho second testator, has been so arrange that if a person dio leaving a will and 1 exooutor dio leaving a will, that tho exec tor of thc last will cannot bo tho oxcoul of thc first by reason of being execul of thc last. Many bills of a local oharacter have be introduced, but upcoial legislation is I looked upon with muoh favor. Tho great question beforo tho peoplo that of registration. Bills have been i troduocd upon this question whioh \ porhopa bo passed over uutil next scssi and thus bo given moro timo for oonsidc: tion. Tho opproprinpu ami Bupply bills will bo brought into tho Houso on Tuesday next. Tho Wi* find Moons Committee oro hard nt wor, o^n theso bills. Every effort is boing nxlc to rcduoc expenses ond lesson taxation, nd ovcry item of theso bills aro sorutoized jealously with tho view of hoving.hc supply bill na small ns possible ot tip oast oosts. Tho low Ruioh allowed thc Comptroller General tho !iocn80 fees from insuranco 3ompnuic8 til bo reposed. Tho lioenso foo will bo no'le larger and this officer paid \ stated salotyfor his work. Tho Comp troller Gcnoul "received oununlly from ;his 8ouroo io average of $2,100 for Four years, beides a salury of $2,100, thus uakiog n enlry of four thounand dollars >r over for ttis offlco. Thc law allowing hese feos vos passed in 1873, nnd by orno nogloctwos uot repealed by tho Legi slatures Biue 1876. This Logisluturo will ?ot only rcpiil tho law allowing theso fees o tho Comptroller, but will inorenso tho iocnso nod bave tho Bamo paid into thc rcosury. c\ considerable revenue might bo nado to thc g07ornmcut from this souroo if .ropcrly managed.
