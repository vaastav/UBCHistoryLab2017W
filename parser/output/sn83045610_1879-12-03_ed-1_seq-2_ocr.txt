In the United States it is dead and buried beyond the hope of resurrection, an l in Eng- : land it is much the same. Under the circumstances it coal I not be other- 1 wise. The apprentice system was an ' outgrowth of tho shop. The cooper, the printer, the blacksmith, &c , took a boy into the trade because he couldn't afford to hire a man ; usually getting the services of tho boy for no thing, and occasionally receiving com pensation in addition. Seventy years ago Napoleon truly denominated the English a nation of shopkeepers, and America was another. Among such people apprentices were indispensable. That day, however, has gone past, and ia its place has coaie the reigu of steam aud electricity. Boys can DO lenger be utilized, aud men are abaelutely re quired. On the locomotive and train, in tbe mammoth factory, in the coun ting room, every persoo must know bis place and be able to fill it. We no longer, min the slow days of half a century ago, have time to stop and teaoh as wo work, and the baud who requires such teaching is certain to be the one first discharged. The ooly waj on this coast for a boy nowadays to learn a trsde is to pick it up. He can hang arouud, use tbe keenest ob servation of which he is capable, and make himself useful as his inclination, ability and limited opportunities will permit. In the lapse of years, and after oft repeated rebuffs and discour agements, he finds a place he can fill, and if there is good stuff in him he quiekly fits himself for any place in the business or any branch of tbe trade. Ou tbe Atlantic, it is not very dif ferent or much better, and in England likewise. In Franco, where tbe same trouble has been encountered, a step in tho right direction has been takep. Sohools there bavo been instituted to the number of two hundred and forty, for the scientific and mechanical educa tion of tho youth, and in this has been found the desired remedy. Book-keep ers, druggists, engineers, printors, glass and iron workers, engravers, jewelers, wood workers, cotton spinners, silk spinners and weavers, and a great many others learn their trades, and learn them well, in these schools. The whole time of the youth is not taken up in work, but several hours each day are devoted to study, particularly that line of study that will tend to increaso their knowledge of tbe trado they are engaged in learning. For the gradu ates of these schools there is a demand at onoe, the best wages are offered, and tke moat desirable positions are open. They are young and intelligent, are accustomed to work, bavo bad their ambitions stimulated, and they have in the past acquittid themselves most satisfactorily. In Paris alone 31,000 minora are now employed, uotjone-half of whom have completed their school eouree, owing to the demand for the services of just such persons, and half time sohools are being established to enable them to ooaplete their educa tion after working hours. In tbe United States we have the same problem to grapple with, and we will have to seek its solution in tbe same way. There is no other conrse to purswe, aud our sg ricultural colleges, our training ships, oar busineas schools, Afi, indicate that that eolation is gradually and certainly finding adoption among ui. THE DUO. Aooording to a noted Spiritualist, who recently lectured in San Francisco, we are placed on this earth not to pre* pare for death but for life, and those who live aright will be always pr«f*r«d for death. With a human being there is no such thing U annihilation. What ia called dying among us is only the •ffort of the soul to break away from earthly barriers. The body ia a shell, and what hatching ia to tba bird dying is to tba confined sou). Death, tha speaker aaid, ia to be compared to a second birth from the corruptible body into the shining realms of immor tality. and tba moral conduct of this life determines the immediate condition of a future existence. There sre differ eat jooeditions of suffering end happi- DMS in the epirit world. Tha more pure a person livea here, the greater will be the degree of blias hereafter. Infants sre received at death by tender, loving angels, wbo bear them to a sphere of innocepce and purity, where they are educated by the angels of God. Suicide i> ft cowardly act, and beneflta not the one oemmitting it.

The future world is one of reality, with fruits, fields, forests, gar lens and every* thing to attract and enchant the mortal. Congenial souls there meet, know each other and have cognizance of tbe needs of those left on earth. This belief is as pretty as it is rational. THE PRESIDENTS IGE. The following arc the opening para graphs of the Message of President Hayes, delivered to Congress on Mon day, the Ist instant: FeUxrtr citizen* of the .Senate arul 11 in* of JteyntntHizu: The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under cir cumstances calling fur mutual congrat ulations and grateful acknowledgment to the liivtr cf all good for the larg* aud unusual measure of national pros perity which we enjoy. NATIONAL FINANCES. The most important events which have occurred in <ur public affairs since my last annual message to Con gress are connected with the financial operations of the Government, directly affecting tbe business interests of the country. I congratulste Congress on tbe successful execution of the resump tion act. At the time fixed and in the manner contemplatod by law U. 8 notes began to be redeemed in gold coin. Since the first of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presenta tion, and in all business transactions, public or private, in all parts ef the country they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon tbe Treasury for gold and silver iu exchange for U. S. notes has been comparatively small, and tbe voloitary deposit of ooin and bullion iu exchange t(ft notes has been very large. The ex cess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for U. S. notes over the amount of U. S, notes redeemed is about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie payment has been followed by a very great re vival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commeroislyworld, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other aations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, wbioh bas beeu paid in gold from tbe first of July last to November 15th, to tbe amoant of about $09,000,- 000. Since tbe resumption of specie payments there has been a marked and gratifying improvement of tbe public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only four per cent- interest, have been sold at or above par, sufficient to pay off that part of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by tbe process of refunding the debt since March Ist, 1877, is $14,- 297,177. Tbe bouds sold wero largely in small sums and tbe number of our citizens cow holding the public securi ties is much greater than ever before. Tbe amount ef natioual debt which matures within less than two years is 8729,121,700, of which *500.000,0C0 bears interest at the rate of fiv; per cent. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the is sue of four per cent, bonds; aud by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $11,000,003 can bo annually saved to tbe Treasury. To se cure this important reduction ot interest to bo paid by tbe Unitod State*, fait her legislation is required which it is hoped will be provided by Congrcs* during its present session. The coinage of gold by tho mints ol tho United States during the last fiscal year was 890.080,012. The coinage of silver dollars ciucc tho passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was 145,300,850, of which $12.- 900,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are r.ow in circulation, and $32,300,500 are still in the posses sion of tbe Government. The peudenoy of tbo proposition lur unity of action between the United States and the priueipal commercial na tions of Europe to effect a permanent system fer the equality of gold and sil ver aa tbe recognized money of the world, leads me to reccommond that Congress refrain from new legislation on tbe general subject. The great re vival of trade, internal aud foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. 1 would, however, strongly urge upon Congrats the importance of authoriz ing the Seoretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the proseut legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to main tain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheap er coin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined without limit, soon be come the sole standard of value, ar.d tlius (be Jc.-itw) is that the curreucv of both gold and silver shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognised money of the world Tha retirement from circulation of United States notes with capacity of I gal ten der m private oootraota is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and staple currency which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government aud the interest and secu rity of the people It is my firm con viction that the issue of legal tender paper mouey, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except m extreme urgency, is without warranty ot the constitution and a vio lation of sound financial principles. The issue of UuiUd States notes during the lata civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private individ uals, was unauthorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period o( time after the ac complishment of this purpose w»s not contemplated by the framers of the law under ahich they were issued. They antioipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided The policy of the United States, ateadily adhered to from the adoption of the constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and whan, torn necemity in the time of war, dtbts have been created, they Lave been paid eff on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view and fur this purpose it is recommended thai the exiting laws for accumalation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the cbjtcts or rates ol taxation is tecessary by Con gress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and Coffee, which will not er<* hance tbe price of those articles to the consumer and wiil aid several miliioc3 of dollars annually to the Treasury. THE 

SUPPRESSION OF POLYGAMY The continued and deliberate viola tion by a large number of the promi nent and influential citizens of the Territory of Utah, of th* laws of the United Mates, for tho pron-cuti >n ar. 1 punishment of polygamy, demand? the attention of every department of the Government This Territory has a population suflieie.Jt to entitle it to ad mission as a State, an 1 tbe general in terests of the nation aad Territory require its advance from tbo Territorial form of government to the ties and privileges of* a State. This important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah, in very considerable number, uphold a practice which is con detuned as a crime by tho laws of all civilized communities throughout the world The law for tho suppression of thii offence was enacted with greit un animity by Congress more ye.ira ago, but has remained until re cently a dead letter in the Territory if Utah, because of the peculiar difficul ties attending its enforcement. Tbe opinion widely rrevailoi among tbo citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The .Su preme Court ef the United States has decided the law to be within tho legis lative power of Congress, and binding as a rule of action for all who reside within tho Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesita tion lu its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should be amended, and in aid of the purpose in view, I recommend that more comprehensive and more search ing methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship i.i the Territories of the United States may be withheld or drawn from tho*" who violate or opposo the enforcement of the law on this subject. THE ELECTION"!* The elections of the pist year, though occupied only with State offi cers, have not failed to elicit on the political diacussions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of tho deep interest which the groat body of citizens take in the progress of the c >untry toward a more ge;ier:d and complete establish ment, at whatever cost, of universal freedom nnd security in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people; both in the sphere of national and State authority, I tind no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my la*t annual moSfa«e —that no temporary or administrative interests of Government, however ur gent or weighty, will ever display the zeal of our peopio in the dofenso of the primary rights of citizenship and that tho power of public opinion will over ride all political prejudices and all sectional and State attachments. In demauding that all over our wide ter* ritory the name nui character of citi zens of the United Sutes shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security an 1 respect I earnestly appeal to tin* intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of cvory part of the country, however much they may bo divided iti opinions on other political subjects to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrngo. I respoctfullv urgo upon Congress t® supply any defects in tho*e laws which experience has shown and which it has within its power to rem edy. I agtdu invoke co-operatioif of executive and legislative authorities of States iu this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious objection will thwart nr delay the com plete pacification of the country or retard the ger.oral diffusion of pros perity.
