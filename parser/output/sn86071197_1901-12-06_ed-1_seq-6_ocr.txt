HOUSTON TEXAS FRIDAY DECEMBER 6 1901 12 PAGES TODAY A REPUBLIC IN PORTUGAL While there Is no revolution Imminent In Portugal the feeling of the people hae grown to be very strong for a republic It is said that tln > Portuguese of all sta tions except the government officers and employes sre dissatisfied nith the government and do not hesitate If engaged In conversation even by a stranger to ex pross their preference for a republic All over the city of Oporto on the walls are scrawled Inscriptions of the words Vla lu republica If a leader strong enough and bold enough to arousi the lazy populace to action should arise a coup detat and tho establishment of a republic would be an easy matter Portugal for years has been dependent upon Oroat Britain but the Portuguese have no pnrtlcular nffec tlOn for the English They recognize and tho English have never made any pretense that anything else Is the case that the English protect them only for inteiosted motives A republic would give Portugal tho friendship of France But tho Portuguese would as londily ally themselves with Germany or Russia or the United States As long as they get the protection they need tho Portuguese caro llttlo from what country It comes Meanwhile tho British nlllanco continues and the king reigns simply because tho people am too Inert to arousa themselves to break up existing arrangements although they are dissatisfied with them Living Is so easy nnd bread olives snidfucs and wine ire obtained with so llttlo effort and basking In tho sun is so plons ant that tho people although revolutionary In senti ment In practice delight to enjoy the dolco far niente sweet doing nothing that liko the Italians of tho same latitude they hno converted into a life philosophy THE PRESIDENT AND THE TRUSTS A great many pooplo have been surprised by tho presidents attitude as shown In his mossago to con gress with rogard to the trusts An impression had gotten abroad parti from the piesldents general repu tation as a reformer and partly from what ho Indicated rather than said in his Minneapolis address before his accession to tho presidency that he would adopt 11 vig orous antitrust policy Many journals throughout tho country that admlro the president and oppose tho trusts have delighted themselves with forecasting tho fun ahead when Terrible Teddy would bogln opcr ationsln earnest as a trust buster The presidents mossngo how over to the most Im partial judgment has a plutocratic ring Referring to our present abounding prosperity the presidont says Such prosperity can uovor bo

SOUTHERN REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS The Philadelphia Times whllo expressing fraternal feeling toward tho South speaks In a recent editorial of tho bill of Representative Moody of Massachusetts as bringing before tho people an Irrepressible Issue Representative Moodys bill proposes to reduce the Southern representation In congress on account of the recent stiff 1 ago amendments In tho Southern States The Now York Press has for a long tlmo been clam oring for some congressman to lay its vlows before con gross Tho Press position Is In advanco of Crumpack gross Ily taking tho number of ncgious of voting age from the last census and subtracting from It the number of rin has i republican votes cast tho Press arrives at tho numbor of suffrages denied If the Press plan were carried out tho icprcsontutlon in congress of tho Southern States would be reduced as follows Present number Mi Cs Alabama a Arkansas 0 Florida a Georgia 11 Louisiana 6 Mississippi 7 South Carolina 7 Virginia 10 Z3 > Totals 58 Future number 5 4 1 5 2I I 8 10 The absurdity of this claim of tho Pross is shown by considering that first while most negroes vote tho re publican ticket some vote the democratic ticket sec ond there are many white republicans In tho South third many negroes do not vote In the South because they do not pay their poll tax nnd many do not voto although theywould bo altowod to bocanse they do not want to takf the trouble Under tho Press plan tho representation of no State would bo fixed After a light voto at nn election It would have to be decreased After a heavy voto at an election it could be tncreabod This would apply to Northern as well as to Southern States The Philadelphia Times talks of nullification nnd the Federal constitutionbeing violated Surely the su pi emo court of tho United States and not congress is the proper tribunal to settle that question But tho Times is not satisllod with the supreme court of tho Unltud States Which It nays while in tho end it can not escape Its plain duty has onco evaded tho Issue lu a case reaching It from Mississippi With journals and with people of this sort who in n question relating to the South will not accept the de cision of the Biiprotno court of tho United States whon It In in favor of tho South no argument is possible Such journals and such people arc cnomles of the South and oneralos of tho Union in which thoy seek to tovlvo sectional bitterness Representative Moody can nht hope to have his bill passed Tho only effect of it will bo thnt he will cause some trouble outside of congress by arousing tho ani mosity of the South hutcrs whose numbers aro yearly decreasing In the North and the Just indignation of tho South In congress If ho over gets his bill reported by a committee Representative Moody will bo voted down by n largo majority The Ppst has found no reason for changing its pre viously expressod opinion that it is inadvisable to move the Oram Lodge from Up long established home in Houston Yet it feels

continue to entertain it this city is fi e to acknowledge the prerogative of ihe order to suit itself in this matter The Post therefore congratu lates Waco upon its success in securing what Houston

EXCHANGE INTERVIEWS The Crawford Grit has a column headed WoodentEdi torials Many papers use the same matter but give no credit McGregor Obscrvtr The other papers referred to have not apparently got as much sand as Grit Recently we noticed large cabbage fields near Flatonia which so far as we could judge promised n good yield if the weather is favorable The farmers raise something else be sides cotton to make a living Many things may be said and written about crop diversification It will be of much benefit to tho farmers if they diversify their crops to avoid an over production of cotton and corn Yes crop diversification would be all right if the farmers could sell their products at home but they are compelled to send the largest part of the product to some other market The freight rates arc so high that very little ts left for the farmer when he has paid his ex penses We hope and are almost sure that this difficulty will be overcome in the near future Moullon Eagle Of course a home market is much to be desired hut some crops sch for instance as cabbage and melons when raised in large quantities must seek a foreign market but even so they can be raised with more profit and less liability to failure than so much cotton Many ot the products of di > crsified farming arc good shippers and as these products mature in Texas while the Northern sources of supply are still in the grasp of winter diversification should prove extremely profit able where pursued intelligently In time the diversification of Texas crops will also offer a tempting premium for the cs tahlishmcnt of canneries and thus the farmers who diversify will work out their own salvation and create the home mar ket for which they so ardently long v > The Wcathcrford Herald has installed 1 new pre s capa ble

companies either for tlie latter have always used it namely reinsurance hecause it is the only security and not The opinion of Attorney General Bell in reply to the in quiry of Secretary of State Tp3 recently of this city makes it possible I cite the reader to an article on page six in last Sundays Post entitled The Forfeiture of Charters can not prevent the immediate reincorporation of the convicted con cerns same stockholders may take qut permit under same title and continue business says the attorney general The caption in The Post too well defines its meaning to admit of further explanation but I will cite you to three in stances in my own experience where reinsurance saved all the policy holders and the stockholderstoo for that matter Some fifteen years ago the East Texas Insurance company the Sun Mutual and the Pelican both of New Orleans met with heavy losses and went to the wall but they immediately reinsured in a safe company which was easy to be found as I was sure of as 1 represented them at the time and saved their policy holders Hut a San Antonio and a Waco com pany each had a similar fate last year which forced them into an agreement to reinsure each other which the court at Dallas decided was a trust and the charters of both com panies were forfeited and their business thrown into the hands of a receiver appointed by the CiJurt leaving the policy holders out in the cold for the companies cauld not even col lect th money they bid cirawL So tit Use aiBt trust dolig business when given to either persons or corporations wb a capita 1 B < ° Sh to >

near a small town that has a cannery can not correctly comprehend or appreciate the importance of a wellregulated cannery as to what it may do for the town and surrounding country to the farmer the laborer the merchant the gardener the real estate owner and the banker It will prove a continual source of profit each year A successful cannery will double the value of real estate both in the town and country in a few years It will increase the sale of all kinds of goodsgroceries hardware farming implements etc It will put a large amount of money in circulation in the neighborhood and distribute it just where it is most needed and give the laborer and his family a chance to ram a considerable sum of money at a time of vear when many are usually idle To the farmer it will diversify
