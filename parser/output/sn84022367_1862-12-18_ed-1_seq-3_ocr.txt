On Saturday, Nov. 2, an explosion took place in the Walker Colliery, a pit about three miles from Newcastle, England. Sixteen men and bovs were killed. Tne London Tim s says : " The appearance above ground was that of the eruption ot a volcano. I ne spectators heard the sound of a tremendous rush of air up the working shaft, and, on looking in that direction, saw steam and a cloud of fragments flying from the mouth of the pit. " Below, the first warning they had was like the sound of a tinrrvjinf and ita effect on themselves was to throw them violently down. The seam of coal ifcoll was set on fire, and charred dead bodies were found close to the part which had ignited. In Other parts of the pit the hewers were truck down at their work, and five bodies were found in the ' broken.' One man had been blown a distance of thirty yards from the seara. The scene that presented itself to the exolorine party afterward was that ot a wreck On the one hand a man lay dead, on the other waa a horse on his knees, his ears pricked up, his eveballs still appeasing to glare with fright, though he was quite dead, and, had probably Wn killed instantaneously by the first and hnrk of the exnlosion. As soon as the shocK was heard, men in the remote parts of the pit ran for their lives, but the fire-damp overtook them and struck them down like shot." j Rcndino Boots bt Mail.

Howard s. 1 he troops advanced to their work at ten minutes before twelve o'clock, on a brisk run, the enemy's guns opening upon them a very rapid fire, wheu within musket range. At tbe base ot the ridge our troops were met by a terrible fire from the rebel infantry, who were posted behind a stone wall and some houses on the right of the line. This checked the advance of our men, and they fell back to a small ravine, but not out of musket range, i " At this time another body of troops moved to their assistance in splendid style, notwith standing large gaps were made in their ranks by the rebel artillery.

'I he concentrated hre of rebel artillery and infantry, which our men were obliged to face, 1 was too much lor them, and the center gave way in disorder, but afterwards they were rallied and brought back. From that time the fire was spiritedly car ried on, and never ceased until after dark. Gen. Franklin, who commanded the attack on the left, met with better success. He suc ceeded after a hard day's fieht in driving the rebels about a bp lie. At one time tae rebels advanced to attack him, butrwereh.mdsomely repulsed with terri ble slaughter, and with a loss of between 400 and 500 prisoners belonging to A. P. Hill's command. Gen.
