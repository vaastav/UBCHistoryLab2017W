CARROL!- CARROLL & McMILLEN, K. L. M XILLF.S. Editors and Publishers. CLEVELAND DOWNED. Charles F. Crisp, of Georgia, has been elected Speaker of the Fifty-second Con gress, and Hoger Q. Mills, with hit plat form of "absolute free trade, an income tax, and Cleveland at any cost,' is wal lowing in the dust. Of course Crisp's election means the continuance of the Democratic policy on the tariff, but more than that, it seems that G. Cleve land has received a slap in the face at the hands of the Xatioaal Democratic House of Representatives. Mills wa3 Cleveland's man, and made the tight on that issue. The fight was bitter and to the fiaish, and the an'i-Cleveland men seem to be in the majority. This is the first right for the Democratic nomina tion next year, and if this indicates any thing, the bloated apostle of tariff re form is do longer the patron saint of Democracy. The fight over the Speakership, which it took thirty ballots to decide, evident ly engendered enough feeling to insure more fractional .fights in this Congress. The Cleveland men will endeavor to re claim the the points they have lost, and an interesting time may be looked for on all questions in which they can divide. The turn of affairs will meet with the approval of Republicans, and can not fail to be injurious to the Democracy, Is these days when executive com mittees are endorsing men for positions, and requesting Representatives to pur sue such and such courses on certain questions, the erroneous impression has gained a footing that such endorse ments carry with them the backing of all the Republicans of the county. Such is not the case, nor do the3e gentlemen who happen to give endorsement in tend that it shall convey such a mean ing. Such an endorsement carries with it no more weight, nor is it entitled to any more weight than the endorsement of the same number of other Republi cans in good standing in the party. Senator Bkice, of New York, was allowed to take hts seat in the Senate, but Senator Sherman served notice on him that his seat would be contested. The way is now open for a contest if the Legislature of Ohio deems such a course advisable, and shall elect a suc cessor to Senator Payne. The Cyclone and Fayette Republican, of Washington C. H., is doing valiant service for the cause of Senator Sherman.- Last week it printed the reasons of the editors of the State, along with the leading editors of other States, for supporting Sherman. Its work will tell in January. Ever since the election the Foraker organs have yelled for their man to the exclusion of everything else. That may do for them, but the Sherman men have been quietly sawing wood, and will be in the lead when the votes are counted. Owing to the day in organizing the House, the President's message was not delivered to Congress until Wednesday morning, consequently too late for this week's issue. The man who tried to kill ' Russel Sage with dynamite was found to be a rank anarchist, named Hugh D. Wilson 

ADDITIONAL LOCAL. Ex-Sheriff O. E. FoiLKe has pur chased the interest of J. M. Maring in the Lantern Globe Works. The price paid is private.but the works will continue iu operation as heretofore, Mr. W. C. Bergunthal being the Principal in the charge of the business. We are glad to welcome Mr. Foulke here to engage in manufacturing and have no doubt his investment will prove profitable. Bell aire Independent. He is For Sherman. Hon. J. C. ileinlein has announced himself for Sherman for Senator. There has never at anytime been any doubt about the sentiment of the Republicans of this county on that questiom, and the announcement could just as well have been made a month ago as now, if he was waiting to learn the feeling of Repub licans. However, the decision of Mr. neinlein is as was expected and meets with general approbation. Sunday's Wheeling Register contain ed a cut and description of the new Dol lar Savings Bank, recently opened at Bridgeport. The building is handsome in appearance and modern in design. It is provided with all the latest contrivan ces for facilitating the banking business. Mr. R. R. Barrett, of this place, is Cash ier.. . a Peru as no other man is so often asked in regard to the, financial standing of men in general in the community as the editor of the local paper. As a rule he knows how to answer, too, for a man who pays up his newspaper subscription promptly, can be trusted in all things. The contrary is also probably true. Governor Campbell has granted a pardon to Edward Steele, who was sent up from this county in February of last year, to serve two years for grand larceny. Steele is said to be dying from dropsy of the heart. It will be remembered that he stole a railway mileage book at Barnesville.

At 9 o'clock last Saturday morning Mrs. Eliza beth E. Merritt, wife of Josiha Merritt, died, after protracted illness, at her home two miles east of here. Deceased was a middle-aged lady, held iu high esteem by all who knew her. She was a daughter of Wm. Gossett, Sr., who, with her hus band and several brothers and sisters, survive her. Interment on Monday at Morristown. The Standard Oil stave cutter, which has been in operation ou the farm of Bcuj. Watkins, has moved on James Niblock's land. There seems to have been, during the last contract, considerable contention between the company and haulers, four in number, who it appears have hauled to Lewis' Mills for transportation 139 more railroad ties and several hundred more staves than the mill sawed. While it Is probably a mistake, It is also rather a ridiculous dilemna. After the adjournment of the Bible Society on Wednesday evening last a number of the mem bers repaired to the home of Miss Clara Estep, surprising and quietly informing her that the gathering was in honor of her 17th birthday. Af ter this the time was spent in pleasant converse and the very eujoyable pastime of making and pulling taffy, until 11 o'clock. May she see many happy returns of the day. B. M. Loper and Wm. Lodge were at Cambridge last week In meeting with the Directors of the Guernsey Infirmary. Miss Ida Hatcher sent a few days last week with relatives in Barnesville, where she atteuded the social given by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Rogers, Thursday evening.

C. Hillcs, of Barnesville, an old time resident of this place, is very much regretted by a large circle of friends here, to whom he was well and favorably known. Also, the calling away of Mrs. Zella Pangell Lamdin, at Belmont, brought sadness to many of our young folks, as she, for several years prior to her marriage, was held in high esteem among them as a bright and amiable girl. Geo. Satterthwaite, near town, lost quite a val uable horse last week from a distemper, with which it had suffered for several weeks. - The Infirmary was on Tuesday, the 1st inst,, the scene of much commotion and many spectators, there being butchered there that day 32 hogs for use of the county Infirmary. Mr. Sidebottom be ing an ex-butcher himself, did most of the impor tant work. The supply is not sufficient for the year, but another killing will take place soon. M. 

COLERAIN. Win. McMillan, of Maynard, and Mr. Blocker, father-in-law of Edward Wells, were both stricken with paralysis Thursday. Owing to their advanced age there Is no hope of their recovery. The Y.

The farmers will cure more than the average, ex iet- ing a raise in bacon. Some of the people are agitating a change in the postoffice at Barton. It will probably cause a rip ple in the still water.

A vagrant, giving the name of Thomas Daley, was fined $5 and costs for being on a plain drunk, and was sent to St. Clairsville to work out his fine. Daley's partner was given ten minutes to get outside the corporation limits. Mayor Shannon desires us to state for.him that his reply of last week to the Xcwn Advertixer was confined to what he construed as being direct charges against himself ; and that he will pay no attention to the hints and inuendoes of last week's .Venn Admlixtr. He further requests of the Advrrli"ir that, if it meant to include him among the "officers " It alleges to be (to use itsexprcg sion) " In cahoot with the saloon element," that It say so in its very next issue. It is a well-known fact that every since the or dinance against the sale of Intoxicating drinks was passed by our council. It had been repeatedly and continuously violated. It Is also known that during the time this ordinance has been in force, few charges for violations have been made that the fines (six in nimibcn Imposed for violations, would, if added together, amount to less than the Dow license for one saloon, during the tli.ie. Who to blame for this state of affairs ? The council has performed Its duty in adopting the ordinance. The Mayor has performed his duty in fining and heavily fining those who have been found guilty his court, of violating the ordinance. Where then, does the blame rest ? Either the ordinance C.
