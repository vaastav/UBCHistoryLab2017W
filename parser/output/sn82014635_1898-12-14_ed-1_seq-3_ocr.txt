The Wichita hog market yesterday -was Strong, with a fairly lloeral supply of begs. Steady, a shade higher and strong were the early reports from other west ern markets and the local market "was of course affected by these first reports. Nevertheless, there -was at all times a Strong tone to the local market and it Was in most cases actuated by its own conditions. There was a better run of re ceipts than the day before, and all the offerings received in time for inspection and bidding- were at once snapped up. There was a good, strong demand all day "and all fat hogs of any land were sum marily absorbed and at the best market prices possible. There was a good sup ply of wagon hogs, one commission Arm alone disposing of 249 hogs in this di vision, and all the other brokers likewise having a liberal rtfn from this depart ment. The run of car hogs also was better than either the day before or for several days, and altogether the day was good in point of receipts. As for quality it may be said that the grade for the day v. is generally poor, the average of the c r hogs being undesirable, and mostly 2 ght weights. The average was only 220 p unds, and this is extra light, as com pared with the past week and more. The offerings came in In scattering lots, the fit lot to cross the scales being a car ! a of light hogs. From then on the dealings were altogether local trade up 1 1 a late hour in the afternoon. These offerings, however, were enough to ab E ru 'he attention of both buyers and c mm'ssion firms. They came in in large a" 1 small bunches and enlivened the mar ket all along until the car stuff com menced to arrive. This class of receipts when they did arrive came in liberally v. to a late hour and after the open mar ls had closed there arrived two more, t late for satisfactory daylight inspec t jn. The Dold company was the only buyer on the market, but they readily t ok in all hogs for sale, including the c.r stuff and the extra heavy run of wagon hogs. Their buying capacity was n it anywhere near exhausted, since they were on the market for as much more as Wat offered. Good hogs sold strong all fla't and this market compared very fa- rabjy with any others in the western r "2- RBPRESENTATrVB SALES. ;: i Dock. Av. Wt.

DISEASE OF PIGS. Oe great dread among swine breeders is tie disease called thumps, which some times attacks young pics. This is cura ble, if discovered in time, but prevention is ietter.

A more simple diet for her, coupled with plenty of exercise for both, will pre vent this disease. And I know of noth ing better for a cure, provided the pigs live long enough to be benefited thereby. Death usually results, however, when once they are attacked. I usually have finer pigs and larger litters from my sows In the fall. After harvest they are turned loose in the fields to glean what they can and are provided only with water, until farrowing time. I rare ly lose a pig- this way, and have some times found ten or a dozen little things several days old In the fleld, where the mother had made for them a nice nest in some protected nook. I once found such a litter in the remains of an old stock of buckwheat stray. They had been there only a few days, but nearly every pig lost its tail as a result of con tact with the irritating straw. The tails became sore and dropped off. The ears, too, were sore, but did not share thelfate of the caudel appendage. This straw or chaff will cause trouble every time, if pigs are allowed to nest in it. At least, this has been my experience. Of course! as soon as the pigs are born they are brought with the- mother to the barn, where they can be cared for, but until November they are kept out in the open air, being provided with a warm, dry place to sleep.

Cattle Receipts of cattle today were unusually small, but prices were barely steady, buyers showing no eagerness to tak hold, and asking con cessions in some cases, the clas of of ferings were fafrly good. Common, half fat steers brought 53.80114.25; fair to good shipping steers selling for 54.505.50, while prime to fancy cattle were disposed of at 55.60g6.05; stockers and feeders sold largely at 53.254.25; calves were active, common grades selling for J3.0O5.75, while prime lots brought 55.0036.75. Hogs Offerings of hogs were large, but the demand was active and prices ruled stronger, with sales largely 5c above yes terday's closing quotations. Hogs sold all the way from 53.25-g3.35 for the com moner droves up to 53.453.52 for good to prime lots, heavy packing hogs go ing for 53.30g3.40. The bulk offerings sold for 53.423.50, prices showing a marked narrowing tendency. The aver age quality was fair. Sheep A fair demand caused an ad vance of about 10c in choice lambs and choice sheep sold better, but heavy weights were again discriminated against. Most of the sheep were fed wes terns and they sold mostly at 53.WHJ. Yearlings were taken at 54.254.50, and lambs found buyers at 54.00-g4.35 for In ferior to prime lots, feeders selling at 54.40 ij4.75. Receipts Cattle 2,500; hogs 42,000; sheep 7.000. KANSAS CITY.

The cotton market opened steady with prices 1 to 2 points lower, with trading on rather narrow lines. Following the call there was a sharp slump of 5 to 7 points below last night's figures under liberal selling for southern and European account, which led to extensive local liquidation of cot ton purchased yesterday. Further loss was checked by the uncovering of limit ed investment buying orders, Wall street taking the lead in thl? class of business. Heavy receipts and irregularity at Liver pool were in part responsible for the early decline. Local bears followed up their advantage by hammering the January and March deliveries, which displayed a weak relation to the res: of the list. Later in the forenoon the market developed consid erable recuperative energy, the appear ance of a cold wave in the western por tion of the belt, reports of advancing spot market in the south and a stronger market for cloths In the cast tending to put new confidence in the bull faction. Sentiment was mixed and for a time prices see-sawed as bulls and bears alter natively obtained control. Speculation was spasmodically active and general. Scalpers sided with the bear crowd at the start, but subsequently transferred their attention to the long side. New York, Dec 13.

In dry goods the general demand for cotton goods of all descriptions has been well maintained to day. The only advances quoted, however, are confined to a few makes of low grade cambrics. Prints are strong in position and advances expected in some leading makes for more staple varieties. Regular print cloths sold today at 2Vc and wWe odd goods at 3 l;16c for 4Vlnch box square. Heavy brown cottons were strong in all leading makes and tending upward. Light weight fine yarn, gray goods, were alto strong. Ginghams were firm in price with fair sales.

The present series of the wool auction sales for this year closed today with a good attendance of buyers present. The closing tone was firm and prices realized today; were practically the best of the series. The number of bales carried over was 21,000; 57,000 were sold to home buyers and S0.000 to the continent. At the opening of the sales competition was active and Merinos firm. Fine cross breda were well maintained, while low, coarse stocks ruled irregular, at a fall of 5 per cent under the October figures. The demand for Merinos increased, the con tinent being specially eager buyers. After the first week of the sale medium scoured and grea6ies and scoured locks and pieces advanced 5 per cent and finer grades of wool were better supported. Yorkshire wools sold at full value and at an unap preciable advance over the prices obtain ed at the October sales. Cross-breds were well sought for since the opening, and especially medium and coarse. Heavy con tinental stocks were low, owing to the Buenos Ayres gold premium being against them and the fact that French buyers had turned their attention here at the same time. "Yorkshire wools Increased in de mand. Riverana new clip wools turned out more lighter and of dirtier quality than in 1SS7. South Austrial wools were heavier and of better quality. South Af rican stocks were in strong demand throughout.

UK I UP Federationists Will Divide on the Linotype Machinist WOMEN IN THE TRADES Financial Question Is Handled . With Tongs. Kansas City. Dec 13. The eighteenth, annual convention of the Amerjran Fed eration of Labor had hardly got down to business this morning when a recess till 2 o'clock was taken. The delegates were promptly in their seats at 9 o'clock for the second day's session of the conven tion. A flood of resolutions, touching a wide range of subjects, were Introduced by various delegates. In each case, without discussion, the resolutions were referred to appropriate committees, to be acted upon by them later. One resolution of particular Interest was that of Delegate Samuel Antlers, general treasurer of the National Garment Work ers' union. It called upon tne United States government to give Its clothing to union shops for manufacture Instead of sweat shops. The resolution was given to a committee. A telegram, was sent at once to Washington at once making the demand set forth in the resolution. THE LINOTYPE MACHINIST. James O'Connell of Chlctro, grand mas ter of the Machinists' union, offered a resolution giving the machinists jurisdic tion over ail men employed mechanically in the care of lynotype machines. There has been a controversy between the print era and machinists as to wnlch union should con;rol this particular labor. Tne resolution was referred to a committee. James Duncan, representative of the International Granite cutters, made a re port of his attendance as a delegate to the British trades congress of Great Brit ain last Augus.t Mr. Duncan declared that the English trades unions iiad made splen did progress in securing legislation look ing to reforms along different lines. E. P. Sabine, president of the National Garment Workers" union, and Samuel Autler, general treasurer, have called a mass meeting of all the garment workers of Kansas ity Wednesday night, when an effort to organize a local union of that organization will be made. 

ANTI-EXPANSION. C. J. Kent of Lincoln. Neb., Populist labor commissioner for Nebraska and a personal friend of Wiilian J. Bryan, Intro duced an anti-expansion resolution. The preambles embrace all the general argu ments made against the extension of the power of theUnlted States beyond the western hemisphere and denounce? the "ao-called policies of imperialism, expan sion and colonization." WOMEN AND HILDREN EMPLOYES. The most revolutionary measure was introduced by J. F. O'Sullivaa of Boston. It asks congress to impose an annual tax of 50 per cent of the total products of any firm or factory which employs women and children over eight hours per day, or employs children under the age of 14. The election of officers will not. occur till near the winding up of the convention's work and as yet there is not very much talk about candidates. Delegate Max Hayes, the leveland socialist, and a few followers are continuing their election eering against President omper's re-election, but apparently have not gained much headway since the -convention opened. President Gompers himself pays no at tention to this antagonism and his friends express no fear of his not -nelng re-elected. When the convention opened for the afternoon session Mr. ompers read a tele gram from Washington announcing the passage of the seaman's bill and the fact that it had gone to the president for his signature. The reading of the message was greeted with applause. T. J. Elderkln, secretary of the Sea man's union, announced that the bill was a victory for organized labor and would be of very great benefit to the seaman, although it was only a compromise meas ure. 

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL REPORTS. The report of the executive council of tho federation, read to the convention by James Duncan, declared for the unquali fied Indorsement of rhe bill now pending before congress granting the referendum to the residents of the District of Colum bia. The report also called attention to rhe indiscriminate use of the boycott by various trades unions without tne recog nition of the federation. It declared that hereafter no boycott would be recognized by the federation until it had been laid beforo tne executive council for indorse ment. 

.WOMAN AS MAN'S COMPETITOR. The most interesting debate of the con vention so far was brought on when the committee on resolutions reported un favorably the resolution of William A. Losle. of Kentucky, memorializing con gress to pass laws prohibiting e employ ment of women by the government in any capacity. The resolution wa Smsed upon a preamble asserting that "woman Is bod ily Incapable of continuous manual labor without injury to herseif and eventually to the coming generations of which she is expected to give birth, and her rightful place is in the home." Georsre T. McNeill, a veserafcle delegate from Boston, wao desires to be knows a a Christian Socialist, stirred the comrea tioa by aa eloquent protest against toe adoption of any sack resototlo. He de clared that the fact that woman was forced into the industrial field, and that site was working there by the side of man. was a terrible Indietmeat against our modern civilization This tate of affairs, be said was a part and parcel of our iniquitous grinding wage system. In conclusion Delegate McNeill -cajd that nothing would be possible for women un til the hope of tfee social democracy should be realized. After aa interesting debate the report of the committee was adopted and Joan F. 0SuSIrraa oSered a rasoteUoa urging the more general formatton f trade unions amoor wa? working women, as a aaeaas of bettering their caadkfoo. The refututios was referred to the resotetioas como&tee. A resolution was adopted asking tb ?ra4&eat to pay Jor tfee extra time oter etgte boors wMcs employes of the navy . departntent and arseaals werked dr.z the war.
