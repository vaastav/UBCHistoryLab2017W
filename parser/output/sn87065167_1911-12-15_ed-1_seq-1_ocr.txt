The adoption of the commission plan of government by the cities of Laurel and Gulfport during the past few days furnishes a striking illus tration of the growth of sentiment in favor of that plan among the larger ■cities and towns of the state. Although statutory authority for adoption of the commission plan has existed in Mississippi since 1906, only twt> cities, Clarksdale and Hatties burg, had adopted the plan up to the time elections were held at Laurel and Gulfport, and in both of the latter j * pities the commission system was giv- \ ' ■en overwhelming endorsement. i ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ Campaigns are now in progVess to -secure the commission plan at Green Yille and Meridian, two of the largest cities in the state, and indications are that the commission advocates will 1>e successful, although they are op posed by the political forces that have been in control for many years. Jackson is also hankering for the commission system, owing to the large measure of dissatisfaction ex isting among property-owners towards the present municipal government, •and it is quite likely that a campaign ! for change from the code chapter on municipalities to the commission plan will be launched after the first of the year. When the legislature meets in Jan- j ' uary several amendments to the sta tutes defining the commission method -will be presented for adoption, and in event of their passage it is more than likely that the municipal code chap ter will be discarded in nearly all of The larger cities and towns of the State.

V Jackson, Miss,, Dec. 15.—The rather astonishing fact that the United States government distributes among Fed eral pensioners in Mississippi each year more than twice the amount paid by the state to Confederate pension ers is revealed in figures given out at. Washington in connection with the Sherwood bill, now pending in Con gress for passage. The pension disbursements to vet erans of the Union army and navy, widows and servants, amounts to nearly $5,000 beenfleiaries. The state pension fund distributed among the Confederate soldiers and sailors, widows and servants, is $36b, 000, divided among about 8,000 bene ficiaries. It is understood that at the ap proaching legislative session an effort will be made to have the Confederate pension fund increased to $600,000 per annum. in of be to be at the •rife*-im1w»jiiniiM POST OFFICE IS BEING MOVED TO NEW QUARTERS Sunday Morning You Can Get Your office Officials Are More Than De ORDER COMES FOR THE USE OF HANDSOME NEW GOVERN MENT BUILDING.

In the many moves made by the postoffice during the last few years this is the first one that the pub lic has had any prior notice of and for that very reason there may be some among the skeptical, who though an ticipating this information, yet are wary in the novel knowledge of the fact. The last move the office made in that direction was accomplished overnight and many of its patrons on coming to work the next morning were dumfounded at its strange dis appearance and only after a diligent search did they locate the new mail house and have their anxiety, that maybe the office had left town, remov ed. On one occasion the office was moved without the knowledge of the clerks and they reported at the old site to find it uninhabited.
