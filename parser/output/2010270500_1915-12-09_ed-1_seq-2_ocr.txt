FOR GREATER REGULAR ARMY Citizen Soldiery Part of His Plan Problem of Commercial Mobilization Stated Disloyalty Among Cer tain Elements In Our Na tional Life Serious Menace to Peace. Washington, Doc. 7. Prcsldont Wil son today dollvorcd tho following mos sago to congress: Gentlemen of tho Congress: Slnco I last had tho prlvllego of addressing you on tho otato of tho Union tho war of nations on tho other sido of tho sea, which had then only begun to disclose Its portentous proportions, has extend ed ItB threatening and sinister scopo until It has swept within Its flamo some portion of ovory quarter of tho gloho, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered tho whole face of International affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as Btatesmon and peoples have nover boon callod upon to attempt before Wo havo stood apart, studiously nou tral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did wo havo no ;inrt or interest In tho policies which scorn to have brought tho conflict on; It was nocessary, If a universal catastropho was to bo avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of doBtructlvo war and that some part of tho groat family of nations should keep tho proccsaos of peaco alive, if only to prevent col lective economic ruin and tho break down throughout tho world of the In dustries by which Its populations aro fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of ttio solf-govornod nations of thlH hemlsphoro to redress, If pos sible, tho balanco of economic loss and confusion in tho other, If thoy could do nothing more. In tho day of readjustment and recuperation wo earnestly hopo and bolievo that thoy can bo of Infinite sorvlco. American Nations Partners. In this neutrality, to which tlmv wore bidden not only by their separate llfo and tholr habitual dotachmont from tho politics of Europe but also by a clear perception of International duty, tho BtatOB of America havo bo como conscious of a now and moro vital community Intorost and moral partnership In uffalrs, moro clearly conscious of tho many common sym pathies and Interests and duties which bid them Btand togothor. There was a tlmo in tho onrly days of our own great nation and of tho re publics fighting tholr way to Inde pendence in Central and South Amor lea when tho government of tho Unit ed StoicB lookod upon Itself as In somo sort tho guardian of tho ropubllcs to the south of her as against any en croachments or efforts at political con trol from tho other sido of tho wator; felt it its duty t play tho part oven without Invitation from thom; and I thlnk that wo can claim that tho task was undertaken with a truo and dis interested enthusiasm for tho frcodom of tho Americas and tho unmolested solf-governmont of her Indopondent peoples. But it was always difficult to maintain such a rolo without off on so to the prldo of the pooplos whoso froq dom of action wo sought to protect, and without provoking sorlouB miscon ceptions of our motives, and ovory thoughtful man of affairs must wel come tho altered circumstances of tho new day in whoso light wo now stand, when thoro Is no claim of guardian ship or thought of wards but, instead, a full and honorablo association as of partners betwoon oursolves and our neighbors, In tho Intorost of all Amer ica, north and south. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of tho states of Control and South Amorlca Is not altorcd. Wo retain unabated the spirit that has Inspired us through out the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by Prcsldont Monroe. Wo still mean always to make a common causo of national Indopondenco and of po litical liberty in America. Attitude Toward Mexico. We have been put to tho tost lu tho case of Moxlco, and wo havo stood the test Whether wo havo bonofltod Mexico by tho course wo havo pursued remains to bo aeon. Hor fortunes aro In her own hands. But wo havo at least proved that wo will not tako ad vantago of hor in her distress and un dertake to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. We will aid and bofriond Mexico, but we will not coerce hor; and our course with regard to hor ought to bo suffi cient proof to all Amorlca that wo seek no political suzerainty or solflsh control. Tho moral Is, that the statos of America are not hostile rivals but co operating friondo, and that tholr grow ing eonso of community of Interest, allko in matters political and In mat ters economic, 1b likely to glvo thom a now significance as factors In inter national affairs and In tho political history of tho world. Drawing the Americas Together. There Is, I venturo to point out, an espoclal significance just now attach ing to this whole matter of drawing tho Americas togothor in bonds of hon orablo partnership and mutual advan

In tho por formance of tlicso tnsks I bollovo tho AraorlcaB to bo destined to play tholr parts togothor I am Intorctind to fix your attention on this prospect now bocauso unless you take It within your vlow and pormlt tho full slgnlllcanco of It to command your thought 1 can not find tho right light In which to Bet forth tho particular matter that lies at the very front of my wholo thought ns I addrcsB you today. I moan na tional defense No ono who really comprehends tho spirit of tho groat pcoplo for whom wo aro appointed to Bpcak can fall to porcoive that tholr passion Is for peaco, their genius host displayed In tho practlco of tho arts of peaco. Great democracies aro not bolllgorent. Thoy do not sock or dcslro war. Tholr thought is of Individual liborty and of tho frco labor that supports llfo and tho unconsored thought that quickens It. Conquest and dominion aro not In our reckoning, or agrecablo to our principles. But Just because wo de mand unmolested development and tho undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, wo rosont, from whatovor quarter it may como, tho ag gression wo oursolvos will not prac tlco. Wo Insist upon security In prose cuting our solf-choson lines of nation al dovolopmont. Wo do moro than that. Wo demand It also for others. Question of Preparedness. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. Wo regard war moroly as a means of assorting tho rights of a pco plo against nggrosslon. And wo aro as florcoly Jealous of coorclvo or dic tatorial powor within our own nation as of aggression from without. Wo will not maintain a standing army ex cept for usos whlt'i aro as nocessary In times of peaco as In times of war; and wo shall always soe to It that our military peaco establishment Is no larger than is actually and continu ously needed for tho uses of days In which no enemies movo against us. But wo do bollovo In a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to tako caro of thomsolvos and of the govern ments which thoy havo set up to servo thom. But war has nover been a moro mat tor of mon nnd guns. It Is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens aro over to fight effectively upon a suddon summons, thoy must know how mod ern lighting Is dono, nnd what to do whon tho summons comes to render thomsolvcB lmracdlatoly avallablo nnd Immodlatoly effective. And tho gov ernment must bo tholr servant In this mattor, must supply thom with tho training thoy noed to take caro of thomsolvcB and of It. It Is with theso Ideals in mind that tho plans of tho dopartmont of wnr for moro adequato national dofonso woro conceived which wlil bo laid bo foro you, and which I urgo you to snnctlon nnd put Into offoct ns soon as thoy can bo properly scrutinized and discussed. Thoy soom to mo tho essential first stops, nnd thoy scorn to mo for tho prosont sufficient. Larger Army Plan. Thoy contomplato an Increase of tho standing forco of tho regular army from Its prosont strength of 5,023 officers nnd 102,985 enlisted mon of all sorvlcos to a strength of 7.13C ofllcors and 134,707 enlisted mon, or 141,843, all told, all sorvlcos, rank and fllo, by tho addition of fifty-two companies of coast nrtlllory, fiftoon companies of engi neers, ton regiments of Infantry, four roglmontB of flold artlllory, and four aero squadrons, boBldos 750 ofllcors roqulred for a groat varloty of extra sorvlco, especially the all Important duty of training tho citizen forco of which L shall prcsontly speak, 792 noncommissioned ofllcors for Borv lco In drill, rocrultlng and tho llko, and tho nocessary quota of en listed mon for tho quartermaster corps, tho hospital corps, tho ord nanco dopartmont, nnd other Blmllar auxiliary sorvlcos. Thoso aro tho ad ditions nocossary to rondor tho army adoquato for Its prosont duties, dutlos which It has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and bor ders and at our Interior army posts, but also In tho Philippines, In the Hawaiian Islands, at tho isthmus, and In Porto IUco. By way of making tho country rjady to nssort somo part of Its roal powor promptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion ariso, tho plan also contemplates supplementing tho army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi zens, raised In Increments of 133, 000 a year throughout a period of throo years. This It 1b proposod to do by a process of enlistment un der which tho sorvlcoablo mon of tho country would bo askod to bind thom boIvob to sorvo with tho colors for pur poso of training for short porlods throughout throo years, and to como to tho colors at call at any tlmo throughout an additional "furlough" porlod of throo years. This forco of 400,000 men would bo provided with porsonal accoutromonts as fast ub enlisted and tholr equipment for tho field mado roady to bo sup plied at any time.

STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE The department of war contemplates an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of 5,023 officers and 102,985 enlisted men to 7,130 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, and supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens. It will be t the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency. The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. It Is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine. It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go. We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the Income taxes. We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the courso we have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America Is not altered. which plans long matured shall bo carried out; but It does mako dellntto and explicit a program which has horotoforo bcon only Implicit, hold In tho minds of tho two committees on naval affairs and disclosed In tho de bates of tho two houses but nowhero formulated or formally adopted. It soems to mo vory clear that It will bo to tho advantago of tho country for the congross to adopt a comprehen sive plan for putting tho navy upon a final footing of strength and effi ciency and to press that plan to com pletion within tho next flvo years. Wo havo always looked to tho navy of tho country as our first and chief lino of defense; wo havo always scon It to bo our manifest course of pru donco to bo strong on tho seas. Year by year wo have been creating a navy which now rankB vory high Indeed umong tho navies of tho maritlmo na tions. Wo should now deflnltoly do tormlno how wo shall comploto what wo havo begun, and how soon. Tho program to bo laid before you contemplates the construction within live years of ton battleships, six bat--tie crulsors, ten scout crulsors, fifty destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, elghty-fivo coast submarines, four gun boats, ono hospital ship, two ammuni tion Bhlps, two fuel oil ships, and ono regular repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number wo shall tho first year provldo for tho construction of two battleships, two battle crulsors, three scout cruisers, flften destroyers, Hvo fleet submarines, twonty-tlvo coast submnrlncs, two g'unboats, and ono hospital ship; tho second year, two battleships, ono scout cruiser, ton de stroyers, four fleot submarines, fifteen coast submarines, ono gunboat, and ono fuol oil ship; tho third year, two battleships, ono battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, flvo destroyors, two Hoot submarines, and fifteen coast submarines; tho fourth year, two bat tleships, two battle crulnors, two scout crulsors, ten destroyors, two fleot sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, ono ammunition ship, and ono fuol oil ship; and tho fifth year, two battlo ships, ono battlo cruiser, two scout cruisers, ton destroyors, two fleot sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, ono gunboat, ono ammunition ship, and ono repair ship. Moro Men for the Navy. Tho secrotary of tho navy Is asking also for tho lmmedlato addition to the porsonnol of tho navy of 7,500 sail ors, 1,200 approntlce seamen, and 1,500 marinos. This Increase would bo BUfficIont to caro for tho ships which aro to bo comploted with in the fiscal year 1917 and alBo for tho numbor of mon which must bo put In training to man tho ships which will bo completed early In 1918. It Is also nocoBBary that tho numbor of mldBhip mon at tho Naval academy at Annap olis should bo increased by at least three hundred If this full program should bo car ried out wo Bhould have built or build ing In 1921, according to tho estimates of survival and standards of classifi cation followed by tho genoral board of tho dopartment, an offectlvo navy consisting of 27 battleships, of tho first lino, G battlo crulsors, 25 battleships of tho socond lino, 10 armored cruls ors, 13 scout crulsors, 5 first-class crulsors, 3 second-class crulsors, 10 third-class crulsors, 108 destroyers, 18 floet submarines, 157 coast submarines, G monitors , 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, 15 fuol ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vossols, 8 ves sels of special types, and 2 ammuni tion ships. Thlo would bo a navy fit ted to our needs nnd worthy of our trndltions. But armies and Instruments of war aro only part of what has to be con sidered if wo aro to consider tho su premo mattor of national soltsufficlon cy nnd security In all Its aspects. Thoro aro other groat matters which will be thrust upon our attention whothor wo will or not. Thero Is, for oxamplo, a very pressing quostlon of trado and shipping Involved In this great problom of national adequacy. It Is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and dovol opmont that wo should havo a great merchant marine. It Is high tlmo wo repaired our mis tako and rosumod our commercial inde pendence on tho seas. Need of Merchant Marine. For It Is a question of Independ ence. It othor nations go to war or seek to hamper each other's com merce, our merchants, it scorns, aro at their morcy, to do with as they please. Wo must uso their ships, and use thom as they determine. Wo have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handlo our own commerce on the Boas. Our Independence ts provin cial, and Is only on land and within our own bordors. We are not llkoly to bo permitted to use even tho ships Action of Meteors. Writing In Nature of tho last display of Perselds, as obsorvod In England, Mr. Donnlngs, tho well-known author ity on meteors, states that thoso bod ies exhibited a distinct dlfforouce In velocity, apart from what might bo in duced by differences In position and distance. "Two meteors appearing In very noarly tho same roglon gave In several instances an apparent speed essentially dissimilar, though presum ably at tho same holght or very noar ly so." of other nations In rivalry of their own trado, and aro without means to oxtend our commerce oven where tho doors aro wldo opon nnd our goods desired. Such a situation Is not to bo endured. It is of cnpital Import ance not only that tho United States Bhould bo Its own carrier on tho seas and enjoy tho economic Independence which only an adequato merchant ma rine would glvo It. but also that tho Amorlcan hemisphere as a wholo should enjoy a like Independence nnd self-sufficiency, if It is not to bo drawn Into tho tangle of European affairs. Without such Independence tho whole question of our political unity nnd solf-dctormlnatlon Is vory seriously clouded and complicated Indeed. Moreover, wo can develop no truo or offectlvo American policy without ships of our own not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and carrying much more; creating friend ships and rendering indispensable services to all Interests on this sido tho water. Must Provide Ships. With a vlow to meeting theso pressing necessities of our commorco and availing ourselves at tho earliest possible moment of tho present un paralleled opportunity of linking tho two Americas togothor In bonds of mu tual Interest and service, an oppor tunity which may nover return again If wo nilsa It now, proposals will bo mado to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to bo owned and directed by tho govern ment similar to thoso made to tho last congress, but modified In somo essen tial particulars. I recommend theso proposals to you for your prompt ac coptnnco with tho more confidence because ovory month that has elapsed slnco the former proposals were made has mado tho necessity for such action moro and moro manifestly Imperative. That noed was then foreseen; it Is now acutely felt and everywhere real ized by those for whom trade is wait ing but who can find no convoyanco for tholr goods. I am not so much in terested In the particulars of tho pro gram as 1 am In taking lmmedlato ad vantago of tho great opportunity which awaits us If wo will but act In this cmorgoncy, . Tho plans for tho armed forces of tho nation which I have outlinod, nnd for tho general policy of adequato preparation for mobilization and do fonso, lnvolvo of courso very largo ad ditional oxpondlturcs of money ex penditures which will considerably ex ceed tho estimated rovonues of tho government. It Is mado my duty by law, whonover tho estimates of ex penditure exceed tho estimates of rovenuo, to call tho attention of tho congress to the fact and suggest any means of meoting tho deficiency that It may bo wiso or possible for mo to suggest. I am roady to believe that it would bo my duty to do so'ln any case; and I fool particularly bound to speak of tho mattor whon It appears that the deficiency will arise directly out of tho adoption by tho congress of meas ures which I myself urge It to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly of tho present state of tho treasury and of the fiscal problems which the next year will probably dlscloso. State of the Finances. On tho thirtieth of Juno last thero was an avallablo balanco In the gen eral fund of tho treasury of $104,170, 105.78. Tho total estimated receipts for tho year 1916, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by tho last congross will not bo extended beyond Its prosont limit, tho thirty-flrst of Decomber, 1916, and that tho present duty of ono cent per pound on sugar will bo discontinued after tho first of May, 1916, will bo $670,365,500. The balance of Juno last and these estimated revenues como, therefore, to a grand total of $774, 435,605.78. The total estimated dis bursements for tho present fiscal year, Including $25,000,000 for tho Panama canal, $12,000,000 for probablo de ficiency appropriations, and $60, 000 for miscellaneous debt redomp tlons, will be $753,891,000; and the balanco In the general fund of tho treasury will bo reducod to $20,644, 605.78. Tho emergency revenue act, If continued boyond Its present time lim itation, would produce, during the half year thou remaining, about $41,000, 000. Tho duty of ono cent por pound on sugar, it continued, would produce during tho two months of the fiscal year remaining after the first of May, about $15,000,000. These two sums, amounting together to $56,000,000, If added to tho rovenuos of the second half of tho fiscal year, would yield the treasury at the end of tho year an avallablo balanco of $76,644,605.78. Tho additional revenues roqulrod to carry out tho program of military and naval preparation of which I havo spoken, would, as ut present estimated,

Thoso figures, taken with tho flguros for tho present fiscal year which I havo already glvon, dlscloso our finan cial problom for tho year 1917 As suming that tho tnxos Imposed by the eraorgoncy rovenuo net and tho pros ont duty on sugar aro to bo discontin ued, and that tho balanco at tho close of tho present fiscal year will bo only $20,044,605.78, that tho disbursements for tho Panama canal will again bo about twenty-five millions, and that the additional expenditures for tho army and navy aro authorized by tho congress, tho deficit in tho gcnornl fund of tho treasury on tho thirtieth of Juno, 1917, will bo nearly two hun dred and thirty-five millions To this sum at least fifty millions should bo added to represent a safo working bal anco for tho treasury, nnd twolvo mil lions to Includo tho usual deficiency estimates In 1917; nnd thoso additions would mako a total doflclt of somo two hundred and ninety-seven millions. If tho present taxes Bhould bo continued throughout this year and tho noxt, however, thoro would bo a balanco In tho treasury of somo soventy-slx nnd a half millions at the end of the pres ent fiscal year, and a deficit at tho end of tho noxt year of only somo fifty millions, or, reckoning In sixty-two millions for deficiency appropriations and a safo treasury belanco at tho end of tho year, a total doflclt of somo ono hundred and twolvo millions. Tho obvious moral of tho figures Is that It Is a plain counsel of prudonco to con tlnuo all of tho preesnt taxes or their equivalents, and confine ourselves to the problem of providing $112,000,000 of now rovenuo rathor than $297,000, 000. New Sources of Revenue. How shall wo obtain tho new rove nuo? It seoms to mo n clear dictate of prudont statesmanship and frank financo that In what we aro now, I hope, to undertake, wo should pay as wo go. Tho pcoplo of tho country are entitled to know Just what burdens of taxation thoy aro to carry, and to know from tho outset, now. Tho now bills should bo paid by internal taxation. To what sources, then, shall we turn? This Is so peculiarly a question which tho gentlemen of tho house of representatives aro expected under tho Constitution to propose an answor to that you will hardly expect mo to do more than discuss It In very gen eral torms. Wo should be following an almost universal example of mod ern government If wo were to draw the greater part or oven tho wholo of tho revenues wo need from tho In come taxes. By somewhat lowering tho present limits of exemption and the figure nt which tho surtax shall begin to bo Imposed, and by Increasing, step by stop throughout tho present gradu ation, tho surtax Itself, tho Income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balanco tho books of tho treasury at tho end of tho fiscal year 1917 without any whero making the burden unreason ably or oppressively heavy. Tho pro clso reckonings aro fully and accurate ly set out in tho report of tho secro tary of the treasury which will bo Im mediately laid boforo you. And thoro are many additional sources of revenue which can Justly bo resorted to without hampering tho in dustries of tho country or putting any too great charge upon Individual ex penditure. A ono per' cent tax per gallon on gasoline and naptha would yield, at tho prosent estimated pro duction, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents por horse powor on automobiles and Internal explosion engines, $15,000, 000; a stamp tax on bank checks, probably $18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents per ton on pig Iron, $10,000,000; a tax of 60 cents per ton on fabricated Iron and steel, probably $10,000,000. In a country of groat Industries like this it ought to be easy to distribute tho bur dens of taxation without making them anywhere bear too heavily or too ex clusively upon any ono sot of parsons or undertakings. What Is clear Is, that the industry of this generation should pay tho bills of this generation. I havo spoken 'to you today, gentlo mon, upon a single theme, tho thor ough preparation of tho nation to caro for its own security nnd to mako sure of entire freedom to play tho impartial role in this hemisphere and in the world which wo all bollovo to havo been providentially assigned to It. I have had In my mind no thought of any Immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations with othor nations. We aro at peaco with all tho nations of the world, and there Is reason to hope that no question in controversy between this and other governments will load to any serious broach of amicable relations, grave as somo differences of attltudo and policy havo been nnd may yet turn out to bo. I am sorry to say that tho gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own bordors. There are citizens of tho Unltod States, I blush to admit, born under othor flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and oppor tunity of Amorlca, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national lfo; who have sought to bring tho authority and good namo of our government Into contempt, to destroy our Industries wherever thoy thought It effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to dobase our politics to tho uses of foreign Intrigue. Their number is not great as compared with the wholo number of those sturdy hosts by which our nation has been enriched In recent generations out of vlrllo foreign stocks; but It Is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have mado It neces sary that we should promptly make use of procosscs of law by which we may be purged of tholr corrupt dls tompors.

A llttlo whllo ago such a thing would have scorned Incredible Becauso It was Incrediblo wo mado no preparation for It. Wo would havo been almost ashamed to proparo for It, as If we wero suspicious of oursolves, our own comrades nnd neighbors! Hut the ugly and Incredible thing haB actual ly como about and wo aro without adoquato federal laws to deal with It, I urgo you to enact such laws at tho earliest posslblo moment and fool that In doing so 1 am urging you to do nothing less than save tho honor and self-respect of tho nation. Such crea tures of passion, disloyalty, nnd an archy must bo crushed out. Thoy are not many, but thoy aro infinitely malignant, and tho hand of our power should closo over them nt once. Thoy havo formed plots to destroy proporty thoy havo entered Into conspiracies against tho neutrality of the govern ment, thoy havo sought to pry Into ovory confidential transaction of tho government In order to sorvo Interests alien to our own. It Is possible to deal with theso things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms In which thoy may bo dealt with. Are Disgrace to the Nation. I wish that It could be said that only a few men, misled by mlstakon sontlmonts of nlleglnnco to tho govern- i monts under which thoy wero born, had boon guilty of disturbing tho self- i possession and misrepresenting the temper nnd principles of tho country during theso days of terrible war, I when It would seem that every man ' who was truly an American would Instinctively mako It his duty and his pride to keep tho Bcales of Judgment oven and provo himself a partisan of no nation but his own. But It cannot. Thoro are somo mon among us, and many resident abroad who, though born and bred In tho United States ' and calling themselves Americans, I havo so forgotten themsolves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate sympathy with one or tho other sido In the great European con flict above their regard for tho peaco and dignity of the United States. They also preach and practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach cor ruptions of tho mind and heart; but I should not speak of others without also speaking of theso and expressing tho oven deeper humiliation and scorn which ovory self-possessed nnd thoughtfully patriotic American must fool when ho thinks of them and of tho discredit thoy uro daily bringing upon us. Whllo wo speak of tho preparation of tho nation to mako sure of her security and her effective power wo must not fall Into tho patent error of supposing that her real strength comes from armaments and mere safe guards of written law. What Is moro Important Is, that tho Industries and resources of tho coun try should be avallablo and ready for mobilization. The transportation problem Is an exceedingly serious and pressing ono In this country. Thoro has from time to time of lato been reason to fear that our railroads would not much longor bo able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and co-ordalned. I suggest that it would bo wiso to provldo for a com mission of Inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of tho whole ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered are as serv iceable as thoy might be in the solu tion of tho problem. It 1b obviously a problem that lies at tho very founda tion of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry ought to draw out every clrcumstanco and opinion worth con sidering and wo nped to know all sides of tho matter If we mean to do any thing In the field of federal legislation. Regulation of Railroads. No one, I nm sure, would wish to tako any backward stop.
