GESGAINS CANNTLEADI Report From Maron That Law yer Backs Campaign Foreign Policy Is Signilcant. With the visit of Justice Charles -L Hughes to Marioa and his an winsa= t that the4olution of in, teraUomal policy wil be in accord am with Ha&di~g's statements in the etesr of the campain, a re vim et the rumpW that lughes will h'the next Sedretary of State has seIine In strength Tht Justlee Hughes is among those who' are seriously considered is well u1Wrtood. However, there is a quo. tien L.bether Justice Hughes would be willing to be in the Cabinet in vtew of the fact he is now making enOrImous foes at his law practice. tn some respee'ts those who are op posed to putting Root in the Cabinet aUe pleased to see the recurr, nco of the Hughes talk. They would profer Hughs to Root. The statement of Hughes at Marion is taken here to mean that were he Secretary of State he would be will ing to work along the lines of forma tion of an association of nations as proposed by Harding in his campaign 8p14ches. Any insistence on the league by him would gain him the opposition of the irreconcile.bles. ROVr NOT ABANDONED. The prevailing, idea that Elihu Root is out of consideration for the Cabinet is said on good authority not to be entirely correct. The iecent long talk between Senator Fall and Root is viewed in some quarters as having for its object a better understanding of the views of Root on international Questions for the benefit of both 1arding and the irreconcilables. In other words, there is said to be an effort on the part of those friendly to Root to dissipate the Idea that if he were Secretary of State he would try to thrust the United States into the league, The irreconcilables have opposed Root on this ground. In sources close to Harding it is mid that there is likely to be A strong revival of the movement for Roct. and that he must not he considerod out of it. The talk of Senator Knex for the premiership is still upler most. Other Cabinet gossip today varies little from that- which has prevailed for some days. It may be said, how ever, that some of the friends ' of 1overnor Lowden are showing a strong disposition to have hin put into the Cabinet. and are urging him on Senator Harding. That Governor rowden is not anxious to enter the ,labinet and would prefer the Paris or London post is generally under stood. LABOR BOOSTING NOLAN. In organised labor circles there i; much talk about the Secretaryship for Labor. Congressman Nolan b CaJlifornia is said to be in the lead. William Hutcheson, of Indiana, head of the carpenters international union, is being strongly backed. An interesting phase of this is that Nolan is looked on as friendly to Gompers and Hutcheson is regarded as an anti-Gompers man. Nolan has the support of Senator Iliran'M John son of California, wno is not only friendly to him on old-time personal and political grounds, but who see In the nomination of Nolan a chance to help head off Hoover. If Hoovu: went into the Cabinet he would be credited to California and this would displease Senator Johnson. SHRINERS TO SAVANNAH. LOS ANGELES. Cal.. Dec. 11.- Im perial Pdtentate Ellis L.
