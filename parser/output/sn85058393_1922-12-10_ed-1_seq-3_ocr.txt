MAXIMILIAN HARDEN Gormanv's Forrmost Publicist. (Copyright 19 2 2. by Tho Standard- Examiner.) BERLIN, Dec. H. On the grave of Lincoln you Citizen Georges Clemenceau made a vow to en deavor to follow the example the great Abraham set for all future statesmen. He who answers you here does not belong to those who deny your honest Intentions, or believes your win determined by hatred and tigor like destruc tlve fury I always have admired o'our hard and steel energy and intrepid defiance lihlured by the vvill-o'-the-w lsp of the passing popularity and who In his coun try's darkest -tour proved himself It.s strongest personality. Always have I admired the man who in is"i in the national assembly at Bordeaux protested against Ger many's annexation of Alsace Lorraine and. as the only sur vivor of that gathering brought he lost provlndeS hack there eight years later winning the right to tho lnserlptlnn on Mon In every communis of his country. "Io cltoyen Georges Clemen ceau, a blen marito do la patrie." The physical courage of an old man of 80 in crossing the At lantic and going from town to town defending Franco also Is admirable. For myself I um sure the senate's exceptions do not justify tho fjerman press In term ing your trip a fiasco that will rebound to Germany's advantage. Because I consider you strong despite your age I think It noocs sary to declnro before your hearers that you are laboring under a disastrous and danger ous delusion. The smile quivering under your moustache. Indicates you would not have been surprised at an oven more rude answer coming from Germany But aren't you reproached in your own country for great blunders? Has It not been your fato to bo Judged as unfit to rise to the presidency because your oven people consider you useful only as B steel Ihatrurrh nt Of war? Tho same would have been the fate of Lincoln had he lived, and after victory, continued to treat the southern states as deadly enemies. But the patriarch you praised at Springfield. Ill , was made of dif ferent stuff In Iron will power, humor and ready wit he was at least your equal, Clemenceau. yot lh every fibre of his being ho was a humane benevolent demo crat He kept alive fnlth In vlc tory tnrougn the darkest hours but from Sumter to Richmond his air always was for reconcilia tion and lasting peace. Will you now clnso your ears as at Versailles where perhaps it was eXoUsabiC to the voice of a great people who always will be your nelglihiM-a and who won't consent to hobble lamely through centuries? What Oormany must :ind can pay as an Indemnity Is a dispassionate business matter such as is settled dally between private debtors and cn-citors with : thorough examination of books I nt without rattling tho sword. And once uni'cd the new world won't refuse the necessary credits to this strong concorn which could effect the economic unity of Europe This, Citizen Clemenceau. is the way Lincoln's memory should point to you.

Former Preach High CoMmlssloiuSf to tho United states. (Copyright, 1922, by The Standard Examiner.) PARIS, Dee. j --The fruits Of lc tory have been abandoned- While It In not yet known whether the Turks will accept the proponnl that they retain tho Dardanelles, guaranteeing free use to all nations, the fact that It was offered, Is a confession of weak ness. International control of tho Btralta, one of tho outstanding poli cies of the war. thuM passes from tho domain of Tacts to the domain of word In every single one of his strong speeches In America Clemeneenu shows how forgetfulness has envelop ed the world And how can we won der that many things have been for gotten on the other side of tho At lantic when we seo other nations which spilt the beat of their blood Ig noring the plainest lesions of the war only four years aft r the armistice. WHAT TURKEY DID. The military and political role play ed by the straits in the world strug gle was tremendous. By giving refugo to the Goben and the lireslau in Aug ust, 1914, and later by tho use of mines and forts closing them to mili tary and commercial traffic the Turks changed tho whole conditions of the war. This action decide, ', u l garla to throw her lot with Germany, compelled Greece's long hesitancy, and allowed the Rumanian collapse. Worse yet, by Isolating Russia It prepared tho way for bolshevism and Broft Lltovsk. Closing the straits olloweu transfer of half a million troops from thi eastern to the western front m 1917-18. bringing tho British disaster In I'lcardy In March, 1918; tho French disaster at Chomlnle Dames in May. Add to these the thousands who fell In Galllpoll and Saloniki and recall what this all meant in pro longing the vv;ir. On tho very' Jay of victory an In ternational watch over the straits was seen by all clear-headed Europeans to be as necessary as watch over the Rhine. I'ROPOSD ( OXDF.MNFJX Now what's the present proposal? It is vague and means nothing and Is an equivocal compromise which can only be a perpetual temptation to trie n.-rtlons bordering tho Black and tho Aegean seas No reason existed ror this capitulation to sovietlsm. The in terallied agreement of September 25 provided genuine freedom of mo straits, yet everyone now hastens fo accept the solution suggested by ex perts It is accepted under most hu miliating conditions After Ismet Pasha refused to explain himself, after Tchitcherln reiterated his provo cative insolences, the powers wield. If war begins again tomorrow the same causes which existed In 1912 are oe lng reproduced and the allies must be prepared to renew their bloody sac. rlflccs In 1916. Under the present arrangement the French will leave Gallipoll and the British. Chanak. The blindest cannot fall to realizo the threats existing The Turco-Russo alliance negotiated In July. 1919. and signed in March. 1921, was completed! by the Russo-German treaty of 1922 and was openly flouted before the Lausanne conference began. When the Turk stops talking the Bolshevik speaks for both. Their interests have ', ben pooled and tho program is com mon to both. Foreigners cannot grt into Russia European colonics at Brusa and elsewhere havo been mo lested both as to property and per On. Grave disquietude reigns in Con stantinople. It Is tho revenge of the Crescent and tho Scimitar against the cross and western civilisation. The Turks are skicere when they say thay do not want the French among them. I However Lausanne results, whether, the Turks and Russlens accept the weak proposals mado to them, the result Is the same. Our occidental prestige in the Orient is destroyed HOW could it be otherwise In view of the incoherent preparations of tho powers for the conferences of Lon don and Brussels demonstrating thr eagerness of the governments which won the war to lose the peace. Polncare went to Ixmdon Friday 1 without any dtflnlto program for in agreement between the French and British. The Belgians aro determined 1 not to ossumo the initiative. The Italians do not seem to know yet what they desire, and while Fascist! prin ciples are clear enough, their appli cation methods are vague. Can gold marks spring, full armed like Mi nerva, from this unfilled soil? I am! not sure that even enthusiasts can 1 be convinced of that. For myself, I am hopelessly unconvinced. ' I oo I THE
