The statistics showing the rates of mortality In the army nrovaJ " Ju;y. ,H'1 w August, inclusive, the" annual death rate in our army was T 2-10 in every hundred men; of whom rmt Tier cent, were killed in action, while 8 2-10 died from disease and various acci dents. This rate was less than that of the Mexican war, and very much less thin that of the Peninsular war and the war in the Urimoa.. In. the .Peninsular war the British mortality was 16 per cent; in the Crimean, 23 per cent,' without counting those. .that ' died in "battle. Those differ rices.- are chiefly . due to the. better care taken of our soldiers in camps and hospitals. ,. A Navy Yard at Cleveland. Tbe bill 'introduced by Honv B. Spauldlng into Congress, to establish Navy yard for the lakes in this city, is one of the most vital importance. There can be no 'doubt whatever in the mind of any man bat that out relations with England are growing more and more delicate, and that tha safety of our lake commerce and th 9 large cities on their borders, demand the establishment of a Havy Yard at some point on the' lakes. Cleveland furnishes the conditions necessary better than any other city on the lakes. . Its coal, iron and lumber interests, and the fact of its being the lake depot of the great state of Ohio, should commend tbe project of Mr. Spald ing. .."We trust Ohio Congressmen, wili give this measure their cordial support. New York in a Ferment. Tha enormous corruptions attending the city government of Ksw York have crea ted much alarm among the better class of citizens of all parties, and they are casting about in the almost vain hope of finding some mode of escape from their trouble. Wilktt Spirit of Vie Timet takes the bull by the horns and calls upon the Legist lure of Vee State to abolish the Municipal Government of the City, and place its en tire control in the hands of a Commission, which .should - have complete- authority over all departments and details of the City Government. The proposition is vig- oroasly attacked by tbe Pott and Commer curfoach advocating that the- city is com petent to govern itself. It certainly looks very doubtful to outsiders". .'

Such vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native Af rican races, and m JUberian bands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave-tiade tnan a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least organ iced naval force would stimulate a gener ous ambition in the republic, and the confi dence which we should manifest by fur- nisning it would win toroearanca and ta vor towards the colony from all civilized nations. INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH. The proposed Overland Telegraph be tween America and Europe, by the way of Uehring s straits and Asiatic liussia wnicn was sanctioned by Con areas at the last ses sion, nas been undertaken under very fa vorable circumstances by an association of American cttizenn witn tne cordial good will and support, as well or mis uovern- ment as those of Great Britain and Rus sia. Assurances nave been received from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise, and their readiness to co-operate in construct ing lines tributary to that world-encircling communication. , I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communica tion between the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed with a full expectation of its early accomplish ment, mas it is Hoped tnat witn toe re turn of domestic peace, toe country will be able to resume with enerirv and advantage ner lormer nign career ot oemmerco and civilisation. EGYPT. Our very popular and estimable repre sentative in Egypt died in April last. An unpleasant altercation which arose between tbe temporary incumbent oi the omce and tbe government of the Jfacna, resulted in a suspension or intercourse, Tne evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate, and our rela tions with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely sat- lsiactory. ... CHINA. The rebellion which has so lone been flagrant in China, has at last been sup pressed, wilh the co-operating good offices of this Government and of the other "Western commercial Powers. The judicial consular establishment has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative action to adapt it to tne ex- tension of our commerce, and to the more intimate intercourse which bas been insti tuted with the government and people of tnat vast empire.

Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in eeurse of settlement, and the Ia- iana oea bas been re-opened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan to ward the United States. .- : - BLOCKADE RAISED. TheporU of Norfolk. Feniandina and Pen- sacola, bavi lwon'opened by Proclamation. It is hoped that f oreign merchants wiu now consider whether it is or not safer and more -oroBtable to themselves, as well as just to ihe United States, to resort to these and otner open ports, ;tnan it is to pursue through many hazard and at vast cost, a contraband SnAa-m- ftnw ports which are closed, if not by actual miutary opera tions, at least by a lawful and effective BLOCKADE RAISED. THE SLAVE TRADE. For -; myself 'I - hive no doubt of the power and duty -of rthe Executive, un der the -law of. nations to exclude ene mies of the' human race .from an asylum in the United States.- If congress should think that the proceedings in such cases lack the authority-oHztwj erwtgbt to be farther repudiated by it I recommend that provision- be made effectually preventing1 foreign"- slave - traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country. It is possible that if it were a new and open question, the maritime powers with the light they now enjoy tbey wouia not concede the privileges of a naval bel ligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute as they are, and always have been, equally of ships and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less assiduous nor more suc aessful during the last year than they were before that time, in their efforts, under r,f that nrivileze. to embroil our country in foreign wars. ' The desire and Hai.rminatlrin of the maritime States to defeat that design, st9 believed to be as .im inii .niint he more earnest than Europe.' Nevertheless, nnforsaen political W arisen, and partially in Rr7niian' and British ports, and on the Northern boundaries of the United States, fcih dm riwuired are likely to eon- tinae.to require,, the "practice of constant vic-llnnce and a lust and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as - the nations concrneu suu iubu gftwm mn fa'f . under the treaty with Great" "BKlffln'afl the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Pugets Sound Agricultural Com panies in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them. FBOTECTIOX 07 OUB CASADtAX B0BDKR. In view of the insecurity of life in the region adjacent to the Canadian border, by the assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has been th-ught proper to give notice that, after the expiration of six months, (the period conditionally stip ulated in the existing arrangements wilh Great Britain), the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon tha lakes, if they shall find that proceeding necessary. The condition of the border will neces sarily come into consideration in connec tion with the question of continuing .or modifying the rights of transit from Can ada through Ihe United States, as well as tbe regulations of imports which were temporarily established by the Beciprocity Treaty of the 5ih of June, 184. I desire, however, to be understood, while making this statement, that, the Colonial authori ties are not deemed to be intentionally un just or unfriendly . toward the United States, bnt on the coatrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across tne border. FOREIGN IMMIGRATION. The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has, as far as was possible, been put into operation. It seems to need an amendment which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure to them here a Iree choice of avocation and places of settlement. A liberal disposition fest3 oy"most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective nation al protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams whieh are appointed by Providence to re pair the ravages of our Internal war and its waste of national strength and wealth. All that is necessary is to secure the flow ol that stream in its present fullness, and to that end the government must in every ' way make it manifest that it neither wish es nor designs to impose involuntary mili tary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our coun- ...... v.. OUR 

FINANCES. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered dur- the past year. The legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially affect ed tne revenue, annougn suutcient ttme has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of tbe Acts of Congress imposing increased tax- j ation. The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants sign ed Dy tne secretary or tne '.Treasury, in cluding the loans and the balance in the Treasury on the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, were $1,394,796 - j uu..tsu, ana tne aggregate disbursements upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.- i y, leaving a balance in tne Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73. De duct irom tntwe amounts the amount or the principal of the Public Debt redeemed and tbe amount of issues in substitutes therefor and 'the actual cash operations of the Treasury were: Receipts, $894,076,646.77 : Disbursements,! $865,234,087.80 , which leaves a cash balance to the Treasury of $18,842,538.71.

I concur with him in the opinion that tne proportion oi the monies required to meet tbe expenses consequent upon tbe war derived rrom taxation, should be still fur ther increased, and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additional Legislation as shall be required to meet the just ex pectations oi tne secretary. POPULAR LOANS. The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of the Treas ury, amounted to one billion, seven hun dred and forty thousand mixtions, six hun dred and ninety thousand, four hundred and eighty-nine , dollars and forty-nine cents. Probably should the war continue for another year, that amount may be in creased, by not far from: five hundred mil lions. Held as it is for the most part by our own people, jt has become a substantial branch of national, though private prop erty. For obvious reasons, the more near ly this property can be distributed among all the people the better; to favor such general distribution, greater inducements to become owners, might perhaps, with good effect and without injury, be present ed to persona of limited means. With this view I suggest whether it might not be both expedient and competent for Con gress to provide, that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchase, exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as mizht be necessary to guard against the abuse 01 to important a privilege. iiia would enable prudent persons to set aside a small annuity against a posiM4ay-of want. m i Privileges like these would render tne possession or such securities w mo amount limited, most aesirauio ij ponviij of small means, who might be able-to av enough for the purpose.

NATIONAL BANKS. The National Banking system is prov iatt to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people. On the 15'.h of November five hundred and eighty-four- National Banks had beea organized, a considerable number of which were conversions Irom State Banks. Changes from the State sys tem to the National system, are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped, that vary soon, there win do in tne L nitea otate, no bank of raue not unauthorized by Con gress, and no bank note circulation not secured by the Government. - That the Government and the people will denye feneral benefit from this change in tbe anking system, can scarcely be question ed. TheXational syBtem wlll'-crte, reliable and permanent influence in sut- port of the Iwnai credit, and protecv the people against losses in the gress to determine.

The Report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satis- lactory exhibit oi tne atisirs or that De partment, and of the naval service. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen, that a navy of sucn vast proportions nas oeen organized in so brief a period, and conducted with so much efficiency and success. The general exhibit of the navy, including vessels tmder construction on the 1st of December.. 1864, shows a total of 67 L, vessels, carrying 4,uiti guns, ana oiu,ojji tons,. being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessel, iC7 guns, and 42,421 tons The total number of men at this time in the naval servine, including1 officers. about 51,o00. There have been captured by the navy, during the year, 324 vessels and tue whole number or naval captures. since hostilities commenced, is -1,300, of which 2U7 aro Bteamors. The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property, thus far re ported, amounts to 14,396,250 CI. . A large amount of such proceeds is still un der adjudication and yet to be repjrLe' partment, of every description,- including tne cost oi tne immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the 4th of March, 1807, to the 1st of Novom ber, 18U4, are $238,647,202 35. lour favorable con siaeration is invited to tha vwioos--Toctuumendations of the Secretary of the Navy, especially in re gard to a Navy Yard, and suitable es tablishment for the construction and re pair of iron vessels and the machinery and armament for our ships, to which reference was made m my last annual message.

GROWTH OF THE NATION. j It is V noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population, improve ment and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country, have scarcely been impeded, much less checked or destroyed by our great civil war, which at tbe first glance would seem to have absorbed almost tbe entire energies of the nation.
