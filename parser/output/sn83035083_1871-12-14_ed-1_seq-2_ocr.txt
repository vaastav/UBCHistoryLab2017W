There is latent in reconstructed States as. elsewhere throughout the Union, muchj of that seutimeut which finds expression in devotion. to local free dom; a sentiment exaggerated into wrongful secession under the pliant passion of the slavery controversy, but, one which, in the absence of slavery,- may be channeled back into the surest safeguard for the equal free dom of all., . It is in maintaining the germinal points from which growths of free opinion start in preserving. the forms .through which it passes into political, life,- and respecting the dis tribution of duty it imposes, the con stitutionalism it has created, that secu rity will be louud for all who are com mingled: in such society as ours. It is partly because this is assailed and sought to be supplanted by outward force -alone that so little advauce has been made by the government in its ostensible reconciliation. ' Tfco same result would follow in other States on any other question thus engineered, and it i worthy of note by Republic cans as well as Democrats that every party which has passed from power since the foundation, of the Govern ment has lost the confidence of the people, because of tbe attempt to un duly exalt the National above local freedoms, and to -strain the national power to ends for which it was never designed, and by methods repulsive to the common thought, and the pres ent will only odd another to t.he liet, for it is a mistake to suppose; that Northern men . do not recognize this fatal blunder, or that, they demand a continuance of the methwd of mad ness.
