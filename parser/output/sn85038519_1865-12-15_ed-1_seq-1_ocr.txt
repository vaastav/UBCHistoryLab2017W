One of the most prominent characteristics which marks the course of th? members of Congress, especially on the republican side, is a great anxiety to explain their vote on tlio Stevens resolution. All manner of reas ons arc given by them, but the ncrvomness and the fear manifested by many of them that no one will understand ttcir explana tion arc really wonderful. It shows very plainly that they feel guilty, and are asham ed of their vote. But the record is there, and the undue haste manifested by the entire republican side more than counterbalances all explanations which they now make. They rushed headlong into the trap set for them. Tlio manner in which they acted gave it the appearance at least of being their honest convictions. But many of them now show very strong symptoms of being in a decidedlv unpleasant frame of mind a state of anxiety represented better than any other wav bv-ntc old maxim, "Marrv at haste and yon will repent at leisure." They were in such a hurrv to pass elevens res olution, and place them.-clvcs on record in favor of it, that they could not even stop to elect their oliicer-t in the uual form, but, as soon as they secured their Speaker, put through all tho others by resolution at once, fearing that the delav in balloting for each one scparato would not give them time to vote on Stevens resolution, llien, when that resolution was presented, the gag of its previous question- was entorcetl, lest nome one would say something against it, and thus delav them in recording their votes. The radicals like Stevens and Kellev were honest enough in all this : for thev had ex amined the field and come to the conclu sion that they must carry their point before the I resident s .Message were read in Lon gres. They gave it as their opinion pub licly that they mut strike the blow at the outset if they expected to accomplish any thing m opposition to the 1 resident s poli cy. But what are we to say of those mem bers who had every where proclaimed that thev heartilv endorsed .Mr. Johnsons course? This is the class of men who have deceived the people, and whom the people will hold accountable. As regards such men as Stevens, Kellcy, of Pennsylvania, fenmner and a few others, mev nave made no cnoit to conceal tncir opposition to the President's mode of reor ganizing the Southern States. They have, therefore, in supporting the resolution, not carried but their professional principles, and have reason to rejoice over their easy tri umph and the remarkable gullibiljtv of tliose rcpuDlicain who nave announced their endorsement of the action of the President. It is this latter class that are now so con science-stricken that thev are anxious to give cvervIodv their reasons. But it will take a long time for them to relieve them selves of tho odium of that record. An open and frank foe, who everywhere and on all occasions announces his conviction of duty and acts upon it, is always looked upon as honorable. To him is accorded the virtue of honest motives.

WHAT TITAD. STEVEX3 EXriXTEI TO ACCOM- 1'I.ISH 11Y HIS JOINT COMMITTEE. In order that the position in which many of .the members of Corgress have placed themselves in regard to their former promi ses and pledges mav be understood, it is necessary to look bacV to the motives that prompted Jlr. btcvens in ollcring it. It is well known that he has for two years past strenuously advocated treating the bouthern States as so many Territories, and favored universal and a sweeping confiscation, the receipts to be applied tc the payment of the national debt. This he has advocated in and out of Congress, and at the samo time held that whenever the tetatcs in rebellion were again admitted to the Union they must come in under orrranic acts after the same probation as new Territories; in other words, kept under military or rather Territorial Governors until thev had rrone throuch a probationary period. and then admitted, by special permission of Congress, under the restrictions and provi sions which that body might provide. lie opposed the admittance of any of the dele gates from the Mates which had been in re bellion in the Baltimore Convention for this reason. But lie was defeated there. lie or pocd receiving the electoral votes cast for President from the same States last year, but, inasmuch as this made no difference in the result, he was permitted to have his wav. and there was no contest over that point of any moment in the republican partv. .Mr. fctcveiii is not like many ol ins rnuieal as sociates persistent that the Southern States shall be kept under military rule, lie at leat privately advocates leaving them ex clusively to civil law, but that civil law to be administered in a Territorial form only, precisely as all new Territories arc governed, which would give Congress, in his view, the same power over all questions arising therein as that body now have over the Dis trict of Columbia. As it has always been the custom of the several Executives in this country to select men from the States to act as governors, judges, marshals, Ac., in new Territories, this would, under Steven's plan, secure the appointment of Northern men to fill all those offices in the States lately in rebellion; and under their manipulation, backed by Congress and confiscation, lie would humble tlicm and place them in a condition to be admitted to the Union at at some future time. This, of course, places tho-"c States out of the Union. This is the correct view of Mr. Stevens's position, or at least, a he ha stated it to his friends in con versation within the last ten day9. Ho came to Congress with the determina tion to secure the endorsement of thoc views by that body. On the "Wednesday previous to the opening of the f-cssion ho had a long interview with the President, and then took bold ground in opposition to the views and policy of the latter. He not only opposed and denounced tho idea of par doning tho late rebels, but lavored coniisca THE 

RADICAL CAUCUS. This interview with the President took place on "Wednesday, the 29th dav of No vember. On Friday, the 1st day o'f Decem ber, there was a caucus of a few "radicals. At this caucus were 'Stevens and a majority of the Missouri delegation in the House, with a few others from different sections of the country, the object being to have some mu tual understanding as to their course, in or der that they might concentrate their strength. At that caucus Mr. Stevens re lated the substance of his statement to the President, and then told the gentlemen pres ent that what they accomplished they would havo to do in spite of the President"; for he was wedded to his own plan of reconstruc tion. During this meeting the Senate was canvassed, and they came to the conclusion that a majority of that body was inclined to be conservative this year, or, as it was term ed in radical syntax, " inclined to play the sycophant to Mr. Johnson." Fears were man ifested that the Senate would admit some ot tlio southern senators, and thus defeat their (thfc radical) pro gramme. In order to prevent that they came to the conclusion that they must se cure the -appointment of a joint commit tee on reconstruction to whom everything relating to the admission of the Southern representatives, and the treatment of the Southern States, should be referred. The resolution appointing this committee should have some provisions which would prevent one house from admitting Southern repre sentatives until the other had come to the same decision. In this way it was thought that a check could be held over tho Senate, and the admission of Southern Senator prevented. Some doubt wjfr expressed by ono or two present about getting a resolu tion of that kind through the Senate ; but Stephens replied that it was the only mode that he could sec to accomplish that object, and if thev failed circumstances might pre sent some other mode. But it was thought that if the party in the House presented an undivided front tho Senate would not dare to reject it. They would be afraid to array thcmsclvcs against the House, for fear that pome measures which thev were interested in might be rejected in the latter bodv. It was agreed that this plan should be adopted, and Stephens was requested to present it to the Congressional caucus to be held on the iloor of the House on Saturdav evening. But this was not the onlv point settled then. All agreed that it would not answer to allow the credentials of the Southern members to be referred in the usual way to the committee on elections, for tho rea son that if the matter took that direction some of the men elected from the South would get around the members and ingra tiate themselves into their favor, and the first they would know, one clever fellow would be admitted from this locality, and another from that, and thus in cflect'defeat their plans, and carry out the policy of the President. It was therefore agreed that the credentials should not be allowed to go to the committee on elections; if referred at all it must be to the joint committee on re construction. In order that the proposition for a joint committee might be successful, the imtxirtance of its being appointed at the opening of Congress was impressed upon all present. Kit were delayed for a few days, they would probably fail. What were done, said Stevens, must lie dono at the very out set. They must endeavor to commit both houses to their programme at the outset, or they will be unable to carry it through. Having once secured the passage of the res olution in both houses, then in order to pre vent any change of policy, it was agreed that a resolution should be put through de claring that there were no Southern Stales to be represented ; in other words, that there were no such States as North Carolina, Ala bama, Georgia, Texas and Florida, or Ten nessee. The latter State was especially mentioned to be treated the same as afl others. This, in their opinion, would dis pose of the question of credentials and re move all further controversy on that jioint. The joint committee would then be left with out any embarrassments to mature its plan of reconstruction, the government of the Southern Territories, which the President claims as States, and fix the period of their probation befljrc they arc admitted to tlio Union, as well as enumerate the conditions of their resuming their relations. THE 

SECOND CAUCUS. The' foregoing statement embodies the substance of the proceedings of the first rad ical caucus. Another caucus of the radi cals was held on the following day at the rooms of Senator Pomerov, of Kansas. In the meantime, however, the programme marked out at the first gathering wa sub mitted to Chief Justice Chase, and it met his approval. The whole thing was done at romeroy's rooms, and reindorsed there. This meeting is said to have been exceed ingly enthusiastic and larger than tho first. Thev became so wild in their radical doc trines that some of those present thought tho majority would go crazv. One expression used bv a person there was that he began to think they would go through the roof of the house. At this meeting every per son was appointed a committee of one to go around and see that every radical member of the house was at the caucus, in order that there might not be any failure in their se curing the endorsement of tho programme by the general caucus of the rcpiiblicans, and thus get every republican member bound to its support as a party measure when it came before the House on Monday. That wing of the party were all there. The proposition was presented by Stevens, and referred to a committee consisting of Ste vens, of Pennsylvania ; Ilaymond, of New York ; Blaine, of Maine ; Spalding, of Ohio, Washburne. of Illinois : Pavne. of "Wiscon sin, and Boutwcll, of Massachusetts. This furnished Haymond an opportunity to administer a severe blow, if not to defeat Stevens' programme ; but instead of that he united in the report in favor of it, and it was im.mimnuslv renortcd back to the rati. cus, and adopted without debate, as a party mcasure. Thus Stevens not only carried his jKiint, but the radical programme adopt ed at their private caucus was put through with the pretended supporters of the Presi dent advocating it. JCaymond was lued as a tool to advance it. Stevens was immedi ately, by resolution, directed to present it to the Houc on the following Monday as soon as that body organized, which was done, and it received the entire vote of the republicans in that bodv. These facts leave no doubt of the intention of the movers of the resolu tion, or of Stevens' object in oficriii"' it. It places the entire republican strength in tho House of Representatives in an antagonistic position to the President, and as a direct and unequivocal attack tioii his reorganization policv as announced to the public in his proclamation and speeches and Message to Concress. Of this there can bo no doubt. Those Congressmen in the recent elections who announced their approval of the Presi dent s policy have, therefore, gone back upon their promises and placed themselves on record in opposition to the President. THE 

6ENATE. The resolution still hangs fire in the Sen ate. A hat will be its fate m that body re mains to be seen. The extreme radicals declare it will pass. Other Senators say received forty-five affirmative votes to sixty cignt against, so much tor one day's con sideration of the President's Message. The republicans wero no longer ready to suspend the rules for cverv radical resolution. This is an encouraging sign. 

CAUSE OF THE TRIBULATION AMONG THE REPUBLICANS. Some of Raymond's friends now assert that ho voted for Stevens' resolution for a joint cumniiiiec ior mo purpose ot revenge upon the President. They state that -about ten days before the commencement of the session he called upon the President in reference tq the New York Custom House, but lie could get no satisfaction out of the President in regard to it, and has taken this course out of revenge. It is somewhat doubtful if there is anything in thisplea. but that, on tho con trary, tliat he was prompted by the hope of a position on cc train committees, unless we take the other view, that he was led into a trap winch he did not understand or know, the nature of. The latter, however, does not give him credit for his usual shrewdness. No person can blame Stevens for his course, for he was consistent with his past record, and made no hesitation in proclaiming what he intended to do. There was no disguise nor concealment about it on his part. He went to work deliberately to accomplish an object and has been thus far successful. But with those who claimed to be against that policy like itaymonu and numerous others, there is no excuse for their course. It is a deliberate swindle upon the public, a repu diation of their pledges and a violation of the expressed wishes of the people. 

INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE TKISIDENT AND SENATOR SUMNER. A rich interview took place between the President and Senator Sumner on the eve ning alter the message was read in Congress. It Lasted for several hours. There "were three or four iicrsons present. Sumner is represented as having been very nervous. Some of those present thought he would tro into a fit at two or three different iieriods of i... . l.f. tin; luuMiiLuiuii. .cu any ram ins actions justified the application of the term of being a monomaniac m regard the to negro. Find ing himself unable to move the President, he finally broke out as follows : " Mr. President, I notice that the white rebels down in Alabam and other localities in the South arc taking very strong against the Union, and denounciugitin strong terms; can you not do something to put a tdop to it?" The President coolly replied : " I see, Mr. Sumner, that white rebels in Boston are talking against the Union. Can't you put a stop to it there?" This confused the Senator for a short time, but after twisting in his scat for a short time he again broke out as follows: "Mr. Johnson, the reports from the South show that the white rebels in almost every section arc insulting the freedmen. Don't you think that Congress ought to do something to cor rect this evil ?" The President, with a significant wink to the other gentlemen present, replied: "Mr. Sumner, I notice by the papers that the white rebels in Cincinnati have been recently insulting white people there and knocking down one or two. Can't Congress do something to correct that evil?" It is needless to add that the stay of the Massachusetts negro monomaniac at the White House was of short duration after that thrust. A 

TOWER HELD BV THE PRESIDENT. Members of Congress have all of a sudden discovered that the i resident has the ap pointing power in his hands. Ihey sec that, with very few exceptions, the federal olhce- holders throughout the country, from the Cabinet down, arc those appointed under President Lincoln's administration. Already there is a wonderful uneasiness among tho members of the House who voted for Ste vens' resolution. This fear will cause a great change in the bodv. The public may iook ior some grand political somersaults be fore the session terminates. In order that this point may Iks understood I givo the points of conversation which took place a day or two since between a high official and republican mcnilter .Tho member re ferred to was boastinir Wlii wn cmnr oppose tho President's policy, and that lie did not care what Mr. Johnson did. " Stop," says the official, ''are vow sure you are independent of the President, and can sustain yourself at home if you oppose him? Your district is very close." " What has the President to do with my district? The people elected me, and ex pect me to carry out their views. I repre sent tlicm, not the President, and he can't affect me there." " But," adds .the official, " how many postmasters have you in your district?" " That has nothing to do with it," re plied the member, " they are all friends of nunc, ilcsidcs, it is always understood that the Representative in Congress is entitled to those appointments or his friends." "But," replied the official, "supiiosc that the President should take it into his head to remove all of your friends and apKint men in their place who were friends of his and did not care anything about you, what then would lie your position at home?1' This ojiencd the matter in a new light to the enthusiastic member. After a little hes itation he asked in a tone showing that this was a new question, " The President will not think of doing that, will he?" "I don't know, replies the official, "what the President will do, or whether he has thought of this matter. I only know what I would do if I were in his place, and that would be to removcevery one ofyourfriciids if you opposed the policy of my adminis tration. "W e II well," drawled out the mem her, "I don't know but the President's jMilicy is right, after all, and I think I will support him." 

SERENADES. There have been several serenades to mem hers and Senators since the message wa rent to Congress. Ihey have been htarted, no doubt for the purpose ol drawing out Hi members on the txiints of the message. Tin first was iriven to General Banks. Hekipic the reorganization ixirtion of the message and never alluded to it at all much to the disappointment of the crowd. It was alto gether different with Senator, Morgan from New York. I Iu was serenaded on W edeosdav night, and came out with an unequivocal en dorsement of the whole me&?tugc. lie at proved it in its length and breadth. New York has, therefore, ono man in the national Legislature who represents the views of its citizens. T a Tn.. ;a.rA nf TL.1... 1. I clearly defines his position thus : 3 AO .... lVT US UU IU, ...

When we can take the whole cherry, why waste time nib bling at it? Vij- our Old Men are I)y luff. The remarkable uict discussed in the fol lowing article from the Richmond Times must have attracted the attention of every intelligent reader. The strange mortality ( among the old men has not been confined to Virginia, but is nottcable in nearly all the border and Southern States tinea the cloeo of the war, and the remark is upon almost every tongue: "How fast our old men die." There is a singular fact connected with i the war which, palpable and prominent as it is, we have never seen commented upon by ' any of the public journal of the country : a fact which is still transpiring and recurring under the influence of causes the direct con- sequence of those which marked its initiation.

That there was not an indoticndcnt republican in the State in his (Stevens') belief but that repudiated that jiolicy. This is Stevens' opinion, upon which ho informed the President that he should act. Mr. Johnson appealed to him for harmony for the sake of the country, but Stevens would not change his tone in tho least. The only thing that he did do in that interview inconsistent with the alxive ex pression was to ask for the ardon of a friend. It is not yet known whether the President granted the pardon or not. that it will not. Another clas say that TenncMce will be excepted from its operation and pass in that fehape ; while others state that it will be modified so as to remove the check upon the action of the Senate by the Ilonsc.and then pass. With these contact ing views of prominent Senators it is hard to predict the result. One thing is certain, the longer it is delayed theiioorcr its chance for endorsement by that body. In the mean time Stephens is holding back his resolution, declaring there is no Southern States to bo represented awaiting the action of the Sen ate on the proposition of a joint committee, in order that his real plans may not be dis covered until that part at leant is accomplished. 

REACTION IN THE HOUSE. A reaction lias commenced in the Hotrse. The President's Message has opened the eyes of many of the memlers who voted for the joint Committee on Reconstruction, and thev begin to see their real position. Hence their effort to explain their vote on that re solution and the quaking exhibited in many quarters. Mr. rarnswortli ol Illinois, on Wednesday, offered a resolution which in effect declared that the negro soldier should have the privilego of suffrage. It being a joint resolution it required a suspension of the rules to introduce it." Inasmuch as Mr. Stevens secured a suspension of tho rules without any trouble to introduce his resolution on tho first day of the session. Mr. Farnsworth imairincd that ho would have no trouble in accomplishing the tsm ) thing on his proposition. J he motion to imarwnd the rules was made, but instead of getting tho entire roto of tho party it only J Ia ijr I'roni Ilornrc rrrlry. To tho Editorof the Intelliicenesr. WoihifHtton . In your i?ue of this morning you have , J r 1! 1.!. 1 KKjKen ot my presence in armiigiuii, ami of my view oftheioIitical situation in terms which seem to require ot me a lew explana tory word. I herewith submit them : I desire and lalxir for lcacc. Peace between our country and all others. Peace between the North and South. Peace between white and black. We havo had enough of war and waste, of havoc and carnage for at IcaU a century. Hence I have Jong labored and still labor for true and lasting peace. 1 can conceive no possible gootl to our country, to any country, to any sccuon, race or ciass, that is likely to be secured or promoted by alienation between the President and the Congress of the United States. On the con trary, it seems to me that every peril that now threaten u, every evil that weigl up on us would be aggravated ; evep- good put at hazard : every hojc clouded, if not blast ed, by such a malign, untoward collision. I have come here to do whatever I can, how ever little that may be, toward avoiding such a catastrophe, but I am not as your paragraph would seem to imply that 1 am the advocate of any especial plan of recon struction. I urge only that the President and Congress, each respecting tho others Constitutional prerogatives and jicrsonal con victions, shall freclr and trustfully confer. discuss and consider with a profound defer ence for each other's patriotism, and an earnest desire to agce on a course of action which they mutally deem just and txneli- cicnt. Let the great problem ol reconstruc tion be approached from all tides in this fpirit, and I feel sure tliat a benign solution will be HtKJcdily attained. Our difficulties arc aggravated by the fact that our position is essentially novel. I cap recall no parallel in human history. It is complicated by questions aHecting tho natural rights of the freedmen, and our moral obligations to them as our humble allies in the late momentous struggle, that we may promptly re-establish the bouthern States in all their original rights and liberties without sacrificing or hazarding thoso of any portion of tlio Amer ican iople, is the earauat denre of Youri,
