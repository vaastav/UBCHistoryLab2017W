NORTHRUP Parson I'etcv&in: And so. my son, some preacher has been telling you that hell is a far off country where you may be punished for your mean ness at some far distant time, and from which mercy may possibly de liver you? Don't you believe it! Hell' Is all around you, everywhere and j every day, and just so sure as you transgress just so sure will you feel ' hell Are. Aud feel it soon, too. There may be a hell a long way off, and there may bo a mercy that will .save you liom it. I do not know about , that. But I do know that right here in this life there is punishment for ; every sin, according to its degree, and there is no mercy to deliver you. There is but one way to escape it and j that is to bo good! I should beglad, my son, if you would be good for good- , nes3' sake. But I don't want you to forget, if no higher motive appeals to you, that you should bo good because tt pays. The President's message was sent to Congress Tuesday, to late for even a summary in this weeks paper. It Is devoted mainly to a review of the commercial history of the past four years, and the showing made is so strong that one's surprise is renowed , that the country should have refused ' to endorse an administration which had brought about such wonderful re sults. It is a stalwart Republican document and every Republican who reads it and all should will have his faith strengthened and will be proud that ho voted for Benjamin , Harrison. rjf'he New Year comes in on Sunday this year, so it is not likely there will be many calls paid except among in timate friends. Next year, though, we hope the good old custom will be j revived. There is too much good will j and pleasure in it to allow it to be laid I aside. It Is a dull and drudging enough world at best. Let us keep I alive the few holidays we have start- ( ed out with. They had ten times as much snow j in central and western Kansas as we ' had here. .Out in Abilene the storm j was a blizzard and the snow was two ' feet deep. East and west railroads were badly blockaded. The Mo. Pac. which was due here at 5:30 Wednes day evening, didn't get in until Thursday morning about 7:30. The Southern Kansas trains coming from the south were also several hours late. Star: Speaking of Democrac pure' and undeflledj the Iola Register makes the terrible charge that Colonel "Bill" Jones, chairman of the Demo-, cratic State central committee, em- ploys a Republican stenographer. How can he abuse the "straight outs" for giving the Republicans aid and ' comfort in the face of these undenied charges? I For instance, Mrs. Chas. Rogers, of Bay City, Mich., accidently spilled scaldinjr" water over her little boy. She promptly applied De Witt's witcu nazei fcaive, giving insiant relief. It's a wonderfully good salve for burns, bruises, sores and a sure cure for piles. Cowan & Ausherman. For a sore throat there is nothing better than a flannel bandage damp ened with Chamberlain's Pain Balm. It will nearly always effect a cure in one night's time. This remedy is also a favorite for rheumatism and has cured many very severe cases. 50 cent bottles for sale by Evans Bros. Wednesday morning brought us the first winter we have had this winter, a cold north wind and an inch or so of snow. Following the rain of the day before, it was hard on the roads and on stock that had no shelter. But hasn't winter a right to come in winter time? If the somebody who found our old umbrella will return it we will give him a new one for it. It wasn't worth much as an umbrella, but we bought it m London and carried it a good many thousand miles, and we had kind of hoped to be able to keep it. The offer of both the Register and the New York Tribune one year for 51.80 when the regular price is S2.50 is a phenomenal one and you should not fail to avail yourself of it.
