PRESIDENT WILSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS IS READ BY CLERK CROWDS ARE DISAPPOINTED Chief Executive Follow« Physicien'« Advice and Stays at Home.—No Mention of Loague la Mada In Short Communication Washington. l»ec. 8.— Both houses of congress were In brief session yes terday to hear President Wilson's an nual message. It whm read hy the clerk, Mr. Wilson having h<-eded the advice of Ids physician not to appear In person to present Ills recommenda tions. Huileries In both senate and house were crowded. The crowds, drawn by flic chance t lia t the president might ap pear In person, or hy the itoHsIbillty that Id« message might touch on the lengue of nations question or hl« own approaching retirement to private life, were disappointed. Mr. Wilson eon fined himself almost wholly to domes tic questions. Only hy Inference did hl« message refer lo Ihe nearing close of hl« adiiilnlslriitioii and that was In the concluding paragraphy. The pro |hihu!s he presented, the president wrote, were not *u much a «crics of recommendation* a* a confession "of the faith In which I was bred and which It 1* my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day." Aside from hearing the president's message, congres* made progress on nt least one of the problem* It faces dur ing Ihe brief session. The liou«e re reived a rule under which an effort will he made tomorrow to take up the Immigration hill for prompt action. It would limit general debate to four hours. The two-day Interval was al lowed to permit Representative Siegel of New York, a mendier of ihe Immi gration committee, to frame a minority report. No other matter In either house had pa wed yesterday beyond the commit tee stage. At both ends of (lie capital, however, member« were deep In plan* to deal with business depression, un employment and farmers' relief. Dis cussion* In the senate of the plight of farmers delayed the rending of the president's message In that body. The Industrial situation also found a place In the president's message. Re covery from war effects gave promise of early completion "only In our own fortunate country," Mr. Wilson «aid. and even here 'Tnlta and Is Impeded at times." A program of "Immediately serviceable acts of legislation" to aid that recovery "and prove the Indestruc tible recuperative force of a great gov ernment of the people" should he un dertaken. Mr. Wilson said, milling: "One of these Is to prove that n great democraey can keep house a» successfully and In as business like fashion «* any other government." First among the recommended steps Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a workable budget system. He said be bad vetoed the budget hill passed at the Iasi session because of "n constitutional objection," but as It was later revised In Ihe bouse he believed It would, with other measures, furnish "foundations for a national budget system." Mr. Wilson cited figures ns to the national debt and urged "rigid econo my In which nil branches of the gov ernment should co-operate." "I cannot overemphasise," he said, "the necessity of economy In govern ment appropriation« ami expenditures j «•»> the avoidance by emigres« of prue lives whh h take motley from the treas ury by Indefinite or revolv Ing fund «(> proprlntlnn*. This year's estimates "strikingly" ! Ill list rat ed the Importance of specific appropriations, the president added, the transportation act having "dls ! ttirbed" the relationship lietween cur rent receipts anil expenditure* to the ! extent of over n billion dollars. •R is obvious," the message vont In ue«!. "that these large payments have already seriously limited the govern ment's progress tu retiring the floating debt " The president renewed some of the recommendations he made at the open ing of the last session, ami added: "I do not feel it my privilege nt present to suggest the detailed and particular method« by which these oh Jecta may I»' attained, but I have faith that the Inquiries of your several con nvittec« will discover the way and the method."

Ordinarily, he said. American millers use about 4.AUO.OOO bushels of Cana dian wheat, but because of the poor quality of till* year's crop In ihe Unit ed States the figure lias more than doubled. The average pre-war con sumption of Canadian wheat In Ihe United States was about 4,000.000 bushel«. 4, MISS M'SWINEY TELLS OF IRISH SUFFERINGS Says British Government Is Deliber ately Stirring Fires of Religious Hatred in Emerald Isle Washington, Dec. ft.
