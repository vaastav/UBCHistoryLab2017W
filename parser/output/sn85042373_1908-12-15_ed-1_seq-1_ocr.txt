President Sends Message to Senate Relating to Panama Canal Purchase SAYS PULITZER JUIO WORLD ARE BOTH UHNrORTHY OF BELIEF Dismisses the Indianapolis News Edl« tor on the Ground That He Played the Baby Act and Hid Behind (ha World's Statements. Washington, Dec. 15.—President Roosevelt today sent to the senate a statement concerning the purchase of the Panama canal property by tho United States, denouncing in strong language the charges that there was anything wrong in the acquisition by United States of the canal property. "These stories," he continued, "were first brought to my attention as published in a paper in Indian apolis called The News, editod by Delevan Smith. The stories were scurrilous? and libelous in character "fp'=" in pvpry essential particu lar. Smith shelters himself behind mo excuse taat. ut merely accepted the statements which had appeared in a paper published in New York, The World, owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer It is idle to say that the known char acter of Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that statements in that Pa per will be believed by nobody. Un fortunately, thousands of persons are ill informed In this respect and be lieve the statements they see In print even though they appear in a news paper published by Pulitzer." After pointing cut the mistakes and the alleged misrepresentations on the part of the authors of the stories, the president continues: "The real offender is Joseph Pulitzer, editor and proprietor of The World. While the criminal offense of which Pulitzer has been guilty is in form a libel upon individuals, the great injury done is in blackening the good name of the American people. It should not be left to prjtvpte citi zens to. sue Pulitzer for libel. He should be prosecuted fbr Ubel by the governmental authorities.. It is there fore a high national duty'to bring'to justice this villifier of the American people, this man who wantonly- and wickedly and without one shadow of justification seeks to blacken the character of reputable private citizens and to convict the government of his own country in thp eyes of the civil ized world, of wrong doing of the basest and foulest kind, when he haa not one shadow of justification o! any sort or description for the charge he has made. The attorney general has under consideration the form in which the proceedings against Pulitzer shall be brought." The president refers to the various papers which he transmits with his message. In explaining tlie method of concluding the purchase the presi dent tnkes upon himseli the responsi bility for all that was done to carry out the will of congress. The action of the government, he says, was wholly uninfluenced by any question of who were or ivero not stockholders either in the new or tiie old company. "Our concern." he says, "was to get the canal property which was owned by a French company and to see that the title was clear. Our transactions were carried on openly and published in detail." The president says that the United States did not have any thing to do with the distribution of a dollar of the money paid out except in following out the instructions of the French court, and that under the circumstances there was not the slightest need for Cromwell to give any information, but that Cromwell ot bis own accord submitted a full list of the stockholders of the new Pana ma Canal company of .France on January 15, 1900, numbering over 6,000, and a list of all the stock holders who were present at the spe cial meeting of the company held Feb. 28, 1902.
