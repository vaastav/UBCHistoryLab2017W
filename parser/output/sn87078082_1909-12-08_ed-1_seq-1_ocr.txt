Irresponsible Nations Not Pro tested by Monroe Doctrine. A DEFICIT OF $73,075,600. legislation Urged Against In junctions Without Notice. Washington, Dec. 7. In his annual .message, read to congress, President Taft said: To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have con tinued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Europe. Tho American rights In the fisheries on the north Atlantic coast under the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference be tween the United States and Great Britain for nearly seventy years. The Interests Involved are of great Impor tance to the American fishing industry, and the final settlement of the contro versy by the permanent court of ar bitration at The Hague will remove a source of constant Irritation and com plaint This Is the first case involving such great international questions which has been submitted to the per manent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser vation and protection of the far seals In the north Pacific are In progress with the governments of Great Britain, Japan and Russia. The attitude of the governments Interested leads mo to hope for n satisfactory settlement of this question ns the ultimate ontcome of tho negotiations. The Near East. The quick transition of tho govern ment of the Ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a consti tutional government with a parlia ment and with progressive modern policies of reform and public Improve ment la one of the-Important phenome na of our times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to have made further advance In Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the near east In that quarter tho prestige of the United states has. spread widely through the peaceful Influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There Is every reason why we should obtain a greater sbaro of the commerce of tho near east since the conditions are more favorable now than ever before. Latin Amerloa. One of the happiest events In recent pan-American diplomacy was the pa cific, independent settlement by the governments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between thorn, which for somo weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain im bltterments affecting other republics less directly concerned. Our Citizen Abroad. This administration, through the de partment of state and the foreign serv ice, is lending all proper support to legitimate and beneficial American en terprises In foreign countries, the de gree of such support being measured by the national advantages to be ex pected. A citizen himself cannot by contract or otherwise divest himself of the right nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protec tion in his personal and property rights when theso are unjustly in fringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations It Is proper that in considering whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support ed In a particular country the govern ment should give full weight not only to the national as opposed to the Indi vidual benefits to Accrue, bat also to the fact whether or not the govern ment of tho country In question Is In its administration and In Its diplomacy faithful to tho principles of modera tion, equity and justice upon which alone depends International credit In diplomacy as well as In finance. The Monroe Doctrine. The pan-American policy of this government has long been fixed In Its principles and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to' the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable govern ment and progressive Ideals, the ap prehension which gave rte to the Monroe doctrine may be said to hare nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrlno as It exists nor any other doc trine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of Irresponsible government the escape of Just obligations or the Insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on tho part of tho United States. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexican soil served, I hope, to signalise the closo and cordial rela tions which so well bind together this republic and the great republic Imme diately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of material Interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and that under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July SO, 1000, the government of Panama agreed, after considerable ne gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having, Indeed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. This government was obliged to in tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nica ragua, which It had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept 18, 1000. Many years ago diplomatic Interven tion became necessary to' the protec tion of the Interests in the American claim of,' Alsop & Co. against tho government of Chile. The govern ment of-Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and had prom ised this government to settle it There had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed ''through lack of Jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov ernments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII. The Nlcaraguan Trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1007 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another and In turn by all of the five Central Amer ican republics to exert itself for the maintenance Of the conventions. Near ly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America In constant tension or turmoil. The re sponses made to the representations of Central American republics as due from tho United States on account of Its relation to the Washington conven tions have been at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far as possi ble, any semblance of Interference, al though It is very apparent that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American Interests in Central America give to tho United States a special position in the zone of these republics and the Caribbean sea. I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fully appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true Interests. It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were offi cers In the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks and was In control of about half of the republic, and as such, ac cording to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war. At the date when, this message Is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public In a communication to the for mer Nlcaraguan charge d'affaires and Is Intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with Its dignity, Its duty to American In terests and Its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may later be necessary for mo. to bring this subject to tho attention of the congress In a special message. In the Far East. In tho far east this government pro serves unchanged its policy of support ing the principle of equality of oppor tunity and scrupulous respect for the Integrity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged the Interest ed powers of both cast and west By the treaty of 1003 China has un dertaken tho abolition of llkln with a moderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantago to foreign commerco as well as to the Interests of China, this government Is endeavoring to facili tate theso measures and the needful acquiescence of the treaty 'powers. When It appeared that Cblneso llkln revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project It was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have a certain direct Interest In tho question of the carrying out by China of the reforms In question. The administration deem ed American participation to bo of great national Interest. Happily, when It was as a matter of broad policy ur gent that this opportunity should not be lost the Indispensable instrumental ity presented itself when a group of American bankers of International reputation and great resources agreed at once to share In the loan upon pre- ; clsely such terms ns this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway ma terial should be upon an exact equality with that of the other nationals Join ing In the loan in the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there was a provision which caused consid erable public apprehension In that upon its face It was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchurlan and Antung-Muk-den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise, to take part in which they were by treaty with China .entitled. After a thorough examination bf the coriven-' tlons and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that no such monop oly was Intended or accomplished. This government made Inquiry of the imperial Chinese and Japanese gov ernments and received from each offi cial assurance that the provision had no purpose inconsistent with the poli cy of equality of opportunity to which tho signatories, in common with the United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations,, with the Japanese empire continue cordial, as usual. The arrangement of 1003 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which is terminable In 1012 Is already receiving the study of both countries. , The Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested In tho secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines In a manner to make It a thoroughly ef ficient Instrument In the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug. 5, 1000, I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government In collecting information necessary to a wise administration of tbo tariff act of Aug. 5, 1000. As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of the treasury department and as to matters of tbe needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with the department of commerce and labor In its relation to the domestic aspect of tbo subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of tbo tariff act of Aug. 6, 1000, It becomes tbo duty of tbo secretary of stato to con duct as diplomatic business all tho negotiations necessary to place him In a position to advise mo as to whether or not a particular country nnduly dis criminates against tbe United States In the sense of tbe statute referred to. Government Expenditure and Rev enue. Perhaps tbo most Important ques tion presented to this administration Is that of economy In expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. Tbe report of the secretary shows that tbe ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June BO, 1010, will exceed tbe estimated re ceipts by $34,070,020. If to this deficit aro added tbe sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $88, 000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on tbe public debt the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be la creased to a tout deficit of 178,078,830. This deficit the .secretary proposes to meet by tho proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this pro- nnaai. (Continued on page 2.

FLAW IN GAME LAW. If Deer Was Shot Witli Buck Shot no Crime was Committed. It develops that it is no crime In Pennsylvania for a person to have in his possession after a season the carcass of a deer providing the deer has been killed with buck shot. Georgo C. McKean was arrested at his home at McKean's Valley, Pike 'county, for having a deer in front of 'his house. McKean told four game wardens that he shot the deer with a rifle, but he could not explain the appearance of buck shot in the car cass. At the hearing before Justice Ludwig In Milford, McKean and TU Jacob Westbrook testified how the former had shot the buck and fol lowed it six miles, before it was found de8d. Attorney C. W. Bull summed up for the defense and W. S. Leash of Delaware Water Gap, for the Commonwealth, and while the latter admitted that It had not been proven that McKean shot the deer with buckshot, he contended that he nevertheless was guilty of having the illegally killed game in his pos session, and should be fined. After considerable discussion, Mr. McKean was discharged and the wardens turned over the deer to him. They failed to find anything anywhere in the Act of assembly which makes it a crime to have in possession a buck deer shot with buck shot, and it was buck shot and not a rifle ball that they claimed McKean used. Port Jervis Man tTnder a Cloud. Robert Davidson Mulr was cashier of the National Bank of Port Jervis, from tho time of Its reorganization in March, 1900, to January, 1906.

Washington, Dec. 7. Within the next week President Taft will send two special messngus to congress. One will be on the conservation of natural re sources and tho other on interstate commerce legislation and the Sherman antitrust law. The president has in formed callers that he will give his views on these subjects tq congress within that time, nnd he has made it plain nlso that he does not purpose for the present iit least to have the anti trust law disturbed. The president contemplated mention lug his desire for amendments to the interstate commerce act in his annual message, but refrained because of tho fact that the subject was too big to be dealt with in company with the many others contained In that document. In the special message on the inter state commerce legislation the presi dent will suggest to congress the crea tion of a commerce court of five mem bers, and he will also ask that tho In terstate commerce commission be giv en tbe power of initiative in rate MAY 

BLOCK SUGAR INQUIRY. Leader In Senate and House Are Op posed to Investigation. Washington, Dee. 7. A congression al Inquiry Into the crooked operations of tho sugar trust at the port of New York will not be countenanced by the responsible leaders in the house and senate unless tbe administration indi cates that It approves of such an in vestigation. ' President Taft and bis advisers are very much shocked over tbe recent revelations in the New York custom house, but they take the position that it would be unwise for congress to probe into the sugar scandal because of a fear on the part of prosecuting officers that their plans would be di vulged nnd possibly a measure of Im munity gained by officials through compulsory appearance before a com mittee of congress. If the leaders can prevent it no ac tion will be taken for some months to come on resolutions offered providing , for an Inquiry Into tbe operations of the American Sugar Refilling compa ny, but nearly all tbe Democrats and a considerable number of Republicans Insist that tbo sugar company should bo brought to justice and tho methods by which It lms made enormous profits through a system of corruption laid baro to tho public. Two resolutions have been introduc ed In tho houso calling for an investi gation of tho activities of tbo sugar trust. Ono Is offered by Representa tive Campbell of Kansas and tho oth er by Representative Garner of Penn sylvania, both Republicans.
