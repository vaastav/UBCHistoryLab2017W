The number cl teachable Indian youths is now estimated at 400C0 or nearly three times the enrollment ol the echools It < a believed tho obstacles in the way ol instruction arc ail surmountable and the

Four years ago it was losnd that the great cattle industry ol the country was endangered and those engaged In it were alarmed at the rapid extension ol the European lung plague or pleuro pneumonia A serious outbreak existed in Illinois Mis souri Kentucky and in Tennessee Ani mals affected weie held in quarantine Five counties in New York and Irom one to lour counties in each ol the states ol New Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware and Maryland were almost equally aSacted With this great danger upon us and with the cantaglon already In the channels ol commence with the enormous direct and Indirect losses already being caused by It and when only prompt and energetic ac tion could bo successful there were in nose of these states laws authorizing this department to erad cate the malady or giving the state officials power to co operate with it for this purpose The department even lacked both the requisite appropriation rnd authority By securing state co operation in connec tion with authoiity Irom cocgress the work ol eradication has been pressed successfully and this dreaded disease has been extirpated Irom the Western states and also from the Eastern states with the exception ol a lew restricted areas which are still under supervision The daoger has thus been removed and trade and commerce have been freed from the vexatious state restrictions which were deemed necessary for a time SORGHUM SUGAR PRODUCTION During the past four years the process ol diffusion application to the manufac ture ol sugar Irom sorghum and sugar cane has been Introduced into this coun try and fully

There are already too many cf these lands in tbe hands of the speculator for the advancement and improvement of the country It has be come an absolute and aa imperative ne cessity for tho settlement and improve ment cf the Panhandle and the western part of the state tnat the unoccupied public domain shall go Into tha hands ot actual settlers 2 That tho classification of said lands at different

Therefore all unsold pnollc scaosl lands or lindf that may hereait r revert bics to the public domain that la open to tie act ual otiler should be placed at a uuitorm price viz One dollar and
