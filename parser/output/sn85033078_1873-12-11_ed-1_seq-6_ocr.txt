Jovcllar issued a proclama tion advising the people to be calm, and the excitement subsid cd. The United States steamer Juniata arrived at Santiago on the 2bMi ult., and her com mnr ler visited the 101 Virginias prisoners re ar .lining there.

A special dispatch to the London Standard \:f the sth says the. bombardment of Cartagena w i,s a failure, and a regular siege was intended. In the bombardment 400 bouses bad been de stroyed. Ihe London Tans* of the sth publishes an official list of the British subjects taken pris on- ts on the steamer Virginius and afterward f.\ .tiled at Santiago de Cuba. The Tam*, commenting on the act, says; “The British G . vermnent, while demanding the surrender of the survivors, must carefully avoid com netting itself to the. proposition that the seiz ure of the Virginius was illegal. Captain-General Jovellar, of Cuba, tele graphed to the Madrid Government on the sight of the 4th, resigning his position, and (i-'.nanding Unit another person be sent to the Island who could carry out the orders of the Government relating to the Virginius restitu tion. He declared that, the impression pro dEi‘*ed by the news of the arrangement which hail been entered into between Spain and the Unified States could be compared with that produced in .Spain by the treaty of Bayonne, which It'd to the war of independence against Napoleon. He begged to assure the Govern m< nt that the immediate delivery of the Vir giaius would instantaneously cause fright ful commotion throughout the island, which would be sure to result in successive catas trophe-, even if a man of the highest ability should be in command. According to a London telegram of the morning of the 6th the Spanish squadron had not been seen in the vicinity of Cartagena for a, week. The insurgents, in its absence, had procured fresh supplies daily, and had cap tured several provision boats. BHVTIKSXIfh The negotiations between the United Stales and Spain w ith regard to the question grow ing out of the capture of the Virginius were brought to a conclusion in Wellington on the 29th ult.. Secretary Fish and Admiral Polo having agreed upon and signed the pro tocol, which the latter soon after telegraphed to his government. The terms are substan tially as follows; I. The immediate delivery to the United States -rf the ship Virginius, and all the surviving passen gers and crew. 3. A salute to our flag on the 35th of December next, unless in the meantime Spain shall satisfy She United States that the American flag was im properly borne on that vessel, and further that me had no right to the American flag or American papers. In this event the salute is to be spontaneously withdrawn, and Spain is to for autlly disclaim any intentional indignity to the flag tu the acts committed by Spain against the Vir jnnius. 3, If it shall thus he shown that the Virginius ha.i no right to carry the American flag and pa the United States will institute proceedings against the vessel and the surviving parties who have violated the laws of the United States, and Sixain guarantees to institute proceedings against any of her authorities who may have violated airier law or treaty stipulations. 4. The matter of reclamation* for damages is re served for future consideration. A Washington telegram of the above date rutye the words “immediate release,” as ap plicable to the delivery of the Virginius and the surving passengers and crew, implies, of soAirse, a reasonable time for its execution, i* some days must dapse before Havana and Santiago de Cuba could be reached. The fix oi the 25th of December as the time of sa luting our flag is to allow necessary oppor tunity to Spain to show that the Virginius improperly carried the American flag and American papers. A Washington telegram of the 3d says Ad miral Polo and Secretary Fish, since they sign ed the protocol, had been in perfect accord concerning the arrangements for the restora tion of the Virginius and the survivors. Eveiything so far had been done with calmness on the part of the representatives of the two Governments. A severe wind-storm was experienced throughout the West on the night of the 3d.

A falling off of 17,000,000 bush els in ttic potato crop is indicated. The hay crop is 500,000 tons less than last year. According to a Washington Associated Press dispatch of the sth Secretary Fish was. not so hopeful as he had been some days before of the ability of Spain to carry out its orders. The suggestion of a modification of the protocol, that the Virginius might be delivered to a third party to await adjudi cation did not meet with any ofli cial favor. A Cuban gentleman states that he had conversed with Secretary Fish and sev eral Senators, and they assured him that any| further diplomacy with Spain on the V ir ginias question would be declined. They’ be lievtd the Spanish authorities in Cuba would refuse to accede to ttie propositions of the protocol, and war would probably be the con sequence. PERSONAL.

The Wisconsin State Grange is to meet at Fond du Lac on the 20th of next January. • The Credit-Mobilier suit which was tried in Hartford, Conn., last October, has been recent ly decided by United States Judges Hunt and Shipman. The motion of defendants’ counsel to dismiss the bill, involving a question of jurisdiction, was decided in favor of the Gov ernment on the second point. The Court sus tains the demurrer, and dismisses the bill as to parties who demurred. The ground of the demurrer is that the damage to the Government by the Credit- Mobilier frauds is too remote to be reached by the process pursued, or by any other, and that the Government has at present no pecuniary interest to be reached by the bill. The court takes the view that there is no trust anywhere raised in behalf of the Government to be protected.
