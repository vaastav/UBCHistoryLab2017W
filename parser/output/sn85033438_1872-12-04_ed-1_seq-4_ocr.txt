A large number of would-bo poets, who write doggerel and call it poetry wero trying to write after his peculiar style. Ihit his for tunes appear now to be on the wane. His disappointment of tho literary people of Boston, onco or twice, has set up an un pleasant buzzing round his poetical ears, and his reputation is suffering. The Tennessee Tress Association, at its session on Thursday, passed a resolution in opposition to the practice which prevails of getting up editorial excursions under auspices of Press Associations. These ex cursions are too often participated in main ly by dead beats, who seize the;opportunity to obtain 'dead-head" tickets and travel in stylo without money. Parties outside or the press, are not seldom the lions of Hiieh occasions.' The Tribune reports Senator Sumner's health improved by his trip to Europe. It says of liis future course in tho Senate. "Cherishing tho same views which ho has so often and so fearlessly expressed, he will nevertheless make no factious opposition to the new Administration of Ge. Grant; will give cordial support to whatever he can approve, and offer a manly, open re sistance to whatever he disapproves." fr - Ir seems from tho Tribune that Mr. Greeley has written butlittlefor his journal since he resumed editorial control of itafter tho election.

THANKSOIVINO DAY. We should be grateful for any act or sug gestion that turns us out of tho ordinary line of (bought upon secular affairs to tho consideration of that;Pelng upon whom wc Individually, and as a nation nre depend ent. It would bo Indeed nliopcful day forus could tho Idea be realized which tho proc lamation of the President suggests tho united, free homage or tho soul in devout praise and thanksgiving to God for His benefits of every ono within tho boundaries ot" tills great republic. Tills new era, wo are persuaded, will not bo inaugurated In this country to-day. So long as such appeals are made to the lower feelings, prejudices and baser pas sions as disgrace the columns of a Mem phis paper, wo can hardly expect that the blessings of Providence to us as a people, will be acknowledged with thaukfulne.-s, or fully recognized. We can not close our eyes to the fact that there arc those who "are f tho United States," enjoying tho privileges and pro tection of the government, that "are not othem" ; who look upon all that do not pronounce their shibboleth or entertain their Ideas'concorning politics and religion, enemies, with whom they cannot consent to join evon in utterance of praise to God. We must leave them to their folly and self conceit. There arc those who entertain nobler thoughts and views, and rejoice that the fact of dependence upon an arm of strength more mightier than that of man is brought home tothoir minds ; that they have been led to a consideration of. their manifold blessings and of the return of thanks due to the Great Giver. In view of our ovn relations as a great people there Is abundaut cause for grateful feelings and thankful utterance. True, there has been disaster on land and sea, life and property have been doom ed to extirpation, and worse than this, sin in high places stalks with undaunted step and haunts the low plaees of the earth in secret ; and with it all, tho scales of justice have hung evenly balanced. Rut with all this there is an increased sensibility of the people to tho "sinfulness of sin" and of unwillingness to tolerate its existence. The sectional bitterness to which we have alluded, remains, but there Is an offset to this In the expresssion of sympathy for those In suffering with whom, but a short period since, there was variance. We have passed through an excited po litical canvass, but with a large portion or the people regardless or political status there is contentment with the result. No such rears as now disturb the serenity or England and the continent concerning the stability of their aflhirs, are moving us. Whatever may be tho depression In cer tain localities, the country has prospered, and our "garners are filled with the finest or the wheat." Surely, too, it Is soine thincr to be thankful for, to see first of all, great communities rising up superior to loss and aflliction, renewing their ener gies, men encouraging each other to no ble, heroic enterprise and secondly to witness the outpouring of benevolent sym pathy for tho sufferers as if mo-ed by a divine spirit. It is a divine ejiiril tho spirit that Is operating through the various sects of Protestants, uniting them in kindred oper ations and kindred feeling of respect and charity. "There are differences of gifts and of operation" so the great Apostle teaches "but the same spirit, and we mav well unite in devout thanks to God that this samo fepirit given to every man whereby to profit," is in wholesome, active exer- cl se. Under the impulse or a more diffused, general knowledge and advancement in special science through themedlum of free schools and scientific institutions. tlu narrow views ot scctarists are becoming ex panded, and religious differences aro seen to be merely, or mainly, distinctions. Even In tho matter which the Anneal selects as the object or its splcnltie effusion we can si c a holier feeling. What the wri ter states as historic fact, viz : tlm festival of Thanksgiving was instituted in opposition to that or Christmas, Is entirely erroneous. It was the devout outpouring or the hearts of a plouo people possessing n musi oe conceueu too much of that spir it oi opposition to Prelacy now manifested by the Memphis editor toward the puritan descendants in Thanksirivhnr to God for ins protection, and deliverance from bitter trial. It Is true they repudiated the Christ mas festival; but their descendants In common with Christians of other churches that formerly disregarded it, unite now with RomaiiUs and Episcopalians in Am-.. oration of their churches, and in celebrat ing with appropriate religious service the natal day of our loved Redeemer. Wo rejolco that the propriety of such festal day as this of thauksglvinir is re cognized by our National and State Exec utives; and we would indulge tho hope mni every returning' year will witness more ready recognition of its valuo by the , umk Jiuiu i-v-.j io seaauu iront ono end or the country to the other, there shall rise up to God a devout, united expression oi fincere iiianKsgivjng for His goodness Hon.

WAYS OF THE WORLD. S I L ' I l . 1 The ways or the world aro incompre hensible to common people and the ad vance or years seems to throw darkness over the subject rather than shed light. Sentimentalists suppose that the sword or justice is so eq'uollyoilcd as liotlo'varyit" hair's breadth either to the right or tho left, through any common or uncommon Influence. Such persons seem to labor un der the delusion thata man's wealth,stand ing In society, respectable relations, etc., aro as nothing when he goes beyond tho pale of morality, nnd that he will bojheld ac countable for tho deeds done In tho body, the samo as If ho was some "poor body." But among the thinking class this delusion docs not prevail. If Jay Gould commits thcslightolfeuseof'misapplying" nine millions he is arrested and deprived or his liberty forthospaco of three minutes. His wealth Is a palliation for the "misap plication" which weighs heavily In the scales. A poor, obscure wretch comes along, lays his hand on a ten dollar bill, uses It to relieve his pressing wants, and goes to the penitentiary for ten years. His offense Is his poverty, and that being so, there is no palliation, judges, prosecuting attorneys, jurors, all look with more or less allowance on a man's crime, accord ing to his social or pecuniary standing In society, previous to the date upon which the offense was committed. Our code of justice seems to be rapidly arriving at this point. When the poor, ignorant, unfortunate wretch is arraigned for the commission of a crime for stealing a petty sum we hear and see nothing of the "law's delay," but "exact justice" isspoed ily meted out to him, and he is ushered inside of tho walls of a State penitentiary. All sexes and conditions of lire say amen to the act. Hut some wealthy lord puts the funds of a corporation, amounting to hundreds of thousands and millions, Into his pocket "misapplies" them, and lie goes unpunished. "For wavs that aro dark" modern justice is getting to be "pe culiar." Ti'fK Memphis Appeal justifies its scheme to colonize or rather exterminate tho blacks in the South, by referring to Mr. Lincoln's encouragement of the colo nization scliemo ten years ago. There are marked differences between the two pol icies. Mr. Lincoln's was suggested ten years ago, when there was, in some minds, uncertainty and doubt as to the future of the colored race. They were then slaves and tho policy of emancipation had not then been fully decided upon. Mr. Lin coln's policy was prompted by friendliness to the colored race, while the Appeal's grows out of hatred. Mr. Lincoln's pro posed policy was colonization if necessary, while the AppcaVs is practically exter mination. It advises the whites of the South not to give the color ed race employment, nor to care for their aged or young. Thisgrows out of a spirit of revenge. It means extermination, starvation and all tho horrors or a struggle that such aselfish.cruel policy would forco upon tho defenceless race. Rut we do not propose to admit that the Apjycal can jus Ify by comparing its policy -with Mr. tLincoln's. There is a vast difference in the circumstances under which tho two suggestions wero made. Mr. Lincoln would no more think ioh- of entertaining such a policy than in 1SG2 he would have consented to the deliberate starvation of Confederate prisoners at Camp Chase. In 18G2 many wise and staunch anti-slavery men were uncertain as to what fate would befall the colored race then still enslaved. Many would have comnromised willlni?lv A a - on colonization, though when they began to carry ft out they would have realized their mistake. It is sheer absurdity to talk about It. It is a physical Impossibility and no sane. practical man ought to spend time in do ing more than proving to obtuse minds the folly of it. THE F0RTY-THIKD C0N0KESS. Vice President Wilson, who will preside over the Senate or the Forty-Third Con gress, is rrom New England. I? Speaker Blaineshouldbe re-elected asSpeaker orthe House or Representatives, it would give to New England the presiding olllcers or both branches or our next Congress. Ih there any reason why she should enjoy such unusual preponderance over the West, the Middle States or tho South? We fa vored Senator Wilson for the nom ination for Vice President because he was eminently qualified for tho place and because he was from a section en titled tg the position. Wo have a very great respect Tor and u high appreciation or the abilities and past services or Hon. Jame G. Blaine. Wo do not wish to be understood as disparaging in any way hisgreatabllity.or his merits as a public olllcer. But he has twice been chosen to the third ofllee in the republic, and Inasmuch as his section hus been honored in the election or that pure man, Henry Wilson, wo think he should give way lor the representative of some other secflon or the country. The South has" no such representation in any 6f thedeprirtment8 of tho Government as she deserves., ,We think In the person of Hon. Horace May mud she presents a gentlcmaii-Jii every 'way vortliy'b'f'tl'io posltljfn'df Speaker tir the House of 'Rep resentatives. For .near fourteen years he ljns been one of its ablest members. In knowledge of parliamentary rules gained from a long experience as a promi nent member of tho House or from a dis criminating judgment and quick percep tion, ho has 'certainly few peers on the roll of tho next Congress. Through a long public life, by uprightness, integrity nnd faithful services lie lias gained tho confi dence of tho people of tho wholo nation. Throughout tho lato bitter canvass, when slander and Invective was Jiurled at most of our prominent leaders,! not a "word nflcctlng hid honesty or the purity of his prlvato or public life was heard. Hestands among tho best, ablest and purest of our public men, and his elevation to nnyhlgh er sphere of duty would bo honorable alike to tho nation and Its servant. He ! represents tho best elements of tho Republican party of tho South the men who have been always true to tho Govern ment and consistently, honestly nnd ably tho champions of Republican principles. Why, then, ir fitted for this position, ir de serving it upon liis merits, and ir having additional claims upon It, because or his geographical position, should lie not bo chosen Speaker ? THE 

SITUATION IR FRANCE. Our telegraphic dispatches this morning indicate a serious condition of alfalrs in France. President Thiers on the 13th read his message to tho French Assembly in which he referred to and defended tho leading features of his administration the rapid payment of tho German indemnity ftind ; the rapid appreciation or the public credit and the peace and gratifying recu peration of the people. The address was referred to a committee or thirty for con sideration. A majority or this coumiitteo replied to it.severely criticising the Thiers administration. They demand the crea tion of a ministry that shall bo vested with authority to restrict the President's powers when necessary. Tho minority approve the address. Tho Left and Lertcenterorthe Assembly endorses Thiers and oppose any change In the government. It was sup posed that tho voto on Wednesday to post pone action on tlio majority report had ended for the present the trouble, but it seems now the crisis has not yet been pass ed. It is charged that the opposition have elected Gen. Chaugarnler as Thiers' suc cessor and that a change of Government fs likely. Wc should think that France had seen enough of anarchy and suffering for one generation. Thiers has, in the main, act ed unselfishly and for the good or the Re public. Undrc his administration the people have prospered and It is not now so much a question with France as to the form or Gov ernment she shall have as It is whether she shall havo any Government at all. Napoleon, at Chiselhurst, is not an idle spectator or the scenes at Versailles as may well be imagined. The deposition or Thiers now means concision, distrust and most likely civil war. Fuller and later dispatches from Ver sailles will be looked for with deep solici tude. 

SEND FORWARD FETITI0NS. We aro glad to notice the increasing1 in terest manifested throughout tho State in the public school question. In connection with tho gratifying results of the late elec tion it is a most auspicious beginning for the new era now opening before our poo ple. We believe our next Legislature will assemblo fnlly conscious or the advanced step public sentiment demands in all legis lation affecting the vital interests or Ten nessee. Wo havo never been so hopeful of our future for wo havo never seen such a healthful public opinion on Education. Immigration, Manufacturing and better Public Roajs. And now while our people aro fully aroused on these great questlons.we suggest to the friends of these reforms the plan of preparing and forward ing to tlio Legislature to assemble.petitions asking for liberal legislation on such sub jects as the petitioners deem most pressing, but especially upon those we havo named. Let our legislators be made to understand that the peoplo will sanction all reasona ble progressonthesesubjectsand they will be moro prompt to act. Tho Nashvillo Banner has an article on tlio school question worthy of attention. It suggests that the balance of our school fund, which Is justly duo the State and which amounts to a million and a-lialf dollars, should be made available by proper legislation. Tho annual iu teres on this sum Is $90,000. This interest is dut for some years. It should bo paid and tho sum appropriated to establish as soon as practicable n thorough public bchool sys tem. But we shall havo more to say here after on this subject, For the present, wc wish again to urge upon the friends of our needed reforms the necessity or full and pointed petitions to the Legislature, de manding prompt actjon in their favor. Now Is the tlmo for Tennessee to put her seir right before tho country. Now is the tithe for work. Friends, let ns put our shoulders to tlio wheel once more and we will surely come olf'successful and do a glorious work for the commonwealth. "Sr. 0113,, D,ecf2.-iThe United States i.miii6uiu,.i n,-iui j;i,5m,uuu against .u. I). Orrer, late Collector of the Fifth Mis souri District.- " : HORACE GREELEY. Even while the whole nation was Join ing in thanksgiving to the Giver of all good, tho hearts of the people word made snd by tho announcement that ono who enjoyedaworld-wldoreputatlon,aud whose friends aro legion, was fast approaching his end. Every message from tho tolegraph wires was waited for with breathless Inter est, and yesterday morning tho dally pa pers all over tho clvlllzod word gave the melancholy intelligence thatHorace Gree- ley, ono of the greatest journalists ot this or auy other age, was dead. It is with unfeigned sorrow that we chronicle tluv sad event. Mr. Grcoley was born in tho State of Vermont, on the 11th day or February. 1811, and was consequently In tho 02nd year or his age. The experience or his childhood and early manhood was n continual buffeting with adverse circumstances, and to these sharp contests with poverty is duo that vigor of stylo which marked his editorial career,, and which rendered him conspicuous in the discussion of all leading political and' social questions of the ' ago' In which ho lived. After a varied experience or sever al years In journalism, in which pecuniary misfortune universally attended his ef forts, ho commenced tho great and crown ing act of his eventful and ever busy life, by starting the Tribune in 1841. In the. grand success' of this Journal, which raw been moro extensively rend than any other nowspapor published on this continent, Mr. Greeley's talents havo shono out, giv ing a steady light ; and it will slandamon umcnttohis energy, capacity ahd pre eminent ability, while journalism lias a history a monument far more enduring than gilded dome Or marble palace. Ho has given that paper a char acter which Insured it a place in almost every household in tho land. In his death, American journalism lias sustained an irreparable loss. The history of tho last year of his life, is oven moro prominent than ever before, and it is as sad as It is prominent. He was led to pursue a course, which a very large majority of his friends condemned and believed to bo directly in opposition to his life-long professions, but they could novel find it in their hearts to speak less charita bly of his conduct, than to call it a mistake. A fow weeks,, before tho late election, which had thoroughly absorbed his entire attention, ho was called upon to bury tho wife who had shared with him tho hard fortunes or his primo manhood, and it so bore upon him that ho never fully recovered. This, together with the bitter disappointment which followed as tho re- , suit of recent elections, almost dethroned ills vigorous and powerful intellect. It was too much for his sensitive nature and he sank under It. Now, whateovr we may have thought of his judgment as dis played in tlio last political act of his life, we are willing to throw tho mantleof char ity over his foibles and remember only his great virtues. He certainly had faults but his personal virtues so far overshadowed them that they appeared small in the, eyes of his friends. Ho is ono of tho men whoso death will be universally deplored. The sympathies, not only or hisi llfo long friends, but also or those who have always opposed him, go out in his behalf, and a nation mourns his death. FOR WHOM WILL THEY VOTE? The death of Horace Greeiy raises a question as to the probable choice of tho Democratic Presidential Electors, who meet next Wednesday, to cast their votes for President and Vico-Presldent. Tho ori ginal purpose or "the constitution was that the electors should vote independently for President. So for as any law is concerned the electors can yet voto for whom they choose for chief magistrate Rut custom has made the electoral vote a 'mere record of tho party voice that named it'. The Democratic electors recently chosen in the Democratic States would havo voted for Mr. Greeley had he lived, mere ly because the voters who choose them pre ferred him to Gen. Grant. As a matter of fact, however they aro not bound legal ly to voto for any particular man- Tho death of Mr. Greeley now presents a novel question to tho Democratic elec tors, for whom will they vote? Each Elector cau cast his vote for whomsoever ho pleases. It is probable, that ns the tlm Is too short for any consultation, their vote win be for several different persons. Some may vote for Gratz Brown. Some may voto for Pendleton. Some may even voto for Graut. And ns the occasion is now offered, to make his election unani mous, would It not be expedient and just to mako it so? Sinco writing the above wo see by our night dispatches that the Greeley pnper at Montgomery, Alabama, makes lie sugges tion wo have made above, und proposes that the electors chosen vote for Grant and make his election unanimous. Wo should not bo surprised to see It done. Til.. Oli ls in rram-uToiiipuriirily I'uo.l. Paws, Dec. 1. All the ministers have resigned. Thiers says tho only course left him Is his resignation.
