Owing to pressure of newt and the increasing circulation of The Stab, compelling its forms to be put upon the presses promptly at the re quired hour, and also to make proper classifica tion of matter, it is absolutely necessary that all advertisements shall be received at the business office earlier in the day than formerly. Its advertising patrons are therefore requested to send in all changes of matter before 11 o'clock a.m., and all new matter before 12 o'clock m., and at much earlier Outn those hours as possible. Copy received earliest will have preference, al ways, and that coming in after the hours named cannot have assurance of insertion until the next day.

The bight to Catch Seals.?The twenty year lease to the Alaska commercial company of the exclusive right to catch seals at the seal Islands of Behring sea will expire on the 1st of next May, and the Secretary of the Treasury is now considering a form of advertisement in viting proposals for this privilege, which has hitherto been a lucrative one. Baron Van steyn, a member of the inter national marine conference from the Nether lands, gave a dinner at Wormley's hotel last night to some of his associates of the oommis- j sioil e Capt. stmons Will Not rebion.? It has been stated that Cap! T. W. bymons, late assistant to the Engineer Commissioner of the District, intended resigning from the army to accept a lucrative position in private life. Capt. Sy mous, writing to u friend in the city, expresses himself as highly pleased with his new post at Portland and as having no present intention of resigning. The captain savs he has not forgot ten the people of Washington and still takes an interest in the city's welfaie. A Decoration From France.?mr A. Howard Clark of tho Smithsonian Institution has been honored by the French government with the decoration of officer of the "OrdrS Merite Agricole." Mr. Clark was commissioned by the President to report upon the food indus tries of the world as represented at the Pari* exposition and was a member of the inter national jury of awards. The Nebraska Congressional Delegation was at tne White House this morning urging upon President Harrison the propriety of ap pointing Judge Dundy of Omaha to fill the vacancycreated by the exaltation of Judge David J. Brewer to the United States Supreme Bench. Judge Dundy is now an United States district judge. It is generally believed that the Presi dent has concluded to find Judge Brewer's suc cessor in the ranks of the district judges and tile nebraskans are satisfied that as the Presi dent took Judge Brewer off the circuit bench for the Supreme Court so he will promote Judge Dundy from the district benclL 

GOOD WORK QUICKLY DONE. The Labors of the International Mari time Conference Drawing to a Close. IT MAT BE POSSIBLE TO END THE SESSIONS BE FORE THE NEW YEAR AND RENDER THE PRO POSED EXTENSION OF TIME on necessary?their recommendations willphobably BE ADOPTED. The international maritime conference is drawing to a close and the foreign delegates are beginning to count the days bofore the happy time when they can pack up their goods and chattels and sail for their native shores. It was hoped at tho beginning of the confer ence that the members would be enabled to eat their Christina* dinners at home, but it does not now look as though they would get away from here much before the 1st of Jannary. A vast amount of work has been done in the con ference, and the foundation has beeu laid for some extremely salutary international legisla tion relative to the rules governing the actions and guidance of ships at sea. It was predicted at first that the program of subjects would prove too long for intelligent discussion dur ing the time set for tho conference, which was limited by statute to January 1, 18'j0. THE PROPOSED EXTESION OF TIME. A joint resolution has been introduced in Congress, however, to extend the time two months, but tho American delegates aro confi dent that they can get through with every topic on the list in the present yearr- Day be fore yesterday in a session lasting from 10 o'clock until 5 an enormous quantity of work was done, several reports of committees received and discussed, and a number of nmendments disposed of. There are now over thirty important amendments, involving ques tions of principle, pending to the rules of the road and these will have to be weighed and treated. At the rate at which the committees are working, which as a delegate expressed it, is A 

STEADY TWENTY-ENOT SPEED, the remuining topics of the program will soon be presented to the conference in a brief, in telligible form, and then all that will remain is tbe gathering up of odds and ends. There will be no compilation of results attempted. When the conference adjourns for good each delegate will have notes of every action by the body and a complete record of the legislation which has been agreed upon as most desirable. The protocols or minotes will, it is feared, not be readv for the delegates to take with them, but they will be forwarded to them soon after their departure. It is generally believed in the conference that whatever has been adopted here will And its way into the statute books of every nation represented in this body. The greatest harmony has prevailed inspired by a desire to make the sea as safe as possible, tad the American delegates are beginning to con gratulate themselves on the probably bene ficial outcome of their labors. The conference has resumed its old hours of session, from 11 o'eiock to ? o'olook. AT THE CAPITOL TO-DAY. THE WORLD'S FAIR SITE. Proposed Hearings by the Sen ate Special Committee.
