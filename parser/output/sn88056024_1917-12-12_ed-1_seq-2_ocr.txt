WHYBOTH OVER WAR? LOVE IS THE REAL ISSUE Congresswoman Rankin, Spinster, Takes Up Cudgel on Behalf of Cupid and Heart-Torn Lassies. Indicates Belief That It Is the Duty of Nation's Law makers to Devote Large Measure of Attention to These Matters. Washington, Doc. 1*.—Cnpld ha« a champion In congress for the first time In history. JEANETTE RANKIN, REPRE SENTING THE STATES OF MON TANA AND MATRIMONY, THOUGH SHE HERSELF IS A SPINSTER, TOOK UP THE CUDGEL. FOR THE] CHUBBY LITTLE HEART-HUNT ING CHAP SHE SAYS HAS BEEN ABUSED BY THE LAWMAKERS. Her first move on Dan's behalf was the Introduction of a bill to repeal the law oompelltng American women who marry aliens to relinquish their Amer ican citizenship and marry a foreign country also. This law, Miss Rankin ■aid, has almost ruined cnpld's busi ness In some parts of the country. "MOST UNHAPPY." "In my state of Montana, for Instance," said she, "many girls along the border near Canada love Canadian boy« and oannot marry them without losing their Ameri can citizenship and therefore also their Montana homesteads. A most unhappy situation." It was while campaigning for elec tion that Misa Rankin promised these love-lorn lassies that when she was elected she would try to get them the right to do as they pleased with their citizenship, their sweethearts and their property. "The situation Is ridiculous," said Miss Rankin. "Men are allowed to choose their own nations. Women should be accorded the same right." ALIEN OWNER8HIP. But the congresswoman's bill Is aimed at more than Just a square deal for Daniel. "In Illinois," she said, "aliéna cannot own property. An American-born friend of mine, married to an alien, bad property left her. She couldn't claim It because his marriage made her an alien. Her husband couldn't be naturalized because he was a Chi naman, a Chicago university professor. "SILLY LAW." "This silly law also stands In the way of suffrage. American women married to aliens cannot vote In suf frage states because they are classed as aliens." In addition. Miss Rankin pointed to the hardships worked by this law on that small army of American bom wives of German or Austrian hus bands, marooned In neutral countries. They left Germany because their hearts were with America. They can not come to America because their cit izenship Is Teuton. There are many of these In Switzerland. 8UPFS. THREATEN THE LAWMAKERS Washington. Deo. 12.—The marble eorrldors of the capitol echoed today with the tramp of «00 suffragists. They were delegates to the National Women Suffrage convention here, who advanc ed In 44 groups upon as many differ ent atate delegations In congress. The women carried the definite challenge to each member oppos ing passage of a federal suffrage amendment that they will line up against every such congressman In the 1918 elections. Headed by Mrs. Norman Whltehouse, the victorious New York suffragists met In Senator Calder's office to ob tain the pledge of the solid delegation from that state. Fifty Massachusetts women Invaded Senator Week's office. UNTIL VOTE TAKEN. Today's demonstration will be fol lowed by pressure from all parts of the country until the suffragists are ready for a test vote In both houses. This may be delayed until January, as the result of polls which indicated that the amendment has a few votes shy of the necessary two-thirds, ln euch branch. ALSO THE ANTIS. Antis, on the other hand, are press ing for Immediate action, confident of defeating the amendment.

SPEECH POSTPONED. London. Dec. 11.—Premier Lloyd George will make a statement on the war bofore the Christmas ad journment of parliament. Chancellor of the Exchequer Bonar Law made the announce ment In the house of commons late today. It had been expected that the premier himself would speak and that he could outline very fully the war alms of Eng land. , This 1s the second postponement of a speech by Lloyd George. He had been scheduled to address lawyers at Gray's Inn last week, but the engagement was cancelled, owing to a severe cold which the Welsh statesman suddenly devel oped. Lloyd George spent the week end at his country home and his friends brought word back to Lon don early this week that he had been planning a speech which would restate Britain's aim In the war and which might be prelimi nary to their complete acquies cence In President's Wilson war alms, to a Joint war alms state ment on behalf of all the allies. Bonar Iaw, In announcing the forthcoming speech today, did not explain the specific! topic which the prime minister would discuss, but It was regarded sa certain It would be on Britain's aspirations In tha war. Prior to revealing the premier's plans, Bonar Law flatly refused to produce the correspondence be tween London and Bucharest pre ceding the entry of Rumania Into the great war. By KD L 

KEEN. London, Dec. 12.—England looked for a new war slogan from its pre mier today. Lloyd George was scheduled to speak In the house of commons. It was be lieved he would devote his address to a restatement of war aims. Those closest to the Welsh statesman be lieved such a re-statement would be a complete, unqualified and emphatic approval of the American war alms, as voiced by President Wilson. Several factors combine to make the moment particularly opportune for a war alms speech from the premier und Lloyl George Is a keen enough politician to seize the psychological moment to "put over" such a message not only to the people of England and of allied nations but Indirectly to the German populace. 

RU88IA STILL TEETER8. The Russian situation Is still teeter ing in the balance. A repledging of war aims may be of vital assistance to the allies' cause there. The German military machine is exerting its greatest efforts now preparatory to another offensive which the German public knows will mean a horrible toll of dead piled on the already appalling to tal which Germany has suffered. SENTIMENT IN ENGLAND. An additional factor is the political situation in England. The L&nsdowne letter beclouded the atmosphere. It repudiated the "war to a knockout" slogan which Lloyd George announced In an exclusive United Press Interview more than a year ago and which had been accepted throughout England. On top of this came President Wil son's message to congress, with Its Incisive, frank and complete announce ment of America's war alms. Winston Churchill, minister of mu nitions, discussed war alms at Bed ford yesterday and some newspaper comment today remarked on signifi cant passages of that speech as hint ing at the possibility of a new general election la England. Churchill de clared. "President Wilson's statement of war alms Is good enough for me." and denounced, lnferentlally, the sup porters of the Lanndowne peace-with out-a-victory adherents. 

INDORSED BY A8QUITH. At the same time former Premier As quith, speaking at Birmingham, em phatically Indorsed President Wilson's restatement of war aims as those for which the allies as a whole were fight ing. He Insisted much criticism of the Lansdowne letter had been based on an erroneous reading of It. Todays London newspapers regard ing Asquith's speech as a precise In dorsement of President Wilson's alms. "THE 

GIST OF ASQUITH'S AND WILSON'S POLICY IS THAT . THE GERMAN PEOPLE MUST BE TAUGHT THAT MILITARISM DOES NOT PAY," declared the Times. "Any other Interpretation of the Lansdowne letter was unwarranted. Asquith's at titude to the war Is not In accord with the main Idea of the letter." "Asquith reaffirmed what President Wilson haB voiced in the past year," the Chronicle declared. The News glowingly praised Asquith. "Asquith and President Wilson only disagree with lansdowne regarding the nature of the guarantees," the edi torial asserted. "Asquith and Wilson Insist on pence sanctioned by a league of nations, and lansdowne on peace by the old diplomacy."

Each of these had to receive full ex planation of the purposes money was required for. THEN MORE EXPLANATIONS. "After that we had to explain to congress. But we did not wait for oongress to act We started to get manufacturing establishments going. It was then we met the obstacle of re fusal of manufacturers to spend money without assurance of payment "Our purchasing system raused more delay. We had to submit prices we proposed to pay to the munitions board, headed by Frank A. Scott. "Lack of personnel also hampered the ordnance departmenL "Before the war I had 85 men In my depurtmenL Now I have more than 2100 ." FROM CIVIL LIFE. "Where did you get the others from, the army or civil life?" asked Senator Weeks. "From civil life," said Crozier. "The army didn't have the kind of men I needed. They are engineers, chemists, lawyers and highly trained business men." Most of the artillery and rifle con tracts have been made on a basis of cost plus certain percentages of profit, because manufacturers refused to take contracts at a fixed price. This was due to fluctuations in labor and mate rial oosts, Crozier stated. "AH our private rifle contracts were made at a cost plus ten per cent." FAVORED HIGH EXPL08IVE8. Senator Chamberlain Inquired whether this country has profited by mistakes the allies made with regard to artillery. "We profited by their mistaken Idea that shrapnel was more Important than high explosives —an Idea they have since revised." Bald Crozier. "We were Informed on this early enough In the war so that we made our contracta for more high explosiv* shells than shrapnel." RECRUITING AT CHICAGO.

Maurice, director of operations, this afternoon. "Tills Is true," he added, "despite the fact that the enemy neutralized our success." GERMAN 8UCCESS AT CAMBRAI. The British general frankly de scribed the Germans' success at Cam brai as being due to "lack of co-ordi nation." "It Is far too early to give the rea sons for the enemy break through," he added. "The time for investigation will be later. We will then know why the break occurred. "At the time of General Byng's push the Italian front was weak and the enemy's troops from Russia were at tracted by the British Cambrai drive Into that sector. Therefore, In efTect.

Every sufferer from stomach trouble was told to take a tea spoonful of pure Bi-nesia or 2 or 3 of tl - 5-grain tablets in a little water immediately after eating or whenever pain waa felt. The test completely vindicated his theory; for im mediate relief was indicated in nearly every one of the first hundred reports received, showing conclusively that the trouble had been due to stomach acid which, as is well known, is instantly neutralised by Bi-nesia. Since making this test, the well-known manufactur ing chemists who have specialized in preparing pure Bi nesia exclusively for stomach use have arranged to place in every package of genuine Bi-nesia either tablet or powder form a bind ing guarantee contract of satisfaction or money back, proof positive of their belief that nearly every so-called dyspeptic is really suffering from acidity and their confidence that genuine Ki-nesia will instantly neutralise stomach acid, stop food fermentation and thus relieve the tro ubles caused thereby.—Adv.
