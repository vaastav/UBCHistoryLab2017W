£m Ml TURNER CO. HERALD. W. 0. BROWN, PuBUSBitB. HURLEY, DAKOTA. ARENSDORF ACQUITTED. The Defendant in the Famous Haddock Case Found Not Guilty. ... 1 j. .?• "-V After EeingOut Fifteen Minute* th* Jury Unanimously Agree on a Verdict. The second trial of John Arensdorf foi tbe murder of EST. Geo. C. Haddock HAS ended, after a hard fought battle by oppose ing counsel, lasting tw.nty-two days. Th arguments of the state olosod at a late horn the evening of Friday the 9th instant, after which the court gave bis instructions to the jury, and tUcn-ibat body 'retired for con sideration, entering their room about 6 F. M. On retiring the jury proceeded to tolce an informal ballot, which proved unan imous for ncquittal. 'JL'hey then eleoted a foremaai after which, in charge" of bailiffs, thr-y went to supper. Boturning to the jury room another vote was token, which proved the same as the former one. A dis cussion of about one and a half hours fol lowed, interspersed with reading the evi dence, ond then the foreman said, "Gentlemen, »re you ready to return your verdict?" whereupon each mem ber of (he inry attaohed his name to tbe paper which pronounced John Arensdorf "not gu lty." At twenty minutes paBt 8 o'olook Judge Wakefield was notified that the jnry-had agreed. The defendant and his attorneys and the attorneys for the state were sum moned and were not many minutes in reaohing the court 100m. The news of the agreement of the jury spread with great rapidity and within ten minutes scores of spectators had gathered in the court-room. Just beforo 9 o'clock the court sent for the jury. AB the jury filed into the room, the men grouped within the bar formed an inteiesting speotacle. Al though tbe verdict was foreshadowed by the foot of the speedy agreement, in con nection with the history of the trial, still there were in the faces of the attorneys on loth sides the badges of acute anxiety. John Arensdorf, the defendant, sat bolt upright in his chair, not even re moving his overcoat. Not a feature of his faoe moved.. And his color did not change while the sealed verdiot was being passed to the clerk or after the moment of its an nouncement. He was absolutely immov able. There WSB in the oouri-room the si lenoe of death, as the clerk, at tbe order of the court after he bail made the usnul in terrogation of the jury as to agreement, read the verdict, "we, the froy, find the defendant not guilty." For a few moments a deathly silence prevailed, then counsel for defenso stepped to Arensdorf, shook bands and congratulated him. This was followed by hearty congratulations. Arens dorf soon w?&t to the Milwaukee house where were* his, wife and many friends. The good news brought tears to h's wife a eyes, but they were dried by the many ex pressions of roioicinsr. About 10 o'clook Mr. and^frs Arensdorf went to their home, and tbur ended the great drama, the sec ond trial of Jolin Arensdorf.

'Son ators Hiscock and Evnrts and otbor New York itepublicans are confident that the message will Insure a Republican victory in that State next tall, and Senator Shernrm believes it will de moralize tbe Democratic party in Ohio. Mr. Randall would say nothing abo jt the documont until ho bad had opportunity to givo it careful reading and study, bnt his manner indicates that the message goes much faitber in the di rection of tariff reform than ho ezpccted. Judge Kelley regards it as weak argument for break ing down tbe present tsr'ff system, many of its sentences sounding Uko the frequent iitloranccs of Mills and Morrison in tbe Houso and 23eok in tho Senate. [Washington special to Chicago Tribune.1 In tbe House, aitor the reading of the mes sago, leading Democrats expressed themsolves pointedly as follows: Mr. Mills sold: "Good, elegant, it could not be better.* Mr. Springer said: "That is a good ono. He hits tbe nail on tho bead every time. Wo have our platform." Mr. Towushond soid: "Elegant, elegant. It boats tliem all. It could not bo better Wo are going to staud by him, and wo are going to win," -Good" Soa°y» of Mr. Bland said: "It's tbe best wo ever had. I have not heard ItB equnl since I have boon in Congress." tbo Republican side Mr. McKiuley said: It is a splendid free-trade document. As good as if written at tho Cobden Club. Iude d, it could not be hotter if taken from eomoof the Cobden Club documents. I greet it witb ploaB nre.n And ho smilM ironically. Mr. Buchanan, of Now Jersey, said it put the Democrats just where his party wanted thorn. Cleveland bad shown biB palm of '88 would It rises above party lines and presents a com mon basis of patriotio statesmanship on which Republicans and Democrats are bound by every consideration of tbe publio wolfaro and of po litical expediency to staud together. Tbo posi tion taken in the previous Congress by tbe Min nesota delegation and eomo other Republicans must be stoutly maintained by the Republican side of tho Houso at this session or tbey, and perhaps tbo party which they represent, will be overwhelmed. (Philadelphia Times, IncL] Whilo the President urges the thorough re vision of tariff dutios he is most emphatic in domandlng that our manufactures shall be fully protootod. Keeping this in view, alt as sumption of a free-trade theory or purposo vanishes from tho minds of the American peo ple. Tbe messago will inspire more discussion and investigation of tbo exoot-relations of tbe tariff tQ capital* industry, and trade than any documont that has emanated from tho Chief Magistrate. [Chicago Inter Oooan, Rep.] Tho President has issued a freo-trado pam phlot in which no argamcnt is educed that has not boon used by all tbo Cobden Club organB till it haa bocome Btale and threadbare. [Chicago News, Mugwump.] There is no partisanship, no free trade, no ap )al to class prejudice, no special bobby, in tho resident's mossage. It is plain patriotio com mon sense from opening to close. Ho has dono well in confining It to tbo one subjoot of tariff reform. His action must locus public atten tion upon the noeessity of a systematic reduc tion of the tariff without prejudice and without favor. [Boston CHobe, Dem.] Congress has only to frame and pass a tariff bill in tbo spirit aud on tbo lines indicated in this patriotic and able mossage in order to solve tho most dlfflcnlt financial situation which, in a time of peaco, has ever confronted the Amer ican people. [New York Times, Mugwump.] Mr. Cleveland has done an act of statesman ship in the best senso. Recognizing a great duty, he has performed it with courage, with firmness, rod at tho right tbno. Judged by any ordinar,*' andard of politioal expediency, tho President's act is inexpedient. He has forced upon bis party an issue as to which the party is dividou, and so divided that unloss tbe mi nority yield it can defeat tho will of the major ity. He has done this on tho evo of a national contest in which a considerable number of men of influence in the party have been urg ing him to avoid this issue, and threatening him and the party with disaster if he did not avoid it. [New York Sun, anti-Cleveland Dem,f Mr. Cleveland has never before in a publio paper taken sides squarely upon tbo question. He has done so now in a manner that leaves room for no misunderstanding. It is a bold thing to do, and the President deserves crodit for the plainness of bis specob. Nobody can accuse liim of hedging or haggling or juggling with words. Tho message is too most remark able, and in some respects the movt important, document that te has produced since his po litical career began. INew York World, anti-Cleveland Dem.] The admirable message of the President has given to the Democratic party what it has long laoked—an issue and a leader. The issuo is tax reform. The leader is the President. Jt can hardly be that tbe President has not at this juncture influcnoe enough to Beoure the union of the Democrats in the House upon a measure of revenue reduction and tariff reform. [New York Commercial-Advertiser. Mugwump.] President Cleveland's concise, able, and man fully candid messago to tbe newly assembled Fiftieth Congress cannot fail to make a pro found sonsauon. Tbe novelty in form and the unoonventlonal tono of tho message, as well as the urgent and overshadowing importance of tbe single topic it considers, will attract the universal attention of the nation to tbe docu ment. If we aro not mistaken it will have a de cisive weight in the future of parties and legia lation. [New York Evening Post, Mugwump.) President Ulovoland's first message to the Fiftieth Congress is tho most, courageous docu ment that has been tent from the Executive Mansion since the dose of tho war. In order to make an impression on tbe publio mind on the most important, if not the only important, topio of publio eoncern»'it was neoessary to pre sent that subject without other entanglement. The gun that bas been fired will be heard in every corner and hamlot of the country. For his splendid courago in "taking tbe bull by the horns" he will win the praise of all who ad mire manliness and straightforwardness in publio station whether they approve hit views or aot.

He was going to read tbo message again. band, and the cam- bo fought on that. Mr. Btmie, ot Pennsylvania, said: "It is too A w°uld be suicidal to cut down tariff duties with the balance of trade against us as it is," "It was a one-sided and prejudiced discission of financial tbeorios," said Mr. Cannon, of Illi nols. "It was not like auytbing wo have ever had beforo us or will have again. "It makes the issue for tbo Democratic party. They-were afraid to make it themsolvos," re marked Mr. Adams, of Illinois. "Tbatwtwa very good protection mossage," said Mr. John Baker, tho sucoessor of Col. Mor rison, "It did not go &o far toward free trade as Morrison would have gone." Mr. Reed,' of Maine, said: "The mess ago Is certainly a surprising one, but it is not surprising because there is anything now in it. No ono familiar with the mo notonous misstatements of the free-trade ar gument needed more than a word hero and there to feel that tbe administration bad gone over to tbe Carlisle frina with no disguise tfnat over. It will be impossible for tbe Democratic party horcaftor to dony its complicity in tho at tack on Amoricau industries without disowning the administration.

Senator Cullorn looked tipon it as throwing down the glove and invit ing the Republicans to take it up, which ho was in favor of doing.

Senator Spooner regarded tbo message as an admirablo free-trade essay.

[Philadelphia Press, Bep. A thousand thanks to President Cleveland for the bold, manly, and unequivocal avowal of hia extreme free-tntde purposes.: And a thousand rebukes and defeat) for the ialse^dangerous, and destructive policy whioh he thu^ frankly and unreservedly proclaims. The me&age de serves all the glory of oourage, all the praise of high publio Issue, aH the condemnation of utter ruinous heresy. It is a surprise in its method, and a still greater surprise in ite matter. It like the in its broad bearings it looms up as one of the most momentous politioal events since the war. It plants the President aud his party Bquarely on free trade it'clarifies the next Presidential battle as by a lightning stroke it makes free trade ve. protection the over shadowing issue it dwarfs and dismisses all other questions it oloars away all cowardly evasions and juggling subterfuges: it ends all SIB ltiful personal bespattering, and it summons American people to decide the supreme Question whether the grand protective system which has built up our splendid industries shall be overthrown or not. [Cincinnati Times-Star, Bep,] While critioislug the position of tbe President cn this question, we must express our admira tion for his bold and. decisive stand, It compels his party to tako a position which means some thing. They can no longer skulk around be* hind glittering phrases which mean nothing. [Cincinnati Telegram, Rep.j It is easy to see that Mr. Cleveland expects to be the Democratic candidate next year from tho way in whioh he bows aud smilos first to ono sido and tbou to the othur of the tariff con troversy. Tho message woold not attract atten tion as a state paper had it oome from tho head of a department Instead of from the President. It will not add to Mr. Cleveland's reputation as a statesman, but it will strengthen his chanco9 of renomioaticu, whioh he probably caros a great deal more about, (Baltimore Amorioan, Rep.] TOO President ovidently basos uis political hopes for tho future on tariff reduction, ana the whole campaign has, ae far as a message orxu do so, been preoipitatod ou that portentous line. [Baltimore Amorioan, Dem.1 It is clear, cogent, and unanswerable, as a demonstration of tho nature and importance of the duty now resting upon tho legislative branch of tbe Government of relieving tbe Treasury of its embarrassments. It is ad dressed to tbo people as well as to Cougres), and will, no doubt, reoeivo doe attention from both. IBaltlinoro Herald, Ind.] Mr. Cleveland's plea for a reduced tariff is both ingenious and forolble. His arguments are calculated to mako a profound impression on tho country, whatever bo their effect on Con gress. It Is quite plain that the message is tho product of a conference amoug leading Demo crats, and that it is designed to serve as tho chief campaign dooumentof 1838. {Baltimore News, Dom.] This makos up tho Presidential issuo for next year, which will be distinctly and definitely between protection and tariff rotorm, [St Louis Post-Dispatch, Ind. Dem.] The practicability of Mr. Cleveland's schomo ot tax reduction deponds so much on the as sent of tho conflicting lcoal iuterests represent ed in Congress that any bill which passes both houses must be a "give and take" oompromiso between theso conflicting interests. If it is found that some tf them ore deaf to Mr. Cleveland's admonitions on tho sul jeot of putting tho general welfare above all local and particular interost, and that the tobaoco tax will havo to go with some of tho more inlquitouB taiiff taxoe, Mr. Clevoland will bo precluded from votoing suoh a bill by what ho has said of tho necessity of gcttiug rid ot the surplus. He bas his prefor enoo as to mothods, and expresses it frankly, but apparently realizes the faot that even an inferior and very objectionable method of tax rcduotiou fs better than none. ISt Louis Republican, Dom.1 'The mossage will have a good effect on Con gress and the country. We believe it will do muoh to simulate Congress to framo and pass a fair and wise reduction-of-rovonue bill and diB oourago tho faotlouB opposition whioh has de feated two suoh bills iu the last two Congresses. [Boston Journal, Rep 1 We 40 not approvo tho President's recom mendations, but wo may fraukly say that we like tho tono of his mossage,. especially the soriousnosB with which he urges upon the at tentiou of Congress tho problem of the Burplus and the tariff. His discussion of the tariff as tbo cause of existing difficulties is disappoint ing in tho narrowness of its views and the fallacy of its logic. [Boston Transcript, Mugwump.] •o ono can doubt that President Clevoland possesses civic courage, whatever olso ho may lack, after reading his message. This document disonsses with great clearness And plainness a subject of vital interest to all departments of industry. He does not appear iu this messa.e as tho reckless disturber of trade or as heading a crusado aga nst manufactures, and it is evi dent that ho would readily sign any tariff bill that would avert future flnanoial disasters and rolleve tho country from a portion of ita burden of taxation. (Boston Travelor, Rep.] He furnishes conclusive proof of his surren der to tho troo-traders. Possibly this may be tbo prioo of his renomination, but lio makos up tbo issue squarely—so squaroly that ho will doubtless yet find It to bo a dear price. [Boston Herald, Mugwump.] It is a clear, sound, practicable argument throughout. 

COLLAPSE OF A TOWER. Four Men Killed by tho Fall of "Water Tower at Tlionmsvllle, Gu., Three Oth ers Seriously Injured—Hazardous ltescuo of Other Workmen.

Protruding from tbo rulus could be seeu'portions of the bodlos of tho dead and injurod, the latter calling for assistance, while clinging to tho sides of that portion of the tower still standing, with nothing to clutch or rest their feet on but precariously projecting bricks, wero four men left uninjured by the crash, but in imminent danger of being da6hed to pieces by falling to tho BtoneB below. When tbe hook und ladder company arrlvod a new horror was added to the situation by tho discovery that the ladder^ would not reach withiu twenty feet of the men above. A rescue with rOpes was tho only obonco loft A brick tied to a cord, whioh was in turn fastened to a rope, was thrown into the air, and fell on the other side of tbe wall. A score of hands quick ly pulled tho rope within reach of one of the imperiled men.

Two thousand dollars is the price a woman sets upon her complexion. At least this is the sum of damages which Miss Frances Kelsey is about to clam in the courts from a druggist whom she alleges is responsible for much of her facial beauty. Lawyer Thompson, as attorney for Miss Kelsey, has pre pared the pleadings and complaint in the case. The documents set forth in clear type-writer letters and legal phra ses that on June 27 last Mis? Kolsey called at the drug store and ordered from the clerk 10 cents' worth of "flake white," which it was her intention to mix with bay rum and apply as a face lotion. Tlie following day the lady rubbed the compouhd over her face, and it burned the cuticle till it peeled away, and she was obliged to take to her bed in great suffering. She was confined for a week, and although the wounds have healed the marks remain, and her face is badly scarred and dis figured. She concludes that the drug gist's clerk by mistake gave her corro sive sublimate instead of "flake white." Miss Kelsey estimates her special damages at $12 for loss of time and $7 for medical attendance.—SI. Paul (Minn.) Globe. Aristocratic Frog-Spearing.

The latest instance of this peculiar kind of spoil took place in the grounds of the cliiittau of Bellancourt. After luncheon a party of ladies and gentle men, armed with weapons resembling crossbows, the arrows being of hazel wood, willi iron lance-lieads, and at tached to the bow by silken strings so as to enable the frogs to be hauled in, proceeded to the banks of a pond. Then there was a great deal of uncere monious stooping down as the frogs appeared and arrows were let oil in all directions the slaughter being con siderable on the part of those who pursued tho sport for the purpose of bagging game.
