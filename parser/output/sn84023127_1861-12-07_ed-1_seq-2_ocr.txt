Wn have no time to-day, for extended remark on tho President's Message. Like all his other productions, it is marKeo. oy a ui- rectness and simplicity of expression, that I innnvg no one in doubt of the mcaninc and sincerity of its author. Every man who can read understanding the simplest forms of the English language, can apprehend every proposition in it ; and every honest and pat riotic reader will give his full confidence to its statements, and own that its expressed opinions, whether previously in agreement with his own or not, aro worthy of a candid and respectful consideration. It is an able document, and will bo so considered by Concrcss and the nation. It is remarkable for tho dispassionate tono which pervades it from beginning to end, and for the absolute confidence which is implied in it concerning the power and integrity of the nation, no matter how great the extent of tho rebellion, nor how manv tho machinations by active enemies at homo and selfish coadjutors abroad, to cfiect its ruin. It is, withal, a much briefer document than our Presidents 1. been in the way of civinc us on such an occasion, for many years past. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives : In tho mid6t of unprecedented political troubles we have cause for great gratitude to God for unusual good health and most abund ant harvests. OUR FOREIGN" RELATIONS. You will not bo surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies ol tho times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic allairs. A disloyal portion of the American people during the wholo year have been en gaged in an attempt - toj divide and destroy the Union. A Nation which endures factions and domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, it not Doth, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungen erous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom tail t o be nn fortunate, and injurious to those adopting them. Tho disloyal citizens of tho united states who have offered the ruin of our Country in return for aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and tncouragcincnt than they probably ex- pected. If it were just to suppose, as the in- bureenls seemed to assume, tbatloreign na tions,tn this case,discurding all moral .social & treaty obligations, would act solely and sel ti'lilv or ttio aiost xtxjedy restoration o! com merce, including cspo'iially the acquisition of cotton, these nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more di rectly or clearly through tho destruction than through the preservation of tho Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite suro a sound argument could be mude to show them that they can reach thiir aims more readily and easily by aidiug to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it. Ihe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting for eign nations to hostility against) us, as al ready intimated, is the embanissment of commerce. Thoso nations, however, not improbably taw from tho first, that it was the Union which made as well our for eign as our domestic commerce. They can i-carcly have lailed to perceive that the effort lor disunion produces tho existing difficulty, and that one strong nation promises a moro durable peaco and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than can the e.ime nation broken into two hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discus sions with foreign btates, because whatever mightbo tbeir wishes & dispositions,the integ rity ol our country, & stability of our govern't mainly de;end not upon them, but on the loy alty, virtue, patriotism and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with usual reservations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudenco and liber ality towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here,as in every other state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures bi adopted for maintaining the public defences on every side. While under this general recommendation provision for defending our coast line readily occurs to tho mind, 1 also in the same connection ask the attention oi uongrcss to our great lakes and rivers. It is be lieved that some fortifications and de pots of arms and munitions, with harbor navigation improvements, at some well selected points upon these would bo of great importance for tho na tional defence and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War expreKsed in his report upon the samo general subjects. I deem it of importance that the loval rezions of Last lenn., and Western North Carolina bo connected with Ken tucky and other faithful parts of the Union by railroad. I therefore recommend as a military measure thatCongress provide for tho construction of such road, as speedily as possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, aud through her legislature make tho most judicious selection of a line. Tho northern terminus must connect with some cxistin? railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or Nicholas ville.to theCumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to tho Tennessee Line, in tho direction of Knoxville, or on some still different line, can easily bo determined. Ken tucky and the General Govern't co-oporatiug in the work, it can bo completed in a very short time, and when dono it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all future time. Some treaties designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senute for tbeir copsidcr atiou. Although we havo failed to induce some other commercial powers to adopt a desirable amelioration of tho rigor of maritime war, we have removed all ob structions of this humane reform, except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your attention to tho correspondence between Her British MaJwitv'a Minister and the secretary ol SUM, relative to the detention of the British . . . , . - r 1.. . , 1. n ship t'crinsntre, in uuuu jaoi,, uj U. S. steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed bieach of the blockad3. As this detention was occasioned by an obrious misapprehen sion of the facta ; and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right, or sanctioned by public law, Irecoirimond that an appropria tion be made to satisfy a reasonable demand of the owners ot the vessel for the detention. I repeat the recommendation of my predo icfaorj in his message to Congress in Decem L itast', in regard to the disposition of the urplds which will probably remain after tatttfying the claims of American citixefia tgajatt China, pursuant to tba awuda of tho WBuuMioncn under tho act of the 3d of March 1859, If, however, it Bhould not be deemed advisablo to carry that recommendation into ellect, 1 would suggest that authority bo given for investing tho principal over-proceeds of sur plus relerred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China, as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in course of our extensive trade with that Enir ve. By act of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of sailinp vessels, to defend themselves against, and to'capture, pirates. This authority has been exercisod in a single instance only, for the moro eliectual pro tection of our extensive and valuablo com merce in eastern seas especially, it seems to mo that it would also bo advisable to au thorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make ot United otates vessels, and their car goes ; and also to authorize consular courts, established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not bo objected to by local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our rccogni- j. q d denco and sovereignty of Uavti and Liberia, I am unable to discover it. Unwillinz. however, to inniXMiratG a novel pohev in regard to them without tho approbation of Congress. I fiuhmit lor vour consideration. thn pTtwdinncv nf an appropriation for inain- taioing a charge d'affaires near each of those States. it does not aumu oi uuuuu that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them.

THE 

ARMY. I respectfully rofer you tj the report of the Secretary ol War lor information res pecting the numerical strength of the Army, aud for recommendations having in viow an increase of its efficiency, and tho well being of the various brandies of tho service en trusted to his care. It is gratifying to knov tint the patriotism of the people has proved caual to the occasion, anu mat tne num ber of troops tendered greatly exceeds tho force which Congress authorized mo to call into the field. 1 refer with pleasure to those portions ol his report which make allusion to the creditable degreo of discipline already attained bv our trout, and to the excellent sanitary condition ol tho entire army. The recommendations of the Secretary for the organization of the militia upon a uni form basis, is a subject of vital importance to tho future safety ot the Country and is commended to the serious attention of Con Tho largo addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that lias so considerably diminished the number of its officers, givts peculiar importance t) his re commendation for increasing tho corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of tho mili tary academy. By mere otuii-aion, 1 presume, Congress has lailed to provide chaplains lor the hospitals occupied by the volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly addressed, has been delivered to each ot the persons,and at the dates respec tively named and stated in a schedule, con- " . f r.i I..- . i . in i taming also the iormoi ineicicer.marKea" j and herewith transmitted. Ihese gentlemen, 1 understand cntecd upon the duties desig nated at tho times respectively stated in tho schedule, and have labored therein ever since. 1 therefore rt-commend that they bo compensated at tho same rate as Chaplains in the army. 1 lurther suggest that general provision bo made for Chaplains to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments. THE NAVV. The report of the Secretary of the Mavy presents in detail tho operations of that branch of the servico, the activity aud cnor y which characterize its administration, and the results of the measures to increase its tficiency and power. Such have been tho additions by construction and purchaso that it may almost be said that a Navy has been created and brought into servico sinco our difficulties commenced. Besides block ading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat and have performed deeds which have increased our JYaval renown. I would invito special attention to tho re commendation of 'the Secretary for a moro perfect organization ot tho .Navy by intro ducing additional grades in the servico. The present organization is defective,and unsatis- iaciory ; anu inu suggiasiiuiis tuuuiuu:u uy the department will it is believed, it adopted, obviate tho difficulties alluded to, promote tho harmony and increase the efficiency of the Xavy. THE 

COURTS AND LAWS. There aro three vacancies on tho bench ot tho Supremo Court, two by the decease of Justices Daniel and McLean, and'onc by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so iar forborne making nominations, to fill tho vacancio?, for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided within tho states now over-run by revolt, so that if their succes sors were appointed in the same localities they could not now servo upon their cir cuits, and many of tho most com petent men there probably would not tako tho personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon tuo supremo oencu. I have been unwilling to throw all the ap pointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return ol peace ; although I may remark that, tj transfer to the North one which has here tofore been in tho South, would not. with reference to territory and population, bo unjust. ...... , , . . j. Uunng the long ana Driinant juuiciary career of Judge McLean, bis circuit grew to an empire altogether too largo for uny onp Judge to givo tho courts therein more than a nominal attendance, rising in population from one million four Hundred and seventy tnousanu and eighteen in 1830, to six mil lions one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred,and five in I860. Besides this the country has outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended tho system requires that all the States shall be accommodated by circuit courts attended by Supreme Judges , while in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa .Kansas, Florida, Texas. California, and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this well be remedied without a chango of the 1 system, because tho adding of Judges to the Supreme Court enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a court al together too numerous lor a judicial body of - ... i r ... 1 ! L . I. . any sort, ana tno evii oi it wiu ue uuo mm will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or not useful : if useful no state should bo denied them, if not useful no state should have ' - . . . r- It -a-l them ; let them be provided ur an, or auoi ished as to all. Three modifications occur t uic, cither ol which, I think, would be an improvement upon our present system, tne supreme Court bo of a convenient number in any event. Then, first, let the whole country bo divided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme Judges to servo In a num ber of them corresponding to their own number, and independent Circuit Judges to be provided lor ail tne rest, ur seouuuiy.iei tho Supreme Judges be relieved from circuif duties and Circuit Judges provided for all the circuits. Or thirdly, (lispenso with circuit courts altogether, leaving tho judi cial functions wholly to tho District ejurts and an independent Supreme Court.

Since the organization of the government Congress has enacted some five thousand acts mil ioint resolutions, winch ml moro than six thousand closely printed pages, and aro scattered through mauy volumts. Many of these acts have been drawn m nasto ana without sufficient caution, so that their pro visions are olten obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubt ful as to render it very dimcuit . lor even the best info: med persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law reaiiy is. it seems to mo very important that the statute law should bo made as plain anu mieuigioie as possible, and be reduced to as '53" n. i-omnass as mav consist with tho fullness and precision of the will of the leg islature.and tho perspicuity of its language. This well done would 1 thins greatly lacii- itatc the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, end would be a lasting benefit to the people by planinc before them in u more accessible and ' ".O.7. . . . . . - .1 1.. mtelligiblo lorm the laws wuicn so uwyij pnnfcrn tlipir interest, and their duties. I am informed by somo whose opinions i respect, that all the acts of Congress now in fnri.- find nf afnormament and general nature, , x -- . t . niiir it Do revised anu re written so us iu omhmfvxl in ono volume or at least two vol units ol ordinary and convo'.ient s:z;, and 1 respectfully recommend to Congress to con sider thesubject,and,if my;suggetions beap- proved. to devise such plan as to tneir wis dom shall seem most proper, for the attain ment of the end proposed. One of tho unavoidable consequences u mo present insurrection, is the entire suppres sion in many places of all ordinary moans oi admin lmstrating civil justice oy tne camera and in the forms of cxistin laws. This is the case, in whole or in part in all the insurgent states, and as our armies advance upon and take possession of tho30 states, the practical evn oecomes more apparent. There aro no cjurts nor offisers to whom the citizens of other States may ap ply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the lnsnrdn t States. and thcrJ is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims. Sjme have estimated it as high a? two hundred millions of dollars, duein large part from inmrgeuts in open rebellion to loval eitizms who aro even now laaKin treat sacrifices in the discharge of tbeir patriotic dutv to support tho govcrcmo: Under these circumstanced, I have been urgently solicited to establish by military power courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I havo thus far decliccd to do it, not because I i ad uny doubt that tho end proposed, the collection of the debts, was iust and rig'it in itself ; but "because I have been unwilling to g beyond the pressure of necessity in unusual txercite of power But the powers ol Congress 1 suppose are equal to the anomalous occasion, and thcreiore 1 reler tho whole matter to Con gress, with the hopo that a plan may bo devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgeut States and Territories as may bo under the control of the Government, whether by a voluntary return to allegianco and order, or by tho power of our a.ras. This however, is nck to be a permanent institution, uuta tcmporSry substitute, and to cease as soon as the c-rdi nary courts can bo re-established lapcaccl It is important that some lioro n- venicnt means should be provided" if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much tho duta. of tho Government to render prompt justice against ltselt in lavor of citizens as it is to ad minister the same between private indivi duals. The investigation and adjudi cation of claims in their naturo belong to the Judicial department, be sides it is apparent that the attastion of Congress will be more than usually en gaged, for sometime to come, with great national questions. It was intenchby the organization of the Court of Claims rauinly to remove this branch of busineei from the halls of Congress ; bu; vhilo tho Court has proved u be an cfi'ectivo and valuable means of iuvcati gation, it in a great degree fails tj effect tfie object of its creation for want of powers to make its judgments final. Fully awaro of the delicacy, not to say tho elmgec, of tho subject, 1 commend to your carelu! consid oration whether this power of making judgement final may not properly be given to the Court,reserving tho right of appeal on questions of law to the Supremo Court with such other provisions as experience iaay iiayo shown to be necessary. - The Post Office Deiwrthk-vt. I atk attention to the report of the Postmaster Gonera!, tho following being a summary statement of the condition of tho depirt mcnt. The revenue from it5r. tourccs during tho fiscal year, ending June 30th, 1861, including tie annual pcrmir.ent allow ance, of 700,000 for the transportation of being about 2 per cent, less than the revenue for 'CO. Tho expenditures were 13 million six huuddred and six thousand seven hundred and fifty nino dollars and eleven cents, showing, a decreas of more than eight per cent, as compared with those of the previous year, L leaving an excess of expenditure over thonTenuo for tho last fiscal year, of four millions fivo hundred and fifty seven thousand four hundred and sixty two dollars and seventy one cent3. The gross revenue for the year ending, Jun,? 30, 18G2, is estimated at an increase of -1 per cent, on thator 18G1, makiDgS8,783,000,to which should bo added the i:nu?s of the department in carrying free matter,of $700, 000 making $9,383,000.

Tho present insurrection shows, 1 think, that the extension of thii District across tho Potomac River, at the time of estab lishing the capital here, was. eminently wis?, and, consequently, that the relinqishment of that portijn of it which lies withtu the State of Virginia, was unwise and dangerous, yl submit to your consideration the expediency ot reclaim ing that part ol the district and tho restora tion of tne original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Vir ginia. The Department of the I.vtbriok. The report of the Sicretary of the Interior with tho accompanying documents, exhibits the condition ot the several branches ot the public business pertaining to that depart mcnt. Tho depressing influence of the insurrection has been especially felt in the operations of tho patent and goner A land offices. Tho cash receipts froai the sales of public lands during the past year have- exceeded the expenses of our land system, only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interruptions of the business of tho.Country and tho diversion of largo numbers of men from labor to unlit iry turner, have ob structed settlement in the new states and territories of the northweal. The receipts oftho Patent uffice have declined m nine months about $700,000. r';ndTiug a largo reduction of the lorce emji ye.i n..-ce-S.ny to mak-3 it eell-sustaining. The demands upon tho United States for pensions will bj largely in creased by the nisiirrco ion.' Num erous applications for pensions t Based upon the casualties of the existing war have aU ready been mado. There is reason to believe that many who arc now upan the pension roll and in receipt of tho bounty of tho government, arc in the r.mks of tho insurg ent army, or giving them aid and comfcrt. The Secretary oftho interior has directed a suspension ol the payment oi pensions oi such persons upon proof of thoir disloyalty. l recommt'uu umi vuun. ... officer to cause the names of such persons to bo stricken from tbo pension roll. The relations ol the uovcrnruent with the Indian tribea have been greatly msturoea Dy tho insurrection, especially in tho southern superintendency and New Mexico. Tho In dim country south of Kansas is in possession nf !ip insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The accuts of tho United States, appointed since tho 4th of March for this super intendency, have been unable to reach their Tinqts. while mo most oi mosu wiio wuru iu nffi belore that timo have espoused the insurrectionary oiuse.and assume to exercise tho powers ot agents by virtue ot commis I r l i T 1 .nn frnin thn insiirocntn It lins been atotml in the public press that a portion oi Himq Indians have been organized as a mill tary force, and are attached to the army of the insurrixnuniBio. Although the government has no official information upon tho subject, letters havo been written to the commissioner of Indian atuirs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to tho United states, and expressing a wish for tho presence ot the iederal troops to protect them. It is believed upon tho rd possessing oi tae country uy uiu forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations, and restriic their former relations to the government. Agriculture, confessedly tho largest inter "est iff the nation, has not a bureau, but a clerkship only is assigned to it in tno uov crnment.Whilo it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its natnro as not to havo demanded and extorted more from theGovcrnmcnt.I respcctlully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage. Annual reports exhibiting the cenuuion oi our agricultural commerce auu ma-.ui lec tures would present a fund of imformation of great practical value to the country. While I make no sngget-tions as to detail. I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might be profitably or ganized. Tho laws lor execution ol thesuppressionoi the African slave trade has been confided to the department of tho Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhu man traffic have been recently attended with unusual unpfi'jis. 5 vessels bein" fitted out for tra,je j,av0 been gcjzed and condemned. .pwo m!ltcs cngagcd in the trad-, and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver, have been convicted and subjected to the penalty ol line and imprisonment, and one captain taken with a cargo ol Alricans ou - . . .... board his vessel han been convicted 01 tno highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment ot which is death. Tho territories of Colorado, Daotah and Nevada, created by tho lost Congress, have been organiz-jd, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein, under auspices especially gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existin in some of these now countries, when tho federal officers arrived there. Tho abundant natural resources of these territories, with the security and protection afforded by orginized government will doubtless invite to them a large emigration when peaco shall restore the business of the Country to its accustomed channels. I submit tho rcso lutions oftho legislature of Colorado which evince tho patriotic spirit of tho people of that territory. So far tho authority of tho United States has been upheld in all tho territories as it is hoped it will bo in tho future commend their interest aud defense to the enlightened and generous care of Congress I recommend to tho favorable considcra tion of Congress tho interests of the district of Columbia. Tho insurrection has been the cause of much Buffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they havo no rcprc 6cntative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the govern mcnt. At nur last session a loint resolution was adopted authorizing tho President to take measures for facilitating a proper roprescn tation of the industrial interest of the U. S. at the exhibition of the industry ot all nations, to be liolden at London in tho year 1S62. I regret to say that I have been unable to givo personal attention to tins subject a subject at once so interesting iu itself and so extensively and intimately connected with tho material pros penty ot tho world, through the oecreta ry's of State aud ot the Interior a plan or system has been dovised and partly matured which will be laid belore ysu. the contrabands. Under and by virtue of the act- of Con gross entitled an act to confiscate property used lor insurrectionary purposes, approved Aug. Oth, lbol, the legal claims ol certai persons to the labor and servico of certain other persons, have become forfeited and numbers ol the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States and must be provided for m some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of tho States may pass similar enactments for their own benefit, and by fio operation of which persons of tho same class will be thrown upon them for disposal, In such case I recommend that Congress vide for accepting such persons from pro :uch states according to somo mode of valuation in lieu pro tamo ot uirect taxes, or upon somo other plan to do agreed on with such states separately, that such persons on such acceptauco by tho general government bo at once deemed tree, ard in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes, or the first mentioned if tho other shall not be brought into existence at some place or places in climate congenial to them. It might bo well to consider too, whether tho frco colored people already in the United estates couiu not so iar as individuals may uesire, bo included in such colonization To carry out the plan of colonization may involve acquisition of territory and also tho appropriation of money beyond that to bo expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced tho acqui sition of torritory for nearly sixty years the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open ono with us. The power was hrst questioned by Mr. Jeffer son, who, however, in tho purchase of .Louisiana yielded his scruples, on tho plea of great expediency. If it bo said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this mcasuro effects that object, for the emigration ol colored men leaves additional room for tho white men temaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, piaceu me importance ot procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds then on providing room for popula tion. On this whole proposition, including inu ui)ruiriauuii oi money ior mo acquisi tion ot territory ,does not expediency amount to actual necessity that without which tho government cannot perpetuated, the war continuing ? the war for the union. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that tho inevitable con flict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore in eveiy caso thought it proper to keep tha integrity of tho Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our parf, leaving all ques tions which are not of Vital military im portance to the moro deliberate action of the national legislature. In tho exercise of my best discretion, I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation the lau of Congress enacted at the List session, for closing those ports. So, obeying tho dic tates of prudenco us well as tho obligations ol law, instead of transcending I have ad hered to tho act of Congiess to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purpots. If a new law upon the same subject shall be propos-d its propriety will h-s duly considered. The Union must tie preserved. and hence all indispensable m;ans must be employed. We should not be in haste to de termine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as vellas disloyal, are indispensable.

In these documents we find the abridgement of tho existing right of suff rage and tho denial to the peoplo of all right to participate in tho election of publio officers ex cept tho legislative body, advocated with labored arguments to prove that largo control of tho gov srnment by the peoplo is tho ecurco of all politic al evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a pos iblo refuge from tho power of the people. In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voico against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needful nor fitting here that a genera argument should be mado in favor of popular in stitutions; but there is one point with its connections, not so hackneyej as most others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is tho effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not abovo labor, in the structure of Gov ernment. It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital, that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, some how by tho use of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborors and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without their oonsent. Having prococded so far it is naturally concluded that all laborers aro either hired laoorers or what wo call slaves, and further it is assumed that whoovor is once a hired liboror is fiiod in that condition for life. Now thcro is no such relation between capital and lab or as assumed, nor is thero any such thing as a free man being fixtd for life in tho condition of a hired laborer. Uoth of these assumptions aro false, and all inferences from them aro groundless. I.ibor is prior to and independent of Capit al. Capital is only tno fruit of labor and could never have cxistod if labor had not first existed. Labor is tho superior of capital and deserves much tho higher considera tion. Capital has its rights which aro a3 worthy of protection as any other right. Xor is it denied that thcro is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual benefit?. Tho error is ia assuming that tho wholo labor of tho community exists within that relation. A few men own capital and thereby avoid labor them selves and with their capital hire or buy anoth er few to labor for them. A largo majority be longing to neither class, neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of tho whole peo ple of all tolors aro neither slaves nor masters, while in tho Northern a largo majority aro neither hirers or hired; men with their families, wives, sons and daughters work ins for themselves on their farms in thoir houses and in their shops, taking tho whole products to themselves and asking no favors of capitalists on tho one hand nor hired laborers or slaves on tho other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital, that is they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hiro others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a dis tinct class. Xo principlo stated is disturbed by tho existence ol this mixed class. Again, as has already boca said, thero is not, of necessity, any such thing as tho free hired laborer's being fixed in that oendition for life. Many independent men, every where in these Slates, a few years bask ia thoir ljvos, were hired laborers. Tho pruderitpen niless in the world, labors awhilo, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for him self, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to holp him. This is tho just and gen erous and prosperous system which opens tho way to all, gives hopo to all, and secures tho consequent progress and improvement of tho condition of all. No men living are moro worthy to bs trusted then these who toil on from poverty, nono less inclinod to tako or touch ought which they have not honestly earned. Let thcso bewaro of surrendering a political power whiah they already possess and which if surrendered will surely ba used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost. rom the first taking of our national census to tho last is seventy years, and we find our popu at ion at the end of the period, eight times as great as it was at the beginning. Tne increase of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater. Wo thus havo at ono view what the popular principle applied to tho covern-r-'ent through tho machinery of tho States and the Union has produced in a given time.andalso what if firmly maintained it promises for the future. Ihcre are among us those who if tho Un ion bo preso ved will livo to seo it contain two hundred and fifty millions of people. Tho strug gle, of to-day is not altogether for to-day. It is for a vast future also. With a firm reliance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events havo devolved upon us.

IETTEIt FROM XEWYOKK. New York, Nov. 28, 1861. To the Editors of the Free Press : Thasksoivisg Dat. I went to hear Kcv. II. Xf. Beecher preach this morning, and a great dis course ho gave, too. His text was Sampson's finding hoaoy ia tho carcass of tho lion: his sub ject, the occasion of thankfuln-si we have on ac count of this war that it is waged, on the part of tho North.from motives so high, not for power, not for gain, not for revenge, but for our Govern ment and our Constitution: that we are in so fav orable a condition to carry on the war, irom abundant crops of grain, abundant resources at home in consequence of the change of business brought about by the disistors of 195" : that two great foreign powers want our corn for (heir iiinino nnnr even mere than thev want our cot ton: that as a result of tho war, slavery will ba fnrsaor dethroned as a poer and the cancer sc long eating out our Hfo, extirpated not by po Htieal emancipation indeed, for doairablo as that may teem, it must be remembered that wo aro not T-ntiin- a revolution, but fi 'htins to uphold the Constitution which makes tho "peculiar institu tion" a thing for local legislation that the South th Knrth thus rndelv dashed together, will find out their true characters, and tho 500,000 apostles whom wo send South, will teach our courage, our fidelity to law, and our true spirit tn lhnn who cannot understand the forbearing hand, but instantly and thoroughly comprehend the meaning of the clenched and weighty fist: that the peaco nsuing will therefore bo more deep and lasting than could ever havo been possible. It was a great discourse. Time and again was tho speaker int rrupted by the applause of the audi ence be not horror-struck, it was not Sunday, and Mr. Beecher's congregation aro not wont to smother their satisfaction at a telling blow, though it is not often that moro than a rustling murmur betokens their appreciation. The dis pourso will of courso bo reported, so you can read for vonrsclves. Bat Mr. Beecher's discourses should bo heard and not read, to be fully enjoyed At the close, tho well known hymn " My coun try 'tis of thee," was given out, and you can im agine with what power that vast congregation, irm-Ved nn bv the clowinc peroration of the preacher, sang it. A rido in the Central Park, soon to bo the crowning glory of New Tork city, may seem to vou noor amusement Jor Thanksgiving Day. Not j 4 - at all; the day was bright, and for so lato as the 2Sth of November,quite warm, not a speck of snow to bo seen on the green grass, or tipping tho ever greens that stnd the grounds. Hundreds of car riages of every kind and sin, scores of equest rians and pedestrians beyond count, proved by their presence and the pleasure that beamed on every fa-:e, that the amusement w as anything but poor. It is a beautiful place tho Central Park, with its endle3 succession of graceful curves, its picturesque bridges, its unexpected and delicious bits of scenery, its ponds, with their flocks of slender necked swans, now close in ehora and thrusting down their long bills to the bottom, looking like a heap of foam lying still upon the surface, and agaia with curving neck and out stretched wings chating each other out and in; it is a beautiful place, even at this season, much more when the sua is warm and tho trees all green. Year after year, art shows its renewed triumph over nature, in thess grounds, as new walks and drives are opeaed and new beauties brought to view, nay, created, for iu this fairy ground naarly everything is artificial, yet with consummate skill mado most like to nature. Here an ivy vine creeps over a gray rock, it was planted there, and though there is rock in situ plenty, 'tis even chance if that one was not put there on purpose to support the vine. A little juniper bush peeps up in a corner, a willow throws its graceful branches across, your path, a fir tree with stately courtesy rustles its slander leaves to weicomo you to the soil of their adoption, not of their birth. Advantage is taken of every knoll to show some bit of land scape exceedingly pretty, but well nigh all artificial. Ars est celare artem; the full at tainmcnt of which In such an undertaking as this is impossible. The beautifully smooth and regular roads, the clear and well-kept walks, the carefully protected shrubbery, the smooth shaven grass, tho iron bridges, the seats, to say nothing of " Rules and Regulations" posted conspicuously, keep con stantly in mind the sense that all is made. This for a City Park, is of course inevitable, and better so than otherwise, for you get most of tho advan tages of naturs with as a littlo as possible of its disadvantages- A groat deal of money has been laid out in making the Central Park what it is, and a large sum ia expended annually to keep up and im prove it, a most judicious investment, too. It is a great thing for New Yorkers, hived up in brick and brownstonc.to havo such a placo of easy access, where to spend an hour or two out doors, not in tho "whirl and rush of thronged Broadway, herctoforo almost tho only promenade. And they are not slow to take advantage of it. Every fine day, multitudes go there; on Saturday's especial ly the main parts of the Park are black with tha thousands on foot, while two endless streams of carriages and horses fill tho roads, carrying old men and matrons, young men and maidens, chil dren and infants, rich and poor, sick and welN listening to the music of the band and enjoying to the full God's outpoured treasures of air and sunlight. Yours truly, Bes. SOUTHERN NEWS.
