N. J., Dec. 4.—National Democratic Committeeman Norman S. Mack, oi' New York, said today with reference to the McClcllan and Fitzgerald resolutions that the Democratic national platform of 3!00 would stand until a new one was made. He said nothing but harm and disruption to the party con'd ccme from any attempt to change it until it is done by the representatives of all Democrats In the national convention of 3904, for unless the Democrats of the east ern states stand by the last declaration of the party, dominated by the Southern and Western states, there would be no good reason why the South and W<:£t should abide by the national platform dominated by. the Eastern states in IIHM-7 Jf they should succeed in controlling ani ' dominating the convention. "The fact of the matter is," he said, "that the Democratic party cannot alter their national platform every minute. If they do not stand by the present one for four years, what assurance will the peo ple have that they will stand by the next one for four years; and I don't mean by this that the 1004 convention would not be conducted on entirely different issues than that of 1900." * 

COLOR LINE IN LABOR PROSPECT OP A DISAGREEABLE FIGHT IX COXVEXTIOX AT SCRAXTOX HAY SIDETRACK GOOD LAWS Sonthcrn Assemblies Have Anti-Ne gro Provisions in Constitutions, but Colored Workers Ignore Them. ." SCRANTON, Perm., Dec. 4.-Tonlgnt the hotel corridors, especially that of the Jermyn, whe:\. the headquarters is lo cated, ore crowded with delegates frSm all over the United States and Canada, campaigning for and against the various measures that are scheduled to come up in the convention of the American Fed eration of Labor, which will open tomor row. The Pacific coast delegation, head ed by John T. Morgan, of Portland, is lighting for the enactment of the Chinese exclusion law, with amendments to make its provisions apply to all Mongolians, and its operation unlimited as to years. Delegates from the shipbuilding trades are making a vigorous campaign for a demand from the federation that the gov. ernment build its own ships and not let out the contracts to private parties, who pay less wages and "exact more labor than does the government. Almost every delegate is taking an ac tive interest in the trades autonomy matter, and of all the subjects billed for discussion it promises to provoke the most talking. Color Line May Cause Trouble. The color line will also be the subject of what promises to be an animated dis cussion. It will be brought before the convention in the shape of a protest against the seating of William IJ. Seal, delegate of the Central Trades and La bor Council of Richmond, Va. The American Federation of Labor specifical ly provides in its constitution that the color line is not to be drawn by organ ization holding a federation charter. Thn Richmond Trades and Labor council has a clause in its constitution specifying that the delegate of the council must be a "male or female white over twenty one years of age." In Richmond are two {peals of the Tobacco Workers' union, composed ex clusively of negroes. Being barred from representation in the Richmond council, they federated directly with the Virginia Btate union, and thus attained member ship n the American Federation of La bor. They are also members of the Tobac co AVorkcrs' International union. AN ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE FATHER CLEARV, OF MINNEAPOLIS, A VICE PRESIDENT.

BANK TAX IS BOOSTED CAPITAL, SURPLUS, UXDIVIDED PROFITS AND BORROWED MONEY LIABLE RATHER SWEEPING DECISION Commissioner of Internal Revenue Interprets tbe Lavr to Apply to All Money Used In tlie Business RULE IS SHARP AND CLEAR WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The commis sioner of internal revenue has rendered a decision in which he holds that bank ers must return for taxation capital, sur plus, undivided profits and borrowed money used in the business of banking. The commissioner holds that capital is taxable, whether Invested, as in the case of the United States bonds or the bank building, or circulating, as in the case of money, including money borrowed; also surplus, including undivided profits. "In providing that surplus shall be in cluded as capital," the decision says, "it is obviously the purpose of the law to have the tax imposed apply to all money used or employed by banks, as capital, in carrying on their business. "Money borrowed by banks, and used as capital, is held to be taxable, and it is clearly no less liable to tax because of the fact that it is borrowed by a bank from its own undivided profits. "The fact that surplus so used consists wholly or in part of undivided profits, or that such undivided profits have or have not been formally set apart for such use, seems wholly immaterial, so far as the purpose of the act is concerned. R is ti.e use, and not the authority to use, that brings such profits within the tax ing provisions of tne act. "Banks should, tnerefore, return for taxation the capital, the surplus fund, their undivided profits or other profit and loss account, except so much thereof as may be actually necessary and has been set apa** to meet ascertained liabilities and losses, or to pay dividends actually declared by the directors of the bank, to pay taxes, or to pay fixed annual charges, such as salaries and other nec essary annual expenses."

Tlill contemplates retiring from fhe presi dency of the Great Northern railway. He has said this much to his friends, adding that, with the two groat rail ways of the Northwest brought together under his control, he is at last ready to be relieved of some of the multitudinous duties he has car\ed so long- Mr. HQI does not intend to take respite from work and responsibilities, -or from active direction of the policies of the North western railways; but he does not care to be longer tied down by tie^ minutiae of the work attendant on the G*reat North ern presidency, and he. is now ready to surrender his office. It is expected that it will go to his eldest son, James N. Kill, who has long been trained for ulti mately taking up this office, and who was made first vice president of the Great Northern within the last week, to suc ceed Col. Clough, one of the oldest offi cers in Mr. Hill's service. As president of the Great Northern railway James N. Hill will be the young est president of a great railway in this country; but his father has great faith in his ability. He will, of course, have his father's ' advice and the support of capable officers, while the general policy of the company, as far as the Northern Pacific is concerned, will be decided by the j Northern Securities . company, | and of • this James J. Hill will continue as presi dent and as the guiding spirit. . He has no Intention of giving up the di rection of the policies of his rail ways, but he does want to be relieved from the close personal attention to' de tails imposed on a railway president. Mr. Hill is not likely, to retire from the Great Northern railway directorate, and the resignation : from the presidency is not related to the recent agitation In the Northwest over the railway consolida tion in that section. He proposes to re sign from the Northern Pacific board because of doubts raised as to his legal status, on the board. , ■ .

M'CLEARY IS TOO SWiFT DAIRYMEN WILL BACK THE TAW. ',;'-: KEY OLEO BILL Ambitions Little Seboolmaster Fini's «i KocU in His Path Toward Governorsliiy of Min nesota. FROM THE GLOBE lUREAI', Wtesliinarton, D. C. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.— lt has been decided after all that the Tawney bill against oleo shall be the measure for which the dairy interests will make a fight. This in spite of the fact that Mc- Cleary got his bill introduced first. The Tawney bill difters from McCleary's in that it docs not tax uneolored 0100. As originally offered, McCleary's bill would tax uneolored products a quarter of a cent a pound, but since learning that tho dairy interests favor Tawney's idea Mr. McCleary has altered his bill to corre spond. Both have the feature of a 10 --cent a pound tax on colored oleo. Right from the beginning McCleary has been trying to cut in and steal Tawney's thunder. Tawney led the fight last ses sion and the National Dairy union was satisfied with his work. It has been their plan to work for Tawney's bill this win ter. Some confusion has been caused by McCleary's gratuitous activity, which, it is charged, is inspired sclaly by a desire to get some advertising in the dairying districts of Minnesota and bolster up a boom which might do him good if he gets a chance later to run for governor.
