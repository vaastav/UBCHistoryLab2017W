The announcement of his death prove 1 a blow to us all. A man, firm in his vot victions of duty, a rehabie public officer, and worthy citizen, modest to that de gree which seeks retirement rather than publicity, and the silence of deeds rather than the show of words, he endeared himself to each and every one with whom he came in contact, and it is not" to be wondered that young and old so deeply felt his loss."

Walker's hotel, with all Ed. Monitor : To-day, at 1 2 si., the Congress of the United States commenc ed its winter's work at the Capitol, and like all the town, 1 went to see and hear what was done. I surely thought not only all Washington, but large delega tions from all over the Union, had found their way there, for the acres of build iugs were full ; but 1 crowded on. push ing inJ way as hest I could until I gain ed a seat which commanded a full view of the floor of the House. Members were coming in, and hand-shakings and how do do's were in order. The greatest con fusion reigned everywhere, and I could think of nothing but the days of "Lang Syne," when, on the first day of school. we children gathered in the school-room, each trying to out talk the other ; and just as we were silenced by the entrance of our teacher, so was this school of old er children quieted when Speaker Blaine brought down the gavil with an empha. sis which said "order." The members quietly assumed their places, and &tood with bowed heads while Chaplain But ler offered a praper.. Then came roll call something 1 disliked as a pupil, detested as a teacher, and grew restless under, to-day. Nearly every member was present to respond to his name, and it is to be hoped they will be on hand as promptly, and be as ready to work this winter, as they always have been to draw their pay. For the next two years, at least, the democrats will hold the bal ance cf power in the House, and it re mains to be seen whether the out-going congress will dare to do its duty, which it shirked so shamefully last whiter. Then a committee was appointed to wait upon the President, to receive any message he might desire to transmit to the House, and a recess taken, when the confusion began again, and I fell into my old habit of studying faces. The democratic side of the House wore a very short face, much given to smiles, as if there were visions of future power before the sight. Fernando Wood has grown young-in appearance, while the dignified Poland wears a weary, care-worn look. as if the cares of public life press heavi ly upon him. He has aged very much in two years, I think, and I fancy he will gladly accept the rest Vermont has seen fit to give him ; but whether or not Vermont will gain by the change, is a question not soon answered. Many times it has seemed to me that Poland was too conservative in his ideas, and too slow in speaking out for the right ; but his ability and integrity must go unques tioned. The fight in Poland's district has often reminded me of the one in your own district in 1866, when Baxter was set aside ; and what was gained by that change ? Has any one of Baxter s sue cessors done more honor to the State than Baxter did ? Has either been tru er to the principles of the party which elected him ? But I have not time ei ther to discuss this matter, or speak of During the summer and autumn an ffort was made to obtain the opinion of eading manufacturers on the proposed reciprocity treaty, borne dilhculty was bund on account of the prevalent opin ion that the treaty had no substantial support any way. and that any special activity on their part was quite unneces sary.

There was a flush of enthusi asm in New York just after the treaty was made public, but the articles on the subject bore a strikiug family likeness, if they were not from the same hand. Aside from this local outbreak there has been no general desire expressed for a treaty like the one now pending. The rranklin Journal says: "A poor old man returning a foot from Boston to his home in Northern Vermont, stopped a little time to rest at one of our hotels not long since : and a pitiful tale he told of sorrow and misfortune. There can be. in this world, jio grief more keen no disappointment more poignant, than w comes to a father's heart whose daugh- ter has voluntarily sought the paths of shame and dishonor. Months ago the girl left home, and her parents were led to believe she was in a den of infamy in Boston. Thither the father went, -scraping together the little savings of a life-time. to defray the heavy expenses of the journey, to reclaim his ioved one. He found her as he feared ; but she refused to return with him, and avowed her de termination to stay where she was. Sad- y he left her and retraced his steps. compelled to walk, having nearly ex hausted his little sum of money, and through Frankliu he came, wending his way slowly and painfully back to his home made desolate by the loss of one worse than dead, worse than buried." t North P mvill.'.

Men of true manly grit are not to be found every day ; but one of this kind died at his post in Cheyenne the other day. He was an engineer on the Union Pacific Fiailroad. Coming west, bring ing the passenger train, he was suddenly taken seriously ill, but rather than shrink from duty, he increased the speed of the engine to forty miles an hour, and reached Cheyenne ahead of time. As the monster machine came to a halt, and the engineer who was to re lieve him stepped into tho pilot house, he said faintly : "Take the engine ; I'm ready to die now," and in five seconds he was a corpse.

Mr. Rogers was a man of moral courage, always standing up for what he deemed right, and de spising anything that looked like trim ming or truckliug.

SUTTON. Some time since, two men lost their wives in this town, and both remarried. On account of present and past relation ship, (by marriage,) one could call the other father in-law, brother in-law, un cle and cousin. Can you tell how tbis compound relationship was produced ? The engineer of the P. & O. Kailroad. has been on and examined the road near Clark's crossing and finds a place. just west of the crossing, where he thinks a depot could be located at a trifling cost, which would afford the railroad, and the town all the facilities required. The place selected is easy of access, and the cost to the town in building a road to it would be very small, while the ex pense to the railroad to put in side track and fit up a site for depot buildings, would be light, Corydon Parker made 3,200 pounds of cedar oil during the past season. He sold the same for 53 cents a pound. Mr. Parker, with hired help, made this amount of oil. carried on his farru, and sold durwg the year $2,000 worth of oil and farm produce. A good sum of money to be brought into town by the industry aud enterprise of one farmer. 10 9 6 6 16 14 1 12 12 10 11 10 7 8

By her side sat the wife of Secretary Fish, a queenly woman, who gives elegant receptions, of which I will tell you some other time. But while I was admiring the pretty faces (for I do admire pretty women wherever 1 see them) Gen. Babcock came in with the President's message, and I hurried back to the House, prefer ing to hevr it there. Silence reigned through the entire reading, except for a moment when the subject of tax on whis ky was referred to: then there was a murmur, whether cf assent or disappro bation I was unable to say, but it was evident a sensitive point had been touch ed. The message concluded, the House adjourned. 1 will not cumber my letter with remarks upon the message for you will doubtless lay it before your readers this week, and every one can judge of it to suit himself. A short time will show whether work or play is to be the order, and all we can do is to wait and see ; iu the meau time there are receptions. operas, theaters, lectures, etc., and next week the great Centennial Tea Party comes off at the Kotunda of the CapitoL Amusements are.plentyif there is moo ey to pay for them, and one ueed not complain of ennui here. Though I have seen some of the best actors in the world, during, the last two months, I have not enjoyed any of them as I did a lecture by John G. Holland. an intel lectual treat which was a feast of brave ly spoken truths. Next week 1 shal hear Josh Billing tell what he knows about hotels. More anon. Tkcfax. December 7, 1874.
