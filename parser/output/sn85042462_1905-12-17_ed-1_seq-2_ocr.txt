2 SENATE PASSES THE CANAL BILL SPENDS THE WHOLE DAY IN DEBATING IT Only Amendment Is On« Requiring That Congress Be Furnished With Estimates of All Salaries Except Those of Laborers IJ> Agnoplated Press. WASHINGTON,- Deo.- IC— The senate toduy passed the Pananiii oiinnl emer gency! uppropriat lon bill, but tho result was not uttulned until after the de bate on .the bill had boon continued the greater part of the day to the ex clusion of practically nil uthnr Imsl nessi Set speeches were mado by. Mr. Ijncon in advocacy of his amendment requiring estimates for the mud I com mission salaries; by Mr. Allison, who devoted, himself largely 'to the details of tho bill; by Mr, Ctilberson, who irltlclsed the employment of Mr. "Bish op as a "press ugent;" by Mr. Stone, who criticised the purchuHe of Amer ican ships to carry Panama supplies In face of the announced determination to go abroad for vessels under the con ditions then existing, and by Mr. New lands, who expressed the opinion that the construction of the canal xhould have been entrusted to the geological Burvey. A substitute for Mr. Itncon's amend ment, offered by Mr. Hale, was ac cepted. It specifically requires that 'congress shall be supplied with regu lar estimates of all salaries except those paid to laborers, pkllled and un skilled. Otherwise, the bill was passed as reported from the committee. During the session Mr. Hale made the authorized announcement that Mr 13ishop's duty as "press agent" would be discontinued. Want* Estimate of Salaries • When the canal bill was taken tip by the senate today, Mr. flacon took the floor in support of his amendment re quiring quarterly estimates of the salaries and other expenses of the ca nal commission. He said that under the present sys tem congress was deprived of the op portunity for proper scrutiny of the salaries paid to the commission's em ployes. Although there was really stronger ground for such estimates In the case of the canal employes than in the regular departments of the gov ernment, he said such a course would go far toward preventing the extrava grance practiced on the commission. He commented on tho fact that Mr. Shonts' salary was more than twice ps much as that paid to the chief jus tice of the supremo court of the United Slates, and said it was not the policy of the government to emulate the high salaries paid by private corporations. ■Even the auditor of the commission gets $10,000, while tho man who passes ■upon his work receives only $4000, and the executive head of the department, the secretary of war, only $8000. "In my humble judgment," he said, "the man does not live whose per sonal services are worth $150,000." He said. In reply to Mr. Spooner, that ho thought that the $30,000 paid the chief engineer of the commission too great. ; , "I would not pay any of them more 1 This Splendid f I OHa I n% HI a ft Mßjrjufl^L HMHm '^ j|s>cß§Qi£r*~^i* 'rv* "^ l>^ LbSSmBShL.

Mr. Stone recalled thp policy nn nounced by the rnnal nuthorltle* last rprlng with rpferenco to tho purchase of foreign ships to be used In the canal work when they could be secured more cxpedltlously nnd more cheaply tfian American vessels. The policy htta, hP snld, met with his Instant approval but he was -sorry to say that while It hnd been "Inaugurated with much thunder ing, It had gone out with a fizzle." He said the policy of going abroad for ships had been based on the theory that there were no available ships to be had In the United States nnd he de clareU that there had bepn no change In the conditiotm between May when the policy was adopted, and July, when the two ships were bought from the Ward line at the price of $1,300,000. This purchase, Mr. Btone contended, had been made at the price given when two vessels of equal caoaelty could have been bought in England for $750,000. Mr. flalllngpr said that the English ships belonged to a concern thnt had failed and were a bargain counter af fair and they were disposed of to other parties before the proffer nt tho price given could be investigated. Mr. Newlands spoke of the general merits of the rannl enterprise, px presslng the opinion that the canal work should have been entrusted to the geological survey, ns the irrigation reclamation work hud 'been. Mr. Culberson withdrew his amend ment nnd the bill was passed without division. At 4:36 p. m. the senate went Into executive session nnd Jit 4:53 adjourned. 

HOUSE DISCUSSES INSURANCE Indications That Debate on Subject Will Be Prolonged By Associated Press. WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.— Tho house indulged Itself again totlny to the ex tent of four hours of what was many times termed an academic discussion of federal control of Insurance. It was the fourth day of the debate and In terCßt of members had appreciably di minished. Democratic contention for state rights predominated in the ora tory.

More than 105 members have applied for recognition on the mihject of In surance nnd th»re Is no disposition to limit the debate. Representative Norrls of Nebraska cpened the debate. He saw objection for referring the matter to nny but the Judiciary committee, because In his opinion a constitutional amendment might bo. necessary before anything could be done to regulate Insurance. It wns pointed out by Mr. Stanley of Kentucky that, thero wna great danger to thfi liberties of the people In the constant encroachment of federal courts on matters properly belonging to state courts. To give federal courts author ity over an Insurance contract, which he said whh the simplest contract, would be to set thn precedent to glvp the same Jurisdiction lo nil contracts, which would be the death knell of freedom and the right of trial by Jury. Mr. Hulllvnn of Massachusetts paid his rpspects to President Roosevelt by stating that he did not believe him In fallible either In his law, his state policy or In ills recollection of conver sations with distinguished visitors. Arguing- ngalnst federal control of In surance, Mr. Hulllvan maintained there was ample slate mithorlty to regulate legal abuses, and ho continued: "Neither state nor national legisla tures can legislate honesty Into a board o? directors of high Ilnnnee sitting in Now York nny more than they can legislate thirst out of the citizens of lowa, Kansas or Maine."
