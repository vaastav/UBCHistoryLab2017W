The Now York Sun, which rather favored the election of Harrison, und which bitterly opposed Cleveland, ??illumines" the President's message in this manner: I "For originality, grasp of public questions, sense of perspective in the statement of the condition of natural affairs, Harrison's message compares unfavorably with the llrst message sent to Congress by President Hayes. This is saying rather a severe thing, but it is strictly true. Tho weakest man who ever occupied the White House hud more to offer Congress in i the way of information and sugges- ? tions, offered with more vigorous individuality of expression than the present chief executive of the United States can exhibit or command."
