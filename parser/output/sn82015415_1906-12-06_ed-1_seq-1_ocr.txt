"But," continued the Commissioner, "I believe that where people come Into our country prepared to do the right thing by the country of their adoption and not seeking to antagonize Ameri can Institutions, they should enjoy all the benefits of our American system of government.

It not be right for me so to do and you must not question me in this regard further." Commissioner Sargent was asked to Interpret tho following cable quotation from the President's message, relative to Hawaii: "When ever the leaders In the great Industries of the Islands finally adopt our Ideals and Join In developing a rolddlo class of substantial citizens, a -way wlll bo found to deal with the in dustrial and commercial problems of :the territory." "I believe tho President means, when he refers to a 'middle class' for Ha--wall," said Sargent "such men as my self and yourself, men who have to work for a living, and, more broadly .speaking peoplo who come to these Isl ands with a view to making a homo and a livelihood and growing up with the country and getting a llttlo some thing out of the land.

The President gen erally speaks emphatically and he gen erally means what he says. "These islands should be good for something besides raising cane and It Is tho President's desire to see the peoplo of tho middle class have a chance here, and I believe that such people as these just arlved In the Su veric will go far toward making this country what It should be. "I would not be at all surprised If President Roosevelt decided to make a trip to Hawaii. It would bo odd If he overlooked so Important a portion of tho United States. Ho has been to Panama and thero Is no reason what ever for his not coming here. I think you will see him here. Ho has also talked of making a trip to the Philip pines, but whether he will accomplish that Journey I cannot say." "It is unfortunate," said Sargent, "that such fair minded newspapermen as Honolulu possesses were not sup plied with advanco copies of tho Pre sident's message so that the whole text could be referred to and the full and correct meaning In regard to Ha waii, and otherwise, given to the pub lic almost as soon as the cable.

The prompt capture of these Islands and tho Philip pines would be one of the first mea sures attempted by Japan. Natural ly tho property holders In both groups would be likely to suffer great loss In such nn event and tho confiscation of tho sugar property of Americans would follow. But nsldo from that feature of tho possibilities, thero is ono other that the talk of war is causing certain local people not a little worry. It Is the American Investors In tho Japanese war bonds, who are wondering what would be their status In event of a war. English and American Investors took up tho bulk of the Japanese war. bonds that were Issued by Japan to enable her to carry on her recent war with Russia. Thero were two Issues of six per cent war bonds, one of $30,000,000 and one of $60,000,000 of which one half was allotted to American subscribers. That Is $35,000,000 of these two Issues were bought In America and are presumably i Tho T. K. K. S. S.

"The majority of the Hawaiian Plant ers have been In favor of a middle class for some time," said W. O. Smith this morning In answer to a question In regard to his Interpretation of that part of the President's message urging the leaders of the great industries of Hawaii to support the policy of devel oping a middle class In these Islands, "and they have endeavored not only In theory but also In practice to Intro duce a middle class here. "That feeling on their part led to tho Introduction twenty-flvo years ago of 10,000 Portuguese which have been in creased now to 20,000, Later a shipload of Norwegians of the agricultural class were brought from Europe and they, for the most part, settled on Kauai. "Then Germans were brought and these settled on tho Llhue Plantation on Kauai. Americans have been brought here. Captain James McKee, nearly thirty years ago Introduced Americans and employed "them on the Ulupalakua plantation, "Later two different attempts were made to solve the problem by Introduc ing negroes who were taken to Wal luku and Lahalna. Then the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company experi mented with Italians. Later Ewa Plantation Induced a number of farm ers from California to come hero. "Thero have been severe difficulties In tho way of tho planters In their at tempts to Introduce a mTddlo class of Americans or Europeans. Before an nexation sugar and rice were the only two products which could bo Introduc ed free of tariff Into tho United States.

Half of this Issue or $75,000,000 was alloted to America. The subscriptions for these closed March 30, 1005, the sub scriptions amounting to $500,000,000. Those wove issued to tho subscribers at S7 5-S per cent making them the equivalent of a six per cent bond. Tills issue Is secured by n Hen of tho to bacco monopoly which tho government of Japan holds on tho tobacco business of tho empire. A war with Japanese would mean the cancellation of those bonds and the elimination of that annual Interest. There aro Hawaiian Investors who would be Involved In such losses. At the time that the lists for subscriptions to Japanese war bonds were opened, It was stated that W. G. Irwin had subscribed to $30,000. Besides this at least $20,000 of locally owned Japanese bonds are known of. If Japan ever had a war with America, those invest ments would stand a good chance of going by the board whether America won or not.

It Is high thno that somo one took steps to observe our na tional honor and Integrity. "Do I think that that recommenda tion for the naturalization of tho Jap anese was made as tho result of tho present friction betweeon Japanese and America?
