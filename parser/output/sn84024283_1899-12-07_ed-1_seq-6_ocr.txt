THE m DIOH'T REALIZE THEIR DtXCEB. for Twelve Dayi and Nights a Bat talion of the ThJrty-Vlrt Yolan - teem, I nder Licnt.-Col. Webb 11a je Bailed the Ship, to Keep Her Afloat. Peoria, 111., 2'ov. 30. Clerk llohr port Manauense anchored in Manila bay. Tuesday, 33 dajs from San Fran eisco, there were several feel of water In her hold, and 400 grim-, greasy. hungTy, exhausted soldiers and sailors, who had been passing- buckets of wa ter since November 17, night and day. First Assistant Engineer Dunlevy was under arrest, and, according to Col. Webb Uayes official report, the ehiei engineer also would have been under srrest if there had been any one to re place him. Didn't Kion Their Danger. The colonel's report also declares that the captain of the vessel told him that the only thing which brought them through was the fact that the men were greenhorns, and failed to realize their danger, while experi enced seamen would have deserted the ship and taken to the boats in mid ocean. The Manauense is a chartered ship filing the British flag. She started from San Francisco, accompanied by the transport Pekin, which carried the remainder of the regiment, and en countered heavy seas to Honolulu, without accident. Vessel was radermanned. After starting, it developed that she as undermanned, and soldiers had to bo detailed to act as firemen, coal pass ers and waiters, and to do other work. Ilefore reaching Honolulu, the crew concluded that the ship was not safe, and the majority agreed to desert. Though they were closely watched, many of the crew succeeded in getting away, and the Manauense left Hone lulu with less than half her crew. The captain of the transport, on November 17, told Col. Ilayes that the vessel had sprung a leafc, and an investigation re united in finding several feet of water in her hold. No Pomps Available. The steam pumps were tried, but failed to work,and there were no hand pumps on board. However, 46 buck rts were found, others were impro vised, and the soldiers were organized into shifts, and, stripped and forming lints, they began bailing, the officers working with the men, passing the buckets which were sent up to the deck by a windlass. The longest time a shift could stand was two hours, and often the period was not longer thar. half an hour. The bailing being con tinued until the ship anchored here. Mar Ii Incry Collapsed. The same day the leak was discov ered, the machinery collapsed, and the electric lighting plant and evaporat ing, distilling and refrigerating ap paratus failed to work. There were no lamps, and the few candle: found were exhausted after a few days. During the last week of the passage, the Manauense was in utter darkness t night. She had been rolling in heavy sea all the way, but November 22 she en countered a typhoon and pitched and tossed alarmingly. In a Typhoon. The Pekin became separated from Ihe Manauense in the storm. The wa ter rose rapidly, and the bailing fore was doubled. But the buckets wert gradually smashed, and barrels and boxes were substituted for them. D6 men working in darkness, planks and pieces of iron shafting being vio lently dashed among them. The fire men uld only feed the fires by being ilifted on the shoulders of the othei men. through water waist deep. KnalncM Failed Frequently. Throughout the remainder of tht voyage the engines of the Manauense failed frequently, and the ship rolled for a few hours while the engines were repairing. Then the steamer would pitch again for a few hours. The meat and vegetables rotted be cause of the failure of the refrigera tors, and were thrown overboard. 4After the storm, the water supplied to the ship at Honolulu had to be used . for the boilers, and there was little or none for drinking. In fact, it is as serted that during the last week of the voyage the men lived almost en tirely on whisky, beer and hardtack All Were Exhausted. The officers and soldiers were utter ly exhausted when they reached Ma nila. They declare the engineers were grossly incompetent. The officers also say that the behavior of the troops was beyond praise. For days they worked in the dark, suffocating hold, with water sometimes up to their shoulders, and planks washing about in a manner dangerous to life and limb. The officers took the lead in bailing, and encouraged the men. A Searvey Captain. . The captain of the ship promised the men 25 cents a day for bailing, but he now proposes to pay them merely $1.50 per man. The soldier talk of libeling the ship. The regiment will proceed to Zam boanga on the Pekin, to garrison sev eral ports on the island of Mindanao. round Dead ta His CTiair. t.oshen, Ind., Dec. 1. Dr. M. M.

When the tanding party from the United States battleship Oregon, under L.ieuteiiat Commander McCracken, tcok the town yf Yigan, province of South llocos, last Sunday, they found there an escaped prisoner. A. L. Sonnenshein, who fur nished the first authentic account of the experience of Lieot. Gilmore, of the United States gunboat Yorktcwn, who, with a party from the Yorktown. was captured by the insurgents near Baler, on the east coast of Luzon, last April, while making an examination of the mouth of the river in nu armed beat. Carried Concealed Credentials. Mr. Sonnenshein was imprisoned at Abra for a long time with Lieut. Gil- ! more and seven sailors, but contrived to escape carrying a concealed note, written in naval cipher, dated Abra, November 19. addressed to: "Any Naval Officer." saying: "You may have perfect confidence in anything the bearer says. The note was signed "(iilmore." Mr. Sonnensheln's Story. According to Mr. Sonnenshein, when Lieut. Gilmore's launch entered the river from Baler harbor, under cover of Ensign W. II. Standley's gun, the landing was received with three vol leys. Two of the Americans were killed and two mortally wounded. Ev ery man was hit, Lieut. Gilmore receiv ing a flesh wound in the leg, and hi fool stuck fast in the mud. It was a choice between surrender and being slaughtered. Terms of Release An Insult. Lieut. Gilmore asked the terms of release. The insurgents proposed that he should procure the delivery to them of the arms and munitions of the Span ish garrison, undertaking, if this were accomplished, to send the Spaniards and Americans to the Yorktown. A sailor of Lieut. Gilmore's party carried the proposition to the garri son. The Spanish commandant replied :hat it was an insult to Spanish arms, and expelled the sailor, a Spanish sol dier firing upon him as he went. Aliened to be Executed. The Americans were then bound hand and foot and taken to San Isidro. when Gen. Luna ordered their execu tion. They were marched to the plaza and, in the presence of a great crowd, were aligned to be executed. Manly Protest Saved By Agnlnaldo Lieut. Gilmore said: "As an Ameri can officer and gentleman, I protest against being shot with my hand: tied." Agiunaldo interfered and prevented the execution. Imprisoned at Abra. When (Jen. Lawton approached Sar. Isidro last June the Americans were removed to Abra, where they were kept confined in cells for two minths Subsequent' they were allowed great er liberty, but the report that Lieut. Gilmore was given a house and servant is untrue. He had the same quarter as the men, and the Americans wen git en the same allowance as the Span ish prisoners five cents a day with which to buy rice and bananas, virtual ly the only rations. Disposition of American Troops. Gen. MacArthur is now in Ilayam Lang preparing to sweep the country on both sides of the Manila-Dagupar railroad. Gen. Wheaton is at San Fabian am Gen. Lawton at Tayug. The cordon from San Fabian to San Ifciuro covers all the roads and occu pies all the towns on the line. Th American policy is to prevent any more insurgents escaping to the nortl; and to force them toward the countrj wrst of the railroad. Maj.

Many of the American troops are suffering from exhaustion, fever or dysentery, and are in need of hospital treatment. Bravest Incident of the War. Capt. Fowler's march after Gen.

In Occupying the Attention of the Boers' lle leauerinff Forces. Loudon, Dec. 2. While the rumors uf the relief of Kimberley, current on the stock exchange, may be prematura in their literal sense, there seems no doubt that the .pressure on the garri son has been much lightened by Gen. Methuen's suceess, and the actual re lief of the place is likely to be a fact very scon. Why Methnen Hurried. A clew to the urgent reasons which dictated Gen. Methuen's hurried ! march may be found in Gov. Milner's hint to the relief committee at Cape Town to prepare for the reception ol ! 10,000 refugees, indicating that tha J garrison must have had reason to fear the reduction of Kimberley by starva tion and disease. News by Way of Pretoria. .The most recent news from Kimber ley comes by way of Pretoria, and al most seems to show that Kimberlet and Mafeking are acting in coucen with Gen. Methuen, for, at the timt the battle was raging at Gras Pan both Col. Kekewich and Col. Baden Powell made sorties and assailed tht beleaguerers. The result of the Mafe king sortie is not known, but accord ing to a dispatch from Pretoria, Col, f Kekewich inflicted considerable loss . on the Boers, two shells killing nine ! nd wounding 17 in a group of Boers Another Sortie From Mafe-ing. j A special from Pretoria, dated Sun day, November 26, says there was an ' other sortie from Mafeking, Saturday. 1 November 2': On the morning of thai i day the chartered police attacked Eloil's fort with great determination The fight was progressing when the : dispatch was sent. I Several ambulance trains left Mafe king, November 25, for the Free State, j where heavy fighting was expected during the then coming week, wher the Boers, it was added, would resist ' the advance of the British in the di ' rection of Kimberlej-. i Resumed the March Northward, j It is reported that Gen. Methuen re , sumed his march northward Wednes ( daj and expected to form a junctior with the Kimberley forces Saturday oj ' Sunday. I It is suggested in some quarters i that the Boer forces have withdrawn from the north of Cape Colony and mav be hurrvincr to attack Gen. Methuen's re a r: but as reinforce- ! merits have been pushed rapidly for j ward from Orange River and DeAar I it is claimed they ought to circumvent i such designs. An Inference. Irom Lord Wolseley s announce ment that it had been decided to call out one more division, it appears clear that the war office does not look for a speedy collapse of Boer resistance. The brief telegrams coming from Natal and the cential thecter of the war convev little information about the situation. Ladysmith Itelief Force. So far as known, the Ladj'smith re lief force is still at Frere, though the lu-idg-e was pernaps sumciently re paired to permit of its passage Novem ber .10, in which case the opposina forces mav already have come in con tact near Colenso where, apparently, the Boers are strongly intrenched on the north side of the river. Boers" Driven Back. A special dispatch received here to day from Frere, dated Tuesday, No vember 2S, says that while attempting o blow up a 300-foot bridge over th3 river at Colenso, the Boers were driven back by British artillery and mounted infantry. ABSOLUTE SILENCE PREVAILS. Ko Xews Received in London front the War in Sonth Africa Be coming Impatient. London, Dec. 2, 4:30 a. m. Absolute silence has fallen over affairs in South Africa. The war office has not yet re ceived Lord Methuen's casualty list. The public and the press, hitherto pa tient, are beginning to murmur at the apparently needless delay which keeps many families in a state of painful suspense. It is regarded as practically certain that Lord Methuen has been rein forced by half a battalion of the Gor don Highlanders, a regiment of caval ry and aj tmttery of artillery, and that De'Aar l is being daily reinforced by troops to hold the lines of communica tion. It is supposed that the Natal ad vance has been delayed by the neces sity of getting supplies to Pieter maritzburg, but not a word emanates from any of the various commands. Robbed by a Cwoman.

One Man Holds l'l Two HessfKgeri mi il Secures Seventeen Hun dred Dollars. Charleston, S. C, Dec 2. An unknown white man, closely masked, held up two messengers in a Southern Express Cc. car last night, and, under cover of a rttolver, compelled them to give up $1,700 in cash. Eight thousand dol lars in another safe was overlooked by the outlaw, who accomplished his work without any aid. The robbery took place near Branch ville, S. C, on the Southern railway The train had just left the station when the messengers, Ramsey and Rhodes, were covered with two revol vers held in the hands cf the robber. One messenger was made to stand with his hands over his head and the other was commanded to hand over the money packages in the safe. Sev enteen hundred dollars was quickly se cured, and the robber, after warning the messengers not to put a foot out side of the car until the train had got under way again, pulled the bell and jumped off as the train slotted up. The conductor saw the robber escap ing alongside the track, but thinking him a tramp signalled the engineer ahead. When the train got under way the messengers came out and told their story. The car was an accommoda tion baggage and express, and the door had been opened to permit the conductor to reach the baggage sec tion, which was in the forward end of the car. The sheriff of Dorchester, with six men and two hounds, have been hur ried to the scene of the robbery. A DASTARDLY ATTEMPT. Tried to Destroy the Home and Fam ily of a Lawyer by Dynamite. Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 2. A spe cial to the Times from Cedar Rapids, la., says: A dastardly attempt to destroy the home and family of Attorney W. L. Cron, was attempted last night by tin known parties, who placed three pounds of dynamite at his front door and ignited a 14-foot fuse which burned down into the fulminating cap, but failed to explode. Cron was awak ened by the smell, and later descended and went to his stable. He found the mysterious package, but supposing it to be something belonging to his sou threw it into the hallway. This morn ing he examined the package and at once reported the case to the police who are at work on slight clew. Fol lowing the Urbana outrage in which one man lost his life, the people are thoroughly aroused and incensed. Open threats of summary justice" are frequently heard. COUNETRFEITER SENTENCED.

Hughes reports from Central Panay that Iloilo prov ince, one-third of island, is cleared of insurgents. By forced marches with two battalions from Labuano, by way of Calinog, he obliged, the enemy to engage at Passi, on 26th ultimo, and drove him with loss to the mountains in detached bodies, capturing ten field pieces, of which two were breech loaders, also nine rifles and several thousand rounds of small ammuni tion.

Considerable, interest is felt here in the news that the insurgents at Bayonbong have surrendered, particularly as the num ber is said to be greater than hereto fore captured by the United States troops at any one time. Bayonbong is the city to which Aguinaldo at one time contemplated retreating for the purpose of locating the rebel capital, after he was forced to flee from Tar lac, but the American troops pressed him so hard that he was unable t carry out his intention. Gen. Otis dispatch of yesterday in dicated that Bayonbong had been captured on November 28, and it is thought this is the same place referred to in the Manila dispatch.

The annual repon of Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock, while summing- up the work In all the bu reaus, Is of special interest by reason ot Its statements regarding pension policies At the close of the fiscal year there wert 991,519 pensioners, a decrease of 2,195 dur- ing the year. The average annual valua of all pensions was $132.74. The Spanish war probably will increase the pension roll during the current fiscal year. Secretary Hitchcock urges legislation to definitely construe the act of June 27, JS90. relating to widows pensions. Regarding this he says : "In order to more exactly de fine the words 'means of support I approve the recommendation of the commissionet of pensions that the act of June 27, 1S90, b so amended that a pensionable status bt granted to widows whose income, inde pendent of the proceeds of their daily labor. Is not in excess of $250 per annum." Tht report also recommends legislative author ity for biennial examinations of pension, ers; legislation prohibiting the payment ol "any compensation whatever to pension at torneys and agents for any service in con. nection, with any claim or proceeding un. aer the pension laws, except such as mav within certain limits fixed by congress b allowed by the commissioner of pension! and paid from the pension money as not provided with respect to 'claims for pen. sion," and for the delivery free of anj part paid letter or packet addressed to pen. sion agencies. The secretary's report estimates the lr rigable area of the arid region of the United States at 74,000,000 acres, capable of comi fortably supporting under a proper irriga. tlon system 50,000,000 people. Reasonable expenditures both by the federal and state governments looking to a well-defined irri. gation system are urged. Nearly 50 pro posed new forest reserves or additions to those already established are under consid eration. The Dawes commission reports the time has not yet arrived for the In stallation of a territorial or state govern ment in Indian Territory, owing mainly to lack of uniform land tenures. Attention is called to the phenomenal In crease In railway traffic in the last two years, amounting approximately in in creased earnings In 1S99 over 1S9S to $9,- 000,000 and the previous year to $23,000,000. the Increase being only limited by the lack of cars to carry products. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1S99, the public lands disposed of aggregated 9,182,413.16 acres. The total cash receipts during the year amounted to $3,070,137.34, an increase of $792,142.16. The total area of public lands is approxi mately fixed at 1,0S2,138,221 acres, of which 929.308.06S acres are undisposed of and 152.- 380,153 acres have been reserved for va rious purposes. Excluding 5,320 Indians in New Tork and 62,500 embraced in the five civilized tribes. the Indians number approximately 181,586 as against 180.132 reported last year. REVIEW OF TRADE. November Somewhat Quieter Than the Preceding Month-Price Situ ation Generally Strona-. New York, Dec. 2. Bradstreet's says: "Warm weather and a holiday have im parted an appearance of irregularity and even dullness to some' lines of distributive trade, completing a month which has been on the whole quieter than was the pre ceding month, but one which still makes satisfactory comparison with a correspond ing period a year ago, when the weathet conditions particularly favored distrib utive business in seasonable goods. The nrice situation generally is apparently one of notable strength In view of these con-; ditions. Farm products, it is true, notably wheat and corn, have been weak and lower on unsatisfactory foreign demand and a bearish influence exercised by in creasing supplies of the former grain. Other cereals are stronger, however. Pro visions have been lower, largely on in creased receipts of hogs, but lard has been steady on good export demand. Iron and steel are even quieter than they were a week ago, and some shading of prices, more in the nature of readjustment, how ever, than of weakness, have given an ap pearance of irregularity. The feature of the week has been the agreement upon iron ore prices, placing the price for the com ing season, as was intimated in this column last week, at nearly double that paid at the opening of the present season. The In dustrial situation has been rather im proved by the practical agreement upon a sliding scale system in the New England cotton manuiacturing districts. Some fur ther advances in wages of railway em ployes and of glass workers are to be noted, and some strikes of coal miners have been settled." R. Q. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade says: "Business continues wonderfully large, prosperous and healthy. As the de tailed statement of failures by branches oi business cannot be made until next week, it seems well to say that in four weeks fail ures have been reported amounting to $6, 848,590, against $8,110,475 in the same weeks of last year, $11,610,195 in 1897 and over $12. 000,000 in 196 and also in 1895. Tet the vol ume of solvent trade represented by ex changes at the principal clearing houses has been for the month 22.5 per cent, greater than last year and 46 per cent, greater than in 1S92. In many lines the volume of busi ness has been larger than in October, not withstanding the extraordinary flood of buying ever since the beginning of last March. "Failures for the week have been 144 in the United States, against 281 last year, and q in Canada, against 19 last year." 

PUBLIC IS RESTLESS Suppression of War News Is Exasperating- and Leaves the Peo ple In Suspense. London, Dec. 2. Absolute silence has fallen over affairs in South Africa. The war office has not yet received Lord Methuen's casualty list. The public and the press, hitherto patient, are be ginning to murmur at the apparently needless delay which keeps many fam ilies in a state of painful suspense. It is regarded as practically certain that Lord Methuen has been reenforced by half a battalion of the Gordon Highland ers, a regiment of cavalry and a bat tery of artillery, and that De Arjr if being daily reenforced by troops to hold the lines of communication. . It is supposed that the Natal ad vance has been delayed by the neces sity of getting supplies to Pietermar itzburg; but not a word emanates fron; any ol the various commands. FIGURES AND FACTS.

ROOT GIVES HIS IDEAS. ftlaay SusTffcstions Are Made br tha Secretary of War 1b His An nual Report. "Washington, Dec. 2. The annual report of Elihu Root, secretary of war, was ma public Friday. The first half is devoted to the operation of the army in the Philip pines. Cuba and Porto Rico. The report iriirea fnll tiictnT-v nf f hn military OPera- j tions In the Philippines from August 12, 1898. ud to the present time. An impor tant feature of the report Is a comprehen sive outline of a plan of government for Porto Rico. It is understood that Presi dent McKInley is In entire accord with Sec retary Root on this question, and that the plan outlined by the secretary will be tha Identical plan which the president will rec ommend to congress in his annual message. Concerning the plan of government pro posed for Porto Rico, Secretary Root cites the. Paris treaty, which provides that con gress shall determine the civil rights and political status of the natives f the terri tory ceded to this government. The scheme outlined Includes a definite declaration by congress of what American laws sro to M made applicable to the Porto Ricans, fol lowing which it is recommended that a federal Judiciary be established. The form of insular government proposed provides for the appointment of a governor by the president, to be confirmed by the senate: the chief officers of state customary under our system, and a legislative council to be composed of the chief officers of state and a minority selected from the people of the Island by the president. All sets of the council are to be subject to the veto power of the governor and to be passed over the veto by a two-thirds vote. No law is to become effective u.itil it has remained with out this approval for 30 days after its pres entation to congress or the president. It is suggested that voting right should be lim ited to those who read and write or who own a small amount of property. The secretary considers it too early to es tablish a local legislature, giving the in habitants the franchise only In municipal affairs. Abolition of the duties between the Unit ed States and Porto Rico is recommended. The report cites Jn brief the history of the military operations in the Philippines, Porto Rico and Cuba during the fiscal year enteed June 30, 1P99. Relief work in all three places is dilated upon. The transport serv ice, It Is stated, includes 51 steam trans ports, with a saving in work done over or dinary commercial rates of $501,000. The re moval of the dead from Cuba and similar work contemplated from the Philippines is touched upon. An increased and reorganized regular army, with many new and novel features in the system iavolved, is earnestly recom mended. Radical changes, which contem plate the betterment of the service in every department are proposed. The changes in the army organisation and the increase proposed are in the first instance specified particularly, while in the second no definite statement is made except as to artillery. The present artillery force is recommended to be increased five times its present strength. The increase in officers and enlisted men is to be sufficient to man the equipment in the seacoast fortifica tions, besides providing for the other branches of the service. In order that there may be a more gen eral dispensation of military knowledge to officers both of the regular army and the national guards, the latter of whom it is Intended to bring into closer touch with the federal authorities, it is also proposed to establish a war college. This institu tion is to be in charge of a staff headed by the major general commanding. Experts are to be detailed for such service for stated periods. Likewise staff appoint ments are to run for a specified time, after which the officer whose term of service as such appointee expires must serve one year In the line before being eligible for staff selection. The secretary recommends the enlarge ment of West Point military academy and an increase in the number of cadets to be admitted annually. Especial attention is to be paid to the artillery branch of the service in that institution and in the army. A ranking officer of artillery is recommend ed, there being no such officer now. The regular army now numbers 61,999 en listed men and 2.248 officers, making a total of 64.247, and a volunteer force numbering S0.050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers, making a total of 34,574. The deaths from all causes, Including casualties in action, for the 14 months from May, 1898, to June, 1899, in clusive, were 6.619. The deaths from disease from all causes were at an annual death rate of but 25.68 per thousand. Estimates of the cost of maintenance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, are as follows: Civil establishment $1,967,706 Support of the army and military academy 87,0l5,2f Fortifications and river and har bor improvements 30,490.576 Miscellaneous : 5.196.799 A net deficiency appropriation of $16,000, 000 is asked for. The secretary declares In favor of a cable from the United States to the Philippines, via Hawaii and Guam. Among his other recommendations is one that Gen. Shatter be retired, with the full rank of major general. The continuance of the river and harbor improvement work now under contract, it Is announced, will cost $15,436,626.68. A monument to Gen. Grant, to be erected in Washington, is also recommended, as is a memorial bridge extending from the cap ital city to Arlington, where the national cemetery is located.
