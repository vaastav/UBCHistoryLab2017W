Wilson's Greatest Word j r irr President Wilson's last message to congress is, be yond doubt, his greatest kate paper. It is the greatest because it comes at just the right time with a straight from the shoulder blow. It is greatest because It will do more good to the allied cause than any other one thing short of a victory in the field. It is greatest be cause of its effect upon 'Germany and the neutrals. It is greatest because of its courage and its firmness and its practical aims. He not only asks for war upon Austria, hut asks it in such a manner as to 'make Austria tremble. He not only strikes at Germany's web of peace propaganda, but he asks for power to sternly repress the Hun's activities over here. The test of the greatness of this message will lie in its effect upon the civilians of all the nations" making war upon Germany. It will strengthen them and inspire them and weld them closer together. The president, ia this message, publicly pledges his word that every hum a a effort possible will be made by this country to beat the Hun to his knees. That was the word the country wanted. And that France and England wanted, too. The mistakes and delays and miscalculations and con troversies and inefficiency of, the governmental machinery will be forgiven if only the nation is assured that the right spirit is behind it all. If it is these mistakes will be corrected and lagging feet will., be sparred forward and incompetents relegated to the rear. The president's message is a lighted lemp in the house that is over-; sLadowed by 'the clouds of war. The Warren District will honor Sheriff Harry Wheeler at a banquet tomorrow night. And it honors Itself by psyng this tribute to a "brave and competent official and modest gentleman. Arizona, it is announced, made' a better showing than any other Ptate in the recent Y. M. C. A. war 'fund drive, scoring 110 per cent over the amount of her quota. The average for the nation was only 46 per cent over the national quota. The word "only" is not used in the pre ceding sentence as term of reproach but In contrast with what Arizona did. The Morning Oasis made its bow to the desert sand at Nogales December 1 and quite a lively and pleasing ap pearance it made in the Arizona newspaper field. The Weekly Oasis has withstood the drouths of twenty-three years and will be continued. The daily, under the same management and editorial direction, (C. N. and Allen T. Bird), has been made necessary by growing business and increased population along the border. Tb3 Review, looking westward along the border line, past the cactus; and mcsquite, in glad to see this new Oasis. - Before LaVacquiere in the Cambrai sector Saturday the British, according to ua official dispatch, killed more Germaus between daylight and dark than during any other similar period during the entire war. It was a slaughter grim and great. The German troops advanced in fifteen waves out in the open before machine gun fire and made ten separate attacks upon this village. Tbeir sacrifice was all in vain as they gained no military ad vantage at all and only a f light amount of ground. It was the supreme German effort to break through and gain a decision in this sector that would offset the victory of General Byng last week. But. the dogged bravery of British troops saved the day. Reinforcements have arrived and the danger is past. But it is this kind of fighting that the allied generals are using all their skill to bring about. If they can take a commanding position and then hold it against costly counter attacks their great strategy of the war is being achieved and the Ger man generals are playing right into their bands. The process of attrition is being multiplied. Germany may not have to pay for bcr Cambrai slaughter this year, but next spring she will need those legions that wore sacri ficed there by German pride in not giving way before the English. 9 THE 

RAILROAD SITUATION. Henry Clews, the New York banker, discusses the rail- nod situation as follows: The railroad situation promises to be taken up for ssr ous consideration immediately by this session of con tress. Our railroads are going through a rapid process cf centralization, the object in view being the operation of the roads on the unit basis. The Railroad War Board at Washington is strongly in favor of the pooling system, which will facilitate handling the traffic and hasten both efficiency and economy. The demands of the roads for new equipment, facilities, etc., are still unprovided tor. These imperative needs are now recognized by the admin istration, and some action may soon be expected. The Interstate Commerce Commission will probably grant the desired 15 per cent to at least some of the lines, but this wBJ sot suffice to give the roads a living wage under present conditions, nor will it remedy the funda mental weakness in our railroad situation, which is lack cf unity. Varloas projects for financial relief are under discus sion, such as a direct loan by the government or the guarantee of interest or dividends by the government. These proposals are considered practical, while public ownership is neither feasible nor desirable. Public opin ion is not ripe for such action. Talk of reducing dividends for the purpose of meeting necessary outlays is absurd. The total dividends paid by American railroads are con siderably less than $350,000,000 annually on a capital stock of approximately $9,000,000,000, or about 4 per cent To reduce dividends would inevitably impair the credit of even the strongest roads and make it still more im possible for them to raise money by either stocks or bonds. Supposing tbe roads were to reduce dividends, say, one quarter, what would be the result? Slmplv a crushing blow to their credit and a saving of less than $100,000,000 This would be a trifling matter compared with the billion or more needed; while any possible reduction in dividends could have no effect whatever upon wages. The only thoroughgoing solution of the railroad prob lem is to amend the law so as to permit railroad pooling which will permit operation of the roads as a single sys tem under government regulation, and at tbe same time abolish tbe confusion and waste arising from operating Rippling Rhymes (By 

WALT MASON.) AMBITION. When I was young and had no doubt tiat I was destined to be great; I'd distance every other scout, and be the land's chief magistrate. I knew I'd leave a deathless name when I pulled out for t'other shore, and in the worll's great hall of fame my chrom'd hang shove the door. I thought not Of the ways and means, of how I shoud put up the grass,' I only knew that kings and queens would be the people in my class. I jeered at ob stacles, forsooth! My upward way I'd bravely keep; for in the golden days of youth tjie toil of Hercules looks cheap. I sit beneath my vine and tree, and backward look across the years, and all my busted dreams I see, and bellow like a brace of steers. I never reached a dazzling height what boot the wherefores and the whys? And every time I made a fight, the other fellow got the prize. The prizes of this world increase, but none is added to my store; I've run for justice of the peace three times, and goose eggs were my score. I sit be neath my tree and vine, and see the buoyant youths go by, with golden visions just like mine, with dreams of heights that reach the sky. From me they bear no caterwaul, no dreary wail of wasted beans; for if the boys didn't dream at all, they'd be old men while in their teens. A CARTOON WITHOUT WORDS ARIZONA HAS PART IN PROTECTION OF RAILROAD CREDITS under the laws of forty-eight different states. For the purpose of immediate relief railroad bonds guaranteed as to principal and Interest by the government would be. the surest and least objectionable plan. A SPLENDID VICTORY. V The yote in favor of the million dollar bond issue for permanent highways in Cochise county was a revelation even to the most ardent supporter of the proposition. It was expected that the population centers would give good majorities for the issue, but there were fears that the voters of sparsely settled districts far away from main highways of travel would vote strongly against the bonds. These fears were realized only in two precincts, Willcox and Bowie. This last named community went "whole hog or none" in the matter, casting every vote against the bonds. Bowie people must be strongly op posed to good roads. But the dry farmers and ranchers from far and near generally supported the bonds. They refuted that old charge that farmers are always opposed to bond issues and heavier taxes. In fact, the rural vote generally on the bonds was the shining feature of the election. Bisbee and the Warren District did better even than expected; Douglas not as well; Tombstone made a blue ribbon showing. When the returns came in Tues day night there wis general rejoicing among the Bisbee citizens who are heaviest tax-payers. They knew that increase in property values and business would a hundred times compensate for the original investment. Cochise county can well point with intense pride to her record: "A million for good roads, and spent in a lump." DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS. Roger Lewis, a well informed newspaper correspond ent, writing from Russia, divides the Bolshevik! into three parts as follows: First, there are innumerable German paid agitators and propagandists whose sole purpose is to reduce the country to complete anarchy. The 'second class is composed of fanatics, escaped criminals, released political prisoners and expatriated Russians whom political amnesty brought back to the country. These, the sense of accumulated wrongs, real and imaginary, of half a century has driven into a frenzy of anarchistic revolt, and. without sharing the motives of their Germau leaders, they find their doctrines quite con genial. - The third and largest class Is a tremendous lody of ignorant worklngmen and soldiers -with nebulous notions of democracy, who have been taught by their leaders that freedom is a debauch of idleuess and that properly- in terpreted liberty mean a a complete reversal of power which will give them a gratifying tyranny tver their old masters. Through tbe appointment of R. N Fredericks of Prescott. .president of tbe Prescott National bank, , as a member of the advisory committee of the National Association of Owners of Railroad Securities; announcement of which has just been made by Pres ident S. Da vies Warfield, Arisona in vestors become prominently identified with a movement of national impor tance recently launched to protect the credit of American railroads by stabilizing the securities of these com panies. The advisory committee is the con trolling body of the association, and Vhe selection of Mr. Fredericks to bead the movement fn Arizona is in itiative of the prominence of those dentlfied with the organization throuhout the country, its officers and upporters Including many of the lead ing financiers and business men of the. nation. Thousands of individual tiembers have enrolled in the move ment, and many others here and ibroad who. while having no invest ment in transportation companies. favor fair treatment of the carriers, have also become members. Tbe association, organized in Balti more several months ago through the initiative of Mr. Warfield, who is president of the Continental Trust company and one of the leading finan ciers of the south.' fills a long-felt need for an authoirtative organisa tion to speak for the owners of the railroads in matters relative to their public affairs. This has been undertaken vigorous ly through a campaign to protect the interests of large and small investors In railroad stocks and bonds. Its rep resentatives have appeared before the Interstate commerce commission and at other public gatherings to present the case of those whose savings and other funds have undergone such a tremendous shrinkage as a result of the recent general decline in security values. The association's activities in clude a comprehensive campaign of. education to' create an interest on the. part of investors in the affairs of their j companies and tbe solution of proo- lems confronting them. It is also olanned to inform the public of the widespread distribution of raiiroad se curities and their vital relation to the economic life of the people. A recent, computation by President; Warfield shows the .direct and indirect ownership of the railroads to be vest ed in 50.600,000 people, nearly one- half of our population, as follows: Individuals outright. 1.000.000, own-. ine 110.000.000 000 worth; life insur-l ance policies in force, held by 33.000,-; 000 persons, representing a total of! $L55C,000,000; savings oanxs, wunt 10.000.000 depositors, representing $847,000,000; fire and marine, casualty I and other insurance companies, .rep-1 resenting a total of $649,000,000; be-j nevolent associations, colleges, char itable institutions, $350,000,000. !

That is the president's message in a sentence. It is a bugle call to battle scarred England and bleeding Franre and to the eager, anxious Amrican patriots who are waiting to join in the xrorli old game. Yes and it means tar and feathers for tbe pacifists hereafter who oppose tbe war. Presi dent Wilson spoke for tbe nation.
