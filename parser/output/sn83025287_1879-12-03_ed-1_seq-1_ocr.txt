Senator Burnside called up his resolution of last session, reaffirming the Monroe doctrine, in co inaction with the proposed Darien canal. He said practically the quetnn was whether a canal should bJ biult under the protection of the United States or a foreign government. It had been said that it was a question of the powers, in wthei word*, that European govern ments would, by force ot arms, if necessary, control this thoioughfare. This, he thought, would be impossible. In case of war we would bv a patriotic effort arm five million men, and by the use ot modern improvements in engineer pve could prevent any foreign war vessels entcutig our harbors. It would bo impossible to transport and to land men enough to over come us Although tho Monroe doctrine had never becu put on the statute books, it was part ot our unvmt'en law. He showed that our greatest statesmen had declaied its wis dom and apptoied its aim. Wo had put it into practice with regard to foreign interference in Meiico. Could it be possible that wc would normit a European power, or any country under European influence, to construct a canal across the isthmus whicn would be so useful in timeof peaceaudso important' time of war? Its construction in such a manner would be fatal to the development of American ideas, on which p.I? founded our hopes of future welfare. A grave responsibility would rest upou mgiess should it now abandon to chance and urjumstanco the maintamance of oiv supremacy on this continent, iMBT PRrVILEGFS Senator Lo^an introduced a bill to extend to the port of 0'i eiso th/ privileges in regard to entry of meicb.aid.ise for transportation in bond, p"tc contained in section 2990 to 2995, revised statutes, inclusive Referred.

Adjourned. CAUCUSES. DEMOCRATS IN COUNCIL. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.The Democratic sena tors met in caucus this morning. There was a largo attendance. Senator Wallace, chairman of the caucus, announced that the meeting had been called as usual at the beginning of the session to consider the subject of reviving Dem ocratic membership of committees prior to re appointment by the Senate. No vacancies hav ing been created by death or resignation in Democratic membership during the recess of Congress, and there being no application pre sented to-day for exchange, it was resolved that tbe majority representation shall remain fixed as at the extra session, and the chairman was directed to notify representatives that committee positions occupied by Senator Chandler arc at the disposal of the minority. A somewhat general discussion then ensued concerning the distribution of the Senate pat ronage. Several of the Senators complained it had not been equally distributed, and said that when officers of the Senate were spoken to on tno subject they referred to the caucus reso lutions of last year, which bound them to re tain certain employes except in the event of misconduct, and contended that with the re mainder of the patronage they had done the best they could. The question of amending resolutions was then broached. There was no disposition manifested to interfere with tbe one by which the senate officers were required to retain all disabled Union soldiers, that were on the roll, but it was remarked there are still employed by the senate a number of men placed in office by Republicans who were never in the army in any capacity, and the desire was expressed by some of the members of the caucus to replace them with Democrats. After some discussion a resolution directing in quiry into the nature of instructions given by the caucus last session and several other reso lutions providing specially for the retention of Capt. Bassett and various other old employes, case any further changes are made, were re ferred to the caucus committee on organiza tion, created last March, to be reported on hereafter. CHANDLER VACANCIES. The Republican caucus committee have ar ranged that the late Senator Chandler's place on the committee of commerce shall be as signed to Senator Baldwin, and that the other committee vacancy caused by Chandler's death, viz, upon the committee of naval affairs, shall be filled by Senator Ferry. Another change in the minority representative upon the Senate committee will be made by placing Blair upon the committee of pensions, vice Ingalls, who retires from it at his own request. GENERAL CAPITOL NEWS- REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN CAUCUo. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.The Republican Sena tors held a very brief caucus this afternoon and referred to a committee, consisting of Senators Morrill, Ferry and Rollins, the subject of filling vacancies caused by the death of Senator Chandler in the membership of the committees on commerce and naval affairs. The caucus committee will also take cognizance of any re quests that mar be presented by members of the minority of exchanges of committee posi tions. MILITARY HONORS TO GEN. JEFF C. DAMS. A general order has been issued by Gen. Sherman offically announcing the death of Brevet Maj. Gen. Jeff C. Davis. The order after detailing his military career in commen datory terms, concludes as follows: Though only colonel of the Twenty-third Infantry at the time of death, his fame and history be longs to the whole army, and the flags of all military posts will be displayed at half-mast the day after the receipt of this order. Gen. Sneridan will give the orders necessary to mark the respect in whioh this honored soldier is universally held by the army, and if the family request it he may order a guard of honor to participate in the funeral ceremonies. THE UTES. The bill introduced by Mr. Bedford to-day for the removal of the Utes, provides that all laws establishing reservations for the Utes in Colorado, shall be repealed, and that the lands constituting such reservation shall become public domain. It further provides that the President, with the consent of the Senate.shall appoint five commissioners to select in some one of the Territories a reservation for the Utes, and arrange with them for peaceful re moval. The bill proposes appropriating $200,- 000 to meet the expenses of removal. THE GLOBE HOROSCOPE. As It Casts Its Light Upon the Chicago Mar kets.

Tho meeting was enthusiastic. GENERAL FOREIGN. THE LAST OF THE AMEERS LONDON, Dec. 2.The Post, commenting upon Yakoob Khan's departure from Cabul for Peshawar, says this news is of great significance. It probably means that Afghanistan has proba bly seen the last of its ameers. It also points to the restraint, if not actual punishment, be ing in store for Yakoob for his carelessness, if not connivance, in the massacre of the embassy. The exact part he played may never be known. The commission of inquiry are reported to have found it absolutely impossible to obtain evi dence that would justify conviction for the major offense, but there is more than enough to establish Yakoob's weakness and culpable negligence. THE 

POPE'S INFALLIBILITY. A dispatch from Persia says the arch bishop of Mechlin, Belgium, in a recent pastoral, as serts the pope is not infallible except when he judges questions which rest on testimony of God and that of his revealed truth or revealed law This IB intended to rebut the charge that Belgian bishops are guilty of schism or diso bedience in disregarding the Pope's admo nitions respecting educational agitation. The bishop of Tournay, the most violent opponent of the liberal cabinet, has been superseded by the administrator appointed by the Pope. The bishop's mind is believed to be unsound. GOVERNMENTAL REFORM IN RUSSIA. LONDON, Dec. 2,A Berlin dispatch says the Czar will inform the nobility of Moscow at the reception to-day of his determination to call a number of unofficial advisers to asist him in the government of the empire. The council will be purely deliberative, without any right of control or interference, and will be chosen partly by the suffrages of the middle and peas ant classes and partly by direct nomination by the Czar from the ranks of the hereditary no bility. Other measures of local reform will also be announced. These innovations have been strongly advocated by the Czarowitoh. THE FRENCH MINISTRY CRISIS. LONDON, Dec. 2.A correspondent at Paris, discussing tbe statement of the Journal des Debates, that the ministry cannot possibly en tertain the scheme for framing a programme for their acceptance says this is the only pos sible course open to the cabinet after the un expected attitude assumed by the majority. Nobody will he able to comprehend how a ma jority so strong as that of the present chamber of deputies on which the government has been leaning for-ten months can declare that it will not support this very cabinet except on the Condition of framing a programme and impos ing this on it, for every individual deputy has the right of submitting any bill and interpella tions followed by the order of day devised only to enable the majority to show the ministry withdrawal of its confidence. Discussing the probable vote of confidence which will end the crisis by consolidating the ministry, the cor respondent says: "It seems beyond a doubt the vote will be given because the Left is not aoting in common accord with certain factions of the majority, will resist the fall of the cab inet, and will force tbe majority next to upset the ministry which Gambetta does not wish to succeed, and whose only successor, apart from Gambetta, would be DeFreyunet, and this would always enable Gambetta to wait his own time. ASSASSINATION OF THE CZAR ATTEMPTED. BERLIN, Dec. 2.Rumors are current that an attempt was made upon the life of the czar while on his way to Moscow, but no authentic details of the affair have been '[received. GORTSCHAKOFF STILL AT THE FRONT. ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 2.The statement relative to the probable appointment of Walu jeff, Gortschakoff successor to the Russian chancellorship, is contradicted in ministerial circles. It is pointed out that Gortschakoff has not yet tendered his resignation. Should he do so Privy Counsellor Giero, who actually conducts the foreign office during the greater part of tbe year, is regarded as his more prob able successor. FATAL FIRE DAMP EXPLOSION.

Cavernac testified aa to his conversa tion with DeLacy, Milton Jones, Geary, Watson and other members of tbe Packard legislature, and stated they had been paid to vote for Kel logg also in regard to some of the affidavits made by these parties. They acknowledged the statements contained were true. I told them all that we wanted them to swear to was the truth that there was no money in it. The only argument used was that by telling the truth and exposing what they knew, they would establish themselves on the side of the good people of the State. Jas. Lewis told me he was going to Washington in the interest of Kellogg. United States District Attorney Leonard tes tified he was a member of tbe Packard legisla ture. Knew nothing at the time about the ru mor that members had been paid to vote for Kellogg. Never knew of anybody being paid. Believed there was a quorum present when the election took place. DEMOCRATIC FOLICY. What Springer Says About ItNo More Riders to Appropriation Bills. [Washington Special, Nov. 30.1 From all that can be gathered it is pretty clear that the old question of repealing the election laws will come up daring the com ing session, bat not in an obnoxious way. None of the Bourbons now dream of attach ing the provision to appropriation bills. Among the interviews had by a Times representative with Democratic Con gressmen on this subject, is one with Mr. William M. Springer, of Illinois. While he talks the same as many of his Democratic brethren, he is taken as authority and made responsible because he was a member of the high joint starring committee who prepared the legislation which was adopted from time to time by the joint Democratic caucus. He but reflects the views of others. He says: "At tbe beginning of the extra session I advocated in the first caucus tbtt was held the passage of political legislation in refer ence to the election laws and the ase of the army at the polls, separate from appropria tion bills. I was then of the opinion that the tacking of such measures on the appro priation bills would unnecessarily alarm tbe country and give the Republicans an oppor tunity which they sought to stir up sectional animosity. At that time I was in a minori- ty." And yet Mr. Springer voted for the ap propriation bills with this extraneous politi cal legislation on them. He continued: "I am still of the opinion that whatever legislation is effected at this session should be passed apart from appropriation bills. I believe that this will be the policy adopted. We do not hope to secure a repeal of the eleotion laws, or even a modification of the obnoxious features of them. The President's position is well known. It is needless to resist the inevitable. The part of wisdom would seem to be to so modify the election laws as to provide that the deputy marshals of elections to be ap pointed hereafter should be appointed one half from each of the two leading political parties, in tbe same manner as supervisors of elections are appointed. Two at each polling-place must belong to different politi cal parties. Let the same provision be applied to deputy marshals, and repeal, if possible, the law authorizing arrests without warrant, whioh is violative of the spirit of oar insti tutions, and then let the matter rest. I believe the President will approve a bill virtually securing these amendments to the election laws. With each modification of the law I have no fears of the inflaenco of the marshals and super visors in the future elections. Though their appointment be wrong in principle, yet in practice they will be equally divided between the two political parties, and no serious in jury will result from these appointments. I advocated these propositions at the last special session, bat at that time oar friends demanded more, and would not be satisfied with such mild modifications of the law. As to the use of troops at the polls,I should favor the enactment of the amendment to section 6 of the present law, passed at the extra session, which provided that no part of the money appropriated in the aot should be paid for the equipment or compensation of any part of the army to be used as a police force to keep peace at the polls at any election had within any State. This section having been passed by the House by a nearly unani mous vote, and the bill containing it having been approved by the President at the extra session, there can be no objection to its in corporation in subsequent appropriation bills." He added that he thought this ought to embrace all political legislation of the ses sion that appropriation bills should be pressed to an early passage, and that the session should be made as short as possible.

It gives, tbe enrollment as follows: Normal DepartmentMales, 36 females, 133 average number belonging, 151 aver age daily attendance, 149. Model DepartmentMales, 70 females, 65 enrollment in model school, 135. Total enrollment, 301. One hundred and twenty-three applica tions for admission have been made, of which six have entered the senior class, two the junior class, two the "A" class, seventeen tbe "B" class, and fifty-three the "0" class. The remaining forty-three, not being able to pass the required examination, were as signed to and constitute the preparatory class. The model sohool is adverted to as being in every way satisfactory and complete. The enrollment consists of 134 pupils distributed through seven grades corresponding to the lower grades of the public schools, thus establishing a complete connection between the lowest primary grades and the Normal department. The report concludes by refer ring to several changes in tbe faoulty. President Simpson desires it stated that the attendance of students at the Normal sohool at Winona is now greater than ever before in its history. MANKATO SOHOOL. The report of Prof. D. C.

Average for the year, 136. GRADUATES. The graduating exercises were held dn the 1st of May, at which time there were gradu ated in the elementary course thirteen ladies and eleven gentlemen. The report of Prof. Kiehle is submitted with special satisfaction in view of the un distubed prosperity which has attended the school daring the year. The enrollment of the sohool was not improved during the year, the improvement being found in the better scholarship of those admitted*and in the more continued attendance. The $3,000 appropriated by the legislature has been expended in finishing off the third story, whioh has been divided into eight rooms, including a most convenient labor atory and apparatus room. The library has received small but im portant additions. The philosophical de partment is still uusupplied, it being thought advisable to defer purchases nntil it can be done to better advantage. Miscellaneous Business. A reeolution was adopted, authorizing the resident directors of the board, at Winona, to obtain necessary plans fojr the improve ment of the Normal school grounds at that place. The board then took np, in committee of the whole, the matter of employing Normal school teachers for a certain portion of eaoh year for conducting institutes, but no decis ion was reached up to the time of the noon recess. Afternoon Session. The bill of Mr. Rice, engraver, for $205, for one hundred diplomas for each school, the estimated number required for two years, was approved and ordered paid. Subse quently, in considering the matter of diplo mas, it was decided that those for graduates of the advanced coarse, should be printed on genuine parchment, and the secretary was authorized to secure from Mr. Rice a suffi cient number to supply the probable demand from the three schools for the ensuing two years. mSTTTUTB WORK AGAIN. The matter of employing normal sohool teachers on institute work was again brought np by Superintendent Burt, who offered the following resolutions: Resolved, That the principal, or a teacher in each normal school at Winona and Mankato, shall be freed from work in those schools for State institute not lesa than four weeks, in the aggregate, to the principal or teacher so freed, between the middle of March and the 1st of May in each year. liesolvcd, that the same regulation apply to the normal school at St. Olqud between the middle of September and the first of Novem ber of each year.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. How It Was Issued in Chicago and St. Paul The Enterprise of the St. Paul Newspa per Union. The Chicago Tribune indulges in a little glorification upon securing the message, which reads thus: The feat of telegraphy performed yesterday by the Western Union Telegraph company in transmitting the President's annual message to the Chicago Tribune is worthy of a place among notable achievements in skill and enterprise. When it is remembered that the message con tains close upon 15,000 words, and that every word was sent and received over the telegraph wires, some idea can be formed of the immens ity of the undertaking. It being unusually late when the message was started toward Chi cago at the eastern end of the circuit, great speed was necessary in the transmission, and to accomplish this it became necessary to employ fourteen wires for the entire distance, with fourteen operators at eaoh end to send ard re ceive. Such are the enormous facilities and capabilities of the Western Uni3n that these fourteen wires were kept in unbroken opera tion, and the vast work of transmission was performed in two hours and a half. It is doubtful whether a more creditable thing in telegraphy has ever been done. The achievement was not equal to that per formed in St. Paul. It was taken here by two operators, two wires being used. They commenced receiving it at half past twelve Sunday afternoon and completed it a little before half past fiveless than five hoars. There was also a break of quite a little time to enable weather signals to be sent and re ceived. If two operators at St. Paul could receive it in less than five hours, fourteen operators in Chicago ought to receive the same matter a good deal quicker than two hours and a half, and by comparison, Chicago has nothing to brag of. The 

GLOBE office put the message in type as rapidly as it came, and by 6 p. M. it was ready for the press. The St. Paul News paper Union has recently added a stereotype foundry to its outfit, and this type was handed over to the storeotyper, who pro ceeded to Riake two casts of the message. Some time before morning the work was complete, and on Monday morning tbe printing of the message for country papers begun. By using the type for one form and the stereotypes for two more, the Newspaper Union presses had three sets of the message, and we venture to say that never liefore in Minnesota was so much accom plished in so short a time Over forty papers were supplied with the message on Monday, either in their regular sheets or in supplements, and nearly as many more yes terday. The Newspaper Union, with its stereotype foundry, can eolip33 anything heretofore at tempted in the way of newspaper printing in Minnesota. LOUISIANA ELECTION. Largo Democratic Gains EverywhereThe Negroes Helping to Swell the Democratic Boom. NEW ORLEAJ.8, Dec. 2.Tho election in the city passed off quietly. Very light vote polled, probably less than a two-thirds vote. The ring ticket in this parish was generally elected. Special dispatches to the New Orleans Democrat from all telegraph stations in the State show heavy Democratic gains, these reports, saving estimated majorities in eleven country parishes, claim Democratic gains by 12.000, compared with the Democratic count of 1876. The same parishes gave Hayes 1,603 majority. All dis patches say the election passed off quietly and most of them report the negroes voting the Democratic ticket and for the constitution. Exceedingly Presumptuous. [Chicago Times, W. H. Smith, who makes a practice of notifying rival publications in Chicago of important news passing over the wires to the Times, issued another communication "To Editors" last night, giving them per mission to copy the President's message from the Sunday Timesa freak of gener osity on his part which will ba duly appre ciated. Besides this favor, he takes occa sion to lament over the "premature publication," as it is styled, and endeavors to paralyze a few impecunious concerns by predicting that hereafter all communica tions to Congress will be submitted in man uscript, thus delaying reports and largely increasing the expense of obtaining news. Mr. Smith's remarks are presumptuous, to say the least of them. There was nothing "premature" in the publication by the Times of Secretary Sherman's report and the President's message. Both were transmitted by telegraph in the regular course of business, no confidence being vi lated or unfair means employed in securing them. The same enterprise whioh made the early publication of these documents possible this year will probably bring about the same results in the future. There are excellent reasons for believing that the gen eral agent of the Western associated press is a dangerous meddler.

A Horrible Tale of the Horrors of the Mil waukee] House of CorrectionAn Incom petent and Brutal Inspector Turns a Re formatory Institution Into a Hell on EarthA Disgrace to ChristendomMis cellaneous Criminal Record. A HELL HOLS. MILWAUKEE JIOUSX OF CORRECTION. MZLWAUKEB, Dec. 2.The majority of the committee appointed by the board of super visors to investigate the affairs of the Milwau kee county house of correction, independent of the investigation conducted by the State board of charities and reforms, made along report to the board to-day. A large amount of testimony was taken, principally that of prisoners and officers of the institution. The committee say there was no escape from the conclusion that Inspector Hasse is incompetent, that he ia not even familiar with the rules governing the in stitution. He admits having frequently used the gag, a punishment not known or allowed by the statutes or rales, and that he does not know if the contract or delivered quality of meat required was fulfilled. The burden of the evidence is that the treatment of prisoners was generally bad, oftentimes cruel, if not barbarous. Hasse and his subordinates have VIOLATlJb THE STATUTES which forbid any corporal or other punishment inflicted for violation of prison roles. Also the rule of the house of correction which pre scribes the punishment to be solitary confine ment in a dark cell, on bread and water, not to exceed twenty days, and although this ia the only legal punishment, yet the way it is ad ministered is the most degrading, dangerous to the health and abominably barbarous of any now administered, and is A mSOBACB TO THE AGE in which we live. By overwhelming testimony, InspectorsHasse and Kennedy are proven to have used this means of torture to a degree never in tended by theState. The committee recommend that Hasse, present inspector, be removed, and that the committee oc the house of correction be given charge of the institution. Hasse, the report holds, is proven incompetent. He has inflicted unwarranted punishment, and has been profane and indecent. The practice of imprisonment in the dark cell, too small to stretch the body, and without bed or bedding in summer or winter, ia severely condemned. The poor helpless crimi nal, unable to lie down or sit up, is compelled to breathe the foal and SICKENING OASSES of his own excrement. It is proven, says the committee, that this has been the constant practice for years, and is a foul blot on the city and State. The committee are also of the opinion that the prisoners are not given baths ai often aa decency requires, and that sick inmates are denied proper care and medical treatment. The committee, in conclusion, report the neces sity for an entire revision of the rules govern ing the house of correction. The report was ordered printed.

AaavsvA, Me., Dec. 2.When the final an swer from the governor was received, stating no one could be permitted under any circum stance to report the election returns of senators and representatives, a long protest was for warded the governor and council by members elect, concluding as follows: Yonr honorable board will permit the undersigned tQ_remark that they never grounded their right to inspect the returns on the act of 1877 alone, which you now declare unconstitutional, for the right they are demanding is one uniformly employed by their predecessors from the foundation of the government, and now for the first time de nied. The undersigned, therefore, cannot see how aright enjoyed in this 8tate under the constitution, and never hitherto withheld, conld be affected by the constitutionality of the statute rererred to. They are especially unable to see how the executive department of the government can set aside the plain direc tory language of the statute. Yonr honor able board will permit tbe undersigned to remark that you enjoy the distinction of being the first governor and council who have direct ly assumed the duty of the judicial depart ment of our government. You assume to set aside the plain provisions of law now on the statute book. If your honorable board can do this in one case yon can readily do it in others, and the execution of our entire body of laws is thus made to depend on the opinion which your honorable body may have as to tbe con stitutionality of the several parts with the reserved right which you have indorsed in this case of changing your conclusion in the space of fourteen days. If this be the definite basis on which your honorable board proposes to ex ecute the laws of the State, it would be a mer ciful act to notify the pesple as to which laws your honorable board regard aa binding and which as inoperative, and especially as to which statutes are safe from change of con struction beyond the period of fourteen days. All laws enacted are binding nntil repealed or set aside by a judicial decision, and yonr board is guilty, you will permit us to say, of glaring usurpation of power whenever you decide to destroy or annul or refuse to execute any law in the statute book. The undersigned protest against the arrogant and unauthorised assump tion of power, tbe unprecedented destruction of rights, the bold usurpation of judioial functions, the scandalous secreting of publio record hitherto open to honest inspection which has distinguished the course of your honorable board in all matters herein submitted for your consideration." It is understood Republican senators and representatives will now resort to judicial proceedings, and will make no further personal effort with the governor and council to procure access to the returns.
