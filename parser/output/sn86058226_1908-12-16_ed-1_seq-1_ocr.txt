(By Special State Correspondent.) Indianapolis. Dec. 16. Now that the democratic legislators have "come and went" what do they know that Ihey. did not know before they came? The way It looks now is that they Ho not know a single thing that they did not know before, unless it Is that the brew ers of Indiana are for B. F. Shively, of South Bend, for United States senator. And this is merely a guess, but there are some things that make it look like a good guess. This Shi- . Ellis Searles. vely brewery ptory came, out at thts meeting for the first time, and before the confer ence was over there were many who believed it . Thei meat of the story Is that the brewers of the state are for- Shively In return for the work he did' against the high license bill when it was be fore the ; legislature two years ago 'fend also for his unsuccessful effort to prevent-the passage of the county local option bill at the special session In September. Shively Worked for Brewers. Those who watched ' the progress of events at these two sessions know that Shively was one of the most ef fective lobbyists in the entire outfit against the ' thousand dollar license bUl, and that it was through his ef forts as much' as those of anyone else that it was defeated. Shively" worked like a trojanvt Of course, it was ac cepted by everybody that he was merely a hired lobbyist in the matter, Just as many other able lawyers were employed legitimately as paid lobby ists for various interests, and every one conceded that Shively did a migh ty good job of it Money Used Over State. In this connection there is re-told iow the story of the little champagne fupper at the Denison hotel the night fafter the high license bill was defeat ed. Crawford . Fairbanks, owner of the 'Terre ' Haute Brewis company, and chief manipulator, with Albert Lieber, of this city, of the brewery politics of the state, was so happy that he threw a supper. Corks pop tied and they had a good time and everybody was complimented for the good work done in that fight. Then during the last campaign a brewery attorney went over the state planting money in the various coun ties for-use in the democratic cam paign. In planting this money he let It be known that it was "Shively tooney," and that if the legislature Was democratic Shively would be elected United States senator. Double Cross Charged. After this story was recalled, yes terday and last night, there cropped ut another one to the effect that Crawford Fairbanks is double-crossing John E. Lamb, of Terre Haute, who is also a candidate for senator. Fairbanks Is ostensibly for Lamb, and has let it be known that he is work ing for him. But a man who stands close to Fairbanks told a friend yes terday that Fairbanks is only out for Lamb for the purpose of keeping the legislators of the Fifth district from going to Slack or Kern. He said that when the right time comes Fairbanks will have Lamb withdraw from the race and that the vote of the Fifth district will then go to Shively. Fleming Considers Shively. Then there Is another situation that lends some color to the story that Shively "has the brewery support and that this makes him a formidable can didate. That Is the fact that Steve Fleming controls absolutely the vote of the Twelfth district and that if he .finds that Edward G. Hofman, of Ft Wayne cannot be elected senator, he (will throw his vote to Shively. Flem ing is a brewer. Xle would do any thing to defeat "John W. Kern, be cause there Is a cordial, mutual per i i (Continued on Page Five.) i i 2 ft" J The "heavy hand of justice-' fell with a thump on Sherman Wilson, col ored, in the Wayne circuit court this morning. Judge Fox was told Wilson was one of tho men implicated in the attempted delivery at the Wayne coun ty jail. The man was accused of the theft of a suit of clothes and a hat from John Bryant and upon his plea of guilty to the charge of petit larceny was fined $10. sentenced to ninety days in the county jail and disfranchis ed for two j ears. Wilson persisted in a plea of not guilty until led to see all the evidence was against him. It was represented to the court that WTilson is the sole support of his aged mother at Xenia, Ohio. A letter was in the hands of the pauper attorney in which the mother asks that her Bon might be dealt with as lightly as pos sible, so he could return to her sup port. Wilson claimed he never had been in any trouble before. CITY HAS NO BUT Residents of New Castle, buy Large Quantities of Liquor. RAILROADS PROFIT BY IT. ALL KINDS OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS HAVE BEEN SENT IN TO TOWN BY WHISKY AND WINE HOUSES. New Castle, Ind., Dec. 16. Almost unlimited quantities of liquid -refreshments were sold in this city last week by brewery agents and representatives of whiskey and wine houses. Two of the latter were here the first of the week, and, it is said, sold between them about $ 1,200 worth of drinkables for private consumption. Some of the orders no doubt went to persons who were thinking of their friends. All kinds of beer is said to have been sold to parties for private consump tion. The quotation is 5c per bottle and several barrel orders were taken. Of course, no one would imagine that any of this stuff is for a "blind tiger." No. its all for private parties who like their "schnops." Railroads and express companies are doing a thriving business along this particular line since the town went "dry" and the temperance people are at a loss to know how to battle the new evil. That beer is being taken freely is evidenced .by the fact that four "dead ones" were found on the court house lawn the other morning. This morning two empty quart whis key bottles were found on a prominent street corner. The two bottles bore different labels and neither brand is on sale at any place in this city. It is believed that both quarts were either shipped into the city last week or were brought in from Anderson or Indian apolis during the night. 

BIDS TOO LOW AND PROPERTYJS MOT SOLD Only $625 Offered for Petro Pine Co's Effects. The public sale of the Potro Pine company's property has been ordered in the Wayne circuit court. The prop erty was offered at private sale and the highest bid secured was $025. This was not considered enough, and the sale was not put through. The Petro Pine company formerly engaged in the manufacture and sale of various kinds of salves, toilet articles and the only white tar soap on the market. It owns a number of valuable formulas and copyrights. FAYETTE COUNTY TO VOTEJQN OPTION Temperance Forces Now Or ganizing. Connersville, Ind., Dec. 16. The temperance forces of Fayette county are organizing for the purpose of holding a county local option election at an early date. A mass meeting was held at the First M. K. church today for the purpose of completing this organization and arranging for the circulation of the petitions. SALOONS CASTRO EFFIGIES BURNED. Caracas. Dec. Itf. Martial law reigns today after a night of rioting, when houses were stoned and buildings burned. Effigies of Castro were burned and his statues hurled down and demolished. The authorities are unable to cope with the mob's fury, which is directed at Castro and hi3 henchmen. No demonstrations have been made against Holland as yet. AGED COUPLE SAYS HOUSE WAS STONED Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Huddles ton of . Dublin Have Many Troubles. HE FEARS THE BANKS. THINKS WIFE WILL GET HIS MONEY AND CARRIES IT WITH HIM OLD PEOPLE HAVE DO MESTIC TROUBLES GALORE. Charges that their house has been stoned and that whitecappers have threatened them, were lodged with the prosecuting attorney by Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Huddleston, of Dublin, to day. The troubles of the Huddlestons are many and altogether due to them selves, according to the authorities. Both are seventy-four years old and somewhat eccentric. The husband al leges his wife is not mentally strong and she has the same unkind remark to make about him. They continue to live together, despite their own quar rels and threats and the actions of bothersome neighbors. The prosecut ing attorney declared he has had his hands full trying to conciliate the Huddlestons and the remainder of the residents of Dublin for four years. Fears the Banks. The husband has a wholesale fear of banks. He believes if he puts his money in a bank his wife will be able to get it. He does not want her to have it and although he isold and in firm he has persisted carrying about with him $1,000 in currency. He was warned against this practice by the prosecutor and sheriff this morning and told he ought to put his money in a bank before leaving tae city. Mrs. Huddleston claims her hus band wants to put her in an asylum. She says that is the place for her hus band and herself and she wouldn't object to going, if he were sent, also. She admitted she had called her hus band improper names and accused him of keeping company with women of ill repute. Her husband says he has to "side in with her to keep down a fuss," so he has taunted her at these times by expressing his willing ness to admit all charges, although he says they are untrue. He said his wife chops latches off the outhouse, after he has put them on. Mrs. Hud dleston says she does that so he won't go there to count his money. The couple was told to return to Dublin and cease strife. Man and wife were told to stop taunting each other and to quit abusing the neigh bors. They were told further com plaints would result in their arrest.

FATAL ACCIDENT A MOST PECULIAR ONE Coal Falls on Horse's Hoofs, Frightening and Causing Them to Swerve, Throwing Mr. Spaulding to Ground. In a runaway accident on North Six teenth street yesterday afternoon, Will W. Spaulding a prominent gardner and greenhouse man. was thrown headlong against a tree, breaking his neck and killing him almost instantly. James B. Howes, father-in-law of Mr. Spauld ing was about a half block distant when the accident occurred. He has tened to the scene and gazed upon the unfortunate victim. At first he did not recognize him as the face was blackened by coal, with which the wagon Mr. Spaulding was driving, was loaded, and he suggested that the body be searched for the purpose of identification. Just as this sugges tion was about to be carried out, Mr. Howes recognized the team of runaway horses, which were being held by a couple of men, as Irelonglng to Mr. Spaulding. Taking a mo.V careful scrutiny of the body Mr. HcAves recog nized it as that of Mr. Spaulding. "My God, it is my son-in-law," he moaned, as he sank to his knees by the side of the body. Accident Unusual. The accident which resulted in the death of Mr. Spaulding was a most un usual one. He had just received a carload of coal, which had been placed on the Sixteenth street -Panhandle switch to be unloaded. He placed the first load in his gravel wagon, hauled by a spirited team of horses, and started for his home on the National road, one mile east of the city. At the corner of North Sixteenth and C streets the front end board fell out and the coal began to drop on the horses' hoofs. They gave a sudden lurch and the avalanche of coal which fol lowed, carried with it the seat on which Mr. Spaulding was seated. One of the lines dropped and became en tangled with the horses' legs. This caused them to make a sudden turn to the side and the momentum burled Mr. Spaulding from the falling seat against a tree. A number of people witnessed the accident and when they reached the side of the victim ho was found to be dead. The falling coal had nearly covered his body. Before the frightened animals could break loose from the wagon and bolt, they were captured by a couple of men. The body was taken to the Doan & Klute undertaking establishment and last evening was removed to the home of Mr. Howes, 23 North Twenty-first street. Owing to the fact that the Spaulding home is being remodeled, the body will be kept at the Howes residence and the funeral will proba bly be held Friday afternoon. Was Well Known Man. Will Spaulding was one of the best known men in the county. For years he has been engaged in the gardening and green house business and he was a familiar figure at the South Sixth street market. Mr. Spaulding was a prominent Red Man and a member of Osceola tribe. He had filled every office in that tribe and at the time of his death, was its treastirer. He was also a prominent member of the White water lodge of Odd Fellows. Mr. Spaulding was born at Hamilton, O.. Jan. 14. 1S37, and when eight year's old removed to this county with his parents. He resided with them on their farm on the National road until he married in July. 1803, when he pur chased adjoining property. Mr. Spaulding leaves a wife and four young children. Florence. Charles, William and Louise, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Spaulding. and his sis ter, Mrs. Beard, of Toledo, Ohio. Friends may call at the Howes home at any time. HEAVY INSANE -WOMAN f HOSPITAL Mrs. Delia Weaver Removed To Easthaven. Sheriff Meredith succeeded in re moving Delia Weaver from her home north of the city to the Eastern In diana hospital for the .insane yester day afternoon. The young woman weighs 300 pounds and had given the sheriff considerable 'trouble to remove because of weight land -proportion, as she measures 30 'inches across the hips. She had been in the hospital looter and was released as cured. New York, Dec. 16. The prosecu tion in the Hains murder trial out lined its case today.

It is not yet known whether this will delay the trial. The prosecutor continued his address after, the announcement was made. PULITZER REPLIES TO THE PRESIDENT iSays That Roosevelt Cannot His Muzzle Paper by - Tirade of Abuse. EXECUTIVE LIBELS U. S. HE BULLDOZES JUDGES, ASSAILS INTEGRITY OF COURT AND SLANDERS PRIVATE CITIZENS, . THE WAIL GOES UP. New York, Dec. 16. Under the cap tion "Lese Majeste" the World today printed the following editorial on President Roosevelt's Panama mes sage: Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He can not muzzle the World. While no amount of billingsgate on his part can alter our determination to treat him with judicial impartiality and scrupul ous fairness, we repeat what we have already said that the congress of the United States should make a thorough investigation of the whole Panama transaction that the full 'truth may be known to the American i people. It is a most extraordinary circum stance that Mr. Roosevelt himself did not demand such au inquiry. All his protestations of outraged virtue, all his torrents of imprecation and de nunciation, end with the amazing as sertion that "there is nothing what ever in which this government is in terested to investigate about this transaction." World Returns Thanks. The World fully appreciates the compliment paid to it by Mr. Roose velt in making it the subject of a special message to the congress of the United States. In the whole history of American government no other president has ever paid such a tribute to the power and influence of a fear less, independent newspaper. It is true that the World printed- the public reports concerning the Pan ama canal affair, which resulted from William Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney's office during the recent campaign to prevent the publication of a story which was said to be in the hands of the democratic national committee. It was Mr. Crom- (Continued on Page Two.)

RESIDENTS CLAIMED THAT PRE VIOUS CUSTOM IN CONSTRUC TION OF SEWER SYSTEMS WAS NOT FOLLOWED OUT. No change In the assessment of benefits and damages incident to the construction of the Southwest sewer system will be made by the board of works as the result of the hearing of the remonstrators this morning. At torney Henry U. Johnson appeared In behalf of William and Rebecca Boyd, two of the remonstrators. Others, who appeared to controvert the as sertions of the city officials that the assessment Is correct were: R. L. Kel ly, E. P. Truebtood. C. K. Chase, Richard Sedgwick, N. C. Heironlmus, Dr. Grosvenor and Charles Bell. It developed at the hearing that not all of those persons, who are assessed believe, they have been dealt with unjustly in the matter. , Cost to City $17,000. As the result of the confirmation of the determination of the board of works, the city will bear about $17,000 of the total expense of $34,000. It will not bear any more. However, the board will revise its primary as sessment roll and this will alter some of the individual assessments by re ducing them. The remonstrators had asked that the city bear about one half of the entire expense. It was maintained by the remon stratorB that the ctty did not follow out the previous custom in the con struction of a sewer system. It was claimed the cost of the filtration plant should be borne entirely by the city. The city was asked in addition to bear about 35 per cent of the remainder of the cost.
