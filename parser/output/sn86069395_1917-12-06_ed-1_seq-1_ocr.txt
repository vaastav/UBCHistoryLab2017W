Barkley Will hold to what he has, and since Sherlcy has been made chairman of ,the Appropriations Committee, he 1 has concluded that the House is good enough for him. Gen. von Lunendorf, who was ap proached by the Russian bnuch with peace overtures, is shy. He said: "There must be a secure government for this purpose, one which possesses power to enforce internally and ex ternally the results of the negotiations with us. Of course, we can conclude an armistice with Russia at anytime as soon as we have the assurance that it will be maintained. A general ar mistice, however, will be difficult to achieve. It would interrupt the sub marine activity and allow the entente to improve its position, while on the other hand no supplies would reach the central powers. Therefore, such an armistice should be a brief one, as otherwise the military situation would suffer." WILSON TO FORCE PRICES DOWN Early Enactment of Wishes Expressed in His Address To Congress.

TURKEY NOT IN OUR PATH Closed Trade Doors May Be Teutonic Lot if They Cling to Same Rulers After Strife? Washington, Dec. 5. A definite statement to the world of America's war aims and of the basis upon which peace will be considered was made by President Wilson in an address to congress, in which he urged immedi ate declaration of a state of war be tween the United States and Austria-Hungary- Germany's vassal and tool, As to Turkey and Bulgaria also tools of the enemy ho counselled dehy be cause "they do not stand in tho direct path of our necessary action." To win the war, tho president de clared in emphatic and ringing tones, is the immediate and unalterable task ahead. He urged congress, just be ginning its second war session to con centrate upon it. The president sharply dismissed the possibility of premature peace, sought by Gorman intrigue and debnted hero by men who understand neither its nature nor tho way it may bo attain ed. With victory an accomplished fact, ho said, peace will bo evolved, based upon "mercy and justice," to" enemy and friend, with a hope of a partnership of nations to guarantee future world peace. The war will be deemed won, ho declared, "when the German people say to us, through properly accredit ed representatives, that theyare ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and preparation of tho wrongs their rulers .havo done." Terms of peace, he added, woujd not include dismemberment, robbery or punish ment of tho enemy, but would be bas ed on justness, defined briefly as fol lows: "Freedom of nations and their peo ples from autocratic domination, rep aration to Belgium, relinquishment of German power over too people of Austria, Turkey, the freo Balkan tit Bg. aiwall aa the amcm 

DREW ROSS DOVER HAN MURDERED Dead Body Found Near Wal nut Street Railroad Bridge Monday Night. BULLET H&Lfi IN HEART Had Come to Town to Sell Some Tobacco Tuesday Had $50 When Last Seen. A farmer from the vicinity of Dover, Tenn., was murdered Monday night and his dead body placed on tho L. & N. Railroad siding near the water tank beyond the Walnut street overhead crossing. The body was found about mid night lying face downward, with a bullet hole through his heart. His chest was across the rail and the body was cold in death, the murder having taken place apparently early in the night. The body was on a siding and was not struck by the train, whose crew made the discov ery, ine matter was reported to. me i police and the body was taken to the Waller & Trice morgue and prepared for burial. Persons in the, vicinity recalled having heard a pistol shot between 7 and 8 o'clock, but no in vestigation was made. On Tuesday the dead man was identified and it was learned from his friends that he had $30 and made $20 more in a horse trade Monday. His watch and all of his money and other valuables were gone when the body was iounci. Tho theory of the police is that the man was knocked down while walk ing in that part of town and shot when a struggle ensued and after, wards the body was taken to where it was found and placed where it was thought a train would crush it, but in the darkness it was not placed on the main track. There was a bruised place on tho head, carrying out this theory. Mr. Ross was a well known citizen of Stewart county. The relatives of Ross arrived Tues day and tho same evening tarted on the long drive for Dover, where the interment probably took place yester day. No clue has been discovered fixing the identity of the murderer. Mr. Millen, who was landlord of the old Central Hotel In the 70s, was here Tuesday. He now lives near Elkton. gjum and northern France." JUSTICE FOR OUR ALLIES AND OUR ENEMY. Emphasizing tho purpose of the United States not to interfere in the internal affairs of any nation, the president asserted that no wrong against the German empiro was in tended and that there was no desire to rearrange the Austro-Hungarian empire. He said when he spoke eight months ago of the rights of nations for free access to the sea, ho said he had Austria, as as well as smaller na tions, in mind. The definition of war aims and peace terms, tho most explicit ever voiced by tho hiad of any of tho great war ring powers, was accepted as tho more significant becauso since his re ply to tho pope's peace noto the pres ident has como to bo regarded more and moro as a spokesman for all tho nations fighting Germany.
