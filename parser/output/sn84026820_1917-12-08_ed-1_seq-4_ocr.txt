It is known that the whole Town meeting ticket was elected, although through the stealing of 20,000 or 30,000 votes the gangsters thought they had defeat ed that great popular - uprising against the contractor bosses. now Finally, after a long struggle in the ballot boxes courts the boss-stuffed have been ordered opened. In the eyes of these Philadelphia politicians-and shame to say, in the eyes of some of the judges, too—nothing ;is so sacred as a gang-stuffed ballot box., ' 'That would make a daugerous precedent !" Thus yawped one of the hireling lawyers who had sold himself to the bosses to help them defeat % the people's will at toe polls. The legal profession has fallen from its former high estate. Its code of ethics has been thrown overboard. There is no villainy, individual or pub lic, though never so vile and low, but attorney-at-law, for an adequate bribe, will pettifog, and misrecite law and fact in his desperate effort "to make the worse appear the better reason," and overwhelm public right and jus tice in favor of private greted and wrong. What makes possible this prostitution of the once honorable practice of the lav.% is the fact that the judges-often themselves creatures of the bosses— wink at the rascally business, often al lowing quibbles instead of right to de termine issues, wished" that this threefold assault upon the ballot, of the bosses, the pettifog gers and the venal judges, may in this instance come to naught.

FRIEND AUSTRIA! A MONG many other follies that mark the ,conduct of our war, is the absurd determination of the Ad ministration to persist in regarding Austria, Bulgaria and the dear old Turkish cut throats as our friends ! It js said the forthcoming message of the president will urge Congress not to de clare war against Austria and the others ! Out soldiers on the battle lines in France and Italy, before firing at, the \ foe who is shooting at them must yell \ "Sind sie Deutsch oder Oesterich," are you a German or an Austrian ?" Italy our sorely pressed ally appreci ates this absurd quibble of martial Iveedledum and tweedledee ! t Of course it pleases Germany mighti ly to know that no Turk, Bulgar or Austrian plotter can be interned or intiferferred with because they are our friends ! So the 10,000 deviltries now bein^ practiced here on every hand by her snies, and consirators can go on unchecked under this Austrian cloke of "neutiplity" and "friendship !" Nice state of affairs truly ! A continuation of that famous—or, infamous—official announcement some months back that we were "too proud to fight"—Austria j And when the Austrian troops help Ihe Germans kill our soldier boys for bidden to fire in return, it will also re mind us of that lovely condition when this Administration permitted German pirates in the course of two years to kill several hundred Americans—and nothing was done but send a dozen or so typewriter notes in weak protest Since printing the above editorial the president in his message has announced in highly vigorous language the policy that war should at once be declared against Austria. The Transcript shares the general satisfaction that the grave -error, which was unjust to our ally Italy and discreditable to ourselves, 'will thus, though late, be corrected. * The president's message is a virile, patriotic declaration not less powerful \ i tage ■Rdignation in' «demanding the war'« proeecutio^^^rfie 'Intolerable wrongs done andP^^Bl against us by j the sinister maeq^HP Germany" be ^ u jjy otffcanno^ 'help wishing that these doble .sentiments had been f, uttered over two years ago, and the Nation spared-the long humiliation of e supinely eoduved \ % outrage after o with no other show .of manly resentment than the inditing of aii absurd series of feeble notes that made us the laughing stock of all the world. . y NOT
