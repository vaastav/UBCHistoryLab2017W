Two reasons evidently prompted his utter ance. First, to re-affirm positively that we are not seeking personal aggrandizement as an ans wer to carping critics at home and abroad; sec ondly, to offset the false views regarding our mo tives which the Kaiser's agents have been spread ing in Italy, Russia and in Germany itself. The President minces no words in denouncing the accusation that America is seeking territorial gains and that is engaged in the task of crushing Germany in order that we may grasp commercial supremacy from the ruins. He emphasizes the truth that Germany is not fighting a mighty de fensive war against the aggression of hostile na tions but that she is engaged in an offensive war for the purpose of assuring her commercial con quests by force of arms, a principle, so the Presi dent declares, that is obselete and cannot stand the test of the enlightened public opinion of the twentieth century. It is to be hoped that the German people will be able to read an uncensored and complete text of this message, so that they may understand our motives. The crafty masters of Germany have deluded them into believing that they are fight ing for their very existence and that they have been offended against. . If the German masses could understand the real fundamental issues of the great conflict, it is safe to believe that they would lose the confidence they have in their rulers and would be amenable to reason, but this can hardly be hoped for. The same appeal is made to the peoples of other nations that are being misled by the agents of the Kaiser. Italy's people have learned their lesson by the expenditure of blood. Russia is in a chaotic state, and German intrigue is quickly bringing about her doom. Those of our own citizens who have been luke warm in their patriotism or have had their doubts about our stand will find the President's message a clear text book. Let them ponder it seriously and their doubts will vanish. The.full importance of the message will grow on the American people as they re-read and study it - It challenges our study. for service in the army. Few Americans realize that it is estimated by physicians that 2 per cent, or 200,000 of the 10,000,000 men subject to the selective draft, will be found to be victims of this disease, and will therefore be among the "re jects." ' ' " ' . '.' ' : " These "rejects" must be cared for. The -men who go to war must be protected against inf ec tion, and the country must be kept free of the scourage at a time when every ounce of vitality and energy are needed in the service of demo cracy. , "Will you do your part by buying more . Red Cross Christmas Seals than you ever bought be fore?" asks the Seal Committee "Remember, every seal provides ammunition in the fight against tuberculosis." Red Cross Bulletin. Red Cross Christmas Seals How many Red Cross Christmas Seals did you buy last year? Will you buy three times as many this year? Unless every purchaser of Red Cross Seals triples his or her purchase this year, the creation of a $3,000,000 War Tuberculosis Campaign Fund will not be possible. The American Red Cross and The National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tu berculosis are making a drive for the creation of this fund because America's entry into the war has revealed thousands of hitherto unsuspected cases of tuberculosis that must be cared for, and because every precaution must be taken to safe guard our troops abroad against the great white plague. Last year $1,050,000 was made for the anti tuberculosis campaign by the sale of Red Cross Seals. This means that 105,000,000 holiday tok ens were sold. To raise the war fund of $3,000, 000 it will be necessary to sell 300,000,000 seals this year, and every man, woman and child will have to help to do this by trebling last year's purchases. The buying of Red Cross Christmas Seals is not merely a humanitarian act. It is a patriotic act, and one which shows that the purchaser has the welfare of the country at heart. Tuberculosis is as deadly a foe to our troops as German bullets and bombs. It is undermining the civilian life of this country and unfitting men Why We Are at War (Prepared for the Indiana State Council of Defense by Father John Cavanaugh, President of the University of Notre Dame.) The Militaristic spirit in Germany must per ish, or America can not survive. When the lion and the lamb lie down together, the lamb is al ways inside the lion, and a peace-loving commer cial nation can never be safe so long as a militar istic, powerful, and aggressive nation lies within striking distance and eager to strike. Let not the gentle-mannered think that we can have no proper concern about the thoughts and the internal organization of neighboring na tions. Where these things are merely matters of taste, we have indeed no right to interfere; but when any strong nation avows a policy that in volves the destruction of our country, we should be less than reasonable, we should be insane, if we permitted that nation to build up a monstrous machine for carrying out its purpose, while we bartered and played. It does not promote the happiness of a kindly fat man to know that a burglar or a murderer is lying in wait for him with a club, as he goes his peaceful way on a dark night. That was precisely the situation of our people before the war began. We rhapsodize over the men of Washington's time and the stalwarts of Lincoln's day, but let us not forget to acclaim the heroes of this critical hour. Of what avail was it that the Revolution ary partiots created America, and the Civil War patriots unified America, if patriots of today do not conserve America? This war is as sacred as either of the other great American wars, and every man and every dollar within the bounds of our country must help to win the fight. Whoever shirks or shrinks is constructively a traitor. This is a war against war, and pacifists them selves, if they were wise, would see in American victory the only hope of the triumph of their cause. " ' ." ' This war is to purchase permanent peace and it must not end till the spirit of militaristic ag gression perishes from the earth. It will require the exertion of all our people's gigantic might to see this conflict through, and any American who, for any reason whatsoever, is cold or backward in this war is unworthy of his sacred inheritance. . , 20 Gov C ioulimt Expenditures Will Be Below Estimates From Official Bulletin. A 

FEELING of relief was experienced throughout the country at the statement of Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo in Baltimore before the Invest ment Bankers' Association on November 14, that the ac tual expenditures of gome of the departments of Govern ment were much less than the estimates the departments submitted in July last, and that the task of providing for the expenses of the Government for the fiscal year is not regarded by the Treasury Department as one which will in any way strain the capacity of the resources of the United States. The Secretary said in part: "Vague and unfounded apprehensions seem to exist in the public mind as to the extent of the financial re quirements of the United States during the current fiscal year. It may be helpful to the country to know that these requirements have been greatly exaggerated, and that in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury there is no reason whatever for apprehension on this score. This opinion is based upon the latest estimates of our finan cial needs. . "The splendid success of the Second Liberty Loan shows that the people are fully determined to support the war and are prepared to make such sacrifices of lux uries, pleasures, comforts, and conveniences as may be necessary." The Secretary explained that his optimistic statement was based upon actual figures in hand. A LITTLE SLICE O' LIFE , My wife is a saving souL Poor woman, she knows no better. For a long time she saved cork and rubber , And old bottles and meat tins and rags and old iron. She was saving them for Uncle Sam, but Uncle never called for them, And finally we unloaded about four vanloads of the stuff On the junkman and got thirty-seven cents for it. Saving junk was no use, and my wife had to save something, So she began saving food. This was the finest Little job of saving she ever did. Women are peculiar. . They either serve too much or too little. They don't strike a happy medium anywhere . . . Outside the spiritualistic seances. She saved up scraps and made hash. We always have plenty of scraps. . She . made up enough hash to last a week, and I said : . "Now that we are saving, let us do it right. ...... Let us also save the hash." And we did so. I hadn't the heart to eat that hash when . . I knew our boys over in the trenches didn't have any hash. So now we are saving all sorts of food. . We are not eating at home at all. Another incentive to patriotic giv ing: The Army and Navy Bazaar in New York, held to buy comfort kits for the fighting men, took in $78,475. After the expenses of promoters were paid there was $754 left for the soldiers. Looks as though we may have to dig up the old sour apple tree. Men are confined to the gallery at suffrage banquet in New York. Since the recent suffrage election it seems necessary to change the name of Man hattan to Womanhattan. Hurrah (if we may be permitted the expression) ! Mr. Hoover has advised housewives to economize on bread pudding. Still some people claim war has' no com pensations.

When strong hints had been received In silence her patience became ex hausted. One day she sent a tele gram to each of the three. These all bore the came message: "Your coun try is calling. Wire reply if you wish to borrow my ear trumpet." She is now very proud of her three "lads in khaki." It was a dull day in the trenches and a bunch of Tommies had gathered and were discussing events. After a while the talk turned on a big boche who had been captured the night be fore. "He was scared 6tiff," said one Tommy. "Did he run?" asked another. "Run?" replied the first. . "Why, if that boche had had just one feather in his hand, he'd 'a flew." Nothing appeals to the soldier's sense of humor as strongly as the physical eccentricities of his com rades. A tall, lean recruit had just joined up in England. A sergeant and lieutenant were discussing him. ' " 'E's thin as a ramrod and 'e don't look strong enough to 'elp in the store," complained the sergeant. "He'll do to clean the rifles,' wered the lieutenant. "And 'oo's a-going to pull through?" wailed the sergeant, defiant manner. an- 'im in a IDinn er Stories Buttonholed by an over-inquisitive re porter, Congressman Foss administer ed a neat rebuke.
