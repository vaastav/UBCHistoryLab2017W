In the Senate the credentials of Messrs. hdmunds and Eaton were presented. Mr. Morrill reported from the special Committee an entirely new scheme of government for the District of Columbia, embracing a system of Municipal Boards the chief of whom shall be three Regents, to be appointed by the President and con firmed by the Senate. Mr. Sherman sub mitted a bill for the revision of the Cus toms laws. Amongother bills introduc ed was one for the relief of the Western sufferers by the ravages of the grassliop pers, and another to break up the impor tation of ( hinese into California under n system of slavery.

Secretary Robeson's report , shows our fittle navy to be in good condition, con sidering the small amount of money that is spent upon it and the age of many of its ships. It now consists of 1(53 vessels of all classes, but probably one-third of these are practically worthless. We have seventy-throe steam vessels nomi nally fit for cruising, but there are but fifty-eight of them that are of service, and of these forty-one are now in com mission. Twenty-one of our iron-clads can do duty, and the rest are ready for the junk shop. Mr. Robeson devotes a considerable portion of his report to a commendation of the great naval drill off the Florida coast last winter as a specimen exhibition of the discipline and efficiency of the navy. The Secretary nowhere favors extravagant expenditures but he argues that there should be a re gular addition to the navy each year to replace worn-out and retired ships. An interesting portion of the report is that treating of the movement amongst the people of Iceland to abandon their an cient home and settle upon the North IVific coast of the United States. 

MARYLAND INDEPENDENT-December 9, is? I. The President’s Message. The Message of President Grant, as transmitted to Congress, is in many re spects a more forcible one than could have been anticipated from those which have hitherto emanated from our self-in dulgent President. In the very begin ning he touches sharply upon the exist- I ing financial t distress of the country.— I Business and industries are. as lie truly F says, prostrated, while labor and capital are plenty. He therefore thinks that 1 “wise statesmanship at this session of Congress would dictate legislation ignor ing the past, directing in proper chan nels these great elements of prosperity.” Most excellent advice, if only carried out. The large public debt he considers an element of depression, and the “sys tem of currency”—paper—which it is impossible to keep at par, has. lie thinks, induced a most pernicious spirit of spec ulation and extravagance among the peo ple. Rather coolly, if not sarcastically. He remarks that he does not question the wisdom of the introduction of this cur rency at the time of its adoption. He urges, as a matter of justice and good faith, that the Isinds held abroad should lie paid in coin or its equivalent, or else National disgrace is inevitable. To ob tain means for this, commeree, manufac tures and agriculture should be encour aged. The first step to be taken is, he says, “to secure a currency, good wher ever civilization reigns,” and this, lie thinks, consists nuly *>f gold and silver, ttu which wo must return at the earliest ipocii.i.- moment, and until that is done ■Lj^F" reN that no permanent prosperity I The delay in resiimp-l fluctuations "f ejiauge, and repeats: “It is the dutyof Congress to devise the method of correct ing the evils which are acknowledged to exist, and not mine; but I will venture to suggest two or three things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to return to specie payments, the first great requi site in a return to prosperity. The legal tender clause to the law authorizing tin issue of currency by the National Gov ernment should be repealed, to take ef fect ns to all contracts entered into after the day fixed in the repealing act, not to apply, however, to the payment of sala ries by the Government or for other ex penditures now provided by law to be paid iii currency in the interval pending between repeal and final resumption.— Provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary, from time to time, from the date when specie re demption commences. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficient ly in excess of expenses to insure an ae- Treasury to s ■*"- v f jBflS V life. Cjv.'i'® a- „ Sg. H H ’ ( • iRF if not ng *r spy fyr f ®who speak by HSHvcffccted during this session. He speaks favorably of our foreign relations, which have been friendly dur ing the post year with all other Powers, lie hopes for a successful result of the pending negotiations for further openiug to our commerce of the Empires of China and Japan. He renews his recommen dation that a special Court be authorized to hear all claims of aliens against the United States for damages to person or property “during the insurrection.” He alludes to the progress of the survey to determine the boundary between the United States and British Possessions in America, and states that the field work has been completed. He states that the “Court of Com missioners of Claims” cannot possibly complete the work before it prior to Feb ruary, 1875, when it expires by law, and asks an extension of the time of its jurisdiction. In relation to the Cuban struggle, lie says that “six years of strife gives the insurrection a significance which cannot be denied,” and thinks that some positive steps should be taken in the matter.— The questions between this Government and Spain are still unsettled, hut a speedy adjustment is hoped for. The President calls attention to the frauds perpetrated upon the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States by means of false naturalization certifi cates, and ask that legislation he shaped to punish oftenders in such cases. The President refers to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and con curs in its recommendations. He ad vises that the tariff be readjusted, so as to increase the revenue, while decreas ing the uumber of articles upon which duties are levied, aud again pointedly calls attention to the unwisdom of recent legislation. Iu commenting upon the Army and Navy reports, the President suggests various improvements iu those branches of public service. He also re views the report of the Postmaster Gen eral and notes the suggestions for an equitable adjustment of compensation to j railroads for carrying the mail;. In reference to the difficulties in the State of Louisiana the President explains and endeavors to justify his acts in re cognizing and supporting the Kellogg Government, and states that unless CW gress shall take action in the matter he will continue to do so. He also declares that the presence of Cnited States troops was necessary in many portions of the Southern States to prevent and punish the intimidation of Voters at the polls, and denounces the White Leagues and other societies of that class, lie says, in reference to the Arkansas troubles, that lie declined to interfere pending the Congressional investigation of the mat ter, and calmly expresses a general re pugnance to Executive interference in the affairs of the States. Of tie ques tion of the difficulties between the races he says : ‘■lait there be fairness in the discussion ol Southern questions, the advocates of both or all political parties giving honest, truthful re ports of occurrences, condemning the wrong and upholding the right, and soon nil will be well. I ndcr existing conditions the negro votes the Republican ticket tiecausc he knows his friends ure of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not because ire n grees with the great principles of State which separate the parties, hut because generally lie is op|wrsed to negro rule. This is a most de lusive erv. Treat the negro ns a citizen and a voter as he is. and must remain, and soon par lies n il! be divided, not over the color line Imt upon principle. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference.” He refers briefly to the report* of the .Secretary of the interior and Commis sioner of Agriculture, and praises the reforms in the Civil Service, llo great ly favors the revival of shipbuilding, of iron steamships, and pro- S that ample compensation f r carry ing the ocean nuu 1 ■ , | eenfive there*, VF’ J-I.ifi.Vp! 1 "" ■' 11.- ■ - s . JM 1 ■ < its relation to capifa^^^B|H[^^i:ta\ be said that after explaining the origin of currency—metal and paper—ho im pressed his bearers with the importance of recollecting that currency was merely a tool of exchange. He next considered the depreciation in value of American currency, and strongly deprecated any further inflation as only tending to aid in enabling money to be secured for speculative purposes, and thus diverting it from regular channels of trade. He advocated earnestly a resumption of specie payment at some time to he abso lutely established by Congress. lie spoke of the present financial condition of America as being such as to place her far below the position she ought to oc cupy in the estimation of the world. jT-?T It is now proposed to colonize our very unattractive possessions in Alaska As they are too damp and cold for the ardent American temperament, they are kindly recommended to the hardy and phlegmatic natives of Iceland. An Ice landic commission has recently prospect ed over portions of the territory, and is reported to declare that, though the country may be death to the ordinary races of people, it is a nice land for an Icelander. Very well; we are not only satisfied, but happy. Let them come over, one and all. We decidedly prefer the Norse to the Chinese immigrants as compatriots; and there would, besides, be a charming romance in seeing the same healthy but not overwise race, who were cheerful and happy on the bleakest traets of the eastern shore of the Con tinent five hundred years befor the voy age of Columbus, just as content in this day to be settled upon equally undesirat blc lands three thousand miles to the west. £-£"lt is understood that it is contem plated by Justice Swayne to retire from the bench of the Supreme Court in a few months, under the law of Congress.— Justice Swayne, if he retires, will have his full salary during the remainder of his life. This will give another appoint ment on the Supreme Court Bench to President Grant, who has already had the appointment of four Supreme Court Judges, and another during his term of office would make a majority of the Court his appointees. Such a thing has never happened before during the in cumbency of any President. if-f?'Some important questions con nected with the Granger movement in the west will soon come before the Supreme Court of the U. S. for decision. There are three easespending, which in volve the constitutionality of the laws, which are hostile to the interests of western railroad corporations. One of these cases will probably be argimd earlv in February. our Baltimore letter. “On the Street.” f vrreepomlenet „f the Independent . Uaitimork, Dee. 1, 1874. "The rai-taurtiotT days are come, The saddest of the years . . A little too warm for brandy-smash, A little too cool lor beer." Thus lias a later-day poet befogged the lines of thsA ~A" •••* nobler poet „.l. . .. .memem inasmuch us every TsalyTs supposed to know who poetized the *'lnelanelmly days." Nor do I wish it to be understood that I en tirely sympathise with the later-day poet aforesaid, for •■brandy-sinusli" l never did taste of; yet l have realized the coolings of beer and do grieve some what that I have to forego my mid-day glass. However, there is no use writing of “melancholy days' now. for they have come and gone. Hud l written some days ago, ns l would have done hut for certain peculiar physical sensations class ed under the general designation “not well,” how I would have reveled in the “melancholy days! l |,u know it is quite the thing. Everybody does it.— All the newspapers are affected with it. The dailies have leaders on the subject. (fur best began a leader thus: Now is the season when then the autumn having overpast its hey-day of splendor arrays itself in scant and sombre ves tures, and, its jocund fruitfulness de parted, takes on * sober aspect ; when mists and pUAiint calmness alternate with the cold, winds of the North, and sharp vk'i.-itudes of temperature perturb the of those who travail over nicitics otSronf.-* ■ .p. -'•■q needs tor flannels ami oTs : v'i. .' i.' • I'Wll' ll ' - -)>••> t. t’. • |•: - It 'ill litfal H||||||w .mill 1 ftjtijf.lilt ir l ' i ■•■ i■ i■'■ Woim&: ,l\ '!'■'■ '■• |sS!!glßSr ' ■■' &PH!?’ ,|I,-'ll stop ln-ri*. though sii it tli<* cii'l*"f tlu' jvrinil which is jpipLjis lung again.

We would have spent a whole day in “Druid Hill Park” and “inixt Our fancies wjtli thesallo\v*rifu*<l gloom* tit pvpuiug, and tin* moaning* of the wind.” And then we would have wandered home, and, mounting numberless flights of stairs, which might have jostled down or jostled out the harmony of our thoughts, wo tumid have lighted our students lamp, we would have seated ourself before an open wood fire, and, gazing awhile into the light thereof, a soft melancholy would have stolen over us made harmonious by fitful gusts out side ; and then —unless you be made of stone —-we would hare penned some lines that—well, “The Pleasures of Melan choly” of •• Irving’s” “Poordevil author” would'nt hove been a circumstance.— And as the mater of t'.iis poor devil’s poem is not given to the reader, so your imagination may work up at leisure what our effusion would have been, (rive thanks, meanwhile, that you were spared the agony. Hut joking aside, one does feel as though one should be in the country on some of the days we have had. A gun, a ride on horseback, a listless lolling wherever fancy may select, solitary musings, autumn-day reveries, not alto gether meaningless as some reveries arc, hut tinged with that melancholy which does in fact make harmony. It is such breaks in this work-day city life which gives to life itself harmony. However, enough of this. Wo don’t propose to get sevious, nor aWw this fit of melancholy to grow over us. It is too late in the season as we have said. Every thing and every laxly is braced up and prepar ing for the winter campaign, so we will go into the street and reflect on shops, women or whatever we may pick up. The shop windows look brilliant and wcll-stuffcd and the shop men seem brisk and lively, and this is about all that can be said from a casual glance ; nor do I see how any reflections can be made hereupon. Hut about the shop girls some men might grow eloquent, though for my part I can’t see that shop girls here are as much on good looks as in some cities I have been in. One of the sweetest looking beings I ever saw, was a shop girl in Philadelphia. I went in to purchase a piece of blue ribbon, and you know how long it takes to find the proper shades of blue. Hut about all these shop girlg, flower girls or if is as in the incident related by l)e Quincy in his “Stage coaches in England.” You never see them long enough at a time to have the charms with which you clothe them dispelled by seeing them eat or anything of the sort. I wonder if Holmes would have been so gushing about that chambermaid if the matter of the lost key luu| been discussed over the last course at dinner instead of in a hotel corridor. I wonder too if that relation of mine who used to be such an admirer of confectionery girls ever saw that little four-and-a-half street girl eat. Hut to return to the streets of Baltimore. The streets are particularly the thing at those periods of the day w hen the ladies are out in full blast, 1 think Baltimore holds its reputation for pretty women rather from their outdoor than indoor appear ance; though Heaven forbid that I should insinuate they don’t look divine on every occasion. I suppose the reason is the ladies here appear on the street so well and sometimes so elaborately dressed ; another argument in explosion of the. “beauty unadorned” theory, another street feature is also in full glow at this season. I tlude to the mendicants crouch ed upon door steps or standing on pro minent corner?, who with the approach of cold snaps have an extra twang of what is meant to la: piteousness in their tones, though 1 must cotif ss this sort of thing appeals to my sympathy very little now-a-aays. For 1 note the same old wrecks whom I observed winters ago in apparently the same state of decrepitude, and l have long since collie to the con clusion that if they are as helpless as they represent themselves, they should have died long ago. There are two old women to he found nearly every day on Charles Ft., who are particularly dis tasteful to me. < )ne lias a fearfully bungled up foot and a carefully wrapped hand which have to my knowledge been in this state of careful concealment for several years, leading one to think she lias a tcn-pcnny-nail in her foot and a darning needle in her hand. At first she scctncd an object for charity, hut I passed her one day as she was counting her pennies and lialf-dimos, and there was such a look of avarice on her face as convinced me she must he a fraud. I will lay a wager that woman has lots ol money at home. The other old woman may or may not be an imposter, but I conceived a personal dislike to her. which her new tactics have not dispelled. Flic used to have a basket of those thin rubber balls which make a most disgust ing infantine squeak on being pressed ; and invariably when 1 passed her on my way to dinner she would rouse herself from her depressed posture and squeak mie of those balls at me, uccoiiiunnyiiiK it will! Hiteit jurgon Ilf* would >■“' ♦** a three months old baby if you happen ed to have one. That woman was the pest of toy life for a whole winter. 1 passed her with stealthy tread and bated breath, but she seemed to feel nty presence. Hut in compensation for the persistency of these old women, we are somewhat relieved of hand-organs, those musical nuisances or rather music murderers.— < Iccasionally one comes across a good hand-organ well ground. 1 have only met with two hand-organs that I could tolerate. You see lam dealing in cou plets. One was manipulated by a tine looking Italian with a brigandish look ing hat and mustache who ground out some choice airs from “// Noviitorr" and other operss, accompanying his music with an occasional graceful take ofl' and wave of his hat byway of let ting you know that any favors would Ik thankfully received. This fellow was an artist in his way. The other hand organ was a diminutive box with a plaintive wail, just suited to the only air I ever heard from it. This was a part of that closing “mt” in “Lucia” “ Toiiilh; deijli mi mini ’ of course the thing was vilely enough done by this music box, but it always carried me back to the opera as I first heard Nillson and Caponl render it in the shadows of that .■Saturday ith i/ . ...e, and how I afterwards wandered around in the gloaming tilled with the image of that beautiful white robed maniac and the the lover’s mourn ful melody still brooding over my soul. I hav’nt heard that box for a long time, and I suppose now I should laugh at these fancies and be very much relieved by kicking the cadaverous looking grin der into the gutter. ('os. A Dangerous Counterfeit. Attention is called to a new and dan gerous counterfeit, of which quite a large number have appeared in circulation within a few days. It is a close imita tion of the issue of the five dollar hill of the Traders’ National Hank of Chicago. The entire hill is liable to deceive even an expert at the first glance, and those who receive bills of this bank would do well to examine them with reference to the following description of the differ ence between the true and the counter feit. I'nder the letter “C,” in the word “Chicago” on the face of the counter feit note, the last shade line runs into the top of the first letter in the word “pay,” which is directly under it, while in the genuine a distinct space intervenes. In the date of the year “1865,” under the right-hand end of the words “five dollars,” in the body of the note, the numerals “6” and “5” come closely to gether. In the counterfeit there is a much wider space. The panels in the border surrounding the face of the genuine note have numerous marks of the drapery. In the counterfeit the marks are fewer and less distinct. On the reverse of the note the most distinc tive point of of difference between the counterfeit and the genuine appears in the lathe work enclosing the figure “5” at the lower right and left-hand corner of the note, the eccentric circles being nearly round and very distinct in the counterfeit, and much more eccentric and less clear in the genuine. The kneeling figures in the lefthand of the vignette on the back of the note are much less distinct than in the genuine, and the work generally is coarser. The paper upon which the note is printed is inferior in quality to that used hy the Government, being much coarser. ** mm i^—■ ■' m ■’* Accounts from Canada as well as from several cities of the United .States, state that the K< formed Episcopal Church has made considerable progress, and it is the opinion of those engaged in the movement that it has before it quit a prosperous future. In this country and Canada between thirty and forty minis ters are engaged in the work, with com municants numbering more than 3,000, and other churches, it is said, will soon bs added. r Pinie r Fa 1 >le.
