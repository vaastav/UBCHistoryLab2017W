seven periods, is either two percent, be low or two per cent, above the average, thus showing bow inflexible, and, conse quently, how reliable, the law of increase Uk Assuming that it will continue, it gives the following results: li70, 42,323,341; 1H80, 56,967,216; 1860, 76.677,872; 1900, 10809,415; HMO, 138,918.528; 1920, 18i,84,335; 1930. 251,680,914. These figures show that our country may be as populous as Eu rope now is, at some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925 our territory, at 7.ni persons to the square mile, being of the capacity to contain 217,lo,OiJt, and we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves reliimnish the chances bv the folly and evils of disunion, or by long this plan, the recommendation that Con and exhausting war, springing from the gress provide by law for compensating onlv great element of national discord any State which may adopt cmancipa among us. While it cannot be exactly tinn before this plan shall have been foreseen how much one huge example of acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed, secession deeding lesser ones indefi- ; Such would only be an advance part of nitely would retard the population, civ- 1 the plan, and the same arguments apply ilization. and nrosneritv. no one can to both. doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious. The proposed emancipation would shorten the war. nernetuate peace, in- sure this increase of the population and . proportionately of the wealth of the country. With this we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debts, easier than we tdiould pay our other debts without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent, per annum, simple in terest, frcm the end of our Revolution ary struggle till to-day without pay ing anything on either principal or in terest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then, and this because our in crease of men through the whole period has been greater than 6 jcr cent, and has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt. This fact would be no ex cuse for delaying the payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great import ance of time in this connection, the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hun- dred millions, what by a different policy we should have to pay now, when the i number is but 31,000,000. In a word, it j shows that a dollar will be much harder i to par for the war than will be a dollar . . . . , Ill for emancipation ou the proposed plan and then the latter will cost no blood; no precious life. It will be a saving of both. As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of jcrson3 therein con templated. Some of them doubtless, in a property sense, belong to loyal owuers, and hence provision is made in this arti cle for compensating such. The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as objeetiona- . tile on the one hand or on the other, in somuch as it comes to nothing unless by mi, t ml consent of the people to be de ported and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress. I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor coloniza tion, and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against the colored per sons remaining in the country which is. largely imaginary, if not sometimes ma licious. It is insisted that their pres ence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere argu ments, that tirau surely is not now. In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not will ingly be responsible through time and eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than remaining slaves'.' If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers. If they leave their old places, they leave tin m open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor les of it. Emancipation, even, without deportation, would probably en hance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed. The freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion -of it, and very probably, for ft time, would do less, leaving an in creased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited ex tent, enhancing wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market; in crease the demand for it, and yon in crease the price of it. Reduce the sup ply of black labor by colonizing the black laborers out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand of, and wages for, white labor. Iiut, it is dreaded that the freed people will swaim forth atid cover the whole land. Are they not illicitly in the land? Will liberation make them any more nu merous ?KqualIy distributed among the whites of the whole country, there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one ill anyway greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now hav ing more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without any appa rent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition. The District has more than one free colored person to six whites; ami yet in i:s frequent petitions to Con gress, I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. Hut why should emancipation South send the freed people North? People of any color sel.lt m run unless there be something to run from. Heretofore, col ored people to some extent have fled . North from liondage, and now perhaps from both bondage and destitution; but if gradual emancipation or deportation ' be adopted, thev will have neither to tlee from. Their old masters will give them wages, at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freed men in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in con genial climes and with people of their own blood aud race. This proposition can be trusted to the mutual interests involved, and, in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them? Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people Northwurd because of the .iliolL-lmieiit of slavery in this District last spring? What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the I District is from the Census of 1S60, hav ing no reference to persons called con . trabands, nor. to those made free by the . Act of Congress abolishing slavery here. The plan consisting of these articles i.i : recommended, not but that a restoration i of the national authority would be ac ' cepted without its adoption, nor that the war, not the proceedings under the ! proclamation of September 22d, 186 will be stavod because of the recommcn , dation of lias plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and therebv stay both. And notwithstanding This plan Is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The plan would, 1 am confident, secure peace more speedily than can be done by force alone, while it would cost less, considering amounts aud manner of pay ment, and times of payment, and the amounts would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war, if wc rely solely upon force. It is most likely very likely that it would cost no blood at all. The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It can not become such without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Con gress, and afterward three-fourths of the Stnt.'K. The requisite three fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave Spites. Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no distant day upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever. I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the Lliiet Magistrate of the nation; nor do I forgot that some of you are my seniors, nor that many oi you nave more experience uh I in the conduct of public affairs; yet I trust that, in view of the great rcsponsi- i i: bility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undo earnestness I may seem to display. Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national autho-ity and national prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here, Congress and Executive, can secure its adoption? Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so cer tainly or so speedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by con cert. It is not, ' lan any ot as imagine better," but " Can we all do better?" Object, wheresoever it is possible, still the question recurs, ''Can wc do better?" The dogmas of the quiet past are in adequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with dilliculties, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then wc shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape his tory. We of this Congress will be re membered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insinilicancc can spare one or another of us. The fiery trinl through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We say that we are for the Union. The worltl.will not forget that while we say this, we do know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the poner, and bear the responsibility. In piving freedom to the slave, wc as sure freedom to the free, honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, best hope of the earth.. Other means may succeed. This could noi tail. The way is plain peaceful generous just a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.

The rebels are lallinp; back to Oxford from Abbjrvillc, and how mi'ch further we are not advised. The fact is, they have not sufficient force in fighting trim to meet Gen.

The rebels are about to re ceive, if they have not already received, a blow in the rear for whicn they are no doubt illy prepared. 1'arLiculars will be sent in a dav or two. Un Monday morning, Colonel Lee's cavalry, by a brilliant dash, captured a battcay ef six guns, and the horses be longing to it, on the north side of the Tallahatchee. The horses were hitched and ready to haul the piei-es back, but the gallant Lee's swift-looted cavalry gobbled them up and brought them otVin safety. One Federal only was wound. General Grant left Holly Springs yes terday, saying he would make his head quarters in Abbyville last night General Sherman crossed the Talla hatchie about teu miles below the point where General's Hamilton and Quimbv crossed.
