About one-siith of the army is still located there. It iato be hoped that an im proved condition of affairs In that section may remit the withdrawal of a portion of the forces. The secretary renews the recommendation that tlie extra lteutenaius now authorized by law to -erre am regimental adjutants and qiiar termaster* in the artillery. infantry and cav ?lry regiments be discontinued, a-< vacancies occur in those grades. A yearly saving, with no injury to the service, of nearly *100,100 would thus be ejected.

To spend money in tbe constant endeavor to keep these ships at! oat |> the most expensive ?ar of maintainrg a nary, sinoe constantly in creasing expenditure if answered by c instantly decreasing results of food. It would be the wisest economy at once to afford tbe means and tbe authority to build a number of small ac tive cruisers, of lire oak or of iron, which, adapted to tbe duties and tbe means of our navy id time of peace, aud fitted with the mws n.odern and economical machinery which has succeeded that In use at the commencement of the decade, could be maintained aad employed r<* wme years, with com para.ively littie expei se tor repairs. He says wtbout new material our actlre icrce on the several stations must rapidly de crease until our cruising navy will, in a few years, pass almost entirely awav. He next re. views the work of the various fleets abroad. In regard to the Interoceanic canal he sav*! The present se? ms to be an opportune moment tor us to take into serious consideration the repors ot the surveys and explorations mvie upon the tLi *n w'{h the view of solving, it l>ossible, the engineering and commercial prob lems involved, ^nd establishing water commu nication between tbe two oceans. The Secre tary speaks of the great advantages ot' such canal, and recommends the exploration of every part ot the isthmus, especially those nearer the . nited states, since, though necessarily of greater (length, they he more directly in the pathway ot our commerce and development, and t he mere obstacle of greater length ot canal max be more than overcome, if it shall appear that it can be constructed, without ene >uut?r ing -orious engineering difficulties. Recent in formation ta\ors the examination of tbe vailev ot the river Bojaya. ncxt refers to the cruise or Commander K. \V. Meade among tbe island* ot the Sonth -,.fc!flc known as ?he Na/igation islands. J heir josition. in relation to New Zealand, Australia, the Sandwich Islands, the ports of South America, and the Isthmus, and to San Francisco, makes it almost the necessary har bor lor supplies, coaling, and repairs for all the trade and travel westward to Australia and southern Polynesia, or returning thence to tbe shores of America. A* an available station for coaling and supplies for our national and com mercial marine in that part of the world, it is tar tbe best to be found within a sweep of manv thousand miles. * He warmly urges tbat the opportunity thus afloraed at least to protect, if not to encourage, someof the American interest which are there struggling to establish themselves be embraced. The purchase of a building for the Hydro graphic office is recommended. It is also recom mended tbat experiments in steam boilers under patronage of the government be made with toe view to increased security to our naval and com mercial marine. Legislation regulative of tbe inspection and management or steam boilers must necessarily be imperfect under an imper fect knowledge of tbe causes which lead to explosions; and reliable knowledge can never be attained by silent reflection in the study, or by verbal and theoretical disctE^ion. but only by actual trials on real boilers, under sach condi tions and circumstances as the present advanced state ot engineering science and skill ahali die tafe. He renews his recommendation of last year that our navy yards shall be developed and adapted to the new necessities ot naval warfare. I hey are the resources of naval power, and I ke lortitications. if strong and capable, otten rtettr other rations from lighUv entering upon w ar with their possessors. At Mare Island es pecially, he recommends the establishment of a gi>at dock yard. It is rccomtnended that the i-Lii adelpbia navy yard be carefully valued, and a sum equal to its valuation appropriated to convert I.cage Island info a tirst-class yard tiie sum to be returned to the Treasury as soon ?a tl.e new works shall be sufficiently advanced to warrant the disuse and sale of the o'd vard lie recommends liberal appropriations for tha > or folk yard, to re-establish and multiply its resources. He repeats the recommendations of his last report in regard to the reduction of the num ber of officers in the naval service, and the manner ot tilling the higher grades; and refers again to the suggestion there made tor in creasing the time of ser vice for cadet-midship men at the Naval Academy; and further sug gests that, alter the abolition of the grtd^of commodore iu the manner proposed, Congress should, bj law, provide a certaiu amount of actual sea-service to ie served bv an offl er in each grade brforc he shall bo eligible, in time of peace, tor promotion b> a higher one. 1 he appropriations made bv Congress for tha tsca I year ending June 3ft, 1ST ;, were .1 ??--, tbe actual expenditures for the sarue Kriod. amounted to S17,6il,t>5.7G. This last amount will of course Ihj increaasd by the dis charge of existing contracts and liabilities incurred in distant parts of th^ world, but it is be leved that when all demamis upon the appro priation shall have been s^-fled the actual expenditures will still remain iiijre than - '-'i less than tbe amount appropriated. The af propriations for the current Usual year amount in the whole to *.#,704.55*57 l'he amount ot this appropriation drawn, up to the r mo.nth' ?^.?5.573.07; this, re duced by the amount remaining in the hands of the various paymasters and agents of the government, will leave ?0,0oft,000 as about the amount actually expended fcom tha current appropriations during the wording months of the present tiscal year. The estimates amount to S20:236,747 50, some what larger than last year; but the increase will be tound, on examination, to b<j almost wholly owing to the imperative demands for improve ments In our steam machinery. fbr several yean past eked out by the use of old and (ometimes imperfect materials. In concluding his report, the Secretary refers to the torjedo system, and says: o.ir separation from tbe po.itical complications of Knrope pro duces a security which has resulted in notorious unreadiness to meet any sudden hostile emer gency, which can come only from the sea by an armed navy in proportion to oar strength or to the extent of our roasts. A well-developed system or torj-edo warfare would, to some ex tent. possibly to a latge extent, meet this condi tion ot unreadiness. Torpedo warfare Is still In it- infarct; but It is tbe infancy of a most pow ?' ?^^tnient. and It Is especially the poU cy ot the I nited States to foster its growth as a w,e*I'OT- adapted to oursituatlon. The judgrasnt ot the most careful and experienced officers in our serv.ee is unanimous and strong in ravor of the use or every means or enlarging and improv rtlr TI ?." i J',?. torpedoes, and of provi f ,he,r inTestigatioa and u?e. It wooTd be a grave errcr, however, while advo cating tho importance of torpedoes as one means >.f at ack and defense, to forget that these will not aione snffice tor naval purposes. Men-ot-war add to tbe security of onr citi zens in tortign countries, often semi-barbarous; they give protection to our commerce against illegal violence; they strengthen the hands of diplomatists at hostile or half-civilized court* Situation- are frequent in which the words of peace and of reason will on!v be heard wh?n supported by the argument ot the presence of a iaan-ti-wai a Latttry. j ? ?

The commis-ioner says rh%t the annual increase in the tax on fermented liquors at *1 per barrel in the last three year* as contrasted with the stationary character or the receipts during the four years next preceding, is certainly gratify ing. but the increase durtcg the first three months Of the present fiscal year far exceeds that of any corresponding period in any other year since the organization of the office. The iiumber of persons engaged in the manufacture of fermented liquors during the fl-?al year ended June 30, lfc.2, was 3,421. Of theee it is s??own bat 13 were in the l?i?trict of Columbia. The commiseioner recommends that the lan guage of the amendment* made by the act of .tune C, 1S72. to section 59 of the act of July 2t, ISC*, a* amended April 10. 1*.?, relating to the special taxes tor selling epirituons and m tit liquors and wines be made more explicit; alsj, recommends that retail dealers in tna's liquors l?e limited in th< ir sales to quantities less than five gallons. and that those s Uing in quantities of five gallons and upwards bo required to pay the wholesale dealer's tax. Tables are given showing an increase ii the total receipts f rom the manufacture and sale of tobacco in all its forms, over the receipts from the same sources tor the preceding fiscal jear. of $137,21.3-24; total product of manufactured tobacco for the year 107,!f6d,84.-? poumls. The number of cigars,"cheroots. &c.ton which taxes were collected during the last fiscal year was 1,627.703.972. The entire product of manufac tured toboc< o reported for the fiscal year ended June 30,1S72, exceeds the totnf product of the preceding year by 1,431 ,?92 pounds, while the aggregate qnantity which reached taxation for the last fiscal year was only 73,815 pounds In ex cea? of the quantity which reached taxation the preceding year. The collections for the first quarter of tbe present fiscal year from tobacco are greatly in excess of those made from the sane source during the same quarter for any previous fiscal year. Tbe Commissioner says: "So tar as I am able to judge, the law providing for a uniform rate of tax on all manufactured tobacco, whether chewing or smoking, is operating very satisfac torily." He thinks that the uniform rate of 20 cents per pound will bring about as much reve nue as the old rates; and after a review of the present regulations in reference to tobacco, says: '*1 advise that there be no additional legislation on this subject at present." The whole number of cases compromised, as provided under section 102, act of July 20,1808, during the fiscal vear ended .June 30, 1*72, was 4T!?.

The lirge apparent la ling ofi in the receipts of income from indi viduals is chiefly owing to a difference in the rate of tax. Tbe leceirts for the last fiscal y>ar exceeded the commissioner's estimate by $3,770,946 73. Important changes having beeii made in the la-* by act of .June 6. 1872, touching spirits and tobacco, it is impossible to state with certainty at this early day how mui h the receipts tor the curren* fiscal year will be affected by tUe modi fied provisions of the law.
