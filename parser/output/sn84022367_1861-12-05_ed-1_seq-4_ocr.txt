We are not going to -av to the world that repub lican institution- have so signally failed that we have ignored them, and are going alter the war to give back ami re-establish others. If they hold fast our Constitution we must not violate it ourselves. What ! wage war again-t them for violating the Constitution, and we arc going to violate it ourselves to get at them. We may not object to Congressional legislation declar ing political emancipation. I wish we could. I wish Adam had not sinned, and j cians declare the mes.-age to bit tame and his posterity had not been affected: but j ineffective. On the other hand, the mod that don't help the matter, as I can see. eratt, mr.n ofaU ,,arties. Sire highiv ,,1,!.

Iinvp declared our tealtv : can we now break our part tor the sake of even so ! magnificent a result as the emancipation of the slave ? Shall we rentl the crystal instrumentjoy of the world and our pride ? It is very easy to say it is a state of war, but we extend nothing, we believe, tor we are administering the men by them. Our faith is given : we must keep it. When we cannot abide by our promise, there are methods expressly provided, we must withdraw the pledged agreements of the Constitution, and stand apart as two .wparate peoples. Are we then shut up in this reasoning ? No ; what the pen of the legislator cannot do, the sword of war will do. The South's strength in this war is slavery. They have placed it in their constitution as a bulwark. They are fighting behind that, and now we have come to the pass that we tire not able to fi.lfill our sworn nact and maintain the in tegrity of this land and the Constitution ! itselt; we cannot mainiam a atwiumg iu : ite own principles, except by contending j them with the shield of slavery on their j urm In punishing the transgressor we 7 1 , , , ,j r. .. .... ! sli ike throush the shield. It rsynot twpo- litical act. but a military, whioh they have i compelled, that has brought on the begin ning of this emancipation, and will carry it to such a degree as will make slavery a burthen to them, and make them, in the end, the most derirous for its end." Ckoswell's Vikws. Suppose the munitions of war are within our reach, would we not be guilty of shameful neglect if we availed not our selves of the opportunity to use them? Suppose the enemy's slaves were arrayed against you, would you. from any squear. ishness. refrain from pointing against thorn the hostile gun, and prostrating them in death ? No; that is your object and pur pose : and if you would seir.e their prop erty, open their ports, and even destroy thvdr lives, I ask you whet'ier you would not use their slaves? Whether you would not arm their dans great ap plause, and carry them in hattaUions aiainst their master ! Renewed and tumultuous applause. Take property wherever you may find it. Take the slave and bestow him upon the non slaveholder if you please. Great applause. Do to them as they would do to us. Raise up a party of interest against the absent slaveholder, distract their coun sels, and if t'lis should not he sufficient, take the slave by the hand, place a musket in it, and in God's name bid him strike for the liberty of the human race. Im mense applause. Now, is this emanci pation ? Is this Abolitiodism ? I do not regard it as either. It no more partakes ; of Abolitionism than a spaniel partakes ! of the nature of the Hon. Abolitionism is to free the slaves. It is to make war SiraCl prun;ipits l njuami ii..iii ...v.. I liut to take the slave and make him an who doe- not tin-, or something equiva lent to it, is unworthy ot the po-ition In; h..!ds. and equally unworthy "t your con fidence."
