VOL. IX. GUITEAU'S GALL. He Still Wy Enough Left to Tell Judge Porter He Had Bettter Shut Hit Month. Scoville Becomes Enraged at John W. Guiteau for Interfering in the Ca«e. Hi— Julia H. Wisbon, Cousin of the Prisonpr, Testifies to Guiteau's Sanity. John Guiteau Told by the Assassin He Had Better Go Back to Boston. What a Chicago Man, Who Wants a Free Pass to Washington Knows Abont Guiteau. His Cousin Testifies. Special Dispatch to th* Datlv Tribune: WASHINGION, Dec. 8 —When the Gui­ teau court assembled Mrs. Julia M. Wibon, of Leadville, a cousin of the pris­ oner, testified that she k»ew L.W. Gui­ teau from her earliest recollection he •was her uncle. The witness then gave a most feeling aecount of the life apd char­ acter of her mother, Mrs. Maynard, who, it had been alleged by the detense, had died insane, but who really died from pneumonia. Her mother was noted for a ovely disposition and Christian character, and her virtues are remembered and spoken of till this day. The deposition of Mr. Turner was read, in which he said, "I have heard her husband say she died insane," and the witness was ques­ tioned in regard to it. Scoville objected to her reply, "I never heard it," and A LIVELY DISCUSSION ensued between Judge Porter and Sco­ ville. Guiteau became enraged at Judge f?brter and shouted, "Now hold your thunder till you get tjie jury. Judge, you are doing this sort of thing too much." At the conclusion of Mrs. Mil Ion's testimony, John W. Guiteau arose from his seat next to the prisoner and asked the court to rule out the question and answer relative to .the witness' father having died of softening of the brain. Judge Cox—"1 think the matter irrev erend." Scoville here arose trembling with ex­ citement, and protested against the med­ dling of John W. Guiteau in his pase. "He opposed to showing the insanity in the famify," said Scoville, and his voice was here drowned by the prisoder who struck his hand violently on the table and shouted, *'So do I, he had better go back to Boston." Another Crank. N EW YORK, Dec. 8.—In the trial to-day of W. Send ram for the murder of his landlady, Mrs. Crave, Adolphus Sendram, a brother os the prisoner, identified some letters written by him, one letter to the husband of the deceased. Sendram writes he was overcome with grief at hearing of Mrs. Grave's death, and at not "being able to attend her funeral or send fiowers, saying, "cirbvm stances oyer which I had no control—being confined in the tombs—preventing me from doing one or the other." He hopes, however, she had a fashionable funeral, and then inquires it her carcass was dumped in hell or Hartwell Island. He then asks Mr. Crave who his housekeeper was now and who stuffs the geese. He knew nothing about doing the lattervbut he knew lead was very good to stuff she devils with. He only put a little into* Mrs. Crave, but it took all devilishness out of her. He avers he is glad he shot her, and would do so again if he had a chance. He is not afraid of being hanged, as "hanging, in New. York is about played out," but if hanged wtould only suffer a few moments, "while Mrs. Crave lingered five months. In a letter to the district attorney the prisoner refused to plead insanity, as ad­ vised by the counsel, saying he preters .hanging to long imprisonment for Insanity. He says this is a plea that is generally made use of in defense by assassins like Gui teau, for instance, in whose defense nojth ing whatever can be said, but that they are crazy. Guiteau is trying his best to make the world believe he is insane. In another letter the prisoner admits the shooting, saying that after he shot Mrs. Crave, he knew he was liable to be sent to prison, ^nd he fired the second in ordeT to make her suffer as well as himself. It his bullet had killed her at once he says be would have long ago joined Cox and Balbe in heaven where all murderers go. The reading of the letters stirred up deep feelings of indignation against the pris-» oner in court. Caught at Last. BUFFALO, Dec. 8.—Wm. Burke alias Charles H. Page was arrested here yester day as the thief who stole $117,000 worth of railroad bonds belonging to D. P. Eels, of the Commercial National bank of Cleveland. Burke or Page was taken at the express office while inquiring for a suit of clothes shipped to him from Cleve­ land. If appears he with two other men ordered suits at Cleveland which were to be shipped to Buffalo, and his two com­ panions are supposed to have the stolen bonds in their possession. Burke alias Page hails from Chicago, and is recog­ nized as a professional bank and safe thief. Last summer he was caught in the act of attempting to steal valuable papers out of a vault in thes bank of Choes, New York. He was ar­ rested and admitted to bail. He was again arrested for a similar attempt at a bank in Baltimore, but again got out on bail. No difficulty has been met in raising flonev, as he belonged to a gang of ex­ perts, who would put up $50,000 if neces­ sary. He was also wanted at Detroit, Loekpnrt and other places. This arrest recalls the [famous bank robbery of this city at the Erie County savings bank a feW months ago, but the officials of that institution were unable to identify Burke as the* mysterious person at their bank on the day the theft occurred. Know What He Was About. Special Dispatch to the Daily Tirbune: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6—In the Guiteau trial Charles B. Farwell was called to the stand to testify as to the political situa­ tion at the time of the assassination. On cross examination he said he considered Guiteau crazy, but not so crazy but what he knew better than to shoot the presi­ dent. Geo. C. Gorham was then called, but his evidence was not important. Davis Makes a Talk. WASHINGTON, NOV. 6.—In the senate today, when Edmunds called up his reso­ lution providing for a continuation of the senate commissions as they existed at the close of the last session, President pro tem. Davis, who temporarily occupied his former seat I the floor, having vacated the chair to Harris, said: "Mr. Presi­ dent: That solemn event which excited the sympathies of the civilized world re­ cently xbrought about an unexpected chance in the presidency, and the Forty seventh congress now meets under his constitutional successor a president who was only inaugurated last March, and was stricken down in maturity ot his manhood after but four months, experience in the executive chair. These stern facts are full of ad­ monition they teach us how, frail are hu­ man hopes and how transitory how vain are our aspirations to which too much of our lives is devoted. Great as was the be­ reavement which spread sorrow over our land and which touched the hearts of every firm in America/ it was sanctified by the consolation that the people of all sections were brought nearer together by com­ mon grief, and thus came to understand each other better. Though kindred as­ pirations had been long tstiblislied, they wore softened and the violence of faction was cliastined by the affliction, although President Arthur represents the party that elected Garfield. His personal position is necessarily deli­ cate and trying he is entitled by his whole bearing through the critical ordeal to the generous countenance I propose to extend to his administration candid treatment justifying it when right and op­ posing it when wrong on air public questions holding it to this purpose, and intending to insist on a purse, economical aad just administration of executive trust. The new president ought to be aided by all proper legislative co-opera tion for the carry ibg out of the policy he may. propose to the country. Whatever that policy in the future may be it is en titled to the lair trial and patient hearing. Huns by a Hob.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec.. 6.—On the night of the 4th Mrs. Ann Jamison was shot dead by an unknown assassin, who fired the kitchen. The Great Farce. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—In the Guiteau trial to-day, Scoville became considera­ bly vexed at Corkhill, and asked him once if he was testifiing. Corkhill re­ plied, "I only wish I could." Scoville—"Go on the stand then and testify don't set there ,and talk to the jury." Witness Backup was asked if he ever heard of L. W. Guiteau asserting he could heal diseases bv prayer. 1' Guiteau excitedly said, he only talked that in his fam ly he didn't go around the street to preach it like an idiot bn a ickass he had too much sense for that. Witness had never heard any such claim on the part of L. W. Guiteau. He was asked if he Kaew Guiteau—••'The fact of tfeiasfitter- is, my father used the money which should have sent me. to college in supporting that Dr. North and his family on'my father's farm at Freeport." I Col. Corkhill—"That's ju3t my opinion of Dr. North." Pending the cross-examination John W. Guiteau (a brother of prisoner) arose and protested against the manner in which the name of his half sister, Fl »ra W. Guiteau, had been mentioned. He desired the witness should state exactly the infirmity under whjch she labored. Col. Corkhill thought the request a most reasonable one. He had received a letter from the young lady, who had been twenty-four ears unmairied, and against whom no word ot reproach had been uttered. She had felt very keenly the in­ sinuation that had been made upon the stand by the defense that she had been sent to St. Louis for treatment in antici­ pation of her- BECOMING INSANE. Witness stated that the young lady in question suffered from afflicted eyes, and was sent to St. Louis tor treatment. Her eyes— Guiteau, turning angrily to his brother, whispered, "What do you want to make such a fuss about that for?" Then, aloud, "I'm sorry that my half sister's name has been dragged in here. She is a very nice person s.» far as I know, and I send her greeting." Mrs. Scoville, sitting on the other side of J. W. Guiteau, was greatly excited,and angrily accused her brother of trying to injure their case. ATKINS' TESTIMONY. Witness was asked if he knew Dr. North, and replies, "Yes, I knew him as a Methodist minister, and I know the cause of his dismissal." /=. Col. Corkhill.—"Well,t what were the causes?" s Witness.-—"He was dismissed for lasciv­ ious conduct- On the conclusion of the examination tiie witness was cross-examined. Just before recess someone in the au­ dience behind Guiteau made a request for his autograph. Guiteau wrote it with a florish, and as he tore off the slip said, "1 want to, callattention(to thiaAutograph business. A great many BISMARCK, D. T., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9,1881. NO. 27. Dr. North. Dr. North was the most positive witness in troduc by the defense and by his show­ ing the entire Guiteau family were more orles* insane. Witness%plied, "Knew him in Freeport persons want my autograph, and Igive it to them, but there's no vanity about nfi?tor egotism. I notice the nerspapers are talking it up again. There is nothing in it at all. '.v -J. 8. COCURANSI a lawyer "Who had reside# in Freeport since 1358 testified that he "never saw an indication of insanity in any member of the Guiteau family." The witness was abofffte Teaveika ataiwt when Guiteau shouted to him, "Hold on. Don't you know his active support in the Oneida com­ munity Haven't you heard him discuss free conversion? Don't you know he was the laughing stock of all Freeport for twenty-five years for his cranky ideas?" Scoville, whispering to Guiteau, tried to lestram him, but he houted at him, "You keep quiet I'm doing this. Don't you know enough to keep still ^rhen I^a* questioning a witness?" Then with a wave of the hand, "go on Mr. Witness, answer these questions." Witness was told he might answer, and replied, "I know just the reverse, be­ cause- ." Gyiteau—"Well, that was the fact any­ way. We don't want any more fof this kind «f evidence. These people" don't know anything about my father's social life and character. There's no contro vercy ab6ut his business character.?,' GEO. W. OGLER, justice of the peace next testified. He ssfid he had lived in Freeport since 1848, and never.saw any indications of insan­ ity in any of the Guiteau family. Witness was asked if he. knew a- man by the name of Amerling, who had testi­ fied for the de ense. Scoville, somewhat excited, protested againsf the unfairness of the prosecuting attorney in making attacks on Amerling as he had done in the examination of'sev eral witnesses. Guiteau shouted, "It only shows the bad breeding of the man." ANSON G. BABCOCK, a farmer, had known C. W. Guiteau since 1840 never sayjr any indications of insan­ ity in him, and' ne_ver regarded any of the family of unsound mind. David A. Sunderland knew L. A. Guiteau for thirty-six years and never saw anything to indicate he was of un­ sound mind in any way or in any degree. From his knowledge and acquaintance wit members of Guiteau's family in­ cluding the prisoner, the witness had never suspected there was any insanity in the family. Guiteau had for some minutes been busy in readfhg the president's message and suddenly interrupted the court pro­ ceedings to express his opinion upon the document. "I am glad," said the prisoner, "that President Arthur has given these Mormons such a slap. I hope he will keep at then? it's a good message has got the right ring to ot. Arthur is doing well and he is going to give the United States the best administration we have ever had." 

STILL THEY COME. Tarbox, ot Freeport, was well ac­ quainted with the prisoner's father he had as good ahead as any man in the state, and, "after a slight pause, "he was the third smartest man in the country." "Who was the first," quickly asked Guiteau. Answer—"Mr. Lincoln." "Who was second." Answer—"Mr. Turner." "Well," said Guiteau, with a broad smile of satisfaction, "as they have both been dead a great many years, my father was ahead," Guiteau was about to inteifupt with another little speech, when: Scoville en­ deavored to stop him and was told,"Don't be punching me under the table, please, when I want to speak." After a short pause, "I tell you what it is, Scoville, you have got to abandon your theory that is all therb is about that. He was a smprt man and everybody kuows it only he was badly cracked on religion." The court then adjourned. A WEEK MORE. District Attorney Corkhill is quoted as expressing a belief that the trial will not last more than a week longer. John W Guiteau is quoted to the. effect, so far as he is concerned, the question of jurisdic tion of this court would not be raised un til after the jury returned an unfair ver­ dict.' -r:'•""••• 1 Guiteau had many visitors at the jail yesterday.. He was very cheerful. HEAVY FAILURE. A Black Eye Administered to Miles City by the Failure of A. B. Nin­ inger & Co. The Liabilities of the Firm Placed at $285,000, With Anettsto Cover iThem. Interview With Mr. SNininger, Who Claims the Reported Liabilities are^Over-Estimated. The Unsuspected Advent of the Bail road Partially the Cause of 1 the Failure. Together With an Overstock, Close Competion, and the Stringency of the Money Market. Heavy Failure. MILES CITY, M. T., Dec. 8.—There was great excitement and unusual surprise in this city to-day, when the report was cir­ culated that the firm of A. E. Nininger & Co., had failed. There was consternation among the depositors in the bank, owned by this firm, but it is believed this part of the institution is all right. The liabilities are placed at $285,000, with nearly ample assets-. There is much sympathy ex. pressed for C. W. Savage, junior member of the firm and resident manager. This firm was one of the largest in the north­ west, and has carried at -different times as high as a $350,000 stock. The cause of the failure is attributed to sharp com­ petition and overstocking of goods in an­ ticipation of the railroad not reaching this point this winter. Most of the credi­ tors are in St. Paul, and Mr. Savage is ^nguine^ aD arrangement whereby the business nwiy continue. -v
