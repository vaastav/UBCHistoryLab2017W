6T. MARY’S BKACOJ*. BRONARDTU**, Ilf. T.iriWDAT MORNING, IWttbcr 16th. 1*75. CojrnßtaE.—The proceedings of Con gress since Its present meeting have been without special interest, the lower branch not haring yet gotten into working condition. It is expected, however, that tbe different committees will be constituted by the Speaker in a few days, but nothing iu way of earn est, serious business is likely to be brungbt up until after the coming Christmas Holidays. Tbe majority appear to be bent upon reform and re trenchment investigations, and in this connection, very many interesti g de velopments may be expected. In tbe Senate, the Republicans hare com menced business by giving an unfair organiza tion to some of the committees, par ticularly to that on Finance. This is likely and certainly ought to lead to retaliation on tbe part of tbe lower 4House. The more bitterly the parties iu Congress are antagonized the the greater tbe likelihood of a thorough and searching investigation into all matters of corruption and misgovern meat. Caimihat. Mattsks.—Win. 11. Skin ner, colored, was brought l*efore Jus tice Morgan on Friday last charged with the larceny of one yearling, the proper ty of Dominick S. Bowles, and after an examination of the case was held to ■ wait the action of the Grand Jury.— The Larceny was one of very daring per j < tration, and the arrest of the party waa'tnet by considerable resistance. In an attempt to escape, Skinner was shot in the shoulderand face l-y Mr. Bowles. His wounds have been attended to and wore pronounced not to be of a serious character. The accused failing to pro cure bail was committed to the custody of the Sheriff and is now confined in jail. Col. Crane appeared for the State and Messrs. Harris and Camalier for the accused. Henry Simpson, colored, was also on the same day brought before Justice Hammett, charged with breaking into the store .f Parsons Si Spalding, situa ted in the Patuxent district. The tes timony not being sufficient to commit, the attused was discharged. He was iuuuediab !v ro-amated upon a peace warrant, and failing to procure bail, was committed to jail. C’ol. Crane appear ed for State and B. U, Camalier fur the acciucd. • A Nr.w PeesidentialCanpidate.— I ndcr the caption above given, wc no tice that our Washington city cotem poraries describe in late issues the ar rest and temporary sequestration of “a demented individual, calling himself A Bailey, and hailing from Leonard town, who imagine s himself the coming president.” Ihe arrest, it seems, was made by < fficer Henkle. (no relation, by-the-by, of our eloquent representa tive in Congress.) ami was perfected whilst the aforesaid “coming president” was “haranguing a crowd of urchins on Louisiana Avenue.” The writers go oa to state, that the Bailey aforesaid was subsequently taken to police Head quarters and threatened, among other things, with the insane asylum. All we have to say in reference to the above matter is. that a Bailey might have been arrested and treated as sta ted. but we demand, does it therefore follow that a Bailey and (Jen. Austin Bailey of our Town is one and the same person r The General is, indeed, a candidate for the presidency and “hails” from Leonardtown, but that he can be the person s|>cken of or that any 11 mile ever arrested him is a story just a lit* !e too preposterous, gentlemen, to impose on ws, however it may have tffocttd the weak intellect of others. A Mossier Hoo. — Many of our co temporaries in tbe upper } art of the State have l*e n indulging in huge brags this Fall al out the weight of the pet bogs of their section, the heaviest that wo noted being 575 !hs. We thought all the time that St. Mary's could beat this if she ma lo an . ffort. and we have now to record, that James F. Abell, Esqr., killed a porker at his place on the 13th instant whose nett weight amounted to 6081 ths. The hog in question was pigged the last of Sep tember To and was consequently aged •bout 2(11 months at the date of killing. Mr. Al-ell estimated that the hog gained -Li) Bs within the last twelve mouths. Stock Chester.

Tes Pbesidcvt's Mbssaob.—Tbe only thing in the President’s Message which seems to have arrested special public attention is bis preposition to amend tbe Constitution by the adoption of a provision requiring the several States to establish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to, at least, the rudimentary education of all children irrespective or color, sex nationality or religion; forbidding, however, tbe teach ing in such schools or inculcation of pagan or atheistic tenets, or the bestowal of school funds to any religions denomi nation for educational purposes. He also objects to tbe accumulation of vast amounts of untaxed church property, and says that class of property in the •United States in 1875 amounts to sl,. 000,000,000. He recommends the tax ation of all such property, exempting only cemeteries and limited edifices for churches. Beyond these suggestions, the Message is quite as flat as public Messages generally are, the present one, however showing evidence of care and ability in preparation.

The following conditions must be ob served by conj}<ctitors for these prizes. 1. All the stories are to be American in their scenes, subjects and character, in whole or in part; that is to say, the basis of the story must be American, but this condition does not preclude such incidental diversion from Ameri can scenes, subjects and character as may be necessary to interesting devel opment of the story. 2. The stories must not contain sen timents of a political, sectarian or sec tional nature, it being especially requir ed that allusions to the late sectional war be avoided; and they must he of such tone as befitsthe character of such an extensively circulated Family Jour nal as is The Baltimore Weekly Sun.

Editor/: —I tender you my sincere thanks for publishing in the Beacon my circular to the Democratic members of the House of Representa tives, and especially for your commen dation and wishes for my success as candidate for the office of Sergeant-at- Arms. My thanks are also due for similar notice taken of my application to the Montgomery Sentinel , the Nw nan (Ga.) Herald and New Yoik Day Root, and probably to other thorough democratic journals. As a set-off to their favorable consideration, I have l>een assailed by other papers profess ing democratic principles, not only for the oj inions and wishes expressed in my circular, but *he most unbecoming and offensive epithets have been applied to me personally—“ ironclad Bourbon,” “unrepentant rebel.”“lunatic” and even “fool,” are specimens of their notice of me. To tic first charge, in the proper ap plicaiion of it, 1 plead guilty. The charge of being a Bourbon indicates, no doubt, reproach by those who male it. for not forgetting the chief duty and obligation of an American citizen to re collect and support the Constitution of bis country. That instrument should lo held sacred by him as the great foundation stone of his liberty and his earthly happiness. It should* never be changed by custom or force, but onlv by the mode provided within itself—the full consent of three-fourths of the 'States —any other mode of change be ing utterly null and void. On these points the American patriot should be invincibly ••ironclad” and “hold the fort.” But what offeuce* have I committed to justify the other epithets or charges made against me ? Even many of rov friends who were anxious for my suc cess were somewhat stocked in’ what they called my rashness iu making the developments contained in my circular, and considered mv prospects complete ly marred for that reason. Inthistbev did not take counsel from tbeir own honest hearts and judgments, but from the sneaking character of politics and politicians. A man who seeks office in these degenerate day* must not be too frank He should learn to suppress the truth, and if necessary for success! not hesitate t practice false pretences.! These very fashionable tricks do ant ac cord with my ideas of what is proper. \ Tbe fact is, Messrs. Editors, I tin 1 neither afraid nor ashamed of havingm v record presented to public view, for I sincerely believe it is based upon tbe true theory of our government. No of fice that can be offered me would cause me to retract one single position taken in my circular and I feel highly compli mooted that even thirteen members of the House did not consider its ooolents any objection to voting for me. Not having soughtany-pledges from any one I do not know who the thirteen were, but whenever known I am confident they will be found to be thorough dem ocn is.® Tbe points taken in that circular are : Ist. That I voted fur John C. Bretk enridge in 1860, standing on his con st itutiocal platform. That needs no defense. 2nd. That I would not vote for Horace Greeley in 1972, standing ' on bis unconstitutional, negro equality platform. I have received too many | compliments for my cou-se in that re spect to require one word in defense, and truly hope that suicidal dose will not again be taken by tbs democratic party. 3rd. I expressed my belief in tbe fight of Slate secession. Some of the greatest men in this lieved in the right and publicly assert ed and taught it. Eveu the Govern ment of the United States bad it taught in the only school under its control (West Point) by placing in tbs hands of Jefferson Davis and other pupils as a text-book Rawle’s Commentaries on tbe Constitution, in which it is express ly and ably taught. A singular in s’ ructor truly, who punished its pupils for learning tbe lessons assigned to them. It is true, the late war killed and crip pled a million of men, and with them killed the late act of secession, hut it did not and cannot kill the principle. That will awaken again whenever one section of States, with tbe Government to back if, shall dare to trample on tbe rigtys of another section, as was done by the North upon tbe South. If such a case should occur within the short remnant of my life (which God forbid) I shall certainly approve secession as 1 did in the case of the South. It must indeed l>e an extraordinary exercise of oppression for which it would ever 1 e adopted, for all the States know ai d feel the • great benefits of the Un ion when the Government performs its constitutional duties, instead of tram pling upon and rendering insecure the constitutional rights of the States. The prominent men of the North—the men who had control of the Government in Itf'Jl—did not disguise that their ob ject, in forming the Republican party, was to bring about such a condition of affairs, which the South knew and fell and st ill fed would he and is most op pressive ami destructive of their inter est and happiness. Without enlarging on this point and repeating that I hope no cause for secession will ever again arise. I stand by the declaration that the South was right in every point of view in seceding from the Union, and that the war carried on against her for so doing was a useless and atrocious outrage. There never was an occasion in which the words of the dramatist oc curred with more force to the unselfish patriot and statesman —“Take away the sword. States can be saved without it.” That my denunciation of tbe war as an outrage should bring on an attack from a democratic paper or democratic man displays considerable inconsisten cy and injustice. I opposed it, it is true, from the beginning, while many of them aided by tbeir v< tea and servi ces in carrying it on. But sometime about the 2i*th of August, 1864, the Chicago democratic platform brought us vorv near together, when it was de clared in tiial Convention, iu their sec ond resolution, that ‘‘Justice, humani ty, liberty and the public welfare de manded that immediate efforts l*e made for a cessation of hostilities.” Why. gentlemen, in view of these facts assail with abuse so humble au individual as j T am ? After stamping the war an an afro cions outrage, it was quite logical that I should not desire success for the in vaders in such a war. With these feel imrs. I ottered the prayer, not that the S<.uth should injure or subjugate the North, hut oh shocking! 1 prayed that the North might not subjugate the South. In view of the awful calamities which have followed the overt brow of the South and the insolent tyranny of the North. I do not believe that there is a single intelligent patriot in the land who doss not regret that God did not grant my prayer. But inde|>endentlv of consequences, whaS propriety is there in condemning me for uttering this prayer when the Lower House of Con gress (1 think unanimously) declared, in the celebrated Crittenden resolution, “That this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of eonqnrst or nbjngaUon.'* If such a prayer as I offered had been made by any member of that House which passed that resolution, would they have attempted to erptl or ct new re him? I jadue not. WLy did they not censure Mr. Crittenden who offered it ? It adds strength to my position when we find that a motion was made iw the Senate when the Crittenden resolution reached that body, by Senate r Trumbull, to strike out the word “subjugation,” which was rejected by the vote of eve ry Senator present but Trumbull, thus rebuking him for expressing the desire to thhjtigoU the South. Thus, it ap pears, the Senate and *he House both denounced the idea of subjugation. I afterwards prayed that they might not do what they considered a deliberate wrong, and while they are held up as great patriots and statesmen. I am |>ointed at as an unrej'entant rebel by Republicans and a lunatic and fool by Democrats, beeanse with such a record as above 1 had the audacity to offer myself as a candidate foran office with in the gift of the present Democratic House of Representatives, I will sav no more at present. I hope ray friends will be satisfied with this defense, and I trust that those who have spoken so harshly of me may feel that they have done me injustice. B. Q.
