POWERFUL' STIMULANTS RESORTED TO SklU of Fonr Physician Unable to Overcome tha Effect of Bleed i lac and Death . PORTLAND. Or., Io. Reunited States Senator John H. Mitchell died at the Good Samaritan hospital In this city at 11:40 o'clock this fo.-enoon, death resulting from complications which followed th removal of four teeth at a dental office yesterday morning. A hemorrhage of unusual e- verily followed the removal of the teeth and despite the application of the most owerful stytlcs known to dental science the flow of blood could not be stayed. Physicians wer summoned to the dental omce. but the combined scicntlllc knowl edge of the dtntists and physicians could not stop the flow of blood. The senator's condition soon became alarming and It was decided to remove him to the hospital. When he reached the hospital he was In a very weakened condition and It became apparent that unites the flow of blood was soon stopped life would pass out. Senator Mitchell had long been a suf ferer from diabetes and other vitiating diseases and In his weakened physical con dition rapidly succumbed to Inevitable weakness following such violent hemor rhages and lapstu Into a state of semi consciousness early In the evening. Hemorrhage Return. Four- physicians, Dr. A. J. Glesy. Dr. Giorgo W. Wilson, Dr. Emll Pohl and Dr. James O. C. Wiley, worked over the sen ator and about 7 o'clock last night tempor arily stopped the hemorrhage, but the relief was of but short duration and again the blood began to flow Intermittently, continu ing during the evening and through the right At an early hour this morning a severe vomiting spell further weakened the senator, and It became more and more apparent that the euO was approaching All during the night saline solution was ia- jected into the veins to furnish more luid for the olrculatory system and to stimu late the sluggish circulation. The diabetic coma Into which the senator lupned grew more and more pronounced, despite the frequent use of powerful stimu lants, snd only occasional evidences of a certain degree of mental activity rewarded the untiring efforts of the physicians and nurses In attendunce. Several hour be fore death the Injection of saline solution was discontinued and more powerful heart stimulants resorted to. but with no effect on the rapidly sinking man. After day light the Senator's condition grew , worse and Indications of mortification became, evi dent especially In the ankles, knees and hips. Several hours before death the ac tion ef the heart at times became almost Imperceptible and the breath came In short, spasmodic gasps. As the end ap proached these symptoms became more and more pronounced, death ensuing at 11:40 o'clock. Senator Mitchell did not at any time realise the seriousness of his condition. When he visited the dental office yesterday he was In a weakened condition, owing to the diseases which affected him. and his request that an ansesthetio be administered was declined, the dental operator persuad ing hint that such a course might prove harmful. The first three teeth were ex tracted with little or no trouble, the flow of blood being normal. The extracting of the fourth tooth was a difficult task and It was following the removal of this that the violent hemorrhage manifested Itself. At Senator Mitchell's bedside when he passed away were his son-in-law, Judge W. O. Chapman of Tacoma, Wash.; J. H. Price, his nephew; Mrs. Lottie Price, and Mrs. May Earth, nieces, all of this city, Several friends of Senator Mitchell had left the bedside shortly before his death came. Arrangements for Mr Mitchell's funeral wiU not be completed until Mr Mitchell's son. John H., Jr., arrives. Mr. Mitchell left Minneapolis this morn ing. Senator Mitchell's Successor. Governor Chamberlain will appoint a sue cessor to Senator Mitchell within a week. In an Interview today the governor said: "I have as yet mads no selection. Or' gon Is sorely In need of representation at Washington, but before taking action I shall look over the situation thoroughly and select a Brian equal to the occasion. I shall make the beat selection possible." It Is almost, a certainty, however, that the new senator will be a democrat. Great pressure has already been brought to bear upon the governor to select a Portland man, whether democratic or republican, Heading this list of possibilities are Colonel C. . E. 8. Wood, a prominent lawyer, and Charles E. Ladd, a banker, democratic; and T. B. Wilcox, a well known flour mill manj republican. If the slate's executive shoufU go outside the city, in the timber available Is A. Bush, a banker of Sulem, and one of the most prominent and able democrats In the sitae. Other democrats of ability are James Raley of Pendleton, B. A. Whit of Buker City. Judge A. S. Bennett of The Dalles. Senator Mitchell's chief counsel' during the trial which led to his conviction, and A. E. Reams, a well known lawyer of Jacksonville, who was de feated by Binger Herrmann for congress at til lust election. Seaule Ucki a Precedent. WASHINGTON, Dec.

DECLINED TO TELL OF THEIR CONFERENCE Trna.crlpt of Teatlniony Sent t District Attorney Proprietor s Kanltable Will Be Cited for Contempt. NEW YORK, Dec. 8. The legislative committee which Is Investigating life In surance conditions today determined to send to District Attorney Jerome a request that he Institute proceeding against Thoma F. Ryan, financier and owner of the majority of the stock of the EqultabM Life Assurance society to punish Mr. Ryan for refusing to answer questions before the committee. Mr. Ryan had refused to an swer when asked what E. H. Harrlman, president of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, had said to him when Mr. Harrlman tried to induce him to enure h's control of the Equitable society with Mr. Harrlman. t Mr. Ryan was asked whether Mr. Harrl man had threatened that results disastrous to Mr. Ryan's Interests would ensue or If Mr. Harrlman had told him that some ac tion would be taken by the state legisla ture, or any officer of the government, un less Mr. Ryan consented to share his stock with him. Acting on the advice of his at torney, Paul D. Cravath, Mr. Ryan declined to answer those questions, although Senator Armstrong, chairman of the committee, directed him to do so. Mr. Ryan, however, did answer one question by saying that Mr. Harrlman did nut tell lilin at Hint time there would be legislative Investigation of the life Insurance business unless he gave up part of the Hyde stock. Mr. Ryan had already told that he had secured control of the Equitable by paying James H. Hyde I2.floo.00i) for 601 shares of the total shares of the society. Harrlman Asks a Share. "After you had bought that stock was there anv proposition to share It with you?" asked Charles E. Hughes, counsel for tho committee. "Am I obliged to answer that question"'" aked Mr. Kyan. "I think you ought to, Mr. Ryan." said Mr. Hughes. "Mr. E. H. Harrlman desired to share th. purchase with me and I refused to permit that," replied Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan said that he thought Mr. Harrl man made his request on tho day that Mr. Ryan bought the stock and before the purchase was publicly announced. "What .did Mr. Harrlman say to you to Influence you to make the sale?" "I do not think, Mr. Hughes, I ought to be called upon to answer a question like that to characterize or state a conversation I had privately with Mr. Harrlman." said Mr. Ryan. Paul D. Cravath Interrupted by saying to the chairman: "I feel bound to say to my client, Mr. Ryan, that while he should testify I ost fully to what he did and what he planned to do, lie cannot .unless he -choose to .do. so voluntarily, be required to attempt to state conversations which Mr. Harrlman or any other man had with him." Matter Rewarded as Important. To this Mr. Hughes replied: "I deem the matter important in two aspects. In the first place, that the com mitteo may understand the motive which may actuate those who desire to obtain control of the stock of tho Insurance com pany and the proceedings which may be taken to acquire it; and second, that we may know whether there is any truth In the report that there was any suggestion that life insurance conditions in this state would be Investigated If Mr. Ryan did not accede to Mr. Harrlman's request. I think that we should have full light upon the transaction and I hope that Mr. Ryan will feel that he can do another public service by advising the committee fully." Mr. Cravath said that Mr. Ryan would testify freely as to facta, but that he was not required to state what Mr. Harrlman said to him. tin private conversation. "Mr. Ryan," said Senator Armstrong, "the committee directs you to answer the question." The following colloquy resulted: Mr. Ryan I will answer It so far as to state that I refused to share th purchase with Mr. Harrlman. - "What did Mr. Harrlman say to you In connection with the matter?" N Mr. Cravath My advice to you is that you are not required to answer that ques tion. The Chairman Do you refuse? Mr. Ryan I refuse to answer on the d vlce of counsel. Xo Threat of Investlitatlon. "Did Mr. Harrlman say that there would be any result Injurious to your Interests in case you refused to admit him to share In the ownership?" ' Mr. Cravath I give you the same advice, Mr. Ryan, that you are not required to an swer that question. Mr. Ryan Same answer. At the order of Senator Armstrong the last two question were repeated to Mr. Ryan, who again refused to answer, saying he did so on "advice of counsel." Mr. Hughes then asked the following question: "Did Mr. Harrlman say to you there would be an investigation by a committee of the legislature or that steps would ha taken to have an Investigation by a com mittee of the legislature of either house- of I nv Insurance condition or Insurance com I panics If you did not permit him to sharo In the ownerahlp Mr. Cravath The win advlc. Mr. Ryan H did not say that. "Now, did he say that any action on the part ot the legislature' or any official nr officer of the government Would be taken in the event you refused o accede to hi re quest?" Mr. Cravath 1 advis you not to snawe.' thut question. Mr. Ryan I refuse to answer on the samt grounds. Q. Now, Mr. Ryan, I think you will b entirely free to say what you said to Mi Harrlman? Xo Partner Wanted. Mr. Ryan Well, I told Mr. Harriniau wanted to be free and did not want any partners in the transaction. Q. Did you tell him why? Mr. Ryan My principal reason was that I wanted to make this trout deed In my own way. Q. Did you tell him that? Mr. Ryan I did. Q. What did he say to you? Mr. Cravath I advise that you are nut required to answer, Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan Th same answer, Mr. Chair man. The Chairman Mr. Ryan, the committee (Continued on Fifth Ptfe.)

WASHINGTON. Dec. e.-The president has summarily removed from office United States Marshal T. L. Mathews of the dis trict of Nebraska for alleged misconduct In connection with the case of Richards and, Comstock, who were recently convicted In that state of Illegally fencing the public domain. The sentence of the court wa that the defendants should remain In the custody of the United States marshal for six hours. The president ha information ' that Mathews immediately turned them over to the custody of their counsel. Reporter Break the Sews. The first Information Marshal Mathews had that he had been removed from office was from the newspaper reporters. Ho sold: "I have received no word from Washing ton regarding the matter and the Informa tion that I have been removed Is certainly a surprise to me. Upon what grounds the action was taken I have no Idea. It ls true that about a week ago the attorney general wrote to me asking for a statement of what I did with Prisoners Richards and Com stock after sentence had been pronounced upon them. I made a clear statement of tho case tr. the attorney general. 1 will not give out that letter for publication at this time, and neither will I say what I did re garding the prisoners. I will say that in their case t only followed precedent and, did what has been done upon a hundred oc casions before". In the Senator Burton case. If you remember, after he was sentenced the marshal allowed him to remain with his lawyer from Saturday until Monday. The Information comes to me as such a surprise that I do not want to make any tatement of my side of the case at thin time. After I have thought over the matter I will make a statement and set out my side of the case." -' Judge Munger wss told of the removal of the United States marshal and expressed utter Indifference nver the matter. I have nothing to do with the matter and know nothing of It," he said. "Ther Is nothing for me to ay." And the Judge resumed his reading. Letter from Mathews to Moody. The Washington correspondent Of The Bee furnishes a copy of the letter written by Marshal Mathews In reply to the request of Attorney General Moody of November 28, explaining reasons why he did not per sonally take charge , of Bartlett. Richards and W. G. Comstock. The letter Is dated at Omaha, December I, and reads: In answer to vour letter A 2S. 1906, I have honor to reply. Referring iirui iu newnpuper stories, one paper St ltd that I took Messrs. Richards and Comstock to a hotel, where we. iHneH lumninnnaiv and spent the remainder of the evening s't mc iu.-a.iei. mere was not one word or truth In this statement. The Washington correspondent of the New York Sun stated In his paper that I, In company with defendants, snent six hours In a restaurant and saloons. Thl also wss a straight up and down lie. 1 presume other papers hsd like etorl. equally as false. The -et8 are that after the court had passed e 'ence on Richstds and Comstock 1 appointed R. 8 Hll. who had acted as their attorney and who Is a gentleman of the highest character and standing, to take charge of and kop in his custody the defendants 'for the period stated In the sentence, which he aftifward Informed me he did, and I l-icl.-se herewith the statement made by Hall, affirming that he executed my instructions and the order of the court In good faith. My action in this case waa not unnsutil, but was one that Is imte frequently done by marshals nnd sheriffs, nnd so fir a mv knowledge of the practice tn this dlstrlot goes It was not exceptional or unusual. My understanding was and Is that sen tence In "the custody of the marshal" f jr a few hours was mere formality, and did not contemplate or mean severe treatment, and I do not think the court Intended It other wise. My understanding of th order ws that they were to be restrained of their liberty for six hours, snd that was done, under a reliable man and In a reputable p'ace, known to me, and where I could And them at any minute during that period. My acquaintance with Richards and Com stock ls ono of the most casual character, and I am not now and have not been under any financial, political or social obligations to them, and there existed no reason why I should accord to them any favor or unusual Indulgence that I would not have thought proper to grant to any other person under similar circumstances. It may be that I misapprehended my duty In the matter and In not exercising personsl surveillance, and that I was remiss In offi cial conduct. If so, I beg to assure yoii that It was without thought or Intention of violating the proprieties of the case or act ing other than would be In keeping with ihe order of th court, and I sincerely re be made the occasion or causa of complaint gret that any official action of mine should to you. Respectfully, T. L.
