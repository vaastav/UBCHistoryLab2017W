Bartley'a bondsmen have all been re leased, and the state rests. There la a fair prospect now that Omaha's lonff felt Want of a first-class modern hotel will be filled during the coming year.

General Oyama should remember what followed the triumphal entry of Dewey at New York and sternly repress any movement toward presenting him with a house and lot. The Bee's oft-repeated assertion that the people of Nebraska need to estab lish higher standard la the selection of men for public office Is being re inforced nearly every day. Perhaps the suggestion of Congress mnu Williams thnt the Panama Canal commission be allowed only sufficient money at this time to pay running ex peases to January 15 means that It will take the minority In congress that long to adopt a policy on the subject. American exportation to Argentina in creased about 10,000,000 last year and there la a noticeable decrease Id the revolutionary spirit In that country. There may be do connection between these facts, but other South American republics should try the experiment. Comptroller Ridgley says bank direc tors .should co-operate with the govern ment in the SUerviloii of national banks; but it is probable that each will continue to lay the blame ou the other when trusted employes make hurried exits from the country without stopping to settle uuHquldated balances. State Superintendent McBrlen thinks be and bis appointees should be exempt frera solicitation for . contributions to help "maintain the organisation to which they owe their positions. That Is common falling with aspiring politicians who have landed a public Job, but tbey always want everyone else to help pay the expeuses of each campaign when tbey ar ruinilug on the ticket AS TO DEAL TA RIFF RA T.'S President rtoonevrlt said In his mips- Mire that "It xliouM be considered whether it la Dot desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying, as against or In favor of any other nation, maximum and minimum tariff rates es tablished by the congress, so ns to se cure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves." Senator Lodge has Introduced tin amend ment to the tariff law which provides for maximum and minimum rates of duty, "so as to give preference and ad vantage to the products of those coun tries which do not discriminate against products of the United States." It pro poses the levying of excess duties against countries which do not admit the goods of the United States on equal terms with those granted other coun tries. Undoubtedly the president and the Massachusetts senator had la view the exigency created by the new German tariff, which will go Into effect within a few months and will operate to the detriment of our trade with that coun try. Germany desires a reciprocity agreement with the United States, such In effect as she has made with several other countries, but as there Is little probability of a treaty of this kind, if negotiated, being ratified by the senate. It Is manifestly Important that some other plan be adopted with a view to protecting our commerce against the discrimination luvolvod In the new Ger man tariff. Whether or not the pro posed amendment to the Dingley law would afford such protection It is Im possible to say. It might prevent any other country from following Germany's example, but so fur as that nation Is concerned It Is not in the least likely to now niter or make nny departure from the tariff policy It has fixed upon. The Lodge amendment does uot con template any revision or readjustment of the existing schedules. It simply proposes the levying of higher duties upon the products of any country which may discriminate against the products of the United Stales. It Is therefore probable that It will not meet with any serious opposition from the republicans. The interests having trade with Ger many and which desire reciprocity may not Iks satisfied with . the proiosition, but it Is perhaps the best thing to do If reciprocity lie not possible. Meanwhile the house democratic leader has Intro duced a bill providing for a minimum tariff and declaring the existing sched ules to constitute the maximum, from which a general reduction of 20 per cent Is to be made to all countries which grant admission to their markets of arti cles the product and growth of the United States at the minimum tariff rates provided for them. It can be con fidently predicted that no measure of this kind will get beyond the ways and means committee, but the proposed amendment to the law gives promise that the tariff will not be wholly ignored by the present congress. distribution of immigrants. The National Civic federation Is con sidering the subject of Immigration and will hear the opinions of a number of prominent men on the matter. Mr. Sar gent, commissioner general of Immi gration, In an address before the fed eration, again urged the expediency of provision being made for the better dis tributlon of Immigrants. lie stated that of the 1,200,4S1 who entered the coun try in the year ending last June about two-thirds of them went to six states and of course most of these to the large cities of those states. This Is a matter which congress should give attention to. It Is the con gested condition of the alien population In the big cities that is mainly respon sible for the demand for additional re strictions. While the west and the south have needed the labor which the Immi grants could provide, they have swarmed to the cities, swelling the ranks of common labor where more was not needed, to their own detriment as well as those with whom they competed for work. The proposed remedy for this Is to supply information which will en able Immigrants to go where labor Is in demand, instead of taking chances in the cities, and it Is not doubted that many of them would avail themselves of such Information. The plan seems en tlrely practicable and there Is reason to think would prove most beneficial. THS nORLD'B 

MONET SUPPLY. The financial statistics presented in the annual report of the comptroller of the currency are almost bewildering to the ordinary person but they will be pursued with interest by those who would be informed as to the world's money supply. The compilation of these statistics evidences great care and in dustry and undoubtedly they can bo re garded us in the main trustworthy, and so fur as the United States Is concerned entirely su. The growth of banking in this coun try during the past few years has been rapid, indicating as strongly as any other fact the advance in prosperity. At this time there is no section of the country without ample bank facilities for the requirements of legitimate bust ness, but the organization of new instl tutlons goes on. At the close of the last fiscal year, June 80, the number of na tloual banks was B,0S8, with capital of over $74S,OfK),000 and deposit of nearly $4.,OUO,000,000. The report says that the number of uatloual bunks in active op eratlou has increased since 1!0J by 2: per cent, while banks other than na tional have increased at the rate of about 22 per cent during that period. The stock of money In the United States at the close of the last fiscal year amounted to 2,8S3.100,8H. of which all but $H51.813.822 was in coin. The aver age per capita at time was $31.08, estimating the population at 8.1.20,000. Only France has a larger per capita of circulation, but her population Is less than half of ours. The greatest mass of gold Is held In the United States and Is stated as amounting to $ l,.T4S.2m.O"o. This vast gold supply constitutes not only a basis for our currency system which makes it absolutely safe, but also renders this country secure against any danger from a foreign drain. We could part with a very considerable portion of it without suffering from the loss. The banker and the commercial man will find much that Is interesting and In structive In the comptroller's report. RELgASI OF RAKTLKTS BO.VDS.VK.V The unexpected does not often happen abd nobody familiar with the Bartley bond case will be In the least surprised over the final release of Bartley'a sure ties by decree of the supreme court. There was a precedent in the sham pros ecution of the sureties ou the bond of Burt ley's predecessor, who deposited more than $250,000 in the CHpitol NatiouaJ bank of Lincoln, although expressly prohibited by law from depositing In any bank more than 10 per cent of its capital stock, which in this Instance would have been $50,000, causing a loss to the state of $230,000 and interest. It is an open secret that the Hill bondsmen managed to get tbelr release by the selection of friendly In juns as referees mid Jurors. It will be borne In mind that Bartley had two sets of bondsmen, and there was scarcely .any doubt that he was In default from nt least $100,000 to $200. 000 when his first term expired. The fact thnt Hartley refused to make a showing of state funds In hls custody was in itself sufficient proof that there was something rotten at that time. The release of the first set of bondsmen was simply a prelude to the release of the second set. The most scandalous part of the whole business was the gross neglect of former Attorney General Smyth to take steps toward enjoining Bartley's sureties from transfer of their properties Imme diately after the magnitude of the Bart ley embezzlement had become known, tho transparently sympathetic prosecu tion of the suit by former Attorney Gen eral Prout and bis failure to attach the valuable assets In the possession of Bartley either before or after his release from the penitentiary. There is absolutely no extenuation for allowing Bartley to turn broker and money lender almost under the dome of the capitol In the face of a deficit of more than $XK),000, and to permit hiin without let or hindrance to collect and pocket thousands of dollars upon notes nd I. O. Us. from parties who had bor rowed state money. The denials of Bartley and his beneficiaries that the famous cigar box contained any papers of value are flatly contradicted by the fact that be has been able to carry ou lucrative money-lending business with judgment of $000,000 hanging over bis head. When a truthful history of Nebraska shall be. written some day the chapter on Treasury Embezzler Bartley and the part he and his accomplices and bene' flclarles have played in piling three quarters of a million of debt upon the taxpayers of the commonwealth, and the underhanded means by which they accomplished his release from prison and the release of bis sureties from their obligations, will form one of its most scandalous pages. While commending the publicity given to the financial statement of the repub lican state committee, some of the bene flclarles who have shirked their share of the party burdens complain because the exhibit reflects upon them by com parlson with those who have gladly con tributed in their full proportion. The fact is no one is entitled to commendation for making public this statement, be cause it is nothing more than the law requires and has been the regular prac tice ever since the corrupt practices law went into effect in 1809. That the list of contributors is this year as notable for the names It does not contain as for the names It does contain Is the fault of no one except those who accept lucra tive party offices without reciprocating favors. One great hindrance to suc cess of the republican party In Ne braska in the past has been that it has been loaded down with so many dead heads whose fares have bad to be paid by the common everyday passengers. Oklahomaus who oppose the prohibi tion of the liquor traffic by federal en actment have the merit of standing; up for the right of local self-government in the face of the power of congress to bar them from the union. Such Insistence upon states' rights, however, Is uot usual In territories desiring statehood. but it is nonetheless commendable. .The Nebraska delegation In congress seems to be very much perplexed over the selection of successors to the va cated Valentine land office reglstershlp and receivership, not so much because of scarcity of candidates as the scarcity of men of known integrity and capacity. The average politician has queer Ideas about the perquisites of office. Congressman Pollard has made his debut by introducing a bill appro priating 175,000 for apublic building at Plattsmouth. If his constituents would only agree to keep him as their official representative until this building la eom pleted and occupied we have no doubt Mr. Pollard would feel sure of at least one re-election. It would appear that Oregon business In Washington is uot pressing since Sen ator Fulton, the sole free representative of the state, has time to prepare a bill court In lUtnrt ton la Arlatoerncy.

It may be, Indeed, that his compounda were as good as the originals. or even better, but even such facts would not mitigate the Intrinsic dishonesty of his action. lie was committing a double fraud upon the purchasers, by selling them something which pretended to be what it was not, and upon the proprietors of the original compounds, by using their names and the names of their goods for selling something else.

RAILROAD BUI. DING. Rivalry Anions; the Maarnatea to Grld- ' Iron th West. New York Commercial. A great battlo is impending in the north west. It la to be one of those herculean struggles of financial giants that do not decimate the country In which It takes place, but which make its valleys and hills blossom as the rose; the men are of the kind that build up, never tear down- that make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before. The plans of E. H. Harrlman for a gigantic railroad construction scheme have been outlined. Nearly $100,000,000 are said to be available for this campaign. Thero Ib no limit to the field that will be entered except the natural boundaries of the coun try. The west is supplied with two or three great railroad systems. They cover a constantly developing field only In a limited sense. In the early days of the west one railroad was enough and It was sometimes exceedingly expcnalve to the owners. Thus the. divisions of territory came, the agreements and the separation and redlvlsions. The field Is growing. James J. Hill first sew its possibilities, and with his Great Northern he traversed the transcontinental highway clear to Puget Sound and then pieced out the Intervening apace to China w)th some big ships. This other maater mind In the railroad world E. H. Hariman Is going still farther. He Is going to Interlace the wide weatern territory with branch lines and then with other branch lines until there will be no mile' of its productive richness beyond his reach. It Is an "encroach ment" on the Hill territory, to be sure an intrusion to be met rail for rail and tie for tie; but the country is to be the beneficiary and these millions will be planted in material and equipment. Mr. Harrlman's ablest lieutenaitt, Horace Q. Burt, once head of the Union Pacific rail road, has been abroad studying railroad construction, and' it is believed these mammoth plans will be carried out under his administration. Next year Is likely to be a year of great activity in the west. POWER OP RATE REGULATION. Right of the Government Conceded by Railroad Man. Springfield (Mass.) Republican. Many railroad officials are appearing In print on the great question of government control of rates. Most of them write with an eye single to the special interest in volved. There are those, however, who are able to look at the subject In Its broader1 aapects, and one of them Is Walter Chad wick Noyes, formerly a Judge of the Con necticut court of common pleas and now president of the New London Northern railroad. Judge Noyes does not attempt to conceal from the reader, but to force upon his attention, the fact that the railroad Is of a dual nature It is private property engaged under a gTant of special privileges In per forming public functions or those of a common carrier. This fact of Itself pre sumes and Justifies public control or regula tion as to charges and otherwise. Th railroad, moreover, is essentially a mo nopoly as to most points on Its line, and where competitive it is being reduced to monopoly through combinations and con solidations. This, again, presumes and Justifies public regulation a public regula tion, for example, which shall reduce to practical operation the principles of tha common law, In force from the very outset of railroading, by which shippers can re cover for unjust or unreasonable charges. The present attitude of the railroad In terest in opposing public regulation of rates flies In the face of principles admitted and more or less asserted from the foundations of the Industry. Judge Noyes' handling of the question at this point Is clear, impressive and Indica tive of a mastery of the legal or constitu tional side of the subject. It merits th close attention of the committee of con gress charged with framing a bill to carry out President Roosevelt's policy. Mean time we most earnestly urge upon the gen eral public Judge Noyes- concluding words: "The obligation of the railroads under existing conditions to unite In the move ment for conservative legislation la as clear as Is the necessity for such legisla tion. The railroads should perceive that they are not merely private corporations that their interests are bound up with those of the public. Their officials should recognise th popular feeling that the ship per does not now have a fair opportunity to assert his right to Just charges. Instead of assailing all propositions of rate regula tion, they ahould Join In an effort to ascer tain that which Is moat Judicious. Defeat ing conservative measures merely Incites radical action. That railroad official serves the Interests of his stockholder best In th long tun who never falls to appreciate the rights of the people. A contented publlo along Its line 1 the best asset of a railroad company." for a United States district China 

ROINH ABOIT SEW YOItK. Mlpplea on th Carrent of Life la tha Metropolis. UuildMs or the Hall of Records are ener getlcally striving to reach the altitude of cost attained by tho Philadelphia city hall end the New Tork state capitol. The Hall of Recorde has already cost $8,000,000, and if the whims of architects and contractors are approved with the cash It will achieve distinction as a haul of fame. The building is considerably smaller than the congres sional library In Washington; It covprs about one-sixth the area and contains about two-thirds the room ot the national building, yet Its cost overtops tha con gressional library more than $6,W10. Ths great expense of the Hall of Records, the many delays In Its construction and Its present state of incompleteness have con vinced many citlsens that the prospect of housing all the municipal departments in on or more structures of similar archi tectural grandeur Is far distant. Th New Vork judgo who remarked "seven months In Jail" to the man who refilled special water bottles with Crotou fluid snd sold It ss the genuine stuff, places himself as a bulwark between the people and one of the meanest forms of fraud. There are many business cheats who would risk a fine who will take no chances of a prison sentence. Ths whiskey sellers are also 'complaining of frauds of the same nature. Their bot tles, warranted to contain the pure juice of the grain, right from Kentucky, are emp tied and refilled with a decoction of wood alcohol and dye stuff, and sold as the original brand. One of these whiskey makers declares that while there are. In New York City 7.000 places where liquor is sold, not over 5,000 are guiltless of this form of graft. Detectives- have been at work for some time, nightly filling their skins with drinks of the spurious stuff, and their pockets with buttles of the same, and proceedings are to be commenced soon that will be followed. It Is promised, with startling revelations. "The people," said one of the whiskey makers, "are told much about pure food. It Is Just as Important that they should be guaranteed pure drinks." Speaking of his reasons for planning to build another hotel for the housing of the respectable man whoso resources have been reduced to a few pennies, or, at most, to a few Hollars, D. O. Mills Is quoted as saying: "My other two hotels have been a suc cess; hundreds of men are turned away from them nightly, and there Is evidently room on Manhattan Island for another house of the kind." The two hotels Mr. Mills has already built are conducted so well and so cheaply mat tney are paying investments, though a good clean room In them may be had for 20 cents a night and a good dinner be served for 15 cents. Mr. Mills called attention to the fact that' George Francis Train lived happily for several years In the Mills hotel No. 1. He often said that the happiest days of his life were spent there in his little room. It cost him about 45 cents a day at the hotel. As far as could be learned, he had an income of something like $26 a month, and out of that he saved $10 a month, so that at his death he had several hundred dollars laid by. There are many other men like Train at the Mills hotels. One would be sur prised to know how many men who we're formerly well to do, some of them for merly wealthy, are living at these hotels. Men are there who have been on Wall street and ' who once occupied Important places : In 'business. They live there be cause they can be in a respectable atmos phere at a small cost. Within a few days work will be begun on Mills hotel No. 3, which Is to be erected at Seventh avenue and Thirty-sixth street. About 100 years ago a man sold an acre of ground In the financial district for a pair of spavined mules. He had use for the mules, but tho land was a burden, because it called for the payment of taxes. Today the same plot of ground ia valued at $4 a square inch, according to the latest sale. Some or the heirs of the man who sold the plot for tho mules are living In New Tork fiats and paying rent. They have a picture of their farseelng forefather on the walls and are proud ot him, although they are broke. The Btock transfer tax I proving an ex cellent source of Income for the New York state treasury. During November the re ceipts were more than $000,000. This Is the record month for receipts from this new tax. Controller Kelaey plans for a more thorough administration of the stock transfer tax which was provided for at the last session ot the legislature. Up to the present time no machinery had been provided for supervision to see that the state stamps were used on all shares of stock held. Inspections are to be made by a number of examiners who sre familiar with brokerage business and understand tha provisions of the new law. At the recent election In New York'Tam many thugs tried everywhere to drive Jerome watchers away from the polls. The latter were nearly all young, Intelligent fellows and somo of them were brutally beaten for refusing to depart. At one polling place the watcher, little more than a boy, was ordered from his post, but re fused to move. The Tammany leader growled: "None o' yer lip or III push yer faco In." The young fellow turned pale, but he answered quickly: "Of course you can do me up If you like; I can t protect myself. But you may have noticed mo writing. I have put down, among other things, the names of every officer, watcher. Judge, Inspector and clerk here today and 1 have mailed those papers to a frler.d." He kept his post. The proprietor of one of the leading New York restaurants wants all bin waiters to wear mutton chop whiskers. This Is in th European fashion and Is esteemed the only correct thing in high-class foreign estab lishments. There is one merit about the style that should be appreciated. It will happen very rarely that a guest In evening clothes will be mistaken for a waiter. Pure Air a a Tonic. Cleveland Leader. Fresh air being a foe t disease. It Is naturally a preventive.

TROUBLE BEG AX. Inanranc Brought to Light Energetic Reporters. Success Magazine. y There would have been no investigation of the insurance companies had It not been for the recent disclosures made by David Ferguson, a reporter for the New York World, who began by prodding the officers of the Equitable about James Hazen Hyde's Cambon dinner and other evidences of ruinous waste. At the outset Ferguson was laughed at by the men he approached. Hyde and Alexander, the two heads of the Equitable, denied everything denied that there was any factional uprising in the Equitable or the slightest unfriendliness be tween Mr. Hyde and Mr. Alexander. But the reporter kept on prodding and digging patiently until he gained the confidence of some one on the inside whose name will probably never be known. From that time on Ferguson had the situation In his own hands, and what followed is thoroughly known to the American public today, hav ing resulted in the greatest upheaval ever known In the history of American finance. Compelled by the persistent revelations Ferguson was making to undertake an In vestigation, Francis Hendricks, superin tendent of Insurance for the state of New York, filed away a lengthy document con taining the testimony he had taken, and It remained for Louis Selbold, another World reporter, to procure a copy of this secret report, which made th longest "Story" ever "run" In a newspaper about single incident-112,000 words. It Is still a matter ot keenest speculation among the newspaper men of New York how Selbold obtained possession of a copy oX a state document, and It will be, probably, a mys tery forever. Reporters of Selbold type never betray confidence. Were the secrets of Messrs. Ferguson and Selbold known concerning tho great Insurance exposure, they would undoubtedly make gdod read ing, but these men made pledges of confi dence for the public good, and it goes with out saying that those pledges will die with them.
