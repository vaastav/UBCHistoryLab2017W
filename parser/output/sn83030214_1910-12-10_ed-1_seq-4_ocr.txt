i DICKINSON WANTS AEROPLANES FOR ARMY Flying Machines for Military Purposes Strongly Indorsed by Secretary of War NEEDS OF COAST DEFENCES Asks $19,546,843 for Panama Canal Fortifications-Author ity to Establish a Volun teer Army Sought. Washinrton, rvr. S.— Secretary Dickinson In Ms annual report strongly indorses the aeroplane, and recommends an appropria tion to provide for the signal corps a rea sonable number of the hotter type of ma chine for instruction and held work. He *ays: Aerial navigation is attracting world wide attention. Marked progress has been mads in this art daring the past year. Its . passible Influence upon the art of war hi . much discussed arnontr military authorities ' ths world over. Recently in Berlin and Paris opportunity was afforded me to wit ness aviation tests that were being made j • eta by the military, and I was impressed : with the interest and activity displayed in ; the development of this new art with spe- ; cial reference to its possibilities for use in : rril?:sirv service.. > - - • era any and Franca continue to lead in the development of air craft for military purposes. German}' has specialized in the I development of the dirigible balloon, while France has paid more attention to the de- ', volopment of the aeroplane. Information I from abroad indicates that at the present rimr-. Germany jxis^esses fourteen military j -lfrfsiblu airships and a number of aero planes, fiance seven military tliri^rlMe air ships and thirty aeroplanes. * The United State?, which was the first \ nation officially to recognize the aeroplane for military purposes, and which conducted ' itt Tort Myer. in IMS. the first public I flight of . - heavier than air machine, lias ! since that date made 1:0 addition to its I aeronaut equipment, which at present eanalst^ of ana small practice dirigible bal loon, one \\ right aeroplane, and three small ' r*ptiv« balloons; nor to its trained person 1 ri. the signal corps at present having but ; •ti« liemci.ant an.ii nine enlisted men on otsty '.ii connection with aeronautics. I There is hut one ofiieer who is a licensed j pilot for free Walloons. • \ ]• is contended by some that dirigible j balloons and aiivhips will at best prove to i v^ of doubtful utility in warfare, Others j hold that the United States would better | postpone expenditure* until the art has i i-TKch«»d a more Hdvnnced state. The fact | remains that a"l European first class ' powers are devoting a great deal of atten tion to tlie subject of military aeronautics. and are displaying marked activity in the development and supply of J^oth the dirig 'blo and th«» aeroplane for war purposes. T>-hi7e the l."nite<l States is practically at a ! standstill in this matter. In my judgment, the time baa come when it would be wise tn make appropriations adequate for pro ' i;3inß the signal corps with a reasonable number of «he better tyjx- of machines for instruction purposes and Dor fie!d work. Defence and Canal Fortifications. The Secretary calls attention to the fact that Or entrance to Chesapeake Bay. one <■? the most Important stratetricsl points on the Atlantic coast, is wholly unfortified. | not a tingle gun beir.g mounted to defend the channel between Cape Charles and Cape Henry. At the eastern entrance to Long Jslajnd Sound guns are needed. Ex cept for these instances, so far as guns alose are concerned, the sea coast defences j *£ all home ports are in a satisfactory I •tat*, lent much remains to be done in pro- ■ riding such auxiliaries as searchlights and ; i in developing the fire control system, which j ' will require about p^ejayfat. « mjßt is asked to authorize an expen diture of 519.545.543 for fortifications for the fvinama C. ntil. including the construction eit posts for the permanent garrison, and $7,000,000 of this sum should be made avail •■vhle immediately in order to complete the project within three years.

THE WASHING TOJV [From T'-.<- Tribune nurfa-.i.] Washington, December 9. ALDRICH MISUNDERSTOOD. "~ The assertion of th-» Secretary of the Treasury that, in his opinion, the expenses of the government cannot be materially reduced below the limit of the estimates -übmitted by him, which are some JCtf.O/O.OQO below the total appropriations for the current fiscal year, has served to recall Senator Manieira statement, made on the floor of the Senate last February, that if he were a business man and were permitted to d > it he would undertake to run the govern ment for J300.000.000 less than it is heine run for now. Much of the comment on that statmont shows an entire misunder standing of the Senator's meaning. The methods which would be adopted by a business man were he to undertake to con duct i this government as he would a private business are so radically different from anything which Is feasible In the administration of the affairs of a great nation that too much importance should not he attached to the Senator"? chance statement. To begin with, if Mr. Aldrich were to undertake to conduct the govern ment as he would a private business, he would begin by cutting off the entire pen sion budget, which would mean a saving, according to the estimates for the forth coming year, of JloS.6?8.000. Then he would eliminate all political considerations in the employment of men and women, which would obviously and admittedly greatly in crease the efficiency of the working force. No man or woman would be retained who did not perform his or her foil share of work, and that share would be >>rreatlv Increased by lengthening the hours'. It is highly probable, moreover, that Mr. Aid rich would promptly rescind the laws and regulations regarding n eight-hour day, which greatly increases the cost of government work, a notable Instance be ing furnished just now by the necess^ty which confronts the Secretary of the Navy of asking Congress for an addi tional $1,500,000 to complete the battleship New. York, and an additional $400,003 to complete the battleship Florida, Of course, theye tilings are entirely impracticable, but they are what Mr. >'drich had in mind, and it is necessary to understand that in order to form a correct estimate of hi? statement. That he ever for a mo ment had any Idea that these things could be done is not true, but he was merely suggesting what, under extraordinary cir cumstances, could be done in order to In duce the Senate to grant his proposition to create a committee to do all that might prove practicable. DOING MUCH FOR LABOR.— As Presi- ! dent Taft says in his message, the govern ment has for forty-two years been doing all In its power to promote the general adoption of the eight-hour day. and he is in sympathy with the movement. The course of the government in this respect. > However, entails such expense that labor i should appreciate the sacrifice which the government, and through it every citizen, is making to promote Its Interests. As has been said. Secretary Meyer, acting on the carefully prepared estimates of his subordi- j nates, is obliged to ask Congress to author ize an additional expenditure on the battle s-hip New York of 51. 500.000. and an addi- I tional expenditure of $400,000 for The battle- ; sUp Florida, being: built in the Brooklyn i navy yard, which is exclusive of the cost j of armor and armament. Tn the case of the | Florida the exact cost a ton of normal displacement will be &.rc 24, jib compared with ,<l?0 for the Utah, the same type of ship as the Florida, hut built under con tract. The Utah will cost $3.9tf,000, as against $0,4C<>,000 for the Florida. Secretary Meyer Informs the naval committee that the enforcement of the eight-hour law in connection with the construction of the bat tleships authorized at the la?t session of Congress will increase their cost by not less than. 2114 per cent. Considerable diffi culty: Is being experienced in placing the contracts for the new ships because of the insistence of the department that the eight- Lour law shall be enforced in connection with their construction. ECONOMIC DIFFICULT! ES.-Tt Is not rasy to appreciate the difficulties which? confront a simple-minded and hard-work-? ing President who undertakes to achieve anything approaching economy in the ad ministration of the affairs of the govern ment- Reference is made elsewhere in The Tribune to the Intense Indignation of mem bers of the House because Secretary Mac- Yeach. actuated by due consideration for the rendition of the Treasury and the Pres ident's earnest desire for economy, omitted from the annual ostimp.t^s pome $26,000,000 for public buildings. Then the National Rivers and Harbors Congress adjourned to

XEW-YOBK DAILY TRIBUNE. SATTRDAY. DECESIBER I*. 1»1 ft - day nfter adopting resolutions which, among other things, urge the annual ap propriation of not less than $30,000,000 for the improvement of rivers and harbors, such sum to be paid out of the ordinary revenues when possible and to be raised by bonds, if not otherwise available. The fact is that the national treasury has been flush for so long a time that it never seems to occur to any one who has a hobby that the expenditures therefor should be curtailed merely on the ground of economy. Mr. Taft has been making every effort to achieve a material saving in the expenditures of the government, has insisted that all his Cabi net officers pare their estimates to the bone, and has effected much in this direction, but should he pursue a consistent course -with regard to expenditures for river and har bor improvement and suggest that an an nual appropriation of $50,000,000 was more than could properly be used for that pur pose, he. would inevitably Incur the criti cism of the several hundred enthusiasts •who closed their annual congress in Wash ington to-day. CONGRESS EXPEDITIOUS.-The pass age of the Indian appropriation bill by the House to-day clearly indicates the energy with which the House is working on the annual supply bill?. This extensive and intricate measure was debated just three days, as against forty days devoted to this bill a year ago. thirteen days two years ago eighty days the year before that and forty-two days the year before. So encour aged are the House leader* that they are now predicting the passage of the legisla tive. executive and j^rlal, the District of Columbia, the river and harbor, and pos sibly the pensions bill before the hollday .eroCc. eroC c Work on all of these ts proceeding rapidly in committee, and every effort will be made to put them through. Whether or not the leaders will strike a snag winch will delay them beyond their expectations cannot vet be foreseen, but that they are making every possible effort to clear the decks for some general legislation is odi ous. THE T\RTFF COMMISSION.— The Ways and Means Committee expects to begin hearings on the subject of a permanent tariff commission, as recommended by the Presi dent and as provided for in the .Wll of Representative Good, next week. The first witness to be heard will be John C Cobb of Boston, president of the permanent tar commission, who will reach Washington on Tuesday. There Is no disguising the fact that, despite the President's forceful rec ommendation of such a commission, legis lation of this character will have a hard road to hoe in the Ways and Means Com mittee as now constituted. Even the Dem ocrats are opposed to such a commission a* th* president advocates. They would be willing to vote for the creation of a legislative eommittee-that is, one com posed of members of the 'two houses of Congress-which would, of course, be noth ing more than a substitute for the two legislative tariff committees of Congress, and would present few if any advantages over them; but a commission along the lines laid down by the President, a commis sion free from political entanglements and actuated solely by a desire to ascertain and present the facts. Representatives Champ Clark and 'Oscar Underwood and a large following among their party colleagues heartily oppose. Of course, Chairman Payne, is opposed to such a and so are most of his Republican col leagues, if they may be judged by their past utterances, although attempting to give an imitation of £ purely judicial frame of mind now that the President has taken his stand and is assured of the support of many of the insurgents. 

NEVER TOO OLD TO LEARN.-That a man is never too old to learn was solemnly asserted by Speaker Cannon to-day, and Mr. Cannon admits that he is not precisely a spring chicken. Mr. Cannon went over to the .Senate this afternoon, and as he was returning glanced up and noticed a red light over the main door of the House chamber. "What is that for?" Inquired (he Speaker. "That is to indicate that the House la in session, Mr. Speaker," replied an attendant. "How long has it been the custom to indicate that the House was in session in that way?" asked Mr. Cannon. No one seemed to know, but all were agreed that the red light bad burned throughout the sessions of the House for many years, and the information led the Speaker to remark that a man la never too old 10 1-arn, and that perhaps if he re gained around the Capitol for another decade. or two he would l become familiar with all the customs and practices which attend a session of that body. G. G. H. TAFT'S MESSAGE PLEASES President Receives Flood of Congratulations . I From The Tribune Bureau.! Washington, Dec. President Taft's annual "message is a remarkably popular state paper, if thousands of letters and telegrams as well as resolutions adopted by various organizations throughout the United States may be accepted as a de pendable indication. The White House mails for the last three days have been tilled with letters of congratulation and resolutions adopted by organizations inter ested in specific recommendations. The following resolutions were adopted at the sixteenth annual meeting of the National Municipal League, held in Buffalo, and signed by C. J. Bonaparte, president: H. K. Doming, chairman of the executive com mittee; A. Lawrence Lowell, vice-president, and Clinton Rogers Woodruff, secretary: Resolved, That the National Municipal League desires to express its approval of th" inauguration of the comprehensive in quiry now in progress into the business methods of the national government with a view to securing more efficient and eco nomical administration of national affairs. Real progress in improving government conditions must largely come through .such painstaking Inquiries and the formulation of dutlnite concrete measures of reform. The league stands pledged to use its efforts to stimulate similar work in its field of municipal government and expresses the hope that among the earliest fruits of this inquiry will be the. passing of an appro priation act for the city of Washington that will embody the functional arrange ment of the budget aiKl the. standard functional classification of expenditures so essential to government accounting. Among the numerous letters of commen dation received l»y the President is the fol lowing from the memorial committee of the Grand Army of the Republic in New York: In the name and on behalf of the Civil War veterans residents of New York City; numbering many thousands who yet sur vive, I thank you meet sincerely for that part of your message referring to them and th<sr, pensions and which to-day draws you ckMe to their hearts. «

RANDOLPH A SUICIDE Former Artillery Chief Suffered from Despondency. Washington, Dec. ?.— Surrendering:, it Is believed, to a fit of despondency caused by protracted illness, Major General Wallace F. Randolph (retired), veteran of the Civil and Spanish wars and former cHief of ar tillery, shot and killed himself- 'to-day in the bathroom of his home here. The re volver bullet penetrated the 'brain and death was instantaneous. - , ' ' . General Randolph was a native or Penn sylvania, and by his conspicuous service with the volunteers from that state in the Civil War won his first commission in the regular army. . He leaves a wife and two daughters. Mrs. Randolph discovered the body, having been attracted, to the bath room by the sound of the shot. . General Randolph was sixty-nine years old. Since his. return to Washington a month ago from a visit to Pennsylvania, his continued de pression had alarmed his many friends, and this, it is believed, led to his suicide. General Randolph -was the first chief of the coast artillery corps and one of the most popular officers In the service. He was mainly instrumental in the develop ment of the present system of field artillery, and for several years had charge of the artillery post xt Fort Riley. Kansas. In the Spanish-American War he commanded the field artillery with General ShaHcr's army in Cuba.
