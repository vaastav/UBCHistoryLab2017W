To the Congress of the United States: Your "assembling is clouded by a sense of public bereavement caused by the reoent and sud­ den death of Thomas A. Hendricks, vice president of the United States. His dis­ tinguished public services, his complete Integrity and devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues, will Had honorable record in his country's history. Ample and repeated proofs of the esteem and confidence in which he was held by his fellow countrymen were manifested by his electiou to the offices of the most important trust and highest dignity, god at length, full of years and honors, he has been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and benediction. The constitution, which requires that those chosen to legislate for the people shall annu­ ally meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also requires the president to give to congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration Kueh measures ns he shall deem necessary and expedieut. At tho tiros hold of a compliance with the constitutional directions, it is well fur us to bear in mind that our usefulness to the peoplo's interests will be promoted by a consiant appreciation of tho scope and the character .of our duties as they relate to fed­ eral legislation. While the executive may recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient, the responsibility of legislative •ction must and 6hould rest on thoso selected by these laws. The contemplation of THK 

GRAVE AND RESPONSIBLE FUNCTIONS assigned to the exeoutive branches of the government under the constitution wiil dis­ close tho partitions of power between our respective departments and their necessary independence, and aiso the need for tbe exer­ cise of all the power intrusted to each in that spirit of comity and co-operation wbich is es­ sential to the proper fulfillment of the patri­ otic obligations which rest upon us as faith­ ful servants of tho people. The jealous watchfulness of our constituents, great and binall. supplements their suffrages, and be l«ire the tr inal established every public servant should be judged. OUH FOREIGN RELATIONS. Flie Government 011 Amicable Terms With All Powers. It Is gratifying to announce that the rela­ tions of the United States with ail foreign powers coutinue to be friendly. Our posi :ion, after nearly a century of successful lonstitutional government and the mainte­ nance of (jood faith iu all our engagements, the avoidance of complications with other uations, and a consistent and amicaule atti­ tude toward the strong and weak alike, fur oish proof of a political disposition wbich renders profession of good will unnecessary. There are 110 questions of difficulty pending with any foreign government. THE AKUENTINE GOVERNMENT has revived the loug-dormant question of the Falklaud islands by claiming from the United States indemnity for them. The loss is at­ tributed to the commander ol' the sloop-of war Lexington in breaking up a practical col­ ony on those islands in 1431 and tiieir subse­ quent occupation by Great Britain. In view of the ample justification for the act of the Lexington and the derelict condition of the islands before and after tiieir alleged occupa­ tion by Argentine colonists, tiiia government considers the claim as wholly groundless. A question has arisen with the government of Austria-Hungary touching the representa­ tion of the United States at Vienna. Having under my constitutional prerogative ap­ pointed our estimable citizen of unitnpeached probity and competence as minister at that court, the government of Austria Hungary invited this government to the cognizance of certain exceptions based upon allegations against the personal acceptability of Mr. Keiiey, the appointed en­ voy, asking that, in view thereof, the ap­ pointment should be withdrawn. Tne reasons advanced were such as eouid not be acqui­ esced in without violation of my oath of office nnd the precepts of the constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation in favor of a foreign government upon tho right of selection tne executive, aud re­ quired such an application of a religious test as a qualification for office under the United States as would have resulted in the practical disfranchisement of a large class of our citi­ zens and tbe abandonment of a vital principle of our government. Tne Austria-Hungarian government iinaily decided not to receive Mr. Jieiley as the envoy of the United States, and that gentleman has since resigned his com­ mission, LEAVING THE POST VACANT. I have made no new nominations, and the luterests ot this government at Vienua are now in the care of the secretary of legation, acting as charge d'affaires ad Interim. Early in March last war broke out In Cen­ tral America, caused by the attempt of Gua^ temala to consolidate the several states into a single government. In tbis contest between our neighboring states, the United States iorebore to interfere actively, but sent the aid of their friendly offices In deprecating war and to promote peace and concord amoug the belligerents, aud by such a council con­ tributed impartially to tbe restoration of tranquility in that locality. Emergencies growing out of the civil war in the United States of Columbia demandod of tbe government at the beginning of this administration the employment of an armed force to fulfill its guarantee under the thirty fifth article of tbe treaty of 1840, in order to keep the transit open across the Isthmus of Panama. Desirous of exercising only the powers expressly reserved to us by the treaty and mindful of the rights of Columbia, tne forces sent to the isthmus were instructed to ooufine their actions to "POSIT1VELV AND ESTICACIOUSLT" preventing the transit and Its accessories from being "interrupted or embarrassed." The execution of tbis delicate and responsl Dle task necessarily involved police control where the local authority was temporarily powerless, but always in aid of the sover­ eignty of Columbia. The prompt and suc­ cessful fulfillment of its duty by this govern­ ment was highly appreciated by the govern­ ment of Columbia, and has been followed by expression of its satisfaction. High praise is due to tbe officers and men engaged in this serviee, the restoration of peace on the Isth­ mus by tbe re-establisliri:eit of the consti­ tuted government there being thus accom­ plished. The forces of the United States were withdrawn. Pending these occurrences a question of much importance was presented by decrees of the Columbian government pro­ claiming the closure of certain ports aud then in the hands of the Insurgents, and In declar­ ing vessels held by the revolutionists to be pi­ ratical and liable to capture by any power. To neither of these propositions could the United Stutes assent. An effective closure of tbe ports, not in the possession of the gov­ ernment, but held by I10ST1I.E PARTISANS, could not be recognized neither could the vessels of tho insurgents against the legiti­ mate sovereignty lie deemed hostis huma nl generis, within the^trecepts of International law,whatever might be tho definition and pen­ alty of their acts under the municipal law of the state against whose authority they were in revolt. Tbe denial by this government of the Columbian propositions d.d not, how­ ever, imply the admission of a belligerent status on the part of tbe insurgents. Dhe Columbian government has expressed its willingness to negotiate conventions for the adjustment by arbitration of claims by arelgn oitizena arising oat of ha destruc­ tion of the city of Asplnwall by tho iusur reotionary forces. The NIcinvaH Canal. The interest of the (Jolted States in a prac­ ticable transit for ships aoross the strip of land separating tbe Atlantic from the Pacific has been repeatedly manifested during the last half century. My Immediate pieJeces sor caused to be negotiated with Nlcaraogan, a treaty for the construction by and at the sole expense of the United States, ot a canal through the Nicaraugan territory, and laid before the senate. Pending the action of that body thereon. 1 withdrew the treaty for re-examination. Attentive consideration of Its provisions leads me to withhold It from re­ submission to the senate. Maintaining as I do the tenets of a line of presidents from Washington's day, which proscribe entan­ gling alliances with foreign states. I do not favor a policy of acquisition of a new distant territory or the incorporation of remote interests. Our own laws of progress are vital and or­ ganic, and we must be conscious of that irre­ sistible tide of commercial expansion which, as the concomitant of our own activo civiliza­ tion, day by day is being urged onward by thoso increasing facilites of production,trans­ portation and communication to which steam and electricity have given birth. But our duty in the present instructs us to address' ourselves mainly to the development of tha vast resources of the great area committed to our charge, and the cultivation of the arts of peace within our borders, though jealously alert in preventing the Amer­ ican hemisphere from being Involved in the political problems and complications of distant governments thereon. I am unable to recommend propositions involving para­ mount privileges of ownership or right out­ side of our own territory, when coupled with absolute and uulimited engagements to de­ fend the territorial integrity of tbe state where such interests lie. While the general prospect of 

CONNECTING TJTB TWO OCEANS by means of a canal is to be encouraged, am of opinion that any aoheme to that end, to be considered with favor, should be free from the features alluded to. The Tehuauteuec route is declared by engineers of the highest reputo, anl by competent scientific men, to afford an entirely practicable transit for vessels and cargoes by means of a ship railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The obvious advantages of such a route, if feasi­ ble, over others more remote from the axial lines of tralfio between Burope and the Pa­ cific. and particularly between the valley of the Missouri and tbe western coast of North and South America, are deserving of consid­ eration. Whatever highway may be con­ structed acros9 the barrier dividing the two greatest maritime oceans of the world must be for the world's benefit, a trust for man­ kind to be removed from the chance of domi­ nation by any single power, nor become a point of invitation for hostilities or a prize for warlike ambition. An engagement com­ bining the construction, ownership and oper­ ation of such work by the government with an offensive and defensive alliance for its protection with the foreign state whose responsibilities and rights we would have. i9. in my judgment, inconsistent with such dedi­ cation to universal and neutral use. aud would, moreover, entail measures for its re­ alization. Beyond this scope our national policy or present means do not extend. THE 

LAPSE OF VEARS has abundantly confirmed the wisdom and foresight of these earlier administrations, which, long before tb conditions of maritime intercourse were changed and enlarged by the progress of the age, proclaimed tho vital need of interoceanic traffic aoross the Ameri­ can isthmus and consecrated in advance to tli© common use of mankind by their positive declarations and through the formal obliga­ tion of treaties. Toward such realization, tbe elforts of my administration will be ap­ plied. ever bearing in mind the principles on which it must rest and whioh were declared In no uncertain tones by Mr. Cass, who, while secretary of stato in 1856. announced that "What tho United Stat9s wants in Central America next to the happi­ ness of tbe people, is the security and neu­ trality of interoceanio routes whioh lead through it." The construction of three transcontinental linos of railway, all in successful operation, wholly within our territory and uniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, has been accom panied by results of a most interesting and impressive nature and has created new con­ ditions not only in the routes of commerce, but on political geograp.v, which powei fully affects our relations toward and necessarily increases our interests in any transisthmian route which may be opened and employed for the ends of peace and traffic, or in other contingencies, for uses inimical to both. Transportation is a faction in thecost of com­ modities scarcely second to that of their pro­ duction and weighs as heavily upon the con­ sumer. Our existence has already proven the great importance of having the compe­ tition between land carriers and water car­ riers fully developed, each acting as protec­ tion to tbe publio against the tendencies of monopoly which Is ineerent in the consolida­ tion of wealth and power in tbe hands of vast corporations. These suggestions may serve to emphasize what I have alread said on the score of necessity of neutralization of any interoceanic transit, and this can only be ac coraplisbed by making the use of the route open to all nations and subject to the ambi­ tions and war-like necessities of none. Tne drawings and report of a recent survey of the Nlcarauga canal route made by Chief Engineer Monacal will be communicated for your information. The claims of citizens of the United States for losses bv the means of the late military operations of Chili in Peru and Bolivia are the subject of negotiation for a claim convention with Chill, providing for their submission to arbitration. The Cblaese Question. The harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained in the application of tbe acts lateh passed to execute the treaty of 1*80. restrictive of the immigration of Chinese lab­ orers into the United States. Individual cases of hardship have occurred beyond tho power of the executive to rem­ edy, and calling for judicial determination. The conditio 1 of the Chinese question in the Western states aud territories is, tie-spite this restrictive legislation, far from being satis­ factory. Tne recent outbreak in Wyoming Territory, where numbers of unoffendi ng Chinamen, iudlsputably within the protection of tbe treaties and the law, were murdered tiy a mob, and tbe more recent threatened out­ break of the same character in Washington Territory are fresh in the minds of all. and there Is apprehension lest the b.tterness of feeling against the .Mougoliau raee on the Pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstrations. All the power of this government should be exerted to maintain tbe amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men, and the inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrong-doers to justice should be insisted upon. Every effort has been made by this government to prevent these violent outbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation of these out­ rages, and it is but just to say that they are traceable to tbe lawlessness of men, NOT CITIZENS of the United states, engaged in competition witb Chinese laborers. Race prejudice is the chief factor in originating these disturb­ ances, and is. in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our domestic peace and tbe good relationship we strive to maintain witb China. The admitted right of a government to pre­ vent the Influx of elements hostile to its internal peace and security may not be ques­ tioned, even where there is no treaty stipula­ tion on the subject. That the exclusion of Cblnese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail Is etrougly evinced in the Dominion of Can­ ada, where Chinese immigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If existing laws are inadequate to compass tbe end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures, within the treaty limits, wbich the wisdom of congress may devise. THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF CONGO. The independent state of the Congo has been organized as a government, under tbe sovereignty of his majesty, the king of Bel­ gium. wao assumes its chief magistracy, in his personal character only, without making the new state a dependency on Belgium. It is fortunate that a benighted region, owing all it has of quickening civilization to tbe beneflcience and philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the advantage and security of its be­ nevolent supervision. Tne action taken by this government last year, in beinz tbe first to recognize the flag of the International as­ sociation of the Congo, has been followed by formal recognition of the new nationality, which succecds to its sovereign powers. A conference of delegates of the principal com­ mercial nations was held at Berlin last winter to discuss methods where jy the Congo basin might be kept open to tbe world's trades. Delegates attened on behalf of tbe United States, on the understanding that their oart should be merely deliberative, without im­ parting to the results any binding character so'far as tbe United States was concerned. This reserve was due to the indisposition of the government to share in any disposal by an international congress of jurisdictional questions in remote foreign territories. The results of the conference were embodied in a formal act of tbe nature of an international convention, which laid claim to certain obli­ gations purporting to be binding on tbe sig­ natories subject to ratification within one year. Notwithstanding tbe reservation un­ der which tbe delegates of the United States attended, their signatories were attached to the general act In the same manner as those of the plenipotentiaries of other governments, thus making the United States appear without reserve or qualification as signatory to a joint International engagement imposing on the signers the conservation of the territorial in­ tegrity of distant regions where we have no established intereiu or control. Tbis govern* ment does not, however, regard tbe reserva liberty of action in tue premises as at ail impaired, and holding that an engagement to snare in the obligation of enforced ueutral lty in tbe remote valley of the Congo would be an alliance whose responsibility we are not in a position to assume, I abstain from asking the sanction of tbe senate to that general act. correspondence wiil be laid before you and the Instructive and interesting report of tne agent sent by this government to the Congo country, and his recommendations for the establishment of commercial agencies on the African coast are also submitted for your consideration. I The commission appointed by my pre-' decesscr last winter to visit the Central and South American conntries aud report on tue methods of enlarging the commercial relations of the United States tberewith has submitted reports which will be laid before you. N° opportunity has been omitted to testify the friendliness of this government toward Corea. whose entrance into the family of treaty powers the United States was the first to roco^nize. After elaborate correspondence, repeated and earnest representations on our part Mr. Suntous was. after an alleged trial and con­ viction, eventually included in a general de­ cree of amuesty and pardoned by tbe Ecudor ian executive and released, leaving the ques­ tion of his American citizenship denied by the Ecuadorian government, but insisted upon by our own. FRENCH CLAIMS. The amount adjudged by the late French and American claims commission to be due from the United States to French claimants on account of Injuries suffered by them dur­ ing the war of secessiou having been appro­ priated by the last congress, has been duly paid the French government. The act of Feb. 25, I8a5, provided for a preliminary search of the records of the French prize oourt for evidence bearing on the claims of American citizens against France for spolia­ tions committed prior to 1801. The duty has been performed, and tbe report of the agent will be laid before you. The interpretation of our existing treaties of naturalization by Germany during the past year has attracted attention by reason of an apparent tendency on the part of the imperial government to extend the scope of tbe residential restrictions to whioh return­ ing naturalized citizens of German origin are asserted to be liable under tbe laws of the empire. The temperate and Just attitude taken by tbis government witb regard to this class of questions will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding. The dispute of Germany and Spain relating to the denomina­ tion of THE CAROLINE ISLANDS has attracted the attention of the govern­ ment by reason of extensive Interests or Amerieau citizens having grown up in tbtsc parts during the past thirty years, and be­ cause the question of ownership involves jurisdiction of matters affecting the status of our citizens under civil and oriminal law. Whilst standing wholly aloof from the pro­ prietary issues raised between the powers, to otb of which the United States is friendly, this government expects that nothing in the present contention shall unfavorably affect our citizens carrying on a peaceful commerce or there domiciled, and has so informed the governments of Spain aud Ger­ many. Marked good will prevailed between tbe United States and Great Britain during the past year. The termination of the fishing ciausos of the troaty of Washington, in pursuance of the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, must have resulted In tha abrupt cjssit ofoi the 1st of July of this year, in the midst of their ven­ tures, of the operations of citizeus of the United States engaged in 

FISHINQ IN BRITISH-AMERICAN WATERS but for the diplomatic understanding reached with her majesty's government in June last, whereby assurance was obtaibed that no in­ terruption of those operations should taae place during the current fishing season. In the interest of goo 1 neighborhood, of the com­ mercial Intercourse of adjacent communities, the question of North American fisheries is one of much importance. Following out the iutimation given by me when the extensory arrangement above described was negotiated. I recommend that congress provide for the appointment of a commission, in which the governments of the Uuited states and Great Britain shall be respectively repre­ sented. charged with the consideration and settlement upon a just, equitable and honor­ able basis of tbe entire question of the fish­ ing rights of tbe two governments and their respective citizens off tbe coasts of the United States and British North America THE FISHING INTERESTS being Intimately related to other general 'luestions dependant upon contiguity and In­ tercourse, consideration thereof in all their equities might also properly come within the view of such commission, and tbe fullest lat­ itude of expression on both sines should be permitted. The correspondence in relation to the fishing rights will be submitted. The inadequacy of the exciting engagements for extradition between the United States and Great Britain has been long apparent. The tenth article of the treaty of 1842, one o: the earliest compacts in tbis regard entered into by the United States, stipulated for sur­ render in respect of a limited number of of­ fenses. Other crimes no less inimical to tbe social welfare should be embraced and tbe procedure of extradition brought In har­ mony with the pie ent international prac tices. Negotiations with her majesty's gov­ ernment for an enlarged troaty of extradition have been pending since 187, and I entertain strong hopes that a satisfactory result may be soon attained. The Arctic exploring steamer Alert, which was generously given by her majesty's gov­ ernment to aid in the relief of the Greely ex­ pedition. was.aftcr tho successful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to Great Britain, in pursuance of the authority con­ ferred by tbe act of March 3, 1885. The fron­ tier line between ALASKA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA, as defined by the treaty of cession with Rus­ sia, follows the demarkation assigned In a prior treaty between Great Britain and Rus­ sia. Modern expliraiion discloses that this ancient boundary is impracticable as a ge­ ographical factor in the unsettled condition of tho vegion. The question has lacked importance, but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the line is supposed to traverse admonishes that the time has come when an accurate knowledge of the boundary is needful to avert jurisdictional complica­ tions. I recommend, therefore, that provision bo made for a preliminary recou noissance officers of the United States to the end of ac­ quiring more precise information on the sub­ ject. I have Invited her majesty's govern­ ment to consider with us the adoption of a more convenient line to be established by tnerid'a'i observ tions or by known geo­ graphic features without the necessity of an evpensive survey of the whole. The late INSUttRE* TION MOVEMENTS IN HAVTI having been quelled, tbe government of that republic has made prompt provision for adju­ dicating the losses suffered by foreigners be­ cause of hostilities there, and the claims of certain citizens of the United States will be in this manner determined. A question arose with Hayti during the past year, by reason of the exceptional treatment of an American citizen, Mr. Van Bokkelen. a resident of Port au Prince, who on suit by creditors residing in the Uni­ ted States was sentenced to Imprisonment, and under the option of a Haytian statute was denied relief secured to a nativo Haytian. This government asserted its treaty right to equal iroatinent with the natives of Hayti in all suits at law. Our contention was denied by the Haytian government which, however, while still professing to maintain the ground against Mr. Van Bokkelen's right terminated the controversy bv setting bim at liberty without explanation. An international conference, to consider tbe means of arresting tbe spread of cholera and other epidemic diseases, was held at Rome in May last and adjourned to meet again on further notice. An expert delegate on behalf of the United States has attended the session and will submit a report. OUR 

RELATIONS WITH MEXICO continue to be most cordial, as befits those of neighliors, between whom the strongest tie9 of friendship and commercial intimacy exist, as the nature and growing consequences of our institutions and geographical propengulty. The relocation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, eastward of the Rio Grande, under the convention of July 29, 1882. has beon unavoidably delayed, but I apprehend no difficulty in securing a pro­ longation of the period for its accomplish­ ment. The lately concluded commercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the stipulated legislation to carry its provisions into effect, for which one year's additional time has been secured by a supplementary article signed in February lastand since rectified on both sides. As this convention, so important to tne commercial welfare of tho two adjoiniug countries,has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty making grounds to express the hope that legislation needed to make it effec­ tive may not long be delayed. The large In­ flux of capital and enterprise to Mexico from the United State9 continues to aid in the de­ velopment of the resources, and in augment­ ing the material well-being of our sister re­ publics. Lines of railway penetrating to the heart and capital of the country bring the two people into mutual beneficial intercourse, and enlarged facilities of transit add to profit­ able commerce, create new markets and fur­ nish avenues to otherwise Isolated communi­ ties. I have already adverted to tbe suggested construction of a sbip roadway across the narrow formation of tbe territory of Mexico and Tebuantepec, witb the gradual recovery of Peru, from the effects of her late disas­ trous conflict witb Ohili, and witb the restora­ tion of civil authority in that distracted couhtry. It is hoped that pending war claims of our citizens will be udj usted. In conform­ ity with notification given by the government of Peru, the existing treaties of commerce and extradition between the United States and that country will terminate March 81. 1886. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. Our good relationship with Russia contiues. The officer of the navy detailed for the pur­ pose is now on his way to Siberia bearing the testimonials voted by congress to those who generously succored the survivors of tbe un­ fortunate Jeannette expedition. It is grati­ fying to revert to the cordiality our inter­ course with Spain. The loug pending claim of the owners of tho ship Unmasonic for loss suffered through the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities on the Phil lipine islands has been adjusted by arbitration and an indemnity award. The principle of arbitration in ouch cases, to whic:i the United States has long and con­ stantly adhered, thus receives a fresh and gratifying confirmation. Other questions witb Spain have been disposed of or are un­ der diplomatic consideration witb a view to just aud honorable settlement. The opera­ tion of the commercial agreement with Spain of Jan. 2 and Feb. 13, ls84, has been found inadequate to the commercial needs of tbe United States, aud the Spanish Antilles and tiie terms of tho agreement are subjected to conflicting interpretations in those islands. An international copyright conference was held at Berne in Sopteiuuer on the invitation of the Swiss government. The envoy of tho United States attended as a delegate, but re fraiued from committing this government to the results, even by signing the recommeud ator. protocol adopted. The interesting and important subject of international copyright has neon befoie you tor several years. Ac­ tion is certainly desirable to elect the object In view, and while there may be a question as to the relative advantage of treating it by legislation or by specific treaty, the matured views off ie Berue conference cannot fail to aid your consideration of the subject. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. The termination of the commercial treaty of 18152 between the Uuited States and Turkev has been sought by that government. While there is a question as to the sufficiency of the notice of termination given, yet, as the commercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under the favored national guarantees of the prior treaty of 1830, aud as an equal treatment is admitted by the porte, no inconvcnience can result from tbe assent of this government to the revision of the Ottoman tariff, in which treaty the powers have been Invited to Join. Questions concerning our citizens in Turkey may be affected by the porte's non-acquies­ cence in the right of expatriation and by the imposition of religious tests as a condition of residence, in which this government cannot concur. The United States must bold, In their intercourse with every power, that the status of their citizeus is to be respected and equal civil privileges accorded to thetn with­ out regard to creed, and affected by no con­ siderations save those growing out of domi­ ciliary return to the land of original allegi­ ance, or of unfulfilled personal obligations, which tnay survive under municipal laws after such voluntary return. VENEZUELIAN AWARDS. The negotiation with Venezuela relative to the rehearing of the awards of the mixed com­ mission constituted under the treaty of 181)6 was resumed in view of the recent acquies­ cence ol tho Venezuelan envoy in tbe princi­ pal point advauced by this government, that the effects of tbe old treaty would only be set aside by tbe operation of a new convention. A result In substantial accord with the advis­ ory suggestions contained in the Joint resolu­ tion of March 3, 1883, has been agreed upon and will shortly be submitted to the senate for ratification. Under Section 3659 of the revised statutes all funds held intrust by the Uuited States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not otherwise required by treaty of the United States, bearing a rate of interest not less than 5 per cent, per annum, there being now no procurable stocks payipg, so b.gh a rate of interest, the letter of the statute.is at present inapplicable, but its spirit is sub­ served by continuing to make investments of the nature iu current Btooks bearing the highest interest now paid. The statute, however, makes no provision for such accretions, it being contrary to the general rule of this government to allow in­ terest on claims. 1 recommend the repeal of the provision in question and the disposition, under uniform rule, of the present accumu­ lations from investment of the trust fund. 

NATURALIZATION. The Inadequacy of existing legislation touching citizenship and naturalization de mauds your consideration. While recogniz­ ing the right of expatriation, no statutory provision exists providing means for re­ nouncing citizenship by an American, natural or naturalized, nor for terminating or vacat­ ing an improper acquisition of citizenship. Even a fraudulent decree of natural­ ization cannot now be cancelled. The privilege and franchise of American citizenship should be granted witb care and exteuded to those who Intend in good faith to assume its duties and responsibilities when attaining its privileges and benefits. Itshould be withheld from those who merely go through the forms of naturalization with the intent of escaping the duties of their original alle­ giance, without taking upon themselves those of their new status, or who may acquire the rights of American citizenship for no other than a hostile purpose towards their original governments. These evils have had many flagrant illustrations. Negotiations have been Instituted at Madrid for a fjpll treaty not open to these objections, and in the line of the general policy touching tho neighborly intercourse of proximate com­ munities, to which I elsewhere advert, and aiming moreover at the removal of existing burdens and annoying restrictions, and, al­ though a satisfactory term nation is prom­ ised, 1 am compelled to delay a definite an­ nouncement. 1 regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors, that pro­ vision may be made for a central bureau of record of the decrees of naturalization granted ty the various courts throughout the Uuited States, now invested with that power. The rights which spring from domicile in the United States, especially when coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are worthy or definition by statuto. The stranger coming here with intent to remain, establishing his residence in our midst, con­ tributing to the general welfare, aud by his voluntary act declaring his purpose to as­ sume the responsibilities of citizenship thereby gains inchoate status, which legisla­ tion may properly define. Tho laws of cer­ tain states and territories admit a domiciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree which places him in the anatna lous position of being a citizen of a state, and yet not of the United States, within the pur­ view of federal and international law. it is important within the scope of national legis­ lation to define this right of alien domicile as distinguished from federal naturalization. TUB COM MERCIAL RELATIONS of the United States with its Immediate neighbors, and with important areas of traffic near our shores, suggest especially liberal in­ tercourse between them nnd us. following the treaty of 1883 witb Mexico, which rested on tho basis of a reciprocal exemp­ tion from customs duties. Other similar treaties were initiated br my predecessor. Recognizing the need of less obstructed traffic with Cuba and Porto Rico, and not by the desire of Spain to succor languishing interests in the Antilles, steps were taken to attain these ends by a treaty of commerce. A similar treaty was afterward signed by tbe Dominican republic. Subse­ quently overtures were made by her Britanio majesty's government for a like mutual ex­ tension of commercial intercourse with the British West India and South American de­ pendencies, but without result. On taking office I withdrew for re-examination the treaties signed with Spain and Santo Domingo, then pending before the senate. The result has been to satisfy me of the Inexpediency of entering into engagements of this character not covering the entire tariff. These treaties contemplated the sur­ render, by the United States, of large rev­ enues for inadequate considerations. Upon sugar alone duties were surrendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered In exchange. Even were it Intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident that, so long as tbe exemption but partially cov­ ered our importation, such relief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essen­ tial seemed highly improvident at a time when new and large drains upon the treasury were contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen under the favored nation clauses of treaties with other nations. As further objection it is evident that tariff regulation by treaty diminished that inde­ pendent control over its own revenues which is essential for the safety and welfare of any government. The emergency calling for an increase of taxation may at any time arise, and no engagement with a foreign power should exist to hamper the action of the gov­ ernment. By the lith section of tbe shipping act, approved Juue 26. 1884, certain reduc­ tions and contingent exemptions from ton­ nage dues were mado, aa to vessels entering ports of the United States from any foreign port In North and Central Ainerioa, the West India islands, the Bahamas and Bermudas, Mexico and the isthmus as far as Aspinwall and Panama. The governments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Swedeu and Norway have asserted under the favored na­ tion olause in other treaties witb tbe United States, a claim to like treatment in reBpect to vessels coming to the United States from their home ports. This government, bow ever. holds that the privileges granted by the act are purely geographical, enuring te any vessel of any foreign power that may choose to •NOAGB IS TRAFFIC between this country and any part within the defined zone, and no warrant exists under the most-favorei-nation clause for the extension of the privileges in question to vessels sailing to tbis country from ports outside the limita­ tion of tha act. Undoubtedly the relations of commerce with our near neighbors whose ter­ ritories form so large a frontier line, difficult to beruarded, and who find in our country, and equally offer to us, national markets, de tpand special and considerate treatment. It rests with congress to consider what action may increase facilities of intercourse which contingency makes natural and desirable. I earnestly urge tbat congress reeast the ap­ propriations for the maintenance of the diplomatic and consular service on a footing commensurate with the Importance of our national interests at every post where a representative is necessary. The salary should be so graded as to permit to live with comfort. With tho assignment of adequate salaries, tbe so-called national extra official fees which our officers abroad are now per­ mitted to treat as PERSONAL PERQUISITES should be doue away witb. Every act re­ quiring the certification and seal of the offi­ cers should be taxable by a set schedule of rates, and the fee therefor returned to the treasury. By restoring these revenues to the public use, the consular service would be self-supporting, even with a liberal increase of tbe present low salaries in further preven­ tion of abuses. A system of consular in­ spection should be instituted. The appoint­ ment of a limited number of secretaries of legation at large to be as­ signed to dutv whenever necessary and in particular for fempoiary service at mis­ sions, which for any cause tnay be without a head, should also be authorized. I favor also authorization for tho detail of officers of the regular service as military or naval attaches at legations. Some foreign governments do not recognize the union of consular with di­ plomatic function. Italy and Venezuela will only reoelve the appointee in one of his two capacities, but tbis does not prevent the re­ quirement of a bond and submission to the responsibilities of our offioar, whose duties he cannot discharge. Tho separated titles of consular general should be abandoned. I deem it expedient that a well-devised measure for the reorganization of the extra 

TERRITORIAL COURTS In Oriental countries should replace the present system which labors under the dis­ advantage of combining judicial and execu­ tive functions in the same office. In several Oriental countries generous offers have been made of premises for housing the legations of the United States. A grant of land for that purpose was made some years since by Japan, and has been referred to in the annua messages of predecessors. The Siam gov I eminent bos made a gift to tbe United States of commodious quarters in Bangkok. In Corea the late minister was permitted to purchase a building from tbe government for legation use. In China the premises rented for the legation are favored as to local charges. At Tangier the bouse occupied by our representative has been for many years the property of this government, having been given for that pur-4 pose in 1822 by the sultan of Morocco. I ap­ prove the suggestion heretofore mado that in view of the conditions of life and administra­ tion In tbe Eastern countries the legation buildings in China, Japan, Corea, Siam aud perhaps Persia, should be owned and furnished by the government with a view to permanency and security. To this end, I recommend that authority be given to accept the gifts adverted to in Japan and Siam. and to purchase in the other coun­ tries named, with provision for furniture and repairs. A considerable saving in rentals would result. TnE 

WORLD'S INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITION held at New Orleans last winter, with the as­ sistance of the federal government, attracted a large number of foreign exhibits and proved of great value in spreading among the con­ course of visitors from Mexico and Central and South America a wider knowledge of the various manufactures and productions of this country, and their availability in exchange for the productions of those regions. Past congresses have had under consider atioa the advisability of abolishing tbe dis­ crimination made by the tariff laws in favor of tbe works of American artists. The odium of the policy which subjects to a high rale of duty the paintings of foreign artists, and exempts tbe production of American artists residing abroad and who receive gratu­ itously advantage and instruction is invested upon our citizens engaged in art culture in Europe and have caused them witb unanim­ ity to favor the abolition of such an ungra­ cious distintion and in their Interest, and, for other obvious reasons I strongly recommend it. THE FINANCES. A Surplus of Nearly 925,000,000 for the Fiscal fear. Tbe report of the secretary of the treasury fully exhibits the condition of the publio finances and of the several branches of gov erument connected with his department. The suggestions of the secretary relating to prao tical operations of this important department and bis recommendations in tbe direction of simplification and eoonomy. particularly of the work of collecting custom duties, are es­ pecially urged upon the attention of con­ gress. The ordinary receipts fram all sources for the fiscal year ended June 3D, 1885, were $322.690,706.38. Of this sum $181,471,939.34 was received from customs and $112, 498,725.64 from internal revenue. Tbe total receipts as given above were $24,829,163.54 less than those for the year end­ ing June 30, 1884. This diminution embraces a falling off of $13,595,550.42 in the receipts from customs, and $n,687.346.97 in the re­ ceipts from internal revenue. The total or­ dinary expenditures of tue goveanment for the fiscal year were $260,226,935. leaving a surplus in the treasury at the close of the year of $63,463,771.27. Tbis is $40,929,854.32 less than THE SURPLUS REPORTED at the close of the previous year. The ex pend.tures aro classified as follows: For civil expenses, S2.i.82D,942.11 lor foreign inter­ course. $5,431),«U9.11 for Indians, $6,552, 494.63 for pensions, $56,102,267.49 for the military, including river and harbor Improve­ ments anu arseuals, $4,.670,578.47 for tbe navy, including vessels, machinery and im­ provements of navy yards, $16,021,079.69 for the interest in the public departments. $51,386,256.47 for tbe District of Columbia, $3,499,650.95 for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, lighthouses and collecting the revenue, $54,738,054.31. The amount paid on the public debt during tbe fiscal year ended June 30, 1885, was $45.993, 235.43, and there has been paid siuoe that day and up to Nov. 1, 1885, the sum af $369, 828, leaving the amount of the debt at tbe last named date $1,514,475,800.47. There was, however, at tiiat time in tbe treasury appli­ cable to the general purposes of the govern­ ment, tbe sum of $66,818,292.38. THE TOTAL RECEIPTS for the current fiscal year, ending June 30. 1886, ascertained to Oct. 1, 1885, and esti­ mated for the remainder of the year, are $315,000,000 the expenditures ascertained and estimated for the same is $245,000,000. leaving a surplus at the close of the year estimated at $90,000,000. The value of im­ ports from the United States to foreign coun­ tries during the last fiscal year wa9 as follows: Domestic merchandise, $726, 682,946 foreign merchandise, $15,506,809 gold, $8,477,892 silver. $33,753,633 total, $784,421,280. 8ome of the principal exports, with their values and the percentage they respect.vely bear to the total exporter tiou, are given as follows: Per- Ar tides.

The fact that our revenues are In excess of the actual needs of the government justifies a reduction In the amount EXACTED FROM THE PEOPLE for its support. Our government Is but the means established by the will of a free peo­ ple, by which certain principles are applied, which they have adopted for their benefit and protection, and it is never better administered and its true spirit never better observed than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditure, and distributed according to a Just and equitable plaa. Tha proposition witb whioh we have to dea is the reduction of tbe revenue received by the government and indireotly paid by tbe people from oustom duties. The question of free trade Is not Involved, nor Is there now any occasion for tbe general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system. Justice and fairness dictate that any modifi­ cation of our present laws relating to revenue, the industries and Interests which have been encouraged by such laws, and in wbieh our citizens have large Investments, should not be ruthlessly Injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subjeet in sueh manner as to protect the interests of Ameri­ can labor,whicb Is the capital of our working men. Its stability and proper remuneration furnish tbe most justifiable pretext for a pro­ tective policy within these limitations. A certain reduction Ahould be oiiade on our cus­ toms revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, tbe Inquiry follows where can It best be remitted and what arti­ cles can best be released from duty in the in­ terest of our citizens. I think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon tbe Imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of living in every family of the land, and release to the people in every humble home a larger meas­ ure of tbe rewards of frugal industry. Natlenal Banks. During the year ended Nov. 1, 1885, 145 national banks were organized witb an aggre­ gate capital of $16,938,000, and circulating notes have been issued to them amounting to $4,274,910. The whole number of these banks in existence on tbe day above mentioned was 2.727. The very Ihnitel amount of circula­ ting notes issued by our national banks com­ pared with the amount the law permits them to issue upon a deposit of bonds for their redemption Indicates that the volume of out* circulation medium may be largely increased through bis instrumentality. Nothing more important thau the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since February, 1878, the government has, under tbe compulsory provisious of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more tban 2.000,00 of dollars every month. By this proooss up to the present date 215, 759,431 silver dollars have been coined. A reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the general government would limit its exercise without express restrictive words to tho people's needs aud tbe requirements of the publio welfare. Upon this theory the authority to "coin money," as given to congress by the constitution, if It permits the purchase oy the government of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an oxtent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium. The desire to utilize the silver pro­ duct of the country should not lead to a mis­ use or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to THE 

SILVER CURRENCY of tbe nation as Is compelled by the silver coinage act, is negatived by the fact that up to the present time only about $40,000,000 of silver so coined have actually found their way into circulation, leaving more than $165,000,000 In possession of the government, the custody of which has entailed a considerable expense for construction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certifi­ cates amounting to about $93,000,000. Every month $2,000,000 of gold in the public treas­ ury are paid out for $2,000,000 or more of sli­ ver, to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enough this operation will result in the substitution of silver for all the gold the government owns applicable to its general purposes. It will not do to rely upon tbe customs receipts of tbe government to make good this drain of gold, becauso the silver coined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private, at times during tbe last Six months 58 per cent, of tbe re­ ceipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates, while tbe aver­ age witbin tbat period has been 20 per cent. The portion of silver and its certificates re­ ceived by the government will probably in­ crease as time got on, for tbe reason that tbe nearer tbe period approaches when it will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obligations, tbe greater Inducement there will be to board gold against depreciation on the sum of silver, and for THE 

PURPOSE or SPECULATING. This hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time comes tbat gold has been withdrawn from circulation, then it will be apparent that there is a difference between the real value of the silver dollars and a dol­ lar in gold, and the two coins will part com­ pany. Gold is still the standard of value, and is neoessary in our dealings witb other countries. It will be at a premium over silver. The banks which have substi­ tuted gold for tbe deposits of tbair cus­ tomers may pay them witb silver bought witb such gold, thus netting a handsome profit. Riob speculators will sell their boarded gold to their neighbors who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at ruinous premiums over silver, and tbe laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will flud that the dollar received for tbe wages of their toil has sadly shrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said tbat tbe latter result will be but temporary and that ultimately tbe price of labor will be adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place tbe wage worker can­ not possibly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price he is compelled to pay ror his living will not only be measured in a coin heavily depreciated and fluctuating and un­ certain in its value, but tbis uncertainty in tbe value of the purchasing medium will be made tbe pretext for an advance in prices be­ yond tbat justified by actual depreciation. The words uttered in 1834 by DANIEL WEBSTER in the senate of the United States are true to-day. "The very man of all others who bas tbe deepest interest in a sound currency and who suffers most ty mischievous legisla­ tion in money matters is tbe man wbo earns his daily bread by bis daily toil." Tbe most distinguished advocate of bi-inetalism, dis­ cussing our silver coinage, has lately written: "No American citizen bad as yet felt tbe sensation of cheapness, either on receiving or expendiug the silver act dollars." And those wbo live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheap­ ness. However plenty silver dollars may be­ come they will uot be distributed as gifts among tbe people, and if the laboring man 6hould receive four depredated dollars where be now receives but two be will pay in tbe depreciated coin more than double tbe price be now pays for all the necessaries and com­ forts of life. Those who do not fear any dis­ astrous consequences arising from the con­ tinued compulsory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and wbo suppose tbat the ad­ dition to tbe currency of tbe country, in­ tended as a result, will be a public benefit are reminded tbat bistory demonstrates tbat tbe poiut is easily reached in tbe attempt to float at the same time two sorts of money of dif­ ferent excellence when the better will cease to be in circulation. THE HOARDING OT GOLD, whioh has already taken place, indicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases. So if tbis silver coinage be con­ tinued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon tbe field of circulation to silver alone. Tbis, of course, must produce a severe contraction ot our circulating medium Instead of adding to it. It will be disputed that any attempt on the part of tbe government to cause the circula­ tion of silver dollars worth 80 cents side by side witb gold dollars worth 100 cents, even with the limit that legislation does not run counter of laws of trade, to be successful must be seconded by the confidence of the people that both oolns may re­ tain their same purchasing power and be interchangeable at will. A special effort has been made by the secre­ tary to increase the amount of our silver coin In circulation, but the fact that a large share of tbe limited amount thus put out bas soon returned to the publio treasury In pay­ ment of duties, leads to the belief tbat tbe people do not now desire to keep it in hand, and this with the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspicion that there already exits a lack of confidence among tbe people touching ou financial practices. There Is certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness,and the whole amount coined and now on hand might after a time be absorbed by the people withont ap­ prehension, but It Is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land which causes fear and uncertainty. What has been thus far submitted upon this subjeet relates al­ most entirely to considerations of a borne na­ ture unconnected witb tbe bearing which tbe policies of otber nations have upon the ques­ tion, but it is perfectly apparent tbat a time of action IN REGARD TO OUR CURRENCY cannot wisely be settled upon, or persisted in, without considering tbe attitude of the subject of other countries with whom we maintain Intercourse through commercial trade and travel. An acknowledgement of this fact is found iu the act by virtue of which our silver is coinpulsorily coined. It provides tbat "Tbe president sball invite the governments of tbe countries comprising the Latin union so called, and such other emperor's nations as be may deem advisable,to join the United States in a conference to adopt a common ratio be­ tween gpld and silver for tbe purpose of es­ tablishing internationally the use of di metallic money and securing fixity of the relative value between those metals. Tbis conference absolutely failed, and a sim­ ilar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direction, and still wa oontinue OUR 

COIN AGS or SILVER at a ratio different from tbat of any other nation. The most vital part of the silver coinage act remains Inoperative and unex­ ecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle upon the silver field In an tUogiea) and losing contest. To give full affect to tha de­ sign of congress on this subjeet I have made careful and earnest endeavor since tbe ad­ journment of the last congress. To this end I delegated a gentleman well Instructed In fiscal science to proceed to the finanoial oen* ters of Europe and In conjunction with our ministers to England, France and Oernuuty to obtain a full knowledge of tbe attltudo and intent of these governments In respect to the establishment of such an International ratio as would procure free coinage of both metals at tbe mints of those countries and our own. By my direction our consul general at Paris has given close attention to the pro­ ceedings of the congress of the Latin Union In order to Indicate our Interest In Ita object, and report its aetlon. It may be said in brief, as the result of these efforts, that the attitude of tbe leading powers remains substantially unchanged since the monetary conference of 1881, nor is to be questioned that the views of these governments are for instance sup­ ported by the weight of publio opinion. The views thus taken have, there­ fore, only more fully demonstrated the use leseness of further attempts at present to arrive at any argument on the subject witb other nations. In the meantime WE ARB 

ACCUMULATING SILVER COIR, based upon our own peculiar ratio, to Such an extent and assuming so heavy a burden to be provided for In any international negotia­ tions. as will render us an undesirable party to any future monetary conference ot na­ tions. It is a significant fact that four of the live countries composing tbe Latin union men­ tioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their silver currency, have just completed an agreement among themselves tbat no more silver sball be coined by their respective gov­ ernments, and that such as has been already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of Its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may well arrest the attention of those who supposed that we can suoceed without shook or injury in the attempt to circulate upon its merits all the silver we may coin under the provisions of our silver coinage act. The condition In whioh our treasury may be placed by a persistence in our present course is A 

MATTER OF CONCERN to every patrlotlo citizen who does not desire his government to pay In silver such of its obligations as should be paid In gold. Nor should our condition be such as to oblige us, in a prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue the calling in and payment of ln terest-bearing obligations wbiob we have the right now to discharge and thus avoid the payment of further interest thereon. Tbe so-called debtor class. for whose benefit the continued compulsory coinage of silver is insisted upon,are not dis­ honest. because they are in debt and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeop­ ardize the financial safety of the country In order that they may canoel their present debts by paying tbe same in depreciated dol­ lars, nor should it be forgotten tbat It Is not the rich nor the money-lender alone that must submit to such readjustment, forced by the government and their debtors. Tho pittance of THE 

WIDOW AND THE ORPHAN and the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be disastrously reduced. The depositors in savings banks and in other institutions wbich held in trust tbe savings of tbe poor, when their little accumulations are scaled down to meet the new order of things, would in th ir distress painfully real­ ize tbe delusion of the promise made to them, tbat plentiful money would improve their condition. We have now on hand all the sil­ ver dollars neoessary to supply the present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see them in circula­ tion, and if their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them, If the need of more is at any time ap­ parent their coinage may be renewed. That disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation of tbe present silver coinage. We have been saved by THE
