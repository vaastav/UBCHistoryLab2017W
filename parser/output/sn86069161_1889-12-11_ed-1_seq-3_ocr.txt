to Congress The Leading Points of tho Lengthy Document Civil Sorvleo and the Southern Onostlon Ilectilvo tho Slost Attention Fenslons TarlC Coast Dofoasos Silver Coinage and Our Slerchnnt Marino Considered Othor SHhJets Touched Upon The following is the presidents mes sage sent to Uie senate and house of rep resentatives on Tuesday Dec 8 To tek Senate ajtd House of Rbfrb bektatives There are few transactions in the administration of the government that ore evn temporarily held in the oonfidenoe of tbose charged with the conduct of the pnblic busuieag Kvery step taken is under the observation of an intelligent and watch ful people The state of the union is known from day to day and suggestions as to needed legislation to find an earlier voice than that which speaks in these annual com munications of the president to congress He then referred to the good will existing between the United States and other na tions and considered it highly significant that the first year of the second century finds within our borders as honored guests the representatives of all the independent states of North and South America The recommendations of this interna tional conference of enlightened statesmen will have the attention of congress and its co operation in the removal of unnecessary harriers to beneficial intercourse between tin nations of America but while the com mercial rewrite which it is hoped will follow this conference are worthy of pursuit and of the great interest they hare excited it is be lieved that the crowning benefit will be found in the better securities which may be devised for the maintenance of peace among all American nations and settlement of au contentions by methods that a Christian civ ilization can approve He referred to tho maritime congress now in session in Washington which was called touching the revision and amendment of the rules and regulations governing vessels and to adopt a uniform system of marine signals Delegates from twenty six nations arepresent It is an interesting and unprecedented fact that the two international conferences have brought herj the accredited represent atives of thirty three nations Attention is called to the fact that all tha nations of the western -hemisphere with one exception s end to Washington envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary being the highest grade accredited to this government The United States on the contrary sends envoys of lower grades to some of our sister republics and I recommend the completion of the reform begun by the last congress in elevating the rank of our diplomatic agents in those countries I alsotrecommend that timely provision be made for extending to Hawaii au invitation to be represented in the international con ference now sitting at this capital After referring to the failure of the last treaty restricting Chinese labor immigration he says hile our supreme interests demand the exclusion of a laboring element which expe rience has hbown to be incompatible with our social life all steps to compass this im perative need should be accompanied with a recognition of those strangers now lawfully among us to humane and just treatment Concerning the Nicaragua canal he said A friendly arrangement has been effected between Cota Rica and the government This government has held itself ready to promote in every proper way the adjust ment of all questions that might present ob stacles to the competition of a work of such transcendent importance to the commerce of this country and indeed to the commercial interests of the world In regard to the Samoan question he re referred to the late conference held in Berlin and trusts that the senate will approve of the efforts which have been made to affect un adjustment He says in reference to the fishery troubles that Canada has of late been endeavoring to administer laws that will cause as little trouble as possible He says the boundary line between the United States and Canada in the narrow channels connecting the great lakes and alone the northwestern boundary should he visibly marked He then referred to our relations with France Belgium Persia Turkey and other smaller nations Questions continue to arise iu our rela tions with several countries in respect to the rights of naturalized citizens Especially is this the case with France Italy Russia and Turkey and to a less extent with Switz erland From time to time earnest efforts have been made to regulate this subject by conventions with those countries An im proper use of naturalization should not be permitted but it is most important that those who have been duly naturalized should everywhere be accorded recognition of the rights pertaining to the citizenship of the country of their apoption The appropri ateness of special conventions for that pur pose is recognized in treaties which this gov ernment lias concluded with a number of European states and it is advisable that the difficulties which now arise In our relations with other countries on the same subject should be similarly adjusted Continuing the message says The recent revolution in Brazil in favor of the establishment of a republican form of government is an event of great interest to the United States Uur minister at Rio de Janeiro was at once instructed to maintain friendly diplomatic relations with the pro visional government and the Brazilian rep resensatives at this capital were instructed by the provisional government to continue their functions Our friendly intercourse with Brazil has therefore suffered no inter ruption Our minister has been further instructed to extend on the part of this government a formal and cordial recognition of the new republic so soon as the majority of the peo ple of Brazil shall have signified their assent to its establishment and maintenance Within our own Borders a general con dition of prosperity prevails The harvests of the hut summer were exceptionally abundant and the trade conditions now pre vailing seem to promise a successful season to the merchant and the manufacturer and general employment to our working people The report of the secretary of the treasury for the fiscal year ending June 30 1880 has been prepared and will be presented to con gress It presents with clearness the fiscal operation of government and I avail myself of it to obtain some facts for use here The aggregate receipts from all sources for the year were 887050058SJ derived as follows From customs 23883274L0S from internal revenue 130881513 02 from miscellaneous sources 33S35S0aSi The ordinary expenditures for the same period were 331 90661500 and the total expenditures including tho sinking fund were a57B93925 The excess of receipts over expenditures was after providing for the sinking fund OT4701295ft For the current fiscal year the total rev enues actual and estimated are 8S5000000 and the ordinary expenditures actual and estimated ore 293000000 making with the sinking fund a total expenditure of tMMSlUu99 leaving on estimated surplus of 54307888301 Daring the fiscal year there was applied to the purchase of bonds in addition to those for the sinking fund 0045017285 and dur ing the first quarter of the current year the sum of 87838937 00 all of which were cred ited to the sinking fund The revenues for the fiscal year endinz Juno SO 1861 are esti mated by the treasury department at fS35 030000 and the expenditures for the sanio period including the sinking fund at 541 40047770 This shows an estimated surplus for that year of 4356953230 which is more likely to be increased than reduced when tha actual transactions are written up The existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should nave the immedi ate attention of congress with a view to re ducing the receipts of the treasury to the needs of the government as closely as may be The collection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary bur den upon our people and the presence of so large a surplus in the public vaults is a turning element in the conduct of private business It hue called Into use expedients for put ting it into circulation of very questionable propriety We should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our bonds beyond the requiremeBte of the sinking fund but any unappropriated surplus in the treasury should be so used as toere U no other lawful way of returning the money to circulation and the profit realized by the government offers a substantial advantage The loaning of public funds to the banks without interest upon the security of gov ernment bonds I regard as on unauthorized and dangerous expedient It results m a temporary and unnatural inciease of the banking capital of favored localities anl om j s a caution- an grad ual recall of th dtsit s tc aoid injury to pocted that the banks hiving those deposita will sell their bonds to the treasury so long as the present highly beneficial arrangement is continued They now practically get in terest both upon the bonds and their pro cealt No farther uss should be nude of this method of getting Uie surplus into cir culation and the deposits now outstanding should he gradually withdrawn and applied to the purchase of bonds It is fortunate that such a use can 1 made of the existing Bnrjiius and for some time to come of any carnal surplus that may exist after congress has taken the necessary step for a reduction of the revenue Such legislation should be promptly bat very considerately enacted I recommend a revision of our tariff law both in itsaihninistrativefeaturesand in the schedules The need of the former is gen erally conceded and an agreement upon the evils and inconvemences to lie remedied and the best methods for their correction will probably not be difthilt Uniformity of val uation at all our ports is essential and ef fective metsur should be taken to secure it It U equally dasirablo that questions af fecting rates and classifications should be promptly decided The preparation of a new schedule of cus toms duties is a matter of groat delicacy be cause of its effect upon the business of the country of groat difficulty by reason of the wi1e divergence of opinion as to the objects that may be promoted by such legislation Some disturbance of business may perhaps result from consideration of the subject bv congress but this te nporary ill effect will be reduced to minimum by prompt action and assurance which the country en jo vs that any necessary changes will bo so made as not to impair the just and reasonable protection of our home industries The inequalities of the law should be ad justed but the protective principle should be maintained and fairly applied to the pro ducts of our farms as well as our shops These duties necessarily have relation to other things besides tho public revenues We cannot limit their effects by fixing our eyes on the public treasury alone They have a direct relation to home production to work to wases and to the commercial independ ence of our country and the wise and pa triotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include all of thesa The nec essary reduction iu our public revenue can I am sure be made -without making toe smaller burden more onerous than the larger by reason of the disabilities and limitations which the process of reduction puts upon both capital and labor The free lit can very safely be extended by placing thereon articles that do not offer injurious competition to such domestic pro ducts as our home labor can supply The removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from a burden which was imposed only because our revenue from customs du ties was insufficient for the public needs If safe provision against fraud can be devised the revoval of the tax upon spirits used in the arts and iu manufactures would also offer an unobjectionable method of re ducing the surplus A table presented by the secretary of the treasury showing the amount of money of all kinds in circulation each year from 1878 to the pros time is of interest It ap pears that the amount of National bank notes in circulation has decreased during that period 114109729 of which 87793 23J is chargeable to the last year Tho withdrawal of bank circulation will necessarily continue unler existing condi tions It is probable the adoption of the suggestions made by the comptroller of the currency viz That the minimum deposit of lionds for the establishment of banks be reduced and that an issue of notes to the par value of the bonds be allowed would help to maintain the bank circulation From March 1 1878 to Oct 1 1880 the net increase in the total amount of money in circulation was 599224193 The circula lation per capita has increased about 5 during the time referred to The president discussing the coinage of silver explains that the large surplus in the treasury vaults is owing to the tact that its paper representative is more convenient The general acceptance and use of the silver certificate show that silver has not been otherwise discredited Some favorable con ditions have contributed to maintain this practical equality in their commercial use between the gold and silver dollars But some of these are trade conditions that stat utory enactments do not control and of the continuance of which we cannot be certain I think it is clear that if we should make coinage of silver at present rates free we must expect the difference in bullion values of tho gold and -silver dollars will be taken account of in commercial transactions and I fear the same result would -follow any considerable increase of present rate of coin age such a result would be discreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all business interest We should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril and in deed nothing more harmful could happen to the silver interests Any safe legislation upon this subject must secure the equality of the two coins in their commercial uses I have always been an advocate of the use of silver in our currency We are large producers of that metal and should not dis credit it To the plan which will be pre sented by the secretary of the treasury for the issuance of notes or certificates upon the deposit of silver bullion at its market value I have been able to give only a hasty exami nation owing to the press of other matters and to the fact that it has been so recently formulated The details of such a law re quire careful consideration but the general plan suggested by him seems to satisfy the purpose to continue the use of silver in connection with our currency and at the same time to obviate the danger of which I have spoken At a later day I may commuicate further with congress upon tha subject The Chinese exclusion act is briefly referred to and the difficulty of keeping the Mongol ians out explained as being due to the vast boundery line to be guarded in the north west and the scarcitv of officers The state ment is made that additional officers will be placed on duty iu that section The proclamation required by Section 3 of the act of Haich2 1839 relating to the killing of seals and other fur bearing ani mals was issuad by me on the 21st day of March and a revenue vessel was dispatched to enforce the law and protect the interests of the United States The establishment of a refuge station at Pont Barrow as directed by congress was successfully accomplished Concerning our coast defenses the presi dent said Judged by modern standards we are practically without coast defenses Many of the structures we have would enhance rather than diminish the perils of their garrisons if subjected to the fire of im proved guns and very few are so located as to give full effect to the greater range of such guns as we ore now making for coast defense uses This general subject has had consideration in congress for some years and the appropriatiou for the construction of large rifled guns made one year ago was I am sure the expression of a purp ose to pro vide suitable works in which these guns might be mounted An appropriation now made for that purpose would not advance the completdou of the works beyond our ability to supply them with fairly effective guns Thesecorityof our coast cities against foreign attack should not rest altogether in the friendly disposition of other nations here should be a second line wholly in our own keeping I very urgently recommend an appropriation at this session for the con struction of such works in our most exposed harbors I approve the suggestion of the secretary of war that provision be made for encamp ing companies of the National Guard in our coast works for a specified time each year and for their training in the use of heavy gun His suggestion that an increase of the artillery f orce of the army is desirable is also in connection commended tho considera tion of congress The improvement of our Important rivers and harbors should bo promoted by the necessary appropriations Care thould be taken that the government is not com mitted to the prosecution of works not of public and general advantage and that the relative usefulness of works of that class is not overlooked So far as this work can ever be slid to be completed I do not doubt that the end would he sooner and more economi cally reached If fewer separate works wero undertaken at the same time and those se lected for their greater genoral interest were more rapilly pushed to completion A work once considerabrybegun should not be sub jected to the risk and deterioration which interrupted or insufficient appropriations necessarily occasion The president referred to the killing or Judge David S Terry by a deputy United States marshal for assaulting Jostfoe i Field and said I recommend that more definite provision be made bv law not only for the protection of Federal officers but for a f uU trial of such cases in the United States - He nays that In making such recommenda tions he does not desire to impeach eitaer the state laws or the general disposition of those charged with their execution Events which havo been brought to my attention happening in other parte of the country nave also suggested the propriety of extending by legislation fuller protection to those who may be called as witnesses in the courts of the United States The inves tigations of criminal offenses are often ren dered futile and the punishment of cruno impossible by tho intimidation of wit nessei The president refers to the crowded con dition of the supreme court and recommends the establishment of imermt J1 He courts having fins appellate jui isrlii Uii ui i l fam clatBesof q jotliom bjhJ cj 11 - jiio rec m iiigjipMWPpgBgH - ommends that the salaries or judges of did- i trict courts be in no case less than 5000 Earnest attention should be given by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called trusts is a matter of Federal jurisdiction When or- j ganized as they often are to crush out all healthy competition ami to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commou and general necessity they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good and anil even penal legislation He recommends au international copy right law lie says our naturalization laws should bo so revised as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition toward our government of the persons applying for citi zenship more thorough The enactment of a simple and inexpen sive National bankrupt law of a character to lie a permanent part of our general legisla tion is desirable Ho refers favorably to Postmaster General Wanamakers report and recommends the plan suggested of a supervision of the post oiHces iu separate districts that shall in volve instruction and suggestion and a rating cf efficiency of the postmasters would I have no doubt greatly Improve the service The president recommends the erection of a new building for the joint use of the post office department and the city postotlico of Washington Concerning the transmission of lottery ad vertisements and remittances throughout the mails he recommends that more stringent measures be adopted Ho refers in complimentary terms to the present improved condition of the navy and recommends a more raiml increase in the number of serviceable ships He concludes by saying I concur in the recommenda tion of the secretary that tha construction of eight armored ships three gun boats and five torpedo boats be authorized He refers in complimentary terms to the bravery and noble conduct of the American naval officers and sailors in the disastrous hurricane in Samoa He speakes of the substantial progress made made by the Indians and adds Our treaty stipulitions should be observed with fidelity and our legislation should be highly considerate of the best interests of an igno rant and helpless people We can no longer push the Indian back into the wilderness and it remains only to push him upward into the state of a self supporting and responsible citizen He then refers at some length to the recent opening of large tracts of lands secured from the Indians and the opening of Oklahoma and the means taken to protect the citizens and preserve order In conclusion he rec ommends the establishment at once of a ter ritorial government for Oklahoma He also recommends that provisions be made for the acquisition of titles to town lots in towns now established in Alaska for locating town sites and for theestabliohment of municiiwl governments An appropria tion for educational purposes there should neitlier be overlooked nor stinted The law now provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who was mustered into the services of the United States during the civil war and is now suffering from wounds or disease having an origin in the service and in the line of duty Two of the three necessary facts viz muster and disability are usually susceptible of easy proof but the third origin in the service is often difficult and in many deserving cases impossible to establish That very many of those who endured the hardships of our most bloody and arduous campaigns are now disabled from diseases that had a real but not traceable origin in the service I do not doubt Basides these there is another class com posed of men many of whom served an en listment of three full years and of veterans who added a fourth year of service who escaped the casualties of battle and the assaults of disease who were always ready for any detail who were in every bat tle line of their command and were mustered out iu sound health and have since the close of the war while fighting with the same indomitable and independent spirit the contest of civil life been ot jreomo by dis ease or casualty I am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large annual ex penditure neither am I deterred by that fact from recommending that congress grant a pension to such honorably discharged sol diers and sailors of the civil war as liaving rendered substantial service during the war are now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance and by disease or casualty are incapacitated from earning it Many of the men who would be included in this form of relief are now dependent upon jHibhc aid and it does not in my judgment consist with the National honor that they shall continue to subsist upon the local relief given indiscriminately to iaupers instead of upon the special and generous provision of the nation they served so gallantly and un selfishly Our people will I am sure very generally approve such legislation And I am equally sure that the survivors of the Union army and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief when this worthy and suffer ing class of their comrades is fairly cared for He conclutl is his reference to pensions by stating that new methods greatly increase the facility of the pension office indisposing of cases ami giving information The president welcomed the four new states and gave concise description of the resources of each In strong language the president referred to tha crippling and killing of so many brakemen ana switchmen in handling freight concluding as follows The attention of the inter state commerce commission has been called to the urgent need of congressional legislation for the bet ter protection of the lives and limbs of those engaged in operating the interstate freight lines of the country and especially of the yardmin and brakemen A petition signed by nearly 10000 railway brakemen was pre sented to the commission asking that steps might be taken to bring about the use of automatic brakes and couplers on freight cars At a meeting of state railroad commis sioners and their accredited representatives held at Washington in March lat upon the invitation of the interstate commerce com mission a resolution was unanimously adopted urging the commission to consider what can be done to prevent the loss of life and limb in coupling and uncoupling freight cars and in handling the brakes of such cars During the year ending June 30 1888 over 2000 railroad employes were killed in service and more than 200J3 injured The new executive department that of agriculture has been a success and the presi dent recommended that congress make the usual provision for the publication of its an nual report which cannot fail to be of value to the fanning community He further recommends that the weather service bo taken from the war department and estab lished as a bureau in the agricultural depart ment Tneoresident recommended that The laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks in the District of Columbia should be revised with a view to bringing the traffic under stringent limitations and control He called attention to the value to the general government of having a worlds fair hold in some of our important cities to observo the 400th anniversary of the discov ery of America On the 4th of March last the civil service commission had but a single member The vacancies were filled on the 7th day of May and mco then the commissioners have been industriously though with an inadequate force engaged in executing the law They were assured by me that a cordial support would bo given them in the faithful and im partial enforcement of the statue and of the rules and regulations adopted in aid of it Heretofore the book of eligibles has been closed to every one except as certifications were made upon the requisition of the ap pointing officers The secrecy was the source of much suspicion and of many charges cf favoritism in the administration of the law What is secret is always suspected what is open can bo judged The commission with the full apnroval of all its members has now opened the list of eligible lists for the classi fied postofBces and customhouses are now publicly posted in the respective offices as are also the certifications for appointments The purpose of the civil service law wa3 absolutely to exclude any other considera tion in connection with appointments under it than that of merit as tested by tho exam inations The business proceeds upon the theory that both the examining boards and the appointing officers are absolutely ignor ant as to the political niews and associations of all persons on tho civil service lists It is not too much to say however that some re cent congressional investigations have some what shaken public confident in the impar tiality of tha selections for appointment The reform of the civil service will maka no safe or satisfactory advance until tho present law and its equal administration are well established in the confidence of the peo ple It will be my pleasure as it isiny duty to see that the law is executed wih firmness and impartiality If some of its provisions harp been fraudulently evaded by appointing officers our resentment should not suggest the repeal of the law bat re form in lte administration We should have one view of the matter and hold it with a sincerity that is not affected by the consid eration that the party to which we belong is for tho time in power My predecessor on the 4th day of Janu ary i8N9 by on executive order to take ef fect March 15 brought tho railway mail scT viee under the operation of tb i ei il ser vice law Pri vision was marie t hat Je or der take effect sooner in any tato 5 here an ehjiU 1 fias sooner obtained Mil On the Uth day of March MKTJynian then the only member of the commission re ported to me in writing that it would not be possible to have the list of eligibles ready before May 1 and requested that the taking effect of the order be postponed until that time which was done subject to the some provision contained in the original order as to states iu which on eligible list was sooner obtained i He then adds The reform of the civil servfeo will make lio safe or satisfactory ad- vanoe until tue present law and its equal ad- j ministration are well established in the con- fidence of the tieople It will be my pleasure as it is my duty to see that the law is exe cuted with firmness and impartiality The present clerical force of the civil ser vice commission is inadequate owing to the increased duties laid upon them by the bringing of the railway mail service under the civil service law Additional clerks are recommended 4ByThe president dwelt at length upon the question of the general government extend ing ail to such rtates and territories as need it in educational matters He recommended that congress make such an appropriation After referring to the great work of mak ing removals and appointments the president sad It is not true that incumbency is a con clusive argument for a continuance in office Impartiality moderation fidelity to public duty and a good attainment in the discharge of it must be added before the argument is complete When those holding administrative offices so conduct themselves as to convince just political opponents that no party con sideration or bias affects in any way the dis charge of their public duties we cau more easily stay tue detnamls tor removals He thinks both in ami out of the classified service great benefit would result from the adoption of some system by which office holders would be graded by their faithful ness and efficiency in the performance of duty He has made such suggestions to the beads of departments and to the postmaster general The interest of tho general government in the education of the people found au early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen but in liberal appropria tions from the common resources for the tupport of education in the now states No one will deny that it is of the gravest Na tional concern that those who hold the ulti mate control of all public affairs should have the necessary intelligence wkely to di rect and determine them National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants and in that form the constitu tional pover of congress to promote the edu cation of the people is not seriously ques tioned I do not think it can be successfully ques tioned when the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the public treas ury Such aid should be and it always has been suggested by some exceptional condi tions The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the south the bestowal of the suffrage which soon followed and the impairment of the ability of tlie states where these new cit izens were chiefly found to adequately pro vide educational facilities presented not only exceptional but unexampkil conditions That the situation has been much ameliorated there is no doubt The ability and interest of tlie states have happily increased But a great work remains to be done and I think the general government should lend its aid As the suggestion of a National crant in akl of education erows chiefly out of the condition and needs of the emanci pated slave and his descendants the relief should as far as os8ible while necessarily proceeding upon some general lines be ap plied to the need that that suggested it It is essential if much good is to be accom plished that the sympathy and active inter est of the people of the states should be en listed and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purposes As one congress cannot bind a succeeding one in such a case and as the effort must in some degree be experimental I recommend that any appropriation made for this purpose bo so hmited in annual amount and as to the time over which it is to extend as will on the one band give the local school authori ties opportunity to make the best use of the first years allowance and on the other de liver them from the temptation to unduly postpone the assumption of the whole burden themselves The colored people did not intrude them selves upon us tbey were brought here in chains and held in the communities where they are chiefly found by a cruel skive code Happily for both races they are now free Tbey have from a standpoint of ig norance and poverty which was our shame not thexrs made remarkable advances in ed ucation and in the acquisition of poverty They have as a people shown themselves to be friendly and faithful towards the white race under temptations of tremendous strength They have their representatives in the National cemeteries where a grateful government lias gathered the ashes of those who died in its defense They have furnished to our regular arm y regiments that have won high praise from their commanding officers for courage and soldierly qualities and for fidelity to the enlistment oath In civil life they are now the toilers of then communities making their full contribution to the widening streams of prosperity which these communi ties are receiving Their sudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop Gen erally they do not desire to quit their homes and their employers resent the interference of the emigration agents who seek to stimu late such a desire But notwithstanding all tins in many parts of our country where the colored pop ulation is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and many cf their civil rights The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed Kvery constituency in the Union is wronged It has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of resjxjct for tho law would work a gradual cure of these fla grant evils Surely no one supposes that the present can be accepted as a permanent condition If it is said that these communities must work out this problem for themselves we have a right to askwhether they are at work upon it Do they suggest any solution I when and under wnat condition is the black man to have a free ballot 1 when is he in fact to havo those full civil rights which have so lonfj been his in law when is that equality of influence which our form of gov ernment has intended to secure to the elec tors to be restored This generation should courageously face these grave questions and not leavo them as a heritage of woe to the next Tho consultation should proceed with candor calmness and great patience upon the lines of justice and humanity not of prejudice and cruelty No question in our country can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the law I earnestly Invoke the attention of con gress to the consideration of such measures within its well defined constitutional pewers as will secure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under tho constitutional laws of the United Stetes No evil however de plorable can justify the assumption either on tho part of the executive or of congress of powers not granted but both will be highly blamable If nil the powers granted ore not wisely but firmly used to correct these evils The power to take the whole direction and control of the election of members of the house of representatives is clearly given to the general government A partial and qualified supervision of theso elections is now Erovided for by law and in my opinion this iw may be so strengthened and extended to secure on the whole better results than can be attained by a law taking all tha processes of such election into Federal control The colored man should be protected in all of his relations to the Federal government whether as litigant juror or witness in our courts as an election of members of congress or as a peaceful traveler on our interstate railways Referring to the humiliating fact that our merchant marine is so inferior to that of other nations not so fortunately situated as we are the president states I recommend that such appropriations bo made for ocean mail service in American steamships be tween our ports and those of Central and South America China Japan and the im portant Islands in both of the great oceans as will be liberally remunerative for tho ser vice rendered as will encourage the estab lishment and in some fair degree equalize the csunces of American steamship lines in the competitions which they must meet That the American states lyiDg south of is were cordially co operate in establishing and maintaining such lines of steamships to their principal ports i no not aouDt We should also make provision for a I naval reserve to consist of such merchant 1 ships of American construction and of a t specified tonnage and speed as the owners will consent to place at use of government in case of need as armed cruisers Bngland has adopted this policy and as a result can now upon neccasty place upon her naval list i some of the fastest steamsnlps in the world A proper supervision of the construction of such vessels would make their conversion into effective ships of war very easy I am an advocate of economy in our Na tional expenditures but it is misuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that withholds au expenditure for tho purpose of extending our foreign commerce fee en largement and improvement of our merchant marine tlie dardopmeat of a sufficient body o trailed AiserrK nai tha ntomoyea
