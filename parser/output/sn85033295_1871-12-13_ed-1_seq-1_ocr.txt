KE4T£S, YOL. XII. PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE Review of the Affairs of the Nation* Our Relations with Foreign Powers, Recommendations Concerning Tariff and Taxation. POLYGAMY AND KU-KLUXISM i TEE WASHINGTON TREATY Washington, Dec, 4. —The following is the president’s messnge delivered to Congress to-day, at noon . To the Senate and House of Representatives: In addressing my third annual message to the law making branch of the Government, it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year success baa generally attended the efforts to execute all the laws found upon the statute books. The policy nas been not to enquire into the wisdom of laws already enacted, but to learn their special intent and enforce them tccordingly. The xiast year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperity to the nation. I It has, hovever, been attended with more than the usual chastisemc n s in loss of life and propertyby storm and fire. These disasters have served to call fortn the best elements of humar nature incur country, and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign na tions, which goes far towards alleviating the distress occasioned by the calamities. The be nevolent who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes will reap their reward in the consciousness of Laving performed a noble act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of the moo, women and children whose sufferings they have relieved. ; Foreign Relations. The relations of the United States with for eign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been in eventful one in witnessing two great nations, speaking one language, and of one line ago, settling, by oeaceful arbitration, disputes of long standing, and liable at any time to bring these nations into bloodshed r all a state of conflict An example has thus been set which, if suc cessful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of men maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the bayonet and broad-sword. The Washington Treaty. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty al luded to, which has been concluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, and a copy of the protocols of the conferences of the Commissioners by who&a ic was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two na tions. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend to Congress, at an early day, to make the necessary provi sions for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the several commissioners on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably ex pressed for the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with by the ap pointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to those important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the two governments, and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed Costar boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The controlling parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as settled, between them selves, certain principles of public law for which the United States have contended from the commencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other martime powers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotia tions are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the powers. I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles in the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the other matters touch ing the relations of the United States towards the British American possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall he had on the part of Great Britain and its possessions. It is much to he desired that this legislation may become co-operative be fore the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrangements for the coming season. I have addressed a commnication. of which a copy is herewith transmitted, to the govern ors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana, Michigan. Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon tee governors of those states, respectively, the necessity of activity on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty, which contemplates the use of the canals on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary, in terms of equity, by the inhabitants of both countries; and it is hoped that the importance of the object, and the benefits iu flow there from, will secure the speedy approval of the legislatures of the states concerned. Tile Northwestern Boundary. I renew the recommendation for an appro priation for determining the true position of the 48th parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the United States and ■ the British North American possessions, be i t ween the Lake of the Woods and the summit ■of the Kocky Mountains. The early action of ! Congress on the recommendation named, i would put in the power of the War Depart- I ment to place a force in the field during the ! next summer. Protection of Germans iu Paris. The resumption of diplomatic relations be tween France and Germany have enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection afforded to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the United States in that country. It is just ' to add that the delicate duty of this protec ion has beeu performed by the minister and con sulate in Paris, and the various consuls in France, under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Then- course has received the commendation of the German government, and has wounded no suscepti bility of the French. The government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the moderate and just policy which this government maintains in its relation* with tho Asiatic powers,as well as w ith the South American Republic. I have given assurance that the friendly feelings of that government are fully shared by the i United States. Slelations wills Austria. The ratification of the consular and natur alization counectionwith the Austro- Hungarian Empire has been changed. Italian Unity, t have been officially informed of the annex- I ation of the States of the Church to the King ; dom of Italy, and the removal of the capital jof that kingdom* to Rome. In conformation with the established policy of the United | States 1 have recognized this change. Treaty of Commerce with Italy. Tho ratifications of the new treaty of com merce between the United States'and Italy have been exchanged. Tho two powers have agreed in then- treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The United States have spared uo opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. American Claims Against Spain. The Forty-first Congress, at its second ses sion, made an appropriation for the organiza tion of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of the in surrection m Cuba. That commission has since been organized. I transmit a copv of the correspondence relating to its formation .. and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the claimants s> complete remedy for their injuries. Jt has_ been made the agreeable duty of the United states to preside over a conference at Washington between the plenipotentiary of Spain and the allied South American republics, which has resulted in au armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. Relations with Russia. The ultimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continues undisturbed. The visit of the tliird son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his govern ment to diminish the cordiality of those rela tions The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side ve share the wishes of" that gov ernment. The inexcusable course of the Russian Min ister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline longer to receive that functionary as a diplomatic representa tive. It was impossible; with a just regard fer tile dignity of the country to permit Mr. Cac acazy tojeoutinue to hold interviews with this government after bis abuse of government officers,and during his persistent interference, through various means, with the relations be tween the United States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, *our gov ernment has been relieved of further intercourse with M. Cataozy and the man agement of the affairs of the imperial legation Las passed into the hands or a gentleman en tirely unobjectionable Relations with Japan. With Japan we continue to maintain inti mate relations. The cabinet of the Mikadahas, since the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of imuortant depart;; ents of the government. I have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterested ness of the policy which the United States I have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire i to continue to main tain! this disinterested and just policy -.nth China as well as Japan. TJc tovcan Troubles. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its estab j lished course, prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our a hip wrecked sailors on the Corean coast . I instructed our Minister at Pekin to en deavor to conclude a convention with Corea, for securing the safety aud humane treat ment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was ! instructed to accompany him. ! with a sufficient force to protect him iu case of need. A small surveying party, sent out on 5 reaching the eoaat, was treacherously attacked at i disadvantage Ample opportunity was gi' an for explanation aud apology for the insult, and neither came. A force was then .landed, and after an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the outrage had been committed, were gallantly assaulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the crim inals and vindicated the honor of the dag. the expedition returned, finding it impracticable , under the circumstances to constitute the desired convention. I respectfully offer the correspondence re lating thereto therewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Con gress may see tit to take. Relations witi* .Mexico and Soutli America. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law establishing' what is known as the Frozen Zone, the frontier of the United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, also that more stringent measures may be taken by that republic for restraining lawless persons on the frontier. I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon re lieve the government of the diffi culties experienced from these causes. Our relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue, with one exception to be cordial and friendly. I recommend action by Congress regarding "to the overdue installments under the award of the Yonezula claim commission of 1866. The internal dissensions of this government presem no justification for the absence of ef fort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. Emancipation in Brazil. It Ls a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that empire, always cordial, trill naturally be more so by this act. It is not too much to hope that the government of Bra zil may hereafter find it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates. Its true prosperity and greatness as a nation are to bo found in the elevation and education of its laborers. Slavery in Spauish Colonies. It is a subject of regret that the reforms in this direction, which were volun tarily promised by the statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out in its West Indian colonies. The laws aud regulations for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico have left the laborers in bondage with no hope oi release until their lives be come a burden to their employers, Americans Owning Slaves. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that the citizens of the United States are large holders, in foreign lands, of this species 'of property, forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent legisla tion, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning or dealing in slaves, or being interest ed in slave property on foreign lands, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagers of the United States. Cuba. It ia to be regretted that the disturbance in the island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a protracted struggle in such close prox imity to our own country, without apparent prospect of an early termination, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people wiio, while abstaining from interference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed euioy ment of liberty and the blessings of free insti tutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona tide American citi zens and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain, growing out of the affairs in Cuba, may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and concord which has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such questions. Diplomatic lieiatioiis with. China and Japan. To give importance and to add to the efli ciency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further in retaining the good opinion of those people and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between these nations and the balance of the commercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support, at least, four American youths in each of these countries to severe in the official family of our minister there. Our representative would then be placed on an equality with the representatives of Great Lni 1 am, and several other powers. Vl now ; situated, our representatives in China and Japan have to depend for interpreters and tianslators, upon the natives of these coun i tries ’ who know our language imperfectly, or proeme lor 4 he occasion the services of em i proves of foreign business houses, or the in terpreters to other foreign ministers. Facilie Steamship Tunes. I would also recommend libera] measures for the pur-pose of parting tho American line or steamers now plying between San Fran cisco and Japan and China, and the Austral ian lure, at most our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their ser vice. The Tariff on Taxes. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spiritu ous, vinous and malt liquors, aud tobacco in its various forms, from stamps. In read justing the tariff. I suggest that a careful es timate be made or the amount of surplus rev enue collected, under the present laws, after providing for the current expenses of the government, the internal account, aud a sink ing fund; and, that this surplus be reduced in such manner as to afford the greatest reve nue. There are many articles not produced at home suck :.s medicines and compounded essences, from which hut little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. Such articles I recommend to be placed on the free lists. ’ Should further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made up on 1 articles which can bear it without disturbing 

WATERTOWN, WIS., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1871. Home productions, or reducing the wages of American labor. I have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws for colleetin; revenues pay collectors too small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at principal ports of entry particularly raise the compensation of these officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this' system must at times work perniciously, It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possesion of these offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered’ to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subejct. Tile National Debt. The national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,126.80 during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, tbe interest of the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to bo raised for interest account is nearly 817,000,000 less than on the Ist of March 1869. It was highly desirable that this rapid diminu tion should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankruptcy; but in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends, of the rapid develop ment of the reso -irces of the country, and its increasing ability to meet the large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desira ble that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to con tinue this lapid payment. I therefore recom mend the modification of both tariff and inter nal tax laws. Gold and the Cuixency. Continued fluctuation in the value of gold, compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country, in keeping up prices of all the articles necessary im every day life; it fosters a spirit of gambling preju dicial alike to national morals and to national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to om - currency, that value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. Tlie Army. Fox - the operations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining, estimates for the ensuing year, and for continuing sea coast and other improvements conducted un der supervision of the War Department I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secre tary of War. I call yonr attention to the provisions of the act of Congress, approved March 2d, 1869, which discontinues promotions in staff corps of the army until provided for by lav/. I recommend that the number of officers in oach grade of staff corps be fixed, and that when ever the number in any one grade falls below tbe number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of chief of corps becomes Vacant, the place may be filled by a selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists. The report of the Secre tary of the Navy shows improvement in the navy, and efficiency of the naval force,without material increase in expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted and is being extended as fast as our material will admit of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By these meaxrs we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex tent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable and generally to discharge j more efficiently tire appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace without exceeding the number of men or tbe expenditures authorized by law. Dining the past year, the navy has, in ad- , dition to its regular service, supplied ihomen i and officers and the vessels of tho coast sur vey, and has completed the surveys authoriz ed by Congress of rhe Isthmus of Darien and Tehanutepec; and under like authority has sent out an expedition completely furnished and equipped to explore the unkuown ocean of the North. The suggestions of the report as to the no cessity for increasing and improving the ma terial of the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standing by the gradual abolition of cer tain grades of officers and reduction of others, and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered, and deserve the attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy above the rank of captain be by selection instead of by senority. This course will se cure in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to yonr officers to improve themselves in tho knowledge of their profession. The present cost of maintaining the navy, and its cost compared with that of preceding i years, and estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying report of the i Secretary of the Naw The Post Office. The enlarged receipts af the Poet Office De partment, as shown by the accompanying re port of the Postmaster General, exhibits a gratifying Increase in that branch of the pub lic service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the peo ple, two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics, with a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely popu lated, but all requiring the services of the mail. It is not at present to be expected that this department can be made self-sustaining but a gradual approach to this end from year to year is confidently relied on, and the day is not far distant when the Post Office Department of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to your especial attention, especially the docu ments favorable to the consideration of a plan for uniting the telegraph system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It would secure the further advantage by ex tending the telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprise will not con struct it. Commerce, trade,and above all the efforts to bring a people, widely separated, into a com munity of interests, are always benefitted by a rapid communication; and education, the grand ground-work of Republican institutions, is encouraged by increasing these facilities, to gether with speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of such im provements will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the operations of last year, and for comparative statements of results with former years. Tlio Public Landi-. I renew my recommendations that the pub lic lands be regarded as a heritage to our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been, in great part, dis posed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them; but caution should he exercised even in attaining so de sirable an object. Educational interests may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. Educational. Ido not wish to be understood as recoin - mending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the general government for the wwwuegement of education. The re port of the Secretary of tho Interior, submit ted with this, will give you information, col lected and prepared for publication, in regard to the census taken during the yeai 1870, the operations of the Bureau of Education for tho year, the Patent Oftice, the Pension Office, thi Laud Office and Indian Bureau. Agriculture. The report of the Commissioner of Agricul ture gives the operations of his department for the year. As agriculture is the ground work of our prosperity, too much importance cannot be attached towards labor; and his de partment is in the bauds of an able head,with able assistants, all jealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the nation all tho useful products, adapted to the various climates and soils of our vast territory, and to the giving of all useful infor mation.as to the best method for tho cultiva tion of plants Quietly but surely the agricultural bureau is working a great Nation al good, and il liberally supported the more wudely its influence will be extended, aud tho less dependant we shall be upon the products of foreign countries. Salaries. The subject of oompeusatiou to the heads Office Over Post Otice. of bateaus and officials, holding positions of responsibility and requiring ability and char ac cr to fill properly, and one to which your attention ls invited. But few of the officials reieivc a compensation equal to the respecta ble support of a family, while their duties are sii.ii as to involve millions of interest. In prt. ate Hie their services demand compensa tion equal to services rendered. A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the government service. Government Kxpcjj-.es. 1 have not given the estimates for the sup oat ol the government for the ensuing year, net' Iho comparative statement between the eipeacuturos lor the year just passed and the ; aar j ust preceding, because all these figures aie contained in the accompanying reports, or in t fioeo presented directly to Congress. Those estimates have my approval. •■"olitital Disabilities. More than six years having elapsed since 111.- las! hostile guu was fired between the en emies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpetuation, the other for the demol ition of tne Union, it may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the 14th amendment, should be removed. It does not exclude the ballot, but only requires the disability to hold office of certain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to officers reflecting the views of the ma •>0 ‘ ! ■ Ido not see the advantage or pro piiety ot excluding men from office merely. 1 aey were before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to be elected to posi ■.:ons requiring them to take an oath to sup the constitution, and admitting to eligi ’'i.dy loose entertaining precisely the same xlO v. -but of less standing in their communities, it may no said that the former violated an u ith while the latter did not. The latter did no; have it m their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted they won: t .lave broken it, as did the former class, it iuerc are any great criminals, distinguished above all others lor the part they took in oppo sition to the government, they might, in the judgment of conquerors, bo excluded from h-.idi an amnesty. This subject is submitted for your careful consideration. The condition of the scut horn states is unhappy, not such as all true patriotic citizens would like to see; social ostracism lor opinions sake, personal violence and threats towards persons en tertaining political views opposed to those en tertained by the majority of the citizens, pre vents immigration, and the flow of much need ed capital into the states lately in rebellion. ii will ho a happy condition of country when the old citizens of these States shall take an interest in public affairs, promulgate the idea honestly entertained, to vote for men representing their views, permit the freedom oi the press and ballot to those entertaining different political convictions. Tnc District of Columbia. under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21st. 1871, a territorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its results have thus far fully realized the expectations of i:s advo cate.- Under the direction of the territorial office "s a system of improvements has been inaugurated, by means of which, Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the Na tion'- Capitol, the citizens of the District hav ing voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount, lor the purpose of contributing to tho advancement of the coat of government. 1 recommend liberal appropriations on the part of Congress in order that the government may boar its just share of the expense of car ijing out various system of improvements. Ho '.a’aiueut Buildings Chicago, IV the great fire in Chicago the most im portant of the government buildings in that city wore consumed. Those burned had al icad 0-', come inadequate to tbe wants of the go >. c! irai 'it m that growing city, and looking to tbe near future were totally inadequate. I recommend, therefore, that an appropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the entire square on which the burned building stood, provided it can be purchase i at a fair valuation, and provided the legislature of Illinois will pass a law authorizing its occupation for govern ment purposes, and also make an appropiia iiot of as much money as can be properly ex pended towards the erection of new buildings during this fiscal year. Immigration. The number of immigrants, ig norant ol our laws and habits, and coming into our country .unually, has become great. and the impositions practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant that I suggest congressional action for their protection. It seems to me the affair is a sub ject ol legislation by Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints hy emigrants of tho treatment ■.-Ave, bat will endeavor to do so dur ing the session of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive your attention. The Ivu-iiluv Law. There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the government the execution of 'he act of Congress, approved April 20th, 1871, and commonly known as the Ku-Klux law. jo a portion of the state of South Carolina the necessity of the coarse pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the commission to investigate southern outiages. Tjuder the provisions of the above act I issued a proclamation calling the attention of the people of the United States to the same,and declaring my reluctance to exer cise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except In case of im perative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the Uni ted States the peaceful enjoyment of the lights guaranteed to them by the constitution and the laws. Alter the passage of this law, information was received from time to time that combina tions of the character leferredtoin this law ex isted and were powerful in many parts of the southern states, particularly in certain coun ties in the state of South Carolina, Careful investigation was made, and it was as srtaiued that in nine counties of that state such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion of citizens to control the local authority, and having, among other things,the object of depriving the eman cipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of the privilege of the free polit ical action oi those citizens who did not sym pathize with their views. Among their operations were frequent semirings and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different political senti ments Irom their own. or free persons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well dis posed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless vio lence. Thereupon on the 13th of Oct. 1871, a proclamation was issued in terms of the law, calling upon the members of the combinations to disperse within tivo bays, and to deliver to the Marshal or military of the United States, ail their arms, ammunitions, uni forms, disguises, and other means and implements uied by them for carrying out their unlawful pur poses. lids warning not having been heeded, on the I’ilh ot October another proclamation was issued suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that state. Direction was given i bat within the counties so designated persons supposed, upon credible information, to bo mem bers oi such unlawful combinations, should be ar rested by the military forces of the United States and delivered to the Marshal, to bo dealt with ac cording to law. Ju two ol the said counties—York and Spartans burg—many arrests have beeu made. At last ac count , iho number of persons thus arrested was one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred, v.'hoso criminality was ascertained to be of an infe rior degree, wore released for the present. These have generally made confessions of their guilt. Groat caution has boon exercised in making arrests. Notwithstanding the largo number, it is believed t hat no innocent person is now in custody. Ihe prisoners will bo held for regular trial in the judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the Jaw, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General. TUe Mormons a ml Polygamy. In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar ism, repugnant to civilization, decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, how. ever, have been found, who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity, and with due sense of sustaining the modesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other violation of the Statutes will bo permitted within the territory of the if *i j •' * 8 with the religion of these sell-styled saints that we an' now dealing, but their practices. They will bo protected in the worship of cod according to the dictates if their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate laws under the cloak of religion. I t may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in tie execution of laws against polygamy, is to be the status of the plural wives and their offsprings. Lho propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing the territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize ail children horn prior to a time Axed in the act, might he justified by its humanity to these innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation. Tile Indian Policy. The policy pursued towards the Indians hag re sulted favorably, so far as can be Judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the exertions of the various societies of Christians, to whom has been entrusted the execu tion of the policy, and the board of commissioners authorized by the law of April 10th, 1869, manv tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, and perform productive labor of various hinds, and to partially accept civilization They are being cared for in such a way, jt is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace poliov, not only because it is human, Christian-like and economical, but because it is perfectly right. I recommend to your favorable consideration, also, the policy of granting a territorial government to the Indians, in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri, and south of Kansas. In doing so, every right guaranteed to the Indians by a treaty should be secured. Such a course mignt, in time, be the means of collecting most of the Indians, now between the Missouri and the Pacific, and south of the British dominions, into one territory, or one state. The Secietary of the Interior has treated upon this subject at length, and I recommend to you hia suggestions. The Civil Scrvicc 3 It has been the aim of the administration to en force honesty and efficiency in all public offices Every public servant, who has violated the trust placed in him, has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If bad men have secured places it has been the fault of the system established by law and customs, for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for government positions persons not sufficiently well-known to them personally, or who give letters endorsing the character of office seekers without proper sense of the grave responsibility which such a course de volves upon them. A civil service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercan- i tile pursuits, the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend, to enable him to ob tain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would enforce this prin- i ciple against all endorsers of persons for public ' places, would ensure great caution in making rec ommendations. A salutary 7 lesson has been taught the careless and dishonest servant in the great num ber of prosecutions and convictions of the last two : years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change : which is taking place throughout the country in i bringing to punishment those who have proved re- ! creaut to the trust confided to them, and in elevat ing to public office noue but those who possess the confidence of honest and virtuous men, who will always be found to comprise the majority of the community in which they live. In my message to Congress one year ago, I urgently recommended a reform in the civil service of the country. In con formity with that recommendation, Congress, in the 9th section of an act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government, and for other purposes approved March 3d, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the executive to inaugurate a ch il service reform, and placed upon him the res ponsibility of doing so under the authority of said act. I convened a board of gentlemen, eminently qualified, for the work to devise rubs and regulations to effect a reform. Their labors are not yet complete,but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adapted to the great relief of the executive, the heads of departments, and members of Congress, which will redound to the interest of the public ser vice. At all events, the oxj icrimcnts shall have a fair trial. Condnsfon. I have thus hastily summed up the operations ef the Government during the iast year,and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper lor your consideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action will bo wise, statesman like, and in the best interests of tho whole country. [Signed] U. S.
