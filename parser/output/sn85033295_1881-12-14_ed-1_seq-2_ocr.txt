Guiteau’v Trial* Eighteenth Day. —Guiteau was filled with fear and trembling as he cringingly shuffled through the large crowd which lined his walk from the van to the entrance of the court. Dr. Kennou, managing editor of the Chicago Medical Re view, gave it as bis opinion that the prisoner was insane. During the testimony of Dr. Ken non, Davidge maintained that John W. Gui teau had sworn positively that the prisoner’s father was not insane. Witness admitted that when a man committed crime while acting un der the delusion of Divine inspiration, aud then conducted himself precisely as a criminal would do, would be presumptive evidence against insanity. Several other experts were called, all of whom testified that if his actions up to the time of the hypothetical question were true the prisoner was undoubtedly insane. Guiteau .vas incensed at the qualified testi mony of the experts and denounced the wit nesses as cranks. Nineteenth Day. —On the 6th inst. the de fense closed their testimony and District Attor ney Corkhili directed all the medical experts to remain for examination by the prosecution. Scoville requested that President Arthur be summoned. Guiteau broke in with: “Yes; and Grant and Conkliug aud the rest of my political friends.” Counsel for prosecution agreed to allow Scoville to prepare Interrogatories to the President, and allow his evidence in this form to be put in later. The prisoner read copiously from his book, “Truth,” certain passages of which will be marked by Scoville to be submitted as evidence. Twentieth Day —The government began its re buttal. The expert testimony was not called at first, the prosecution producing a large number of witnesses who had been early neighbors, friends of the Guiteau family. The uniform testimony went to show that while Gmtcau’s father was eccentric in some ways he was a man of unusually bright intellect, and was trusted with important positions with the fullest con fidence of the city of Freeport, where he lived. Other relatives were eccentric, but very few cases of actual insanity were found in the* fam ily. • Gen. Sherman was placed upon the stand. When he had concluded, Guiteau said: “I thank you, General, for having ordered out those troops that day. If it hadn't been for you I should not be here to-day. I owe my life to the protection which you and General Crocker gave me during that period when mob spirit was rife.” The prisoner interrupted the coun sel as often as usual. Twenty-first Day. —The testimony taken on the Bth tended greatly to weaken the prisoner’s case, as it destroyed every vestige of the claim of hereditaiy insanity. The prisoner interrupt ed the witnesses repeatedly and viciously. President Arthur’s answers to’Scoville’s interro gations were read in court. He said he had seen the prisoner ten times and possibly twenty times, that the prisoner, to his knowledge, haci rendered the republican party no service during the campaign; that there was nothing in the relations between the leaders of the partv and Guiteau to furnish the latter with any ground for supposing he would receive an appointment. The President stated that he had received a letter since the indictment containing some claim of his having rendered some important services to the republican party during the Presidential campaign, and an appeal for a postponement of his trial to give him time to prepare for a defense. Twenty-second Day. —When the criminal court opened on the 9th, Guiteau became un usually noisy, abusing Corkhili and a number of witnesses. Geo. W. Plummer of Chicago, after suffering the interruptions for a while said to the prisoner; “It seems that your close relations with the Deity of late have corrupted your manners.” The prisoner laughed heartily at this sally and said: “ Well, that ain’t so bad, Plummer, for a western man.” Plummer said be had noticed nothing about Guiteau to indicate an unsound mind. Stephen English, editor and proprietor of the Insurance Times, New York, took the ftand. Guiteau called out: “This man was in Ludlow Street jail, and I got him out for §300.” Witness said he was in jail under §40,000 bonds and hired prisoner to secure his release, giving him §3OO. Guiteau took ihe money, aud also that of other persons tut rendered no service therefor. Guiteau shouted at the witness; “Why, I would not spit on you on the street, you old scoundrel. I'D get some insurance men to show you up. You are lying all the way through, English, you old fraud.” Witness considered the prisoner a shrewd sane man. At one time Guiteau cried excitedly: “I want to know, Corkhili, what all this kind of evidence has got to do with the real issue—-who fired the shot that killed Garfield, the Deity or I? I think it is devilish mean to rake up ‘my character in all its details. The only issue here is, who fired that shot, the Deity or I! Just take that home, Corkhili, and think it over till to- morrow morning. I want to know what all this has got to do with ray sanity or insanity on the 2d of July? As I told you before, I had time enough to go crazy a hun dred times in the interval.” J. McLean Shaw testified that Guiteau told him that he (Guiteau) was bound to become notorious, and might some day, like J. Wilkes Booth, kill some great man in order to draw attention. An apartment-house, capable of ac commodating forty families,has just been completed at Brooklyn, at an expense of $500,000. It is an enormous struc ture, and families will be able to live in a most luxurious style. It is model in every respect, containing elevators, steam, and all sanitary improvements. The cost of running it will be 

SIO,OOO per year, and the rental will probably amount to $55,000. FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY. MACARONI. Boil until tender enough to put a fork through easily. Put in a deep dish a layer of macaroni, with a little melted butter and salt; grate cheese over this; fill up the dish as above, the last layer of cheese without butter. Pour over all milk so you can see it on the edge of the dish. Bake until a nice brown. HONEY-COMB PUDDING. To one pint of molasses add one cup of brown sugar; beat them well together. Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg m a teacup of milk; add one teaspoont'ul of saleratus and pour it into the molasses. Beat the whites of six eggs to a stiff’ froth; add the yolks to the molasses; stir in one teacup of flour; add a little mace and cloves. Stir in the whites, and bake one hour in a moderate oven. Serve with a rich sauce. CURRANT SWEET LOAF. Mix two heaping teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, with one pound of flour; then rub into it four ounces of butter, as for pastry; add eight ounces of currants, six ounces of sugar, and one pint of milk, in which one heaping teaspoonful of car bonate of soda has been dissolved; add a little salt, spice to taste, and bake. The addition of two beaten eggs and four ounces of citron makes a rich loaf. A RICH MINCE MEAT. Boil a fresh beef’s tongue, a large one, weighing five or six pounds, in salted water till tender, about three hours. Skin it and then put it back into the liquor until it is thoroughly cold. Weigh it and chop it, and to every pound of tongue put a pound of snet, a pound of raisins, a pound of currants, a half pound of citron, a pound of chopped apples, a pound of sugar, cin namon, allspice and cloves sparingly: a pint of brandy to the mince meat, which must be packed down tight in a stone or earthen jar. When you make up your pies add to every five pounds of the mince meat a quart and a pint of cider. This is enough for eight pies. If you require more brandy it must be added at the time of baking. The cider must not be put into the mince meat jar, as it will spoil the whole quantity. This receipt makes a very rich mince meat. For the ordinary mince meat, take three pounds of the “ sticking piece ” of beef, which is from the neck. This has some fat in it. Boil till tender in salt and water; Let it get cold in the liquor. Then chop it; add two founds of suet. Then put an equal quantity with your weight of beef, of currants, raisins, chopped apples and sugar, pound for pound. A half pound of citron to each pound of meat. Cinna mon, allspice and cloves, and the juice and chopjied rind of two lemons. APPLE BUTTER. Boil four gallons of cider for three hours, skimming it. Have the apples pared and cored, and put them in gradu ally; as they boil down fill up with more apples. Have an oaken stave pierced with holes and fastened to a long han dle—a broomstick is the best—so that you can stand at a distance from the kettle. It must be stirred continually to prevent its burning. If you have your cider on to boil by 10 in the morning, the apple butter ought to be all cooked by 12 at night. Sweeten it to taste with light, brown sugar, but the sugar must not be added until about an hour before it comes off the fire, as it burns more easily after the sugar is in. Add cinna mon and cloves to taste when yon put the sugar in. When it is done it must be so stiff that a spoon will stand up in it. Apple butter is a tedious thing to make. It is beet to have a merry-making over the apple-paring and stirring, as it is very heavy work for one or two per sons. A gay party in a country house undertook it a few seasons ago, but long before midnight all had given out, leav ing one strong-armed young fellow alone to finish it, Apple butter must be cooked in a very large kettle, a perfectly new tin boiler, or a copper kettle. There is no use in making up a small quantity, as it takes just as much time as to cook a barrel of cider. If made according to this receipt, it is sure to keep. Washing in Italy. [From the Cornhill Magazine.] In cold weather much washing of the person is considered to be dangerous to health; and my barbarity in subjecting a young baby to a daily bath during the winter excited almost as much virtuous indignation as my culpable neglect of the “fascia,” so necessary to keep the legs straight. On receiving a neighbor into the house for a week, I thought it incumbent on me, although it was the dead of winter, to provide him with all conveniences for washing, but these at tentions were lost upon him; and my astonishment when the house-maid thought fit to inform me in her dramatic way that neither soap, water nor towel had been touched, was perhaps no greater than his own at finding these useless thing provided. “ The signora says to me,” begins Marietta, “have you put soap into the room of that gen tleman ?” —“Sissignora.” “A bath?” —“Sissignora.” “Two towels?”— “ Sissignora, sissignora, ma, signora, non toccati! ne I’una, ne Taltra! ” The spruce-gum industry in Maine is represented to be in a highly flourishing condition. Men who range the woods collecting the gum make good wages, selling the article for 40 cents a pound. Altogether residents of the state obtain $40,000 yearly by the sale of the article. THE 

LOWER CANADIAN. A Model of Thrift who Dwells in the Queen’s Dominions. [From the December Atlantic.! The inhabitant is a model of thrift. He grows his own tobacco, makes his own “beef” moccasins, and manufac tures his own whisky. His wife spins the wool out of which is made V etovffp. du pays, a kind of frieze, in which he clothes himself. His house is a picture of neatness. The outside is whitewashed at least twice a year; the inside is swept and garnished until it is as bright as a new pin. The floor of pine boards is scrubbed and sanded every day. The walls are hung with pictures, somewhat gaudy as to color, of the pope, St. Cecelia, St. Joseph and St. Anne, and photographs of the parish priest and of the children who are away in New Eng land or Minnesota. Over the broad fire place, in which huge logs blaze in winter time hangs the family fusil, the old flint-lock a sire carried under Mont calm, and now used to kill an occasional bear and to fire a feu defoie on St. Jean Baptiste day and other great occasions. Near it are medals brought from Borne by the priest or the bishop, and the rosary that has come down as an heir loom in the family. The house is dec orated with sampler work of saints and angels, for which the women are famed. A crucifix hangs above the fusil, and in settlements near a church the house is always supplied with holy water. The patriarch of the family sits in the ingle ueuk, puffing blasts of smoke from his long pipe up the bellowing chimney, and •sporting the toyue, an old-fashioned red night-cap with a brilliant tassel, which his fathers before him wore under the ancien regime. The good wife in mantalet of calico skirt of homespun blue, and neat Norman cap, is at the spinning-wheel; the eldest daughter, soon to marry the honest husbandman in the next clearing, is weaving her linen outfit at a hand-loom. The pot in which the pea-soup, the staple dish, is made, is gurgling on the fire; a smaller pot contains the pork; and in the gulf parishes the tiuade, composed of alternate layers of pork and codfish, is still the piece de resistance. The bed rooms are furnished with old-fashioned bedsteads, covered with patch-work quilts of cunning and patient workman ship. Here, too, are pictures of the Madonna and St. Ignatius, and a small i plaster figure of the great Napoleon, j meditating with folded arms on the | cliffs of St. Helena; a bough of palm i blessed at Eastertide; holy water, a j specific against lightning; and the snow-shoes on which the inhabitants visits his little kingdom of eighty or one hundred arpents in the long winter season. The housewife bottles an infin ite variety of preserves in the fall, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, huckleberries and other wild fruits which the bush and the swamps yield in abundance; and in the spring the ma ples furnish a sweet harvest of sugar.

[From the Buffalo Telegraph.] In the Episcopal church at ElMcott ville, Cataraugus County, is an old bell, which according to a very legible date on its side, was cast in Moscow, Russia, in 1708. Its history is about as follows: It is now 173 years old and was cast for and first used as one of a chimes of bells in a large cathedral in Moscow. When Napoleon inaugurated his disastrous re treat in 1811, by burning the city, the cathedral with its chime was molested in the common ruin. Several years after ward, this bell was gathered up other old metal and sold to a sea captain for bal last to his vessel, which he returned light to New York. In the course of time the bell found its way into the hands of the well known bell founder, Andrew Meenelej, of Troy, and was kept in his yard for several years as a curiosity, though not highly valued. When the present church building in Ellicottville was finished, a gentleman connected with the parish happening to see it, purchased it at a low price and presented it to the society. In due time it was elevated to its present position and after a half century’s silence, its peculiar tones once more resounded through the air; but this time, not sounding a single note in the Misericordia of a nation groaning under the bonds of moral and physical oppression, but pealing forth a glad sound of its own in a land where every heart is free. The bell to-day is still sound, and its notes as clear as on the first day of its existence, and its re verberations are still throbbing and echoing away among the hills of old Cat taraugus. Particles in the Eye. [From Youth’s Companion.] Old and young per sons are often sore ly troubled by small hard particles of matter that get under the eyelids. When children suffer in this way, their parents may not even suspect the cause of the trouble. The irritation may go on in creasing for years: for the inflammation strongly resembles catarrhal conjunc tivitis, which has quite a different cause. The conjunctiva (as the termination itis in medicine always means “inflam mation of,” conjunctivitis means inflam mation of the conjunctiva) is a mucous membrane which begins near the edge of the lids, upper and lower, lines them, and then, turning back, covers also the eye-ball. It thus forms two sacs. It is exceedingly sensitive and is very liable to inflammation of various kinds, all painful, and some very difficult of cure. A foreign body beneath the eyelid soon inflames it. Such a body beneath the upper lid is not as readily detected as one beneath the lower, and it is harder to remove it. A child that had long suffered from what was supposed to be catarrhal in flammation, and for which it had been energetically treated, only to grow worse, was brought to Dr. Broosa, professor of ophthalmology in the New York Uni versity. On turning up the child’s upper eyelid, the source of the trouble was found in a small bud of a cherry-tree. Belief and cure followed its removal. In all such cases the main thing to do, is to avert the lid. The lover lid is eas ily turned over the finger. If the parti cle is beneath the upper lid, press the lid against the eyebrow and have the patient look down. Then seize the eye lashes and edge up the lid aud turn the lid quickly over the thumb. Bemove the speck with a handkerchief, and show it to the patient; for he will often feel for some time as if the object were still in the eye. A Minister’s Messenger and What He baw. [Paris Letter to Philadelphia Press,] Two hundred years and one week ago. almost at the very moment when his soldiers were entering Strasbourg, the Boi Soldi started out fr< *m Fontaine bleau to take possession in person of his new conquest. The day b. fore—that is to say, on the 29th of S ptember, 1681, Louis XIV, had announced to his court in the presence of the German ambassa dor that he had made up bis mind to go to Strasbourg, in order to receive the oath of fealty w i<-h the treaty of Ni megue gave him tin righ to exact from the city. It was a coup do theatre, and no mistake. But how happened it that the king was so well infra mea as to the set tled condition of off o s at so distant a point? Well, the storuns ns follows; One evening the minister Louvois sent for a young man who had been recommended to his good graces, and said. “ Sir, you will g t into a post carriage which you wi I find at my door. My servants have exact instructions what to do. You wiil proceed to Bale without stopping, and you will reach there about two o'clock to-morrow. You will proceed immediately to the bridge which crosses the B ine You will re main there until f<: ur o’clock. You will carefully notice aT h at you may see there. You will then again get into the carriage, and without 10.-h-g a minute you will return and report to me what you may have seen” Tee young man bowed and started at once. Two days after, he reached Balt, n>d at once has tened to take np his st a* on on o>e bridge. Nothing extraordinary attracted his at tention. It was market-day, and some peasants were passing and repassing, bringing vegetables ran! taking back their empty carts. A squad of militia passed. Townsfolk crossed the bridge, talking of the news < i the day, and a little man wearing a yell* w coat, leaned over the railing and an mo and himself h 7 dropping stones iiao the v aver, as if to create circling eddies, which he watched with a satisfied look Four o’clock struck and the ministerV messenger started on his return t > Paris. Very late in the evening tin- young man, greatly disappointed at he jesult of his mission, arrived at tie home of Lou vois. The minister uas -tdl awake and rushed to meet bis proto:,-- , “What did yon see ? ” he ;*fked. “ I saw peasants g-iug and coming; a squad of militia J if bridge; citizens who walked ?do iscussing the day’s news, and a v mm wearing a yellow coat, who v -:ie. am ■’ g himself by dropping stones ivo. • her.” The minister had * ear ■ i _*h, and he hurried to the kina. i. i ! man in yellow was a secret ag- e , a . the stones dropped into the v-at. ; a a signal that all difficulties lad < overcome, and that Strasbouo b 1 > France.
