Two electric cars at Detroit, Mich., carrying some twenty pas sengers and both running at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour, col lided last Saturday, and as a result three men were instantly killed and a half score seriously injured. The President's message was a veritable McKinley document. He congratulates the members of Con gress upon assembling under such "felicitous" conditions, and touched upon nearly every public question, but, strange to say, the revenue deficit was let severely alone. Attorney-General Pickle, for the State, and John J. Vertrees for the railroads, closed the argumeuts in the United States Circuit Court at Chattanooga Monday, in the case of the railroads operating in Ten nessee against the board of State tax equalizers, attacking the assess ment of the State board of railroad commissioners, made under the act of the last legislature. Judge Clark took the briefs of attorneys, and said that he would decide the case on his return from Cincinnati the latter part of the week. The general opin ion seems to be held by those who have heard the arguments during the progress of the suit, that the railroads have the best of it, and that the assessments will be re duced. ' ' , 

ECHOES OF THE PAST. Excerpts From the Diary of Capt. A. J. Campbell. From Johnson Island Prison to Dixie Laud Is a Long and TeAlon ' Journey . - The IUukt Don't Like the Way Some of the Confederate Offlceri Fondle Around Federal Officials and Trigger for Favors. Continued from last week Article 11. Sept. 8, 1862. Our guards are as mute as mice. Cheered for Federal soldiers, we hurrah for Jeff Davis and Stonewall Jackson. We arrive at Maltoon, a railroad junction (marked on the old maps Paradise), at 3 a.m. Saw a negro girl peeping out of a little cabin as though she were afraid of being kidnapped. At Indianapolis some little negroes ventured up to look at us. A Reb jumped out of the cars and started after them, making them ecamper off in a hurry. Our Missourian for whom we made up the money is seen here sitting off among the crowd of lookers on. At 7 a.m., we arrived at Effing ham. The Rebels scattered all over the town and the guard was runuing around after them, but one com pany can't guard a train of thirty cars of Rebs who have learned that the train will not start when many of them are off. Here an old Dutch woman refused to sell Confederates anything. The Dutch are hard against us; the Irish for us. At 9:30 we stopped for a train to pass. A little boy here said that there was lots of secesh in this country. A citizen told Lieut. Love that he would rather fight for the devil than for Old Abe. At Indianapolis I trot a paper. The holder was afraid to let me have it until he asked the advice of a bystander. We have not found any one along the road who has had time to read the news. They don't know what it is, but iwe fine it to ba glorious. Lexington, Bowling Green,' Frankfort and Cynthiana are evacuated by Fed erals and they fall back on Louis ville and Covington. Cincinnati in an uproar, the whole of the citizens called out and martial law declared by Lew .Wallace, the commander. Kentucky 'legislature sitting at Louisville. Confederates pushing on after Federals and routing them, horse, foot and dragoons. Our bravo boys driving them at every point in Virginia. Gen. Jackson reported wounded; Gen. Ewell killed. Northern papers setting up a howl for more troops, stating that the barbarous rebels are at their very doors and that all will be lost if they don't meet them cn masse im mediately. At one o'clock we arrived at Cen tralia. We have a good manv sym pathizers through this part of Illi nois. The Federal mistake us for federals and cheer us. Some new recruits at this place told us "to give them hell, boys," but they soon found that we were Rebels by the hurrahs for Stouewall Jackson and Jeff Davis. Ninety-six miles from Cairo we came to a considerable town. In the southeast part of the town some young ladies came out on the por tico. A little trirl had a nag. winch all the boys took to be a Confederate llag. One of the young ladies got so excited that she jerked it away from the little Kin and commenced wav ing it amid the cheers of a thousand liebel oincers and wavinar or nana kerchiefs. Some took two red and one white handkerchiefs and made extemporaneous Confederate flags and waved them from the top of the cars, which were covered with Con federate officers. Farther back ; saw a young lady cheering us with a white hanaKercniei. Anotner, standing by, ierked it away from her, but she continued to wave ner hands. At the same town a vixen stood in the door and kept popping her fists at us. The more we hol lered the madder she got. We glided by, leaving her "champing the bits." Several ladles on the road told us to stand up and fight like men. In the evenine we arrived at Duquoin, eighty miles from Cairo, and waited lor an up train to pass Here we saw fthe man mentioned here was a few years ago, and possi bly is vet. a citizen or the southern end of Maury County. During the Eumme1' season of revivals he was quite a conspicuous figure at any church within a radius of ten miles of his home where a revival was in progress. Nor did he figure less conspicuously, whether invited or not, on such occasions, at the homes of those brethren whose wives were noted for setting a good table. He looked very sheepish and went and brought his wife down. She is very bitter against the South. X had but little to say. We learned from a citizen that he was doing nothing for livelihood. It is evident to my mind that he is playing off on the loyal Illinoisans as a persecuted Union man who has had to flee for his life and leave all his property; a thing which many other scamps have done, creating a false , impres sion on Northern men in respect to Southern men. . ' Passed Big Muddy tiver bridge about sixty miles from Cairo. Sev eral companies were stationed here. evidently guarding the bridge. After dark the engine stalled and had to take part of the traln.over at a time. Reached Cairo at 10:30 all cramped up and fatigued to death, havlug had no opportunity to sleep for two nights. We were crammed on the Universe, an old crazy boat. We covered it from top to bottom and then could scarcely get room to lie down. I slept on top of the boat. Our baggage was sent ahead and we do not know where it is. We have heard that our trunks were burst open at Sandusky after the officers told us that we need not send our keys, as they did not intend to ex amine the baggage. If that be so we are satisfied that everything of value is stolen. 8ept. 4. Waked by the cold this morning, though the day is oppres sively warm. Every part of the boat is so crowded that you can scarcely turn around. The river water that we drink is as warm as dish water. We can scarcely get anything to eat. The rations of a great many gave out yesterday. Some few eatables for sale are brought over in skiffs. Passes are difficult to get and the citizens are so afraid that they will be arrestud that we can't begin to have our wants supplied. A great many have no money. Camp Douglas prisoners have been arriving here day and uight since we have been here. As soon as we got aboard our boat it was anchored out in the mid dle of the Ohio. The river is full of Rebels with two gunboats watching. An ironclad steamed np the river to-day, probably for Cincinnati, as the Yanks there are frightened out of their hides. Dr. Southern, of Co lumbia, came over from Cairo to see his acquaintances aboard. He met with cold comfort. Tutle, the commander of this post, (he also commanded a regiment at Ft. Donelson) brought over some rations late this evening, gun-wadding bread, raw met, coffee and soap. There is no chance in the world for so many to cook, and i have been afraid the old boat would be set on fire, so many crowding and rushing around the fire to cook something. Here we came up wttn our Colonels and Major who had been paroled somf tinie before we started, to report at Vicksburg. They could get no farther than Cairo. The juards have been trying to nave tne fires on the boat put out, but the Rrtbs won't let them. Old Follett, a tyrannical old scamp, has lost his power over us and has fallen back to Cairo, leaving us and nis com pany to do the best we can. At San dusky he spoke out very gruffly to his lieutenants to "drive 'em In, drive 'em in," as though we were a lot of hogs. JSiL'ht hundred negroes, stolen Dy the Federals, arrived here yester day from "away down South." Learned here that Dr. Dickson had been arrested and sent to Johnson Island. Some of the Rebels were taken off this boat about dark, but we seem very much crowded yet. Sept. 5. After being tramped over a good part of the night we stirred out early to try to get a chance to make some coilee. xnis pnee is worrying us greatly. The weather is oppressively warm and if we have to remain at this place long we will all be sick with cholera or some oth er pestilence. The boats the pri vates are on are so crowded that a groat many have to stay out on top and take the rain. At dark we were put aboard the boat on which the Johnson Island prisoners were placed last night. This gave those who came aboard first a chance to sret the best Darts of the boat. Some eight tbousaud prisoners are lying off Cairo in nifflit of Mound City. sweltering and almost suffocating with hfiHt D-nnhoats Delow and above us. With ropes and blankets we stretch out covers to protect us from the sun. When it rains we cannot guard so well against it Sept. (!. Slept last night on top the boat on my shawl with nothing to cover with men so thick that one can't get about without step ping on them. On the boat to-day I saw an intelligent contraband, owned by Butler, of Cahoma county, Miss. lie was very sick of Yankee- dom and wanted to iro DacK. uapt Blake's daughter come over this mornlne: in a skiff to see him. There are 1,200 men on this boat, the Choutan. Capt. McWhirter, Cols. Battle, Wood, Quarles and others are paroled to Cairo aud pick out a hundred officers and select crowd eolntr down on parole $15 for the passage. There is a good deal of hard feeling against them among the officers for the way they have triggered around and fondled around old follett aud other federal om cers. Our trunks and baggage came aboard yesterday, all pillaged and mutilated. The civilized world never before witnessed such thiev inir and low-down rascality by otti cers or any government. JNeany every officer in prison asked if he must send the key to his trunk and was repeatedly told that it was not necessary; that the trunks had been examined twice and everything con traband kept out and that they did not intend to examine them. In Sandusky they broke open every trunk, breaking off the hinges and tops and smashing in the sides, un tying our bundles and pillaging everything. Many trunks were robbed of their entire contents and everything of value taken from our baggage. The only thing of value that I put with the baggage was a pair of heavy blankets I brought from Donelson, and the only blank ets I had were stoleu. Capt. Follett will get mauy a cursing before we get to Vicksburg by all except a few who are always truckling to tne "blue-bellies" and begging for fa vors. The most of us have too much pride for such conduct. - TO&KCOXTISUZD. congress;. ' in session. President McKinley Sends His Annual Message. ' The Recognition of Cuban Independ ence Is Sow Out of All Questlou No Belligerent Rights. The Financial Problem Wants Hawaii Annexed Congratulated Upon Assembling Under Felici tous Conditions." Presidont McKinley last Monday sent hi3 message to the first regular session of the Fifty-fifth Congress. The document is a lengthy one and would occupy nearly two of the Heralo'6 pages. The main points of his address are as follows: To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives: It gives me pleasure to extend greeting to the Fifty-fifth Congress, assembled In regular session at the seat of government, with many of whose senators I have been associa ted in the legislative service. Their meeting occurs under felicitous con ditions, justifying sincere congratu lations and calling for our grate ful acknowledgment to a beneficent Providence, which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a nation. The Financial Question. With the great resources of the government and with the honorable example of the past before us, we ought not to hesitate upon a cur rency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the gov ernment of maintaining parity or our different forms of mony, that is, keeping all of them at par with gold. We Burely cannot be longer heedless of the burden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menace to the national credit. 1 If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. I recommend that the issue or national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 and up wards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of Congress, then 1 would recom mend that national banks be re quired to redeem their notes in gold No Help for the ubns. The most important problem with which this government is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and tne uuoan insur rection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this eovernment at various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest, grow- ine discontent, and an ellort toward a larger enjoyment or liberty and self control: or organized resistance to the mother country ; of deep de pression after distress and warfare and of ineffectual settlement to be followed by renewed revolt. Ihe civilized code oi war has been disregarded no less so by the Span lards than by the Cubans. The ex istiuir conditions cannot but fill this government and the American peo Ie with the gravest apprehension, .'here is no desire on the part of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. Let the Cruel War Go On. In the absence of a declaration of the measures that the government proposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it suggests that Spain be left free to conduct militarv operations and arrant politi cal reforms, while the United States for its part shall enforce its neutral obligations and cut off the assist ance which it is asserted the insurg ents receive from this country. The supposition of an indefinate pro longation of war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are already well nigh reclaimed; that planting of cane and tobacco therein has been resumed and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for. Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only by upright and patriotic con siderations, moved neither by pas sions nor selfishness, the govern ment will continue its watchful care over the rights and properties of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and enduring If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and hu manity to Intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and ouly because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and approva of the civilized world. He Wants Hawaii. - By a special message dated, the Ifitli day or June last, I laid b6fore the Senate of the United States a treaty signed that day by the pleni potentiaries of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii, hav ing for Its purpose the incorporation of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the United States, and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the injunc tion of secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, the subject may be properly referred to in this message because the necessary action of the congress is required to determine by legislation many details of the eventual union hould the faot of annexation be accomplished, as I believe It should be. If the treaty is confirmed, as every consideration of dignity nnd honor requires, the wisdom of congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements perhaps yet fit to share in the highest fran chises of citizenship and having due regard to the geographical condi tions, the most just provisions for self rule in local matters with the largest political liberties and an in tegral part of cir nation will be ac corded to the Hawailans. No ler.s is due to a people who, after nearly five years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the obligations of self governing statehood, come' of their free will to merge their destinies in our body politic. The Klmetallltt CoinmUxlon. Under the provissions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897, for the promotion or an international agreement respecting bimetallism, I appointed on the fourteenth day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward C. Wil cott, of Colorado; Hon. Adlai E. Stevenson, of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine, of Massachusetts, as special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent in their efforts to secure the concurrence and co-operation of European countries in tne inter national settlement of the question, but up to this time have not been able to secure an agreement con templated by their mission. Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have already demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject and it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an inter national agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold and silver money upon such terms and with such safe guards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no in justice to any class of our citizens. ' 1 International Arbitration. International arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects claiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen' the general views on this question ex pressed in my inaugural address. The best sentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settle ment of differences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war. Treaties embodying these hu mane principles on broad lines with out in any way Imperiling our in terests or our honor shall have my constant encouragement. Talk or Alaska. The territory of Alaska requires tne prompt attention or (Jon gress. The conditions now existing demand material changes in the laws relating to the territory. The great influx of population during the past summer and fall, and the prospect of a still larger iinmigra tio'i in the spring, will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of civil authority within the ter ritory or postpone the establishment or a more thorough government. Ihe startling, though possibly ex aggerated reports from the Yokon ltiver country of the probable short age of food for the large number of people who are wintering there without tho means of leaving the country, are confirmed in such measure as to ju&tify bringing the matter to the attention of congress. Access to that country in winter can be had only through the passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps an im possible task. However, should these reports of the suffering of our fellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief.
