Dec 7. n at tack upon postmaster general Burle oa's denunciation of organizations of postal employes was made last night by Thomas F. Flaherty, secretary treasurer of the National Federation of Postal Employes. The statement .ittacks Mr. Burleson's administration of the postofflce department as au tocratic, denies that postal employes have threatened to strike and states that by referring to the organized em ployes as "potential revolutionists" the postmaster general is seeking to discredit them and east odium upon their present agitation for a badly needed wage Increase."

The United States is supporting Italy as well as England, France an thoLO countries In like manner a. supporting the United States in tbt. war, they are all waging against the imnerlal German government. At that point the United States meets Austria-Hungary and Austria Hun gary is suppo.ting Germany. The two nations are in cose contact and in open coalition in the conduct of tiu war. Are Actually At War. "Aside from acts of aggression and offense committed by the Austro Hungarian government asainst tne United States, which in itself tbe committee declares to be sufficient cause for war, it is manifestly impos sible that the United States and Aus tria should be at peace while Ger many pnd the United States are at war Tha state of actus? war al-eady exists between Austria and the United States.

Senator Dodge, of Massachusetts scored the Turkish government and declared that to secure unity Bal-rca-ia also should be recognized as a foe. The executive and state depart ments, however, said senator Lodge "feel that action at thl? time is un desirable. In taking these grave steps m a declaration of war. it is essen tial that we should act with most en tire harmony. There oneht to be no division. But it is not unsuitable to briefly state the reasons of those who believe Tur key and Bulgaria should be included. --vT hAll.ce technicallv a case could be made out in regard to Turkey.

I hope due warning will be given Americans there because we ao not wwn men names added to the long list of Turk ish massacres." Eulsarla Enticed Into War. Turning to Bulrarla, senator Lodgs said there was no feeling of hostili ty to the Bulgarian people, but that the "czar of the Bulgars." was en ticed into an alliance with Ge-many "It would be difficult to find in history." he said "a me-ner or baser figure. Bulgaria, as the president said. Is the tool of Germany. Bulgaria has a legation in this city. If her of ficers are friendly to this country, they are traitors to their own gov ernment; if true to their own gov ernment, then there is a legation rep resenting Germany and her allies in the capital of the United States, i would like to see it removed. "Bulgaria is a tool, but It Is a dream, in my opinion, to think we can detach her or Turkey from the German alliance. It is as much a dream as that we could detach Aus tria."

The re lease of Russian prisoners held in Austria began ten days ago. Aus tria took the initiative in this with out waiting for Russia to release Austrian prisoners. Each Russian prisoner was schooled carefully in Austria's desire to end tbe war, and the whole body of these Russian prisoners was returned to Russia as a sort of propaganda for terminating the strusg-e. Austria holds some hundreds of thousands of Russian prisoners, taken in the ebb and flow of the Rus sian invasion along the e-i-tern front II. 5.
