"Mob law judiciously handled is tbe best and surest," tlife conclusion oar neighbor arrived at after commenting on the Park murder; and uin reflection, c are not much surprised. Mob law has evidently -been one of the great ele ments of success to hi party. By mobs, under the name of I he K. G. C's. before the rebellion. Preachers and School Mast rrs who did not believe according to South ern orthodoxy in politics, were driven ir.uinnence or nangea upon a tree. At the close of the rebellion, the mob spirit centered in the Ku-Klux-Klan, and what they failed to accomplish bv open rebel lion, they sought to secure by organized Irands of assassins, and thousands have tell at the hands of this organized band of desperadoes, whose very existence de pends on embittered hate and thirst for blood. And oh ! how long has our great metropolis (New York) carried her elec tions in favor of the Democratic party, bv mob force! What countless thousands have been made to mourn to retain Demo cratic ascendency. But we rejoice to know that with the restoration of law and order, his party is doomed. Doomed more surely than the city of Cbicygo. The latter will, in time, ris up out of the rushes and flourish ; but the former will go down tc rise no more. When the Democratic party was in favor of law and order, it was a party of power; but when it became corrupt and distrustful, yet sought to retain by force what it had forfeited by moral turpitude, it fell, and S Tat was the fall thereof. When civil liberty could assert her rights in New 1 ork ; Oh ! what a tumbling there was at Tammany, and no partv which seeks to .-rush her mighty prowess, can have the faintest hope in this enlightened age, of even temporary success, without bein backed by a mob. Gen. Baker's Proclamation in Pursuance of the Clark Co. JS.u-.Kiux Proclamation. Shortly after the lynching of the ne groes who were charged with the murder of the Park family, there were strong in-Oicattona-cof a determinm; - . VM vu UV V of a secret g'an, who had not satisfied their fiendish thirst for blood in the law leas hanging of the supposed murderers, to drive from the County of Clark, or ex terninate all the negroes- in that county. These facts timing to the knowledge of the Governor, he wisery issaed the following ploclamation to sturetoanoflending citi zens their rights bgainst an offending and lawless mob, to-wit : PROCLAMATION. The Democrat in commenting upon an article which appeared in our issue of Nov. 16th, in relation to the publication of the tax notice says:' That "as the lawyer of the Republican ought to know the law requires but three publications, the expense will be somewhat less than lie figures it." We now rail their atten- tian to page 91, Sec. 93 1st Vol. Rev. Statutes of Indiana, which will convince them that we arc right and they are wrong. In his reply to our article published .Nov. 23d, under the title "Democratic Courtesy," they have but little argument to offer further than to claim it as a cus tom, and then threatens us if we don't let them have all the legal advertising, they will spoil our business in regard to work which we are interested in. From in formation correctly received, there is no Republican Sheriff in the 11th Congres sional District, where there is a Demo cratic paper that publishes all sale notices in his party organ. And as to the notice of the meeting of the East Plymouth Drainiug Company, which wa3 composed of Democrats and Re publicans, being published in this paoer and not in the Democrat, will say that it may possibly be that said notice of the meeting was published alone in this paper; but the same Draining Co. divided their printing with the papers, and paid $4 for 3 insertions in the Republican, and $3 for a similar notice inserted once in the Democrat. Perhaps there is no Republican county in Indiana where an attorney was situated as one of the editors of his paper that would have been treat ed bo thabily as to he refused the publi cation of his client's Sheriff sale notice in his own paper, and put in another against his will. It is doggedly mean there is no law for it, and we defy them to pro (luce a precedent in the United States, and if there is any ratting that is smaller business than this, they will have to go to China where they eat rats. 

STATE OF INPIANA. KxscimvE Department November 23. 1871. Whereas. Orranizpji hunrU nf amu.ii and niasked men have recently usurped the functions aud powers of the judiciary in the counties of Franklin and Clarke, and have assumed the riclit to fnifihie take prisoner from the jails of said coun ties, and execute them for offenses against the laws of the state, charged to have been committed by such prisoners, and in the latter county three negro men were taken ironi me jail and executed by one of these lawless organizations; and it has been mad known to me that have bicC published in said county of Clakrc, purporting to emanate from one of mese clans, DDtuymg all colored persons who have seitled in said count v sinr thn close of the war. to leave said countv on pain of death ; and, being also informed that there now are colored prisoners in the jail of Clarke county, who mav be in danger of mob violence : Tsow, therefore. I. Conrad Baker, irov- ernor of the state of Indiana, do hereby call upon the local authorities and the people of said county, and of all other counties where these illegal organizations may exist, to use all ths lawful means in their power for the suppression of ttie same, and for the speedy arrest and trial the school. 01 uiosts who nave been euffaired in the! recent terrible tragedy before mentioned. Eviry citizen, and every class of citizens, is entitled to the eoual orotection of the law, and mob violence must be suppressed. ana prisoners awaiting trial and their lawful custodians, must be orotected at all hazards. To this end, all the means at my command will be furnished to the local authorities to aid in the performance of their duties whenever a request to that effect is made. I especially warn the mis guided men who are said to be attempt ing, bv organized violence and terrorism. to uanisu a p state from tl Teachers' Institute. Tuesday, a. m., Nov. 28th. Music. Prayer. Music. Calling roll. Reading minutes by the Secretary, Mr Orr. Essay by Miss Cleayeland, on the " Ne cessary Qualifications of Teachers." We were unable to get the consent of Miss C. to have her essay published. Miss Cleaveland made a few extempore comments. Training would do the work. She thought teachers should, control themselves first; that they should be able to judge concerning the puuishment of pupils. Every teacher should have pa tience. Whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well. The teacher should have thorough knowledge of the branches taught; high appreciation of the beauti ful ; careful of grammatical mistakes ; re search beyond themselves laudable am bitioi; a sense of religion; the lushest motive from which to act. A teacher should be a christian. The qualities of a teacher should be firmness, gentleness, quicKcess 01 oDservaiion, diplomacy, a proper knowledge of cause and effect, log ical reason, patience, fastidiousness and christian life. Mr. Chase made a short speech on the essay, speaking of its correctness. PENMANSHIP. Mr. Chase thought they had better say. " physician heal thyself." In some places pupils provide their paper, the teachers setting them copy, lie thought this the worst way. His objection was, the pu pils imitating the penmanship of the dif ferent teachers, in ten years lift', of a boy his hand writing would become com pound. Suggested that the teachers should adopt one system and it should be taught weil, and by all the teachers of Recommended Payson, Dut- Thev should learn the system well. It was not neces sary for teachers to go to professors. Pu pils should use copy books. Teachers should show trustees that it was the best way and cheaper. Mr. Beiler said teachers had things in company which Mr. C. overlooked. Ask ed if he would have those beginning, and all others, write one word at a time. The editor of the Charlestown Btcord received an advert iscmcnt, purporting to be a proclamation from the captain of the LUark county Ku-KIux, requiring an tne negroes who have recently emigrated to Clark county to leave, or to share the same fate as Taylor, Johnson and Davis. Instructions were given to send the bill fear advertisement to box , at Iudianap lis post office Plymouth Democrat. In the face of the above, why does the editor of the Democrat call Covernor Ba ker a granny for issuing a proclamation calling upon all good citizens of Clark county to protect ttnonending persons. and criminals who have been overtaken by justice PREPARE FOR THIS CMPAICS!

The state must rely mainly upon the local authori ties in its efforts to guarantee the equal protection of the laws to all her citizens. and if these authorities become powerless in me presence 01 organized violence, tne late legislation of congress makes ample provisions for the intervention of the na tional authorities, and the president in his proclamation of the 3rd of May last, has assured the country that this legisla tion shall be enforced everywhere to the extent ot the powers vested in him. Let the people and the constituted authorities of every county in the state be so faithful in their observance and execution of the ! laws that Indiana may forever avoid the reproach ot having rendA-ed the interior- ent schools.

Explain one half of the time to the first class (if there are two), aud theother half to the second class. En cry one could learn something from number one. If pupils can write better than the teacher, let them conduct their own writing.

I want of space it will not appear till next Mr. H. said he would, and compel them ; week. to know the meaning. Mr. Beiler said the scholar would not all be attentive; there woull be such a large number of clas ses. Mr. H. thought there would be no use in having so many classes. Mr. Beiler wanted to know why it would not be better to get thi meaning of the words from the spelling book. Mr. H. said it would teach them to know what they were reading about. Mr. Nichols wanted to know if Mr. H. knew the meaning of all the word in the reader. Mr. II. thought he did. If he did not, he would not be competent to teach. Mr. R. A. Hume thought the best way was to assign lessons la the spelling book that the scholars were anxious to no tice the words missed by each one. Mr. Beiler thought the best way was to select two from the class, and have two sides, and to commence alone side, and if a word was miosed, let the opjjoaite bide catch the word then the strife would be between the sides aud the pupils. Mr. R. A. Hume wanted to know if he had larce and smalt do so. Mr. Beiler said lie had not ; but should this winter, with the difference of re-pro nounring the words to the small scholars. Mi A. C Hume said Mr. Bciler's meth od was no better than the old ones. The pupils will not know the meaning, jir. B. said he might do both. 

CLASS .MEETING. LED BY MISS ELLA BELL. Thought teachers should be dignified; gentle, so that pupils would respect them. Mr. Beiler gave Miss Bell credit for do- in as she had promised calling him se cond. lie thought teachers should have dignity. That they bhould be firm, at the same lime friendly. On the play ground a gentleman teacher should be tkyentleman. and do just as he would have the pupil do. Geuilemen should be found there, but not necessarily the ladies. If the teachers were on the play ground, the pu nils would !e respectful. Miss Bell i-aid she did not mean cross ness, bv dignity. Mr. Wilfong said he agreed with Mr. B. about the plav ground. The teacher should be mild and always friendly. Miss Lanfesty thought the teacher should be firm and decided not cross and crabbed. By being polite, one might teach pupils to be polite. Mr. Borton said teachers should svmpa- thise with pupils, and take an( interest in everything pertaining to them. Any thing done to gain confidence would be the most profitable. Mr. Baldwin thought the teachers should be careful in taking part in the plays. When pupils quarrelcd.-Uhe teach er would generally be on ono' side, and if he gave iu his decision, the other side would be sure to call him partial. He did not object to them playing, but thought the teacher should get his exercise by walking around and overlooking. -Mr. Beiler objected to Mr. B.'s re marks. Thought if a teacher could not decide correctly he ought not to teach. The presence of the teacher prevented i quarrels. It he were there, one pupil would not be telling him one thing, and another, another. If the teacher were wrong, he should acknowledge it. Mr. .Nichols said Mr. Beiler had given his sentiments.

Ver catiTmt If we were disposed to lack confidence in an institution, or locality, or the citi zens thereof, our confidence would be strengthened whorcver there is a plan hucU as that adopted by the Plymouth correspondent of the Bourbon Mirror to turn the subject matter into ridicule And there is no such instance on record of an attempt at ridicule, but what the parties, or place, or institution ridiculed profited thereby. It is said that nn ancient king of Egypt, told his subjects that if they would dig in the eartk they would find a gold apple which if planted would produce gold fruit. The people in digging for the apple, so effectually culti vate3 the ground that an abundant crop was produced that gave them a handsome rr-rurn in gold. : It is also Si id that i n early settler of Kentucky told a story that the ground was so rich in that State, that a crow-bar planted in the evening, would sprout ten pounds of nails during the night. Now every one knows that this is not true; but in that day it helped to draw the at tention of the people to Kentucky, and citizens went there with their crow bars and though they did not sprout nails, a proper use of them brought nails and lumber, and fine houses and farms, and started Kentucky on in the march of civilization. The Plymouth correspond ent of the Bourbon Mirror, says there was a stranger here who went around among the merchants buying up tails from beef hides, for the purpose of start ing a calf nursery in Ohio, and one in Btark; that tkey stuck the tailR in the ground and raised calves from the roots of the tails ; and suggests that as a capital idea to the Mutual Life Protection Com pany for Its consideration. (Xow there is no company here of that name,) and if there were, we alsa lwve our doubts whether calf tails planted in the ground will eprout young calves, but it may be that an experiment in tin direction might be of great benefit. And while we have our donbU, it is no more unreasonable than the Darwin theory, and as tbe cor respondent of the Mirror has not given - his name, may we not reasonably suppose that he is tbe first calf produced which enables him to speak so intelligently on subject not generally known Will he look into the Mirror and behold his face. 'Any Jady, desiring about the nifist' Fruit Picture published, can' see It by calling at our office, and can get it by sub scribing to our paper and to "Our 0"w n Fireside." The pvice vf both paper is only $3.50, andtbr: Fruit CJiroiftpJs worth twice the moneT. ... an effort to protect the law abiding from the lawless, he is then "an old granny." Why does ourcotemporary ridicule Gov ernor Baker for a noble act4 and why does he regret that barbarity in the extreme wes not added to lawlessness ? Why do you never hear him say anything against Ku-Klux who are mercilessly murdering thousands of goothcitizens in the South? and why does he oppose any, and even measure proposed to prevent these out rages? Why did he not advocate Lynch Law a few years ago when Thornburg was cut down in his youth for no crime, unless it was drinking too much liquor. It will be remembered too, that not long ago, young Cook, who had been arrested for larceny, was shot as an es caping prisoner Why was this act fully justified as a penalty for stealing three hundred dollars worth of property, while he permits greater crimes to go unnoticed 1 Why is Governor Baker a Granny because he seeks to prevent ontlaws from driving innocent men from their homes, because three of their nationality had been guilty of a foul murder We are in favor i of punishment being meted out ade quate to the offense in every instance, and opposed to mob law at all times where law can be enforced, and when we see a journalist advocating lawless mobs, and justitying barbaric punishment as a re compense for crime to one class of men, and to another all the benefits of tbe law andihe charities of a beneficent people, in other words, vindictive punishment to the one, and extreme charity to the other, we certainly cannot fail to determine the animu.

We are not very much inclined to favor the doctrine of total depravity; but occasionally some thing turns up in an uniooked for quarter, that unsettles us on that question. We had 'come to look upon our amiable and gentlemanly coteniporary, the editor of the Laporte Argus, as a bright example of courtesy and truthfulness. But alas, for the frailty the perverseness of hu man nature. In the last number of that paper, we find the following in answer to an editorial in Bro. Gurney's paper. He says: ; And while we are speaking of this matter- it may not be amiss to call the atten tion of the Virlette man to a fact which has probably escaped his memory. We once announced our determination to extend the same style of treatment to him Hint he does to us. We will pay him back in bis o vn coin, and take pleasure in giving him good interest. He commenced this tight by making a positive but entirely false statement about us. That he did it un derstanding is no longer a question, and it is cqwardly And contemptible in him to whine wheu-We retail a few of his well known Aort-comings, by way of dem onstrating his uEmuess to judge of our motives.' r " . - . Just to think, what a lying 'contempt ible scoundrel tbe Argus man threatens tobe. It is enough to mate "each par ticular hair" of the head of hi readers stand oh endr We sorroVingly lay down pupils were so taken up in writing that Jirgui ana weep. , : mey would not sp:U Correctly, school.' SPELI.IXG. Mr. A. C. Hume sid lie was not much acquainted with the subject. He thought it the foundation of all other bandies. The method generally taught was that of being called up in a class and spelling, and one going above anot her. He thought this was about as good as none at all. The better way was writing spelling. The best way was to get their lesson out of their previous reading lesson. That scholars might have benches and would not tire. Spelling words and not know ing the meaning, was as bad as no spelling at all ; pupils should be taught by sound as well as letter. Mr. Hcrvey asked if he taught spelling in that way, how he would teach the pu pils who could not write. Mr. Chase thought it should be limited that there were some whom it would take six months to drill their smaller ones. Mr. Hume thought small pupils could and would remember better if they only learned eight words in three months. Mr. Chase wanted to know if it would not be an objection, if they only learned a few words. Mr. Beiler objected to spelling orally. Mr. Hume objected to spellir.fi three or four times a day. Mr. Baldwin wanted to know if he would entirely do away with the old sys tem. Mr. Hume said he would. Mr. It. A. Hume objected to doing away with it. Mr. Chase wanted to know if Mr. Hume would do away with the spelling book. Mr. A. C. Hume said he would act ac cording to circumstances. Mr. Kichols wanted to know if there would not be a school meeting called. Mr. Hume said, No. He wanted to know if he was to do wrong in order to get the good will of the people. If so, he would not do it. Mr. Beiler thought Mr. Hume was going to extremes. He thought -they should have both oral and writing. Mr. Hume said he was misunderstood. He did not intend to do away with oral spelling, but the speiling book. Mr. Chase thought the pupils learned many things hich they did not understand un til older. A lady, (whose name your reporter did not learn) suggested that children should write their lessons before they came to the class, and recite them oxally afterward. Mr. Baldwin said sometimes in writing 1 HE SATURDAY EVENING over t he lessons at recess. It was valua ble time. Every teacher shouki look over the lesson uuless he or she had taught ti enough without. . . ., Miss Dickson thought teachers had enough exercise going to and. from 'board ing places. V. ; Miss Beiler said he did not expect ladies to play: but that a gentleman, unless he was obliged to study, should be playing, and preparing his body for stmly. Mr. Dickson thought it would be low ering a lady's dignity to play. lieading programme for afternoon. Singing adjournment. f coSTIXTED KF.XT WEEK. The senior editor of the Plymouth Re publican, who is a practicing attorney complains, and ery justly, we think, at the refusal of the Sheriff to allow him to publish a sale notice, and thereby save his client $5 in the cost of publication. In every other county but this, in this vicin ity, we believe attorneys are permitted to control the advertising for their clients. Such is the practice, at any rate, in Kos ciusko, St Joseph, Laporte. and we be lieve Porter all Republican counties. Bcurbon Mirror. - The Rochester Sentinel sayi "Clark county is democratic, and were an election at hand would surely be under martial law." The editor of this paper undoubt edly had reference to the proclamation of! Gov. Baker, issued in pursuance of the Clark county triple tragedy, and this is his style of evading the real question in volved. Why did he not meet the issue, or join in denouncing the fiendish work of the lawless? Why did he evade the point by assuming what could not be? Look out, Arthur ; you may be helping to build a trap to catch yourself. Ocr Neighbors Akimat,. At the present time there seems to be consider able kicking in the Democratic stable ; and if we can credit the statement of our neighbors, there is a long eared animal kept at the Ledger office at.. Knox, Ind., Inch kicked the editor of the Demaci'at tfthk place some two weeks-ttgo, which hurt him so badly that he screamed- Un like most of his kind," whiclj'.aris :pecniiar ly remarkable for firmness, after bearing his master's yoise he quiets down and. be comes perfectly docile ; and . now by ref erence to the" last weeEVsZrt;? i will not ice that he, Vho the'mdcr'df called a jackass, is voluntarily bearing extra bur dens for his sarcastic keeper, asd kicking at us that have not been near ikn.-' This is doubtless to convince our cotemporary that h!s presence was not obsctf ed when tlie w'eked foot.was raised. - We "care not whjt the motives were, Hilf a Century old!
