Joseph Chamberlain, secre tory for tho colonies of Great Britain, delivered a speech on Thursday night which will, no doubt, tickle the ears of ,'i good many people of the United States who enjoy flattery and nice words, but who do not always take the trouble to penetrate their meaning. Mr. Chamberlain has been doing a great deal of this sort of talking since the war between the United States and Spain began. And, inasmuch as Lord Salisbury has remained silent, it may be just possible that Mr. Chamberlain knows that he is speaking by the book and is, in consequence, as profuse in his compliments as not a great many years ago he was with his sneers, as directed toward this country. Mr. Chamberlain took for his text, m his recent address, the general subject ] of British interests in Eastern China, and discussed, with much freedom, the relations of the several nations just now Interesting themselves in the se lection of points in the Chinese em pire with a view to the improvement of commerce and the opening of trade in the Orient. The activity of Russia has perhaps been the most vexing in cident of this scheme of partition of China through the acquisition of righjs within certain limits of territory. President McKinley, in his message, called attention to the work that was going on in China, with reference to ! the improvement of the commerce of European countries, and made the rec ommendation that a commission be ap pointed to inquire into all the bearings upon the situation and report upon the best methods to be pursued by the Tnit.-rt States for the promotion of Its rapidly growing business with th» Orient. Mr. Chamberlain's remarks were pa cificatory, both with reference to Rus sia and Germany, but he took occasion to speak almost rhapsodically over the relations existing between England and ' the United States, as an indication of | which h~ pointed to the president's ': pleasing- ailusion, in his recent hies- i sage, to the growth of the friendly sen timent between England and the Unit ed States. Ever since Mr. Chamberlain's utter ance last summer at Birmingham, hinthuv at an alliance between thi;j country and England, the press of London has been almo?t uniform in its praisi s and approval of the United and the Imperial colonial policy upon which the country seems to be entering. Mr. Chamberlain is an adopt In diplomacy and is probably as insincere as any man who ever sat on a mln- j isterial bench in parliament. By em- I phasizlng and reiterating whenever oc casion offers the idea of an Anglo- Ican alliance, it is plain to be seen thai Mr. Chamberlain has acquhed j a considerable knowledge of Uncle J Sam's native game of bluff. He pats the czar and the German emperor upon the back and gives utterance to many honeyed words; but just about that mo ment he winks that other eye, hall concealed behind a monocle, and smiles, while he gently elevates his little American eagle fledgling of Anglo- Saxon alliance. Mr. Chamberlain undoubtedly means to convey the impression to the Euro pean powers, in the carving up of China., that they ought all to get along j together smoothly in the business, but, in the event of any misunderstanding between them, Great Britain will not be long in need of a friend whose In terests in the Pacific are just now ex panding. Mr. Chamberlain is playing a very neat little game," but he ought not to natter himself that it fails altogether of comprehension by those who are possessed of the X-ray qualification of seeing through a diplomatic stone vail. Treaty Ready for Signature. Tho commission representing the United States and Spain to arrange terms for a treaty of peace between the two countries has concluded Its work In Paris, and the document only awaits proper engrossment and signa ture to make the conditions ready for ratification. The sessions of the commission have extended over a period of more than two months. The actual negotiation t.egan Monday, Oct. 3. The progress has been slow, and, at times, some what tedious, but the conclusions ar rived at are practically tho^e which were anticipated when the protocol was arranged at Washington. There ere, of course, many details which aiv not known by the public, but thesa are of immaterial import and over shadowed by the larger propositions involved. It is understood that the treaty now ready for signature omits many points ■which will, at a later day, become sub jects for future negotiations; but their consideration cannot be entered upon until the principal document is rati fied—of which result there is consider able doubt. The representatives of the United Scales government were Cushman K. Davis, United States senator from Min nesota, chairman; Senator William P. Frye, of Maine; Senator George Gray, of Delaware; William R. Day, late sec retary of state, and Whitelaw Reid, of New York. The "Gang" in Control. The municipal court of St. Paul un doubtedly needs to be cleansed and fumigated. Judge Hine shows a laudable desire to have the work done. Judge Orr may perhaps share the de sire, although we have seen nothing to indicate it, nothing, in fact, that might be accepted as a "clincher." The Globe has pointed out certain irregu larities on the part of the court's em ployes which demand attention. Bail money has been sequestrated and mis appropriated. One of the men whom Mayor Kiefer indorsed for a subordi nate position has been caught in the act of extorting money from a poor fellow who was so unfortunate as to have dealings with the municipal court, and compelled to refund. Why wasn't h« dismissed from the public service as being an unworthy servant? Because he is a Republican and helpful to the mayor's political organization? And now comes a further exposure of the irregularity of methods pursued by the court attendants. Judge Hine is the complainant in this case. Tlie judge has the sympathy and will re ceive the support of The Globe in his crusade. But will he accomplish anything? Isn't the political ring whlcn. dominates the city hall too strong to be injured by any Republican, however virtuously inclined he may be? Mayor Kiefer has a duty to per form. Why doesn't he discharge it? The "gang" is in control. There can be no doubt about that. Grain Inspector's Report. Chief Grain Inspector Clausen has submitted his annual report to the rail road and warehouse commission. He says, among other things, that the receipts of winter wheat at the terminal points in Minnesota during the past year wore the largest in tho history of the department and were the most nearly approached, heretofore, in 

ISDO-91. He also stai.es that wheat is received at Minneapolis and Duluth from eight different states, namely, lowa, Nebras ka, Kansas, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Min nesota. The principal recommendation made l»v Mr. Clausen is with reference to a change in the present methods of ap peal. In his judgment all terminal in spection should be decided promptly and at the point where the controversy niginates. To do this would necessi tate the appointment of an appeal com mittee at the terminal points of Minne apolis and Duluth. A dispatch from Jersey says having is dead at Princeton. What? Again? Chicago has a cat show. Chicago sausage factories must be running on half time. Mrs. McKinley is shopping in New York. This will give the merchants of Washington great joy. Haverhill, Maps., has elected as mayor a Socialist grocery clerk. Bos ton will cut Haverhill dead. Michigan and Texas are neck and neck and running easy. Both have had a blizzard during the week. The powder mills of Delaware are now holding peace jubilees. Five of them exploded in a bunch yesterday. Frank Gould was presented with $10, --000,000 on his birthday. Be careful with" your money, Frank. Nobody will ever repeat that act. Financially speaking, the election in Wisconsin went wrong. It ccst Scofieid $697.25 to be elected and Sawyer $!,y47. --80 to be defeated. During the next two years the presi dent can keep one eye on Theolore Roosevelt and • rivet the other to .C'.idhman K. Davis. The next 2'Jlh <,f February that comes around will have to be introduced to itself. The time lapse is fro'in Feb. 29, 1596, to Feb. 29, 1904. The Massachusetts December elec tions show a still further heavy Demo cratic drift. Massachusetts had read the president's message, too. An editor down in Illinois suggests William J. Bryan and John M. Palmer for the next Democratic ticket. That fellow is looking for a "scrap" pure and simple. The New York Journal claims the president's message is only an indorse ment of its pesiticn. Come to think of it, that's quite easy. Will the Journal name a f.-<w subjects it doesn't talk on all sides of in the course of a year? Senator Tillinan is nothing if not emphatic. Speaking of the Spanish treaty, he said: "I am not going to vote away $20,000,000 of the people's money for a lot of niggers, a lot of islands we don't want and a pile of scrap iron." Epistles to St. Paul. l?i;wn In the victnty of Tenth and Wacouta streets there lives a small boy who Inherits some of the argumentative powers of his father, an attorney, and also a portion o£ the father's fendness for tobacco. It co happens that the presiding parent in the family ia blessed with an aversion for the weed, and has a particularly decided manner of express ing her disapproval. F >r Borne time the youth has been in the habit of indulging in furtive smokes around in the barn and in the alley back of tne house, and. having been undetected except as to the odor, he haa become embolde-ned In his evildolng. One day last week the youngster provided himself with a corncob pipe and a dime novel and proceeded to regale himself with both on the rear steps of his home. He was awakened from a dream of life on the Span ish main by noticing a very uncomfortable feeling stealing over him. and, glancing up, was horror-struck to see the presiding parent in question gazing, ?Dee-ehle.ss w'.th anger, at him from above on the .sioop. It was clearly a critical moment, and the boy's trousers tingled in anticipation, but he rallied his nerve and thus addressed his parent: "Say. ma, I know I'm a worthless, disrepu table scapegrace that won't never amount to notl:ir.g and a disgrace to the family, and this dreadful tobacco will stop my growth and I'll grow up a degenerate good-for-noth ing, like pa, and that I'll be ruined and bring your back hair in sorrow to the gray?, r.nd—" Here the boy paused f or breath and glan??d up. to find that his mother had disappeared. She had nothing to say. The occurrence has not since been referred to In the household, hut the youth no tongcr sL%-kes in the vicinity of his home. His escape was too narrow. THE ST. 

PAUL GLOBE SATURDAY -DECEMBER 10, 1833. The President's Message. No Redaction In War Taxen. MoKinley's message Bays nothing of reduc ing the heavy war taxes which fall so heavily upon the people and interfere with the ordi nary round of business. He gives no hope of any immediate modification of the law or re lief from the vexatious impositions which are necessary to collect revenue in this extra ordinary way.—Brooklyn Times. A Dull MesiiaKe. A longer or a duller message has not been sent by the president to the congress since ■we first had presidents aad congresses. The dullness is not in the topics discussed; it is in the discussion. At no time since the ending of the Civil war has there been more stirring event or more commonplace comment.— Philadelphia Record. Disappointing. It is disappointing that the president makes no recommeindation looking to repeal of the war taxes. The continuation of these taxes in their present form can not be defended. The government ought not to be so admin istered in time of peace as to necessitate the continuance of such burdens upon the people. —Buffalo Evening Times. Expenditures and Deficiencies. A noticeable thing about the message is the cheerful style in which the president recommends the flinging of millions right and left and accepts an enormous perma nent increase in expenditures as a matter of course and as an incident of glory to which no one can possibly object. in the president's reference to the report of the secretary of the treasury we read: "It is estimated upon the basis of the present revenue laws that the receipts of the gov ern ment for the year ending June 30, ISS9. will bo $577,874,007 and its expenditures (689,' 574.C47, resulting in a defl?ienny of $112, --000,000. This is tossed off without comment as a matter hardly deserving of parking no tice.—Chicago Chronicle. Keiuarkublc fcur Omissions. The message which President McKinley sent to congress yesterday is most remarkable •in what it omits to say. The absorbing ques tions to be settled by our nation at present are those arl3lng out of the evidences that the president Intends to depart from the traditional policy of the nation, and the as sertions of some who claim to represent him, that the principles on which this cation is founded will also be abjured. The whole na tion has been expecting that the message would state the considerations which have led the president to abandon the old prlnciplo of non-interferc-nce outside of the American continents, and give some statement of how far along the path of imperialism he propose* to go.— Pittsburg Dispatch. McKinley a Follower, Not a Leader. Mr. McKinley is a follower rather than a .C.^cr. T " r:aif '$£ into the somid-rnoiiej ■ ranks. He was led into expansion. If con- | gress will pass a bill to reform the currency he w!ll sign it. But will he do anything to secure Us passage by congress? Only upon one issue has he ever assumed | the attitude of a positive leader. He had i hardly taken his seat before he called con gress in extra session to nass a new tariff bill. And he did this notwithstanding the faot that the tarifE was by no means the I first issue in his campaign; that It was ai- j together subsidiary to the financial issue, on ! which he was elected. When the president i puts iorth one-half the effort to secure financial legislation that he put forth to secure tariff legislation we may feel con fident that his desire for currency reform is at k-ast as strong as the desire of his comp troller of the currency to prevent currency reform.—Louisville Courier-Journal. The Stop "Watch. It must have cost the president severe toil to make it appear that he approved of the war in the beginning when everybody knows that he was utterly opposed to a war with Spain until forty or fifty Republican members of congress "held a stop-watch over him," as Congressman Boutelle said, and gave him forty-eight hours in which to surrender to them. After he bad surrendered to theiu he held the same stop-watch over Spain, and although he had led her government to expect that a fair trial would be giv.an to the plan of Cuban autonomy which had been adopted at our instance, he. changed his''tone suddenly and ordered her to haul down her flag within forty-eig-ht hours. This was done in pursu ance of a resolution of congress which, ha says, "was approved by the executive."— New York Evening; Foai.. , , Churches and Their Work. .The ladies of St. Matthew's church will give their annual sale and supper Friday afternoon and evening ia Central hall. • • • The women in charge of the Christmas ba zar to be held today at Unity church, on.

STATE HAS GAiNED HALF A MILLION STATEMEN OP IXTERBST ON STATE FINDS PREPARED BY TREASURER. Mr. Kcerner Will Sngscst to the Legislature That the State In vestment Hoard Bo Permitted to Put Its Surplus in City Bonds. State Treasurer Koerner yesterday completed a etatismen-t of the money received by the state from Interest on the various funds since 1873. Previous to that time the Investment of the state funds was left to the discretion of the treasurer, who either kept the funds in the state's strong box or Invested them in s^iW mills, grocery stores or most anything that in these days seem ed a promising Investment. The legis lature of the fame year authorized that oftioial to put the surplus cash out at interest In state and national banks throughout the state, whiich has netted the state a very substantial revenue dining the last twenty-five years. Mr. Koerner's gttaftement gives the total amount received by the state from in terest as $444,083.55, The largest amount received durinsr any one year was dur ing 1894, $56,919.72, and the smallest in 1879, $170. During this year it was all the state could do to meet all the appropriations made by the legislature, and 'but an insignificant sum was pla-ced out at in tor -.n. The summary of the amounts is as follows: 1873 $7,024 3911887 $9 420 46 1874 7,245 4415«8 13 209 01 1575 5.73*821889 18,947 59 1876 5,087 62,1890 16,354 07 1877 4,974 391891 2G 407 31 1878 1.96384J189S 82 565 66 1579 ,170 701.393 56,708 31 1880 7,531 821594 56 913 ?■> 18S1 19,872 :4jlS9ii 44.242 04 1882 8,437 23,1896 37 3016'! 1883 3.218 16.1897 31 46f, 98 1884 2,919 9111898 21,505 34 1885 6,475 42! . 1886 6,191951 Total $444,083 65 In many of the states state funds are kept in 'the stale treasurer's vault, ai;d earn nothing from year to year. This is particularly true of some of the newer and more Western states. At present Minnesota has a surplus in the permanent school fund of a quar ter of a million dolia:s for which no in vestment could be found by Mr. Koer n<;r and Auditor Dunn, while in the bond market in New York a few weeks ago. In view of this fact Mr. Koerner has recommended in his reoort, which has just been completed, that a law be passed by the .legislature authorizing the state beard to loan money to cities of a certain class, at the usual 3 per cent Interest, Mr. Koerner regards the bends of Minnesota cifes as gilt-edged, and thinks it will be particularly de sirable and advantageous for the state to place its surplus funds at home, where it is safe and advisable.

NEW YORK, Dec. 9.— R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade will say tomorrow: The most significant thing this week has been the entire absence of the customary nervous fright before and afterthe meeting of congress, the pres ident's message and the treasurer's re port. No one showed the least alarm and nobody could find a reason fur any. Money and stock and grain markets moved on exactly as if the government were automatic, certain to do or say no more than the people had already decided and expected, and so the grad ual betterment since October continues. There is a large demand in nearly all industries; larger export demand for foreign needs; a more healthy domestic demand since seasonable weather ar rived, and a comforting conviction that November business, the biggest ever done in this country in any month, was but a step towards something better. Exports last year in December were marvelous, but this year are starting far ahead. Cotton is sharing in the export movement fully, and has risen three-sixteenths in price, with a feel ing that estimates of yield may have been excessive. At the extremely low price yet quoted, foreign buyers do not stop to calculate commercial and mill stocks on hand. The consumption in this country is not very large, being but little changed by troubles about wages at the South, though by more voluntary curtailment in New England, but the demand for goods is bettei and has lifted the price of print cloths an eighth, and some of the other goods a shade. Woolen goods have been in much better demand, and many of the small er mills have been buying after con cessions secured by the larger. Much broader market is more healthy and promises far more for the industry, and sales of 10,655,200 pounds in two weeks past at the three chief markets, against 10,852,700 pounds in the same weeks of 1892, are quite in line with demand in prosperous years. Prices yielded about half a cent in November, according to one hundred quotations by Coates Bros., and from Philadelphia dispatches appear to be about a cent lower this week. The rupture of the incohate rail com bination, it appears, resulted in lower prices and larger sales in the first week of sharp competition than were real ized a week ago. Prices were made in some transactions much lower than were then or are now quoted, and while $17 at Pittsburg is now named, special orders are said to cause lower figures. The purchase of 50,000 tons Bessemer pig at $10 at Valley furnaces and 100,000 billets for Pittsburg works at $15.50, of which 40,000 tons went to a hoop mill, with 11,000 tons sold at Chicago at $22 and 22,000 tons plates for one concern at Pittsburg, besides enormous orders for bars and plates in car and ship building, a steamship con tract en the Delaware and a contract for 5,000 tons for bridges at Chicago, give some idea of heavy business com ing forward, just when the works us ually expect a season of idleness an<s waiting. Pig iron has risen at the East to $11.50 and quotations average for pig throughout the country a shade higher than at any time this year, though prices for finished products have recently been declining, and are lower than in the early months of the year. This week's failures have been 248 In the United States against 312 last week, and 22 in Canada, against 29 last year. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. Brad street's Report Shows Condi tions Are Generally Favorable. NEW YORK, Dec. 9.—Bradstreefs financial re-view tomorrow will say: "Transactions in both .stocks and bonds this week have been active, and the market shows a broadening tendency. The specula tive undertone has bsen very strong and any I slight depresstooa seem to develop renewed buying power. London shows lncreaaing fa vor for American stocks, and Us purchasing has born sufficiently steady to give material aid to the bull side. The ease of the money market here facilitates buying by the public, although the fact that stocks are being car ried to an unusual extent on call loans does not escape attention. It might bo added that the activity and advances in so niany low priced and hithr-rro inactive stocks increases the proportion of such securities carried on I margin or in loans, but as yet no danger is j apparently apprehended from that score. The i market, at large is impressed only with the j favorable trade situation, the encouraging ' i business outlook, the abundance of capital I | seeking investment and the excellent earnings ! which railroads are generally reporting. Ac j tual and possible dividend payments by rail i road and liidu&trial,*«bmpaiiie3 also play a } part in sustaining the decided bullish feel i ing of the market, and the more prominent operators are generally active on that side of the market, or if they take profits In one part of the trade do so for the advance ment of other stocks. "The meeting of eongross seemed to pro duce little effect, the prevailing idea being that its tin:e would be taken up wich war and colonial questions, minimizing the possi bility of measures bsing considered which might have an unfavorable effect on business ar.rl financial sentiment. The president's mss sa4je was favorably received, and the expected sj-cedy signing of tho treaty of peace with Spain was a factor in causing the very strong tone at the end of the week." 

RETAIL TRADJS At TIVB, Satisfactory Feature of the Busi ness Outlook of tlie Country. NEW YORK, Dec. 9.— Bradstrcct's tomor row will say: Business conditions continue of a most encouraging character. A very satisfactory J feature, and one full of encouragement *.o all wholesale lines of trade, is the activity shown :n retail trndp, in nearly all markets. | Reports received as to tho holiday traile ; proper, too, point to the present year con stituting a record-maker in thi3 reapeet. The Importance of the early arrival of real win ter weather to the retail distribution of heavy clothing and similar seasonable goods can hardly be overestimated. In the wider j domain of general trade and industry per- I haps the most notable feature has been the continued activity and advancing price 3 shown for classes of iron and st3el, but par ticularly pig iron and steel billets. So pro nounced has this demand become einee the placing of the first large orders that what is ordinarily regarded as a dull period in this industry has given place to exceptional ac tivity and the stimulating effect already im parted to values seems likely to be addefl to, rather than diminished, so far as the outlook for the coming year can at pre:;on» be foreshadowed. Features of the week have been Immense 5-rles of Bessemer pig iron; large sales of I steel billets a:>cT heavy orders for ship platr.s, : | the latter- at Western points. Car builders too, have placed extraordinary large ordsrs, ! impelled thereto by the enlarged demand I from railroads, whkh find their present fa cilitities for handling go;ds overtaxed. I Export trade continues encouraging and ; of a favorable nature in this respect is tho I weakening in freights reported towards the ] close of the week. Increased supplies coa srquent on the heaviest movement fr.m farm ers' hands ever known, have constituted a i bepri?h feature in wheat prices this week, notwiths:anding continued heavy shipments abroad, and the coarser grains have sym r-Etbized with th:= important cereal. Activity ] in the lumber trade baa been a feature cal!- I ing ior comment in many markets, the plae i ing of large government order? for yellow i pins lumber, most of which is for export to I Cuba, having insured plenty of work for a I number of Southern mills until far in the | new year. From other branches of trade re j rrrts nre'ot; sustained demand of proportions | sufficient to take care of seasonably small j receipts, and prices reUin nrmneaa. Cotton is again higher, partly owing to smaller esti mates becoming fashionable, this feeling be ing reflected in improved demand at many markets. Wheat, including flour, shipments for the week aggregate 6,758,952 bushels. against 7,483,959 last week; 6,266,159 bushels in the corresponding week of 1897, 4,222,714 bushels In 1896, 2,418 323 bushels In 1895 and 2,536 230 bushels in 1894. Since July 1, this year, tha exports of wheat aggregate 102,967,094 bushels against 114,204,698 bushels last year. Corn exports for the week aggregate 4,388,535 bushels, against 4,623,988 last week, 3.125.554 bushels In this week a year ago, 3.541,288 bushels in 189(5, 2,391,184 bushels in 1895 and 292,277 bushels in 1894. Since July 1, th'.s year, corn exports aggregate 69,026,828 bushels, against 67,251,656 during the same period a year ago. Steadiness of prices has been a notable feature of business this fall, though th* natural drift of values has been to a lower level. Of 107 staples, 49, or a little 1e33 than one-half, are unchanged as a result of the month's work, while 32 staples advanc ed and only 26 declined, while, as compared with Dec. 1 a year ago, 54 staples, or s'.lght ly more than one-half, are higher, 42 are lower and 11 are unchanged. Business failures in the United States this week number 237. as against 212 last year, 292 in this week a year ago, 381 in 1596, 313 in 1895, and 385 in 1894. Business failures in the Dominion of Canada for the v/eek number 29, as compared with 25 last week, 23 In this week a year ago, 42 in 1596, 39 in 1895 and 34 In 1894. 

DEARTH KNEW IT BEFORE HIS CRITICS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CON DEMNED THE HAIL INSURANCE LAW NEARLY A YEAR AGO. His Report Shown That Back In March He Called Attention to the Thins* Which Somie Papers Are Now Commenting On. A few of the state papers are crit icising the administration of Insurance Commissioner Dearth for the way in which he has dealt with certain mutual hail and cyclone insurance companies. They claim that these companies should not have been allowed to ao business. Mr. Dearth said the same thing himself nearly a year ago, or when he prepared h!s annual report way back in March. Mr. Dearth called the attention of the coming legislature to the defects in the law which made him powerless to deal with these hart companies as he should otherwise have done in the Interest of those who rely on them for protection of their crops. Mr. Dearth's report, issued under date of March 1, 1898, calls attention to the defects of the law on page 7, of part 1. He says: "As the statute practically legalizes such a condition of affairs, the commissioner was practically pow erless under the law to refuse such companies a renewal of their licenss. Each and every company was, how ever, arbitrarily required by the com missioner to pass a resolution and file a copy of the same with the depart ment, limiting to a reasonable amount the compensation of officers at a stip ulated salary and prohibiting the pay ment of any officers In addition there to." A little later Mr. Dearth says: The present statute should be very ma terially amended, so as to throw every safe guard about the management of the affairs of this class of companies, thus preventing tha possible repetition of extravagant or ex orbitant expenses in the future. The com panies were also required to pass a further resolution providing that at the next regular annual meeting of the members the provision of the by-laws requiring the members to ac cept their pro iata share of the amount real ized from the assessments levied in any one year as payment in full of their claims should be eliminated so that in the future all com panies which may be unable to pay their claims for losses in full will be treated as in solvent, thus empowering the insurance com missioner to proceed against it, whenever the condition of a company is found to be tusol- I vent. With the by-laws thus amended the farmers, who may become members of these companies, can have the assurance that th^ir losses will be paid in full; otherwise the companies must cease doing business. I C3ii say for the officers cf the majority of the companies that no objection was raised against limitation of salaries and prohibiting the allowance cf commissions in the future, the required resolutions covering this matter being apparently cheerfully passed and copes of same promptly filed with the insurance de partment. There can bo no question but that the pur pose or object of the legislature in placing upon the statute books of this state the law i providing for the organization of mutual hail and cyclone insurance companies was that of effording cur farmers an opportunity to mu tually join together and protect each other at a mere nominal expense against excessive losses, sustained through hail or cyclones to their crops, ard they certainly should not be required or asked to pay assessments cover ing excessive commissions voted certain ofQ cers of the companies by the board of direct ors. It is to be sincerely hoped th^t the statute in question will be so amended a3 to render such transactions in the future legally impossible. Had the present criticism of Insur ance Commissioner Dearth been martn a year ago it might have carried some weight, but as it comes a year, after Mr. Dearth had called attention to how i the commissioner's hands were tied in the matter by the Minnesota statutes, it naturally has little weight and less justice.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE ACT AS IT WAS OUIGIXALLY PASSED BY COXGHESS SOME CHANGES PROPOSED Different Construction of the Mean. ing of HanU Surplus Relief for Commercial Broken Is S«s*e»t ed Lse of Stamps in the Han dling: of Express or Freight . Ile«trlctloaiM on Tobacco. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.—Chairman Dingley, of the ways and means com mittee, Ras received a letter from the commissioner of internal revenue, T. B. Scott, recommending a number of amendments to the act of June, 1898, known as the war revenue act. In paragraph 1, section 2, relative to bankers, it is proposed to insert in the proper place the following: Undivided profits shall be considered as sur plus in estimating the tax due from bauk3, the amount to be estimated by taking the av erage for the proceeding year, provided that the word "capital" shall not be understood to mean money borrowed or received from time to time as deposits, in the usual ccu.se of business, from any person not a partner of, nor interested in the bank, association or firm. Paragraph 4, section 2, relative to ' commercial brokers:" The supreme court held in er;se of Slack vs. Tucker, 23 Wall, 32, that persons who receive into their possession any goods or merchan dise and sell them on commission, cannot be regarded as commercial brokers. This re lieves many persons who would ctherwi. c ba liable. There Is no tax imposed on commis* sion merchants, auctioneers, or real t siata agents or brokers. There seerrs no c:-p <;ia! reason for singling out commercial brokers and requiring a speemial tax from them, especially as the tax falls in the main en a poorer class of people, it is recommended, therefore, that the ux on commercial brok ers be repealed or that other classes of busi ness, such as commission merchants and real estate agents be also required to pay special tax. Add to the paragraph in schedule A, relative to bank checks, the following: Provided that papers in the nature of re ceipts or otherwise usfd as bank check 3or orders for the payment of money shall be taxable as cheeks, except in the case of with drawal of funds from savings banks by a de positor on presentation of big bank book, or else Impose a tax on all receipts. Provided, that any instrument purporting on its face to be a statement of weights or rates of merchandise when cashed as a check or order for the payment of money shall be held liable to stamp tax the same as a check. USE OF STAMPS. Under the head of "express and freight," in schedule A, add the fol lowing: And provided also that no stamped receipts or stamps shall be required for any bain, bundle, box, articlo or package transmits d for the United States government, nor tor any bales, bundles or packages as are tran sported by such companies or persons with out clurgo thereon. . No stamp duty shall be required on any powers of attorneys accompanying a bond or note or pledge or certificate of .stock when such bond or note or pledge or certificate of stock shall have affixed thereto the sramp or stamps denoting the duty required, and when ever any bond or note shall be secured by a mortgiage, out one stamp duty shall bo re quired to be placed on such papers; provided that the stamp duty placed thereon is the highest rate required for such instruments or either of them. Insert, in the proper place a provision that no stamp shall be required on deeds of re lease. Strike out under the head of "contracts" the provision taxing brokers' note or memo randum of sale of goods, merchaudis-\ stocks or bonds, exchange note of hand, real o ate or property, of any kind or description i-u d by brokers or persona actirg as such, 10 cents. If brokers pay the spec-ial tax' re quired that should be deemed sufficient. * That section 3394 of the Revised Stat utes, as amended by acts of congress, be made to read as follows: None of the packages of smoking tobaccs and fine cut chewing tobacco and cigarettes, prescribed by law, shall be permitted to havo packed in or .attached to, or connected w!th thorn any article or thing whatsoever other than the manufacturers' wrappers and la bels, the Internal revenue stamp end the to bacco or cigarettes respectively put up there in, on which tax is required to be paid under the internal revenue laws, nor shall there be affixed thereto, branded, printed or written upon such packages or contents any promise of, or any certificate or order for, any gift, prize, payment or reward. snellinglmprovement.
