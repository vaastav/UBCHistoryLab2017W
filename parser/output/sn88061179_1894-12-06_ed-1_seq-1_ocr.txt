Tho rcHolutlons passed by the senate and house of representatives on the occasion have been communicated to tho widow of President Carnot. Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle, the Ger? man prohibition against importations of live stock and fresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped that Germany will soon become convinced that the inhibition is as needless as it is harmful to mutual inter? ests. The German government has protested i against that provision of the customs tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one tenth of one cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export boun? ty thereon, claiming; the exaction of such duty is in coutravention of articles five and nine of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In the interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so much of the statute as Imposes that duty, and I invite attention to the accompanying re? port of the secretary of state containing a dis | cusslon of the questions raised by the German i protests. I Early in the present year an agreement was j reached with Great Britain concerning instruc I tions to be given to the naval commanders of the two governments in Behring sea and the contiguous North Pacific ocean for their guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed, for the protection of seal life in the waters mentioned. An understanding has also been reached for the payment by the United States of $125.000 in full satisfaction of all Claims which may be made by Great Britain for damages (crowing out of the controversy as to fur seals in Behring sea, or the seizure of British vessels engaged in taking seal in those waters. The award and findings of the Paris tribunal to a great extent deter-, miued the facts and principles upon which i these claims should be adjusted, and they have been subjected by both governments to a! thorough examination upon the principles as j well as the facts which they involve. I am con? vinced that a s-ettlement upon the terms men? tioned would be an equitable and advantageous one and I recommend that provision be made for the prompt, payment of the stated sum. Thus far, only France and Portugal have sig? nified thcivwillingness to adhere to the regu? lations established under tho award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a preparatory examination of the question of protection of food fish in the contiguous waters of the United States and thepDominion of. Canada are in progress.1 Since communicating the voluminous corre? spondence in regard to Hawaii and the action taken by the senate and house of representa? tives on certain questions submitted to tbe judgment and wider discretion of congress the organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen has been announced with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition usual in such cases has been ac? corded the new government. Under our present treaties of extradition with Italy miscarriages of justice have oc? curred owing to the refusual of that govern? ment to surrender its own subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended conven? tion obviating this difficulty have been una vamng. Apart from the war In which tho is'and em- ! pire is engaged, Japan attracts increasing at- ! tention in this country by her evident desire to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and J to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her ' laudable desire for complete autonomy in her : i domestic affairs and full equality in the family : of nations. The Japanese ompiro of to-day is po longer the Japan of the past, and our rela- ! tions with this progressive nation should not I be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. (Jood will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our relations with our ' nearest southern neighbor. Peace being restored along her northern frontier. Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There 1 ought to be a new treaty of commerce and ? navigation with that country "to take the place Of the one terminated thirteen years ago. The j friendliness of the intercourse between the two ; countries is attested by the fact during this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased under the ru'.e of mutual considera? tion, beiug neither stimulated by conventional arrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or seltish distrust. The problem of tfye storage and use of the ' waters of the Rio Grande for irrigation should I be solved by appropriate concurrent action of the two interested countries. Rising in the Colorado heights, the stream hovra intermit? tently, yielding little water during the dry mouths to the irrigating channels already con? structed along its course. This scarcity is often severely felt in the regions where the river forms a common boundary. Moreover, the frequent changes in its course through level sands often raise I embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdic ?on. Prominent among the questions of the year j was the Bluefleids incident, in what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bordering on the Atlantic ocean and within the jurisdiction of [ Nicaragua. By the treaty af W between Great Britain and Nicaragua the former gov uuiment expressly recognized sovereignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self government was guaranteed to the Mos? quito Indians, to be exercised uccording to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers within its limits- The so-called native gox'ernment.which grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereign? ty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically inde? pendent municipal government. Early in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances, culminating in the sup? pression of the native government and the at? tempted subsitution of an impracticable com? posite administration, in which Nicaragua and alien residents were to participate. Failure was followed by an insurrection, which for a time subverted Niearaguan rule, expellinj? her officers and restoring the old organization. This, iu turn, gave place to the existing IxmoA irovernraent established and uphold by Nicar agua. Although th? alien interests arrayed against I Nicaragua in these transactions have been Jargely American, and the commerce of that region for some time has been and still is chiefly controlled by our ctt<zsns. we ean not fdr that reason' challenge the rightful sover? eignty of Nicaragua over this important part of her domain. For some months one. and during part of I the timo two, of our naval shirts hjaxo been sta Honed at Blueflelds iej the prptection of all legitimate Interests ojj p,u,r citizens. In Sep? tember last the government at Managua ex polled from its territory twelve or more foreigners, includiag two Americans, for alleged participation in the seditious or revolutionary movements against the republic at Blueflelds already mentioned; but through the earnest remonstrances of this government the two Americans have been per- ! mitted to return to the peaceful management I of their business. Our naval commanders at | the scene of those disturbances, by their con- | stant exhibition of firmness and good judg- J ment, contributed largely to the prevention of ' more serious consequences and to the restora tion of quiet and order. I regret that In the midst of these occurrences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of Nica ' raguan. justice. An American cit lizen named Wilson, residing at Kama in the Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Arguello, tho acting governor of the town. After some delay the murderer was arrested, but so insecurely confined or guarded that ha escaped, and notwithstanding our repeated du~ zaends it is claimed, t^'fcis 'rea?pture has f?en |mjpssiare by reason of his flight beyond ifcaraguon jurisdiction. ?? The Nicaraguan authorities having given no tice of forfeiture of their concession to the ca nal companv on grounds purely technical and I not embraced in the contract, have receded rpom that position. ? * * . ? * * * * The recent death of the czar of Russia called torth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with; ( hia bereaved family a*4 tho Kuasiaa peopio. - ?-? ^r* As a further demonstration., of respect and friendship our minister at St- Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies. The scaling Interest of Russia in Behring sea are second only to our own. A modus vi? vendi has therefore been concluded with the Imperial government restrictive of poaching "on the Russian rookeries and..of sealing in waters which were not comprehended in the protected-area defined In the Paris award. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian government equality of treatment for our great life insurance companies whose operations have been extended throughout Europe. Admitting, as we do. foreign corpora^, tlons to transact business In the United States, we naturally expect no less tolerance for our own in the ample fields of competition abroad. Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by Spain on the vessels and commerce of the United States have demanded from time to time during the last twenty years earnest re? monstrance upon the part of our government. In the immediate past exorbitant penalties have been imposed upon our vessels and goods by customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors of the most trivial ; character in the manifests or bills of lading, j In some cases fines amounting to thousands of j dollars have been levied upon cargoes or the j carrying vcsscl? when the goods in qucs I tion were entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when the error has been I detected, and the Spanish authorities notified before the arrival of the goods In port. This conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal treatment extended to Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports in like cases. No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious questions has yet been reached. The Mora case, referred to in my last annual message, remains unsettled. From the diplo? matic correspondence on this subject, which has been laid before the senate, it will be seen that this government has offered to conclude a convention with Spain for disposal by arbitra? tion of outstanding' claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim, which, hav? ing been long ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as stipulated. The rules for the prevention of collisions at sea which were framed by the Maritime con-* Terence held in this city In 1889, having been concurrently incorporated in the statutes of i the United States and Great Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1,1895. and invitations have been extended to all maritime nations to adhere to them. Favor? able responses have thus far been received from Austria, France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30,1894, amounted to $372.80 .',493.29. and Its ex ; pendlturcs to $142,605,758.87, leaving a deficit of i f??9.803.2GO.58.

I The balance of the Income for the year.amount ing to 993.815,517.97, was derived from the sales ! of lands and other sources, j The value of our total dutiable imports ; amounted to $275,199,080. being $146,657,625 less '< than during the preceding year, and .the itn ! portations free of duty amounted tol$379J?)5, I 53G. belns $64,748,675 less than during the pre ceding year. The receipts from customs were $73,536,486. 11 less, and from internal revenue 813,830.539.07 less than in 1893 The total tax collected from distilled spirits was J85.25{*,250.25: on manufactured tobacco $28,617,898.62, and on fermented liquors $31,414, 78801. Our exports of merchandise, domestic and foreign, amounted during the year to $892,140, 572, being an increase over the preceding year Of $44,495,378. The total amount of gold exported during the fiscal year was $76,898,061 as against $108,608,444 during the fiscal year 1893. The amount im? ported was $72,449,1 II),as against $21,174,381 dur? ing the previous year. The imports of silver were 813,286,552, and the exports were 850,451,265. The total bounty paid upon the production of sugar in the United States for the fiscal year was $12,100,208.89, being an incrrase of $2,725. 078.01 over the payments made during the pre. i ceding year. The amount of bounty^paid ! from July 1, 1893 to August 28, 1894, ' tho time when further payments ceased by op ? cratlon of law. was J9C6.185.84. The total ex '? penses Incurred in the payment of the bounty 1 upon sugar during the fiscal year was $130, 14U.?O. It 1? estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the receipts of the gov? ernment during the current fiscal year ending June 30,1895, will be $424,427,748.44, and its ex-, penditures $444,427,748.44. resulting in a deficit Of $20,000,000. The first day of November, 1894, the total; stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,240,773,888, as against 2.204.051,000 on the first day of November, 1893, and the money of all kinds in circulation, or not Included in the treasury holdings, was $1,072,093,422, or $24.27 per capita; upon an estimated population of 08.887,000. At the same date there was held in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $44,015,177.55, and sil? ver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $J27,779,98S. The purchase of silver bullion un? der the act of July 14,1890. ceased on the first day of November, 1893, and up to that time there had been purchased during the fiscal year 11,917.658.78 fine ounces at a cost of $8,715,521.32, an average cost of $0.73131 per fine ounce* The total amount of < allver purchased from the time that law took effect until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the last date mentioned, was 108,674,68.'.53 fine ounces, which cost $155, 931,002.25, the average price per fine ounce be? ing $0.9244. The total amount of standard silver dollars coined at the mints of the United States since the passage of the act of February 23,1878, is $421,776,408, of which $3T8,166.?J3 wero coined under the provisions of that act, $38,531,143 un? der the provisions of the act of July 14, 1890, and $5,078,472 under the act providing for the coinage of trade-dollar tjuUioa The total coinage of all metals ?t our mints during the last fiscal year consisted of 63,585.220 j?eces, valued at $106,216,730.06. of which there were $99,474,012.50 in gold coined: $758 in standard silver dollars: $6.024,1 <<>.30 in subsidiary silver cola and $7lG.9bJ ?6 J*a minor coin.

Fifty national banks were organized during the year ending October 31,1894, with a capital of $5,285,0J0. z.i>\ soventy-nine, with a capital of $10,475,000 went into voluntary liquidation. Twenty-one banks, with a capital of $2,770,000 were placed in the hands of receivers. The to? tal number of national banks in existence on the 3J.st day of October last, was 3,756, being forty less than on the Slst day of October, 1893. The capital stock paid in was $672,671,385, being $9,678,491 less than at the same time in the previous year, and the surplus fund and ; undivided profits, less expenses and taxes paid, amounted to $334,121,082.10, which was ?16,089,780 Jess than on October 31, 1893.

Tfre total resources of the banks* at the date mentioned amounted to $3,473,922^55, as against $8,109,503,281.36 in 1593. From the report ot tue secretary of war it appears that the strength of the army on September 30, 1891, was 2,i3> of? ficers and 25,765 enlisted men. ' Al? though this is apparently a very- slight de? crease compared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been increased tjatho equivalent of nearly tTWO reaimenu through Ithe reorganization of the system ot recruiting, and tho conoequent.rele.a30 tOTCgixaentai duty of the large force ot E^|&feB#0 serving at tic recruiting departments. The abolition of these departments, it is predicted.will further? more affect an annual reduction approximat? ing 1250,000 in the direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, moral and dis? cipline of the troops The execution of the policy of concentrating j the army at important centers of popu? lation and transportation, foreshadowed in the last annual report of the^ sec? retary, has resulted in the abandonment of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was ef? fected under a plan which assembles organi? zations of the same regiments hitherto widely separated. This renders our small forces .more readily effective for any service which they may be called upon to perform, Increases the extent of the territory under protection without diminishing the security heretofore afforded to any locality, improves the disci? pline, training and espirit de corps of the army, besides considerably decreasing the cost of Its maintenance. Though the forces of the department of the east have been somewhat increased, more than three-fourths of the army is still stationed west of the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy, which secures the best and greatest service in the interests of the general welfare from the small force comprising our regular army, should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts through acts of congress to gratify the ambt tions or interests of localities. While the maximum legal strength of the army is 25.000 men the effective strength through various causes is but little over 20.000 men. The purpose of congress does not, there? fore, seem to be fully attained by the existing condition- While no considerable increase in the army is in my judgment demanded by recent events the policy of sea coast fortification, in tho pros? ecution of which wo have been steadily en? gaged for some years, has so far developed as to suggest that the effective strength of the army be now made at least equal to the legal I strength. Measures taken by the department I during the year, as indicated, have already considerably augmented the effective force, and the secretary of war presents a plan.whlch I recommend to the consideration of congress, to attain the desired end. Economics effected in the department in other lines of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involved in the proposition sub? mitted. Among other things this contemplates the adoption of the three battalion formation of regiments, which for several years has been indorsed by the secretaries of war and the generals commanding the army. Compact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization, ready to be filled out in the event of war, which is peculiarly adapted to our strength and re? quirements; and the fact that every other na? tion, with a single exception, has adopted this formation to meet the conditions of modern warfare, should alone secure for the recom mendation an early consideration. It is hardly necessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the commands of the constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of protecting. the property of the United States, aiding the process of federal courts and removing lawless obstruc? tions to the performance by the government of its legitimate functions, it becamo necessary in various localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of the regular troops. The duty was discharged promptly, courngc I ously and with marked discretion by the offl I cers and men, and the most gratifying proof j was thus afforded that the army deserves that I complete confidence in its efficiency and dis? cipline which the country has at all times manifested. The skill and Industry of our ordnance offi? cers and Inventors have. It Is believed, over? come the mechanical obstacles which have heretofore delayed the armament ot our coasts, and this great national undertaking upon which we have entered may now proceed as rapidly as congress shall determine. * * * The total enrollment of the militia of the several states Is 117.533 officers and enlisted men, an increase of 5,343 over the number re? ported at the close of the previous year. In recognition of tho long and distinguished military services and faithful discharge of del? icate and responsible civil duties by Maj.-Gen. John M. Schofield, now the general command? ing the army, it is suggested to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieuten? ant-general would be a just and gracious act, and would permit his retirement now near at hand with rank befitting his merits. The report of the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme court Iin overcoming the arrears of its business and in reaching a condition in which it will be able tn rtismnse of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is, or course, very largely due to the successful working of the plan Inaugurating circuit courts of ap? peals. * * * Other important topics are adverted to in the report, accompanied by recommendations, many ot which have been treated at large In previous messages, and at this time, therefore need only be named. I refer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure of compensation to federal officers; the enlargement of the pow? ers of U. S. commissioners, at least in the ter? ritories, the allowance of writs of error in criminal cases on behalf of the United States and the establishment of degrees in the crime of murder. * * * Another subject of pressing moment re? ferred to by the attorney general is the reor? ganization of tho Union Pacific Railroad Co. on a basis equitable as regards all private Inter? ests and as favorable to the government as ex? isting conditions will permit. The operation of a railroad by a court through a receiver Is an nnomalous state of things which should be terminated, on all grounds, public and private, at the earliest possible moment. * * * Eight years ago in my annual message I urged upon the congress as strongly as I could, the location and construction of two prisons for the confinement of United States prisoners. A similar recommendation has been made from time to time since, and a few years ago a law was passed providing for the selection of sites for three such Institutions. No appropriation has, however, been made to carry the act into effect, and the old and discreditable condition still exists. * * ? The report of the postmaster-general pre? sents a comprehensive statement of the opera? tions of the post office department for'the last fiscal year. The receipts of tho department during the year amounted to $75,080,479.04 and the expendi? tures to $81,324,414.15. The transactions of the postal service Indicate with barometric certainty the fluctuations in the business of the coun? try. Inasmneh. therefore, as business complications continued to exist throughout the last year to an unforseen extent it is not surprising that the deficiency of revenue to meet the expenditures of the post office de? partment, which was estimated in advance at about eight million dollars, should be exceed? ed by nearly one and a quarter million dollars. The ascertained revenues, of the last year, which were the basis of calculation for the cur? rent year, being less than estimated, the de? ficiency for the current year will be corre? spondingly greater, though the postmaster general states that the latest indications are so favorable that he confidently predicts an in? crease of at least eight percent, in the revenues of the current year over those of the last year. The expenditures increase steadily and neces? sarily with the growth and needs of the coun? try, so.that the deficiency is greater or less j in any year depending upon the volume of re ; celpts. { The postmaster general states that this de? ficiency is unnecessary and might be obviated at once if the law regulating rates upon mail matter of the second class was modified. The rate received, for the transmission of this sec? ond class, matter is one cent per pound, while the bos% of such transmission to the govern? ment Is eight times that amount. In the gen? eral terms of the law c this rate cov? ers newspapers and periodicals. The ex tentions. of the meaning of these terms from time to time have admitted to the privileges intended for legitimate newspapers and periodicals a surprising range of publica? tions and created abuses, the cost of which amount in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the post office department. Pretended news? papers are started by business houses for the mere purpose of advertising goods, complying with the law inform only, and discontinuing the publication as soon as the period of adver? tising is over. "Sample copies of pretended newspapers are issued in great numbers, for a li&fl purpose only* The res ult is ? zreat Joss of revenue to the government besides its humiliat? ing use as an agency to aid in carrying out the scheme of a business house to advertise its good.-, by mean* ofa trick upon both its- rival houses and the regular and leitftim-te news? papers. Paper covered literature, consisting mainly of trashy novels, to the extcut of many thousands of tons, is sent through the mails at one ceut per pound, while the publishers of standard works are required to pay eight times that amount, in sending their publications. * * * The total number of po^t offices in the Uuitod States on the 30tb day of June. lttM was 

GU.SU3. an increase of 1.403 over the preceding year. Of those 3.4S8 were presidential, an increase in that class of sixty-eight over the preceding l year. j Six hundred and ten eitles and towns are j provided with free delivery. Ninety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the law have not been accorded it on ac? count of insufficient funds. * * * The report shows most gratifying results in the way of economies worked out without af? fecting the efficiency of tho postal service. These consist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy contracts, rclettingo!; ma.I transporta? tion contracts and in the cost and amount of supplies used in the service, amountiug in all to $10,619,047.42. The report also contains a valuable contri? bution to the history of the Universal Postal Union, an arrangement which amounts prac? tically to the establishment of one postal sys? tem for the entire civilized world. * * * The postmaster general renews the sugges? tion made in a previous report that the de? partment organization be increased to the ex? tent of .creating a direct district supervision of all postal affairs, and in this suggestion I fully concur. Attention is called to the report of the secre? tary of the navy, which shows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our j new navy. All the vessels now building, in? cluding the three torpedo boats authorized at the last session of congress and excepting the first-class battle-ship Iowa, will probably be completed during the coming fiscal year. The estimates for the increase of the navy for the year ending Juno 30. ItfttiJ, are large, but they include practically the entire sum neces? sary to complete and equip all the new ships not now In commission, so that unless new ships are authorized the appropriations fori the naval service for the fiscal year end? ing June 30, 180". should fail below the esti? mates for the coming year by at least$12,000,000. The secretary presentM with much earnest? ness a plea for the authorization of three ad? ditional battle ships and ten or twelve topedo boats. While the unarmored vessels hereto? fore authorized, including those now nearing completion, will constitute a fleet, which it is believed is sufficient for ordinary cruising pur? pose in time of peace. * * * * I recommend that provision be made for the construction of additional battle ships and tor pcdo boats. The .secretary recommends the manufacture not only of a reserve supply of ordnance and ordnance material for ships of the navy, but also a supply for the auxiliary fleet. Guns and their appurtenances should be provided and kept on hand for both these purposes. We have not to-day a single gun that could be put upon the ships Paris or New York of the In? ternational Navigation Co. or any other ship of our reserve navy. * * * The war now In progress between China and Japan has rendered it necessary or expedient to dispatch eitrbt vessels to those waters. Both the secretary of the navy and the secre? tary of tho treasury recommend the trans? fer of the work of the coast sur? vey proper to the navy department. I heartily concur In tills recommendation. Ex? cluding Alaska and a very small area besides, j all the work of mapping and charting our | coasts has been completed. [ It is within the domain of civil service re? form inasmuch ns workmen are employed through a board of labor selected at each navy yard and are triven work without reference to politics and in the order of their application, preferences, however, beinjr given to army and navy veterans and those having former navy yard experience. The report of tho secretary of the interior exhibits the situation of the numerous and Interesting branches of the public service con? nected with his dej>artment. I commend this report and the valuable recommendations of tho secretary to the careful attention of the congress. The president fully indorses the recommen? dation of the secretary that adequate protec? tion be provided for our forest reserves and that a comprehensive forestry system be in augurateu. Tho intelligent Indian school management of the p3.st year has been followed by gratify? ing results. Efforts have been made to ad? vance the work in o sound and practical man? ner. Fivo Institutes of Indian teachers hnvo been held during the year, and have proved very beneficial through the views exchanged and methods discussed particularly applica? ble to Indian education. At the clone of the last fiscal year.ou the 30th day of June, 180-1, there were 969,544 persons on our pension rolls, being a net Increase of 3,532 over the number as reported at the end of tho previous year. ! These pensioners may be classified as fol i lows: Soldiers and sailors, survivors of all I wars, 753,968; widows and relatives of deceased soldiers, 215,162; army nurses in the war of the rebellion, 414. Of these pensioners, 32,039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to the late civil war, and the widows or relatives of such soldiers. The remainder, numbering 937,505 are receiv? ing pensions on account of the war oi the re? bellion, and of these 469,344 are on the rolls un? der authority of the act of June 27,1890, some? times called the dependent pension law. The total amount expended for pensions during the year was $139.804,461.05, leaving an unexpended balance from the sum appropriated of $25,205, 712.65. The sum necessary to meet pension ex? penditures for the year ending Juno 30,1896, is estimated at $140,000,000. ? ? * The barefaced and extensive pension frauds exposed under the direction of tho courageous and generous veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau leave no room for the claim that no purgation of our pension rolls was needed, or that continued vigilance and prompt action are not necessary to the same end. The accu? sation that an effort to detect pensions frauds ta AtHdence of unfriendliness toward our wor thy veterans and a denial of their claims to the generosity of our government, suggests an unfortunate indifference to the commission of any offense which has for its motive the secur? ing of a pension,ami indicates a willingness to be blind to the existence of mean and treacherous crimes which play upon demagogic fears and make sport of the patriotic impulse of a grate? ful people. The completion of the eleventh census is now in charge of the commissioner of labor. The total disbursement on account of the work for the fiscal year ending- June 30.1894. amounted to 110,365.676.81. At the close of the year the number of persons employed in the census of? fice was C79. At present there are about 400. The whole number of volumes necessary to comprehend the eleventh census will be twen? ty-five, and they will contain 22,270 printed pages. The secretary of agriculture in his report re? views the operations oi! his department for the last fiscal year, and makes recommendations for the further extention of its usefulness. He reports a saving in expenditures during the year of $600,000, which is covered baek Into the treasury. This sum is 23 per cent, of the entire appropriation. * * * The amount appropriated for the weather bureau was 1031.100. Of that sum $138,!00, or 14 per cent., has been saved and is returned to the treasury. As illustrating the usefulness of this service, it may be here stated that the warnings which were very generally given of two tropical storms occurring in September and October of the present year resulted in detaining safely in port, 2,205 vessels, valued at S38.283.913, laden with cargoes of probably still greater value. What is much more important and gratify? ing, many human lives on these ship* were also undoubtedly saved. The appropriation to the bureau of animal industry was 1850,009, and the expenditures for the year were only $4S$, 429.24. thus leaving unexpended $354,570.76. The sanitary inspection of cattle shipped to Europe has cost an average of loji cents for each animal, and the cost of inspecting south? ern cattle and the disinfection of cars and stock-yards averages 2.7 cents per animal The scientific iBQuiries ot the bureau of ani mal Industry have progressed steadily during the year. Much tuberculin and mallefnhav< been furnished to ?t?te authorities for useli the agricultural colleges and experiment sta? tions for the treatment of tuberculosis ano ! glanders. Owing to the beeuliar fealty of the stati cian's work, and the natural and acquired fit? ness naccssary to its successful prosecution the secretary of agriculture expresses the opinion that every person employed in gather* ing statistics under the chief of that divts.OQ should be admitted to that service only after a thorough, exhaustive, and successful exam!* . nation at the hands of the United States elvi] service commission. This has led him to call for such examination of candidates for tb? position of assistant statiseians. and ?lso of candidates for chiefs of sections in that di vision. Tbc advantages to the public service of ?) adherence to the principles of civil service re? form arc constantly more apparent; and noth? ing is so encouraging to those in official life who honestly desire good government is the increasing appreciation by our people of these advantages. A vast majority of the voters oi the land are ready to insist that the time and attention of those they select to perform foi these important public duties, should not be distracted by doling out minor offices, and tfcej are growing to be unanimous in regarding party organization as something that should be used in establishing party principles instead of dlctiating the distribution of public place? as rewards of partisan activity. The president is convinced that we oughl not to be longer without a national board ot health, the national health officer charged with no other duties than such as pertain to the protection of our country from the invasion of pestilence and disease, and earnestly recom? mends legislation to that end. By virtue of a statute of the United States, passed in 188:), j appointed in July last Hob. John D. Kernan. of the state of New York, and Hon. Nicholas K. Worthington, oi the state of Illinois, to form with Hon. Carroll ?. Wright, commissioner of labor, wh< was designated by said statute a commission for the purpose of making careful inquiry int<? the causes of the controversies between cer? tain railroads and their employes which had resulted in an extensive and destructive strike, accompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance with considerable loss of life and great destruction of property. The report of the commissioners bos been submitted to me and will be transmitted to the congress with the evidence taken upon the? investigation. Tho tariff act passed at tho last session ol the congress needs important amendments it it Is to bo executed effectively and withcer? tainty. In addition to such necessary amend* ments as will not change rutes of duty. I am still very decidedly In favor of putting coal and Iron upon the free list. So fur as the sugar schedule is concerned, I would be glad, under existing aggravations tc see every particle of differential duty in favoi of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the favor so accorded the sugar re? fining Interest in our tariff laws It still lan? guishes to the extent of closed refineries and tncusands of discharged workmen, it would seem zu present1* hopeless case for rcasonabU legislative air.. .., Whatever else is donecr omitted. Iearnestlj repeat here the recommendatiors I have mad* in another portion of this communication that tho additional duty of one-tenth of a cent pel pound, laid upon sugar Imported from coun? tries paying a bounty on its export, be abro gated. The president then recounts the necessity of Issuing bonds to replete the gold reserve, und says: Nothing could be worse or further re moved from sensible finance than the relation* existing between the currency tho government has issued, the gold hold for its redemption, and the means which must bo rosorted tc for the purpose of replenishing such redemp? tion fund when Impaired. Even if the claim* upon this fund were confined to the obliga? tions originally intended, and if tho redemp? tion of these obligations meant their cancel* lation, the fund would be very small. liut these obligations, when received and redeemed in gold, are not canceled but are re-issued and may do duty many tlrnos by way of drawing gold from the treasury. Thus we have an end* less chain in operation constantly depleting the treasury's gold and never near a final rent As if this was not bad cnongh, we 'have by a statutory dclclaratiou thai i* 1? the policy of tho govemmonf to maintain tho parity between gold and silver, aided the force and momentum of this exhaust* Ing process and added largely to the currencj obligations claiming this peculiar gold rcdemp* tion. Our small geld reserve Is thus subject t< drain from every side. The demands that in* crease our danger also increase the necessity ot protecting this reserve ugainst depletion and it is most unsatisfactory to know that the pro* tection afforded Is only a temporary palliation It is pefectly and pupabiy plain that the onlj way under present conditions by whicfc this reserve when dangerously depleted can be replenished is through* thf issue and sale of tho bonds of the gov? ernment for gold: and yet congress has not only thus far declined to authorize the issue ol bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there seems a disposition in some quarters to denj both the necessity and power for the issue ol bonds at all. I can not for a moment believe that any of our citizens are deliberately willing that thelt government should default in its pecuniary obligations or that its financial operations should be reduced to a silver basis. At any rate I should not feel that my duty was done if I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a calamity. As long, there* fore, as no provision Is roado for the final redemption or the putting aside of the currency obligation now used to repeatedly and constantly draw from the government It* gold and as long us no better authority foi bond issues is allowed than at present exists such authority will bo utilized whenever and as often as it becomes necessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve and in abundant time to save the credit of our country and make good the financial declarations of our govern* ment. Questions relating to our banks and currency are. closely connected with the subject just reforred to and they also pre* sent some unsatisfactory features. Prominent among them are the lack of elas? ticity in our currency circulation and its fro* quent concentration in financial centers whea it is most needed in other parts of the country. The absolute divorcement of the government from the business of banking is the ideal rcla tionshipof the government to the circulation of the currency of the country. This condition can not be immediately reached; but as a step in that direction and as a means of securing i more elastic currency and obviating other ob? jections to the present arrangement of bank circulation, the secretary of the treasury pre? sents in his report a scheme modifying present banking laws and providing for the issue oi circulating notes by state banks free from tax? ation under certain limitations. It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for the deposit of United States bonds as security for circulation; to permit national banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding in amounnt seventy-five per cent of their paid up and unimpaired capital, provided the*? deposit with tho government, as a guarantee fund, in United States legal tender notes. In? cluding treasury notes of 1800, a sum equal la amount to thirty per cent, of the notes they j desire to issue, this deposit to be maintained] j at all times, but when ever any bunk retires ' any part of its circulation a proportional part of its guarantee fund shall be returned " to it: to permit the secretary of the treasury to prepare and keep on hand ready .for issue irj case an increase in circulation is desired, blank national bank notes for each bank hav? ing circulation, and to repeal the provisions ?f the present law imposing limitations and) re? strictions upon banks desiring to reduce or in* crease their circulation, thus permitting such increase or redaction within the limit of sev? enty-fivo per cent, of capital to be quickly made as emergencies arise. * ? * I conclude this communication fully appre? ciating that the responsibility for all legisla? tion affecting the people of the United State? ' rests upon their representative.-* In the con? gress und assuring them that whether in ac? cordance with recommendations I have made or not I shall be glad to co-operate in 'wrfect ing any U-gfsIatioa that tends to the prosperity and welfare of our eou atry.
