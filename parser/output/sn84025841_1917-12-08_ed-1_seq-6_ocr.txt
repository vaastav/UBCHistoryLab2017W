' ? t Colored folks, who support colored enterprises are supporting themselv vu . I ^ack of money will put a woman out of humor quicker than anything else. The Holy Bible is a great consola tion, when you fail in your efforts or face a great calamity. Colored folks are getting together again. The while folks eoem to he get. ting apart. Worry puts as nfany peoplo into a J grave-yard as diseases and some peo plo believe that it does even more than this. President Wilson cannot Maine the peoplo of this country, cither white or black should his efforts fail, for both are patriotically supporting him. He polite colored folks and obliging to whito folks ami to your own peo ple. 11* anything, be too polite. U is far bettor than not being polite enough . The feeling of antipathy to colored folks is disappearing in all parts of the country and tlio feeling of dis trust of whito people on the part of the colored people is vanlnhing in the same way. We need a Chamber of Cotmmerce among tho colored folks. A way can he found to get valuable information from tho Chamber of Commerce among white people. When you see a man going down the hill, it is not wise to throw brick bats at him to make him go faster. It Ls not right to treat a woman in the same way. i Poor folks, who have been cailling for help have stopped doing so, they are looking at the National Govern ment, which is doing the same thing. Th"o Russian boar lias gone into its' ?hole and it is busily engaged in pull-} ing t-ho hole in after it. The opin-j ion of the Entente Allies is imprint.-' able. I Colored folks have always 1 allied to the support of the United States Government . The trouble has been that the United States Government, has not always rallied to colored folks. When a civilized people burn a hu man being at a stake, they show plain ly that they have degenerated t.o a level below that of the victim that they execute. ; A writer has found out that it costs the State five hundred dollars to electrocute a person, ?whose/-* body is not worth ten dollars and whoso room in the world is not worth ten conts. Save your money. It will pay you so to do. Good times always immedi ately follow the end of a war and for the most part, accompany it even amidst much suffering unless tho country at war Is being invaded by hostile armloa. Some people see two years more of war ami for our part at the pres ent cost. aggregating nearly one hun dred thousand dollars per minute for all parties to the contest, we cannot ligure more than two mouths of the same kind of slaughter. 'I'lu- Richmond City School Hoard i* doing a 1'. in its power for the ad vancement of the school population in this neighborhood and is winning the cordial approval of all right-think ing citizens. We road about' Col. 10. M. House and he seems to occupy the same rel ative position to the Wilson admin istration that the lute lamented Mark llanna occupied towards the RlcKin I ley administration. The only differ ence seems to he that there is no "barrel" in sight, but Uncle Sam's i "barrel." 1 Uncle Sam's government is hiding the legs of its men with long over coats and Dame Fashion is exposing the same extremities of her women ! with short skirts. It seems that the part that should be exposed to view is being hidden and that part that i should be hidden is exposed to view. i A few months ago thousands of poo i pie hereabouts were after liquor. Now thousands of these same people are ' after sugar. This is the way of the I world. Just let a person know or I think they cannot have a thing and that is the very thing that the per son will almost die to have. The following telegraphic dispatch explains itself: Washington, December ? The ex ecution of Private Frank Cadue, of the infantry, for the assault and mur der of a seven year old French girl, in France on November 5, has. been approved by the \Var Department. Cadue was hanged, after sentence by a military court martial instead of being shot, as had previously been said. The record of the trial says I ho confessed to the crime and plead ed that being under the influence of liquor, ho did not know what he was doing . In reviewing the case, llio War De partmcnt considers thai military tlaw has been complied with in every re spect. Caduo's was the first case of its kind to occur in the American Army abroad. Suffice it to say tlm't Private Frank Cauue was a white man and not a Negro. PRlCvSIDIONT WHaSON'S 

RECOM MENDATION. President Woodrow Wilson deliv ered a message to the Congress that has astounded tho people of this coun try. lie recommended that the Con gress of tho United States declare that a state of war exi.sts with Austria, (ho principal ally of (Germany. As Germany went to war on account of and in defense of Austria, the situa tion is anomalous. This is not a formal declaration ot wax , hut niero \ ly the statement that a sta?.o of war exists. It remains for Austria to de clare war on tho United States. It is also an interesting fact that Germany lias never declared war on tiie United States. This accounts for the fact that Ger man submarines have not made their appearance on this side of tho Atlan tic to destroy American shipping. Ger many will no doubt figure up a hugo bill against tho United Sa'es for lend in? assistance to her enemies. As the United States of America lias dccldcd that Germany will be defeat ed, it is a question as to what V.md of indemnity, if any the government hero will demand of the Gorman Em piro and its allies. For our part, it seems to us that tho attitudo of this government with reference to Austria was the dircct result of the recent allied conference at Paris, France. It was done to hear1 en the Italian government that now faces destruc tion at the hands of the Austrian and German armies. If the Italians can lie induced to hold out until the United States can get its troops in Franco, a different story may be told upon the battlefields of Europe. It is general ly conceded that Germany cannot be defeated 011 I lie field of battle. Siie can only lie subdued by exhaustion. It i? one of the marvels of the cen tury that she is still In tho contest as a fighting factor. Tho conquest of Hon man la gave her a new lease of lifei provisioning her efommisifarilis J and giving her needed supples in 1 practically all branches of her indus tries. Then came the collapse of Russia, which relieved tho tension in the East and sent hundreds of thousands of seasoned troops to overwhelm the Italians in South-eastern Europe and to swamp tho British in the West in Flanders. Germany lias been given a lease of life, variously estimated to bo from one to two years. Tho al most incxhaustiblo resources of this country are now being drafted. If the war is not ended soon, ilio rein ? forcoments will make victory for Ger That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments, and any citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right. -Bill of Rights of Vir ginia, Article I, Section 12, That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws by any authority, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised -Bill of Rights of Virginia, Article I, Section 7. many impossible. The indications., [however. are thai a peacofui war will : be maintained after (he fighting one has heen ended. I It is intended to form an alliance of nations ami make the German Um pire a commercial pariah. What could not bo accomplished by tho sword will bo brought about by peace able means. President Wilson makes reference to this method of warfare. I As it is, France is practically out of ] of t lie lighting as she lias exhausted her manpower and has drawn gen erously upon the colored folks of her dependencies anj in America to help her stem the German military llood. As it is regarded as treason to t'alk peace, nearly every one is taT.king war, although secretly they long for the silencing of the heavy cannonade that has .been shaking Europe for three years or more. Men may havj their personal opinions, but all are standing patri otically behind the Statesman in the White House, and tho solons in Con gress. Criticisms will come no doubt after the war, but at present, silence reigns, Old Glory lloats and the peo ple of tho country hope for the best as Ja result of the declaration of war against Aufelrljtt. Tho "political sur geons are at work on tho patient. Let the relatives keep quiet until tho operation is over.
