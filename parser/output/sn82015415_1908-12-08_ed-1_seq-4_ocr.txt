HENSHALL MANAGER TUESDAY DECEMBER 8, 1908 LOCAL RECORDS BROKEN, AND HOW. The Star this morning far eclipsed all local records, and probably was beaten in no other place anything like the distance of Honolulu from Washington, in the publication of the President's message. This was done with the aid of the wonderful news gathering organization of the Associated Press, with a special cable service ordered by The Star to place the message on the streets here at the earliest possible moment. Congress met at noon today, at which time it was about seven o'clock in the morning in Honolulu. The Star had ar ranged yesterday for a special service, knowing tlic interest taken In this last message of the great retiring President, and especially in what he might have to say regarding Hawaii. At 7:43 this morning the cable came to The Star announcing that the message had gone to Con gress. In two minutes The Star presses were going and newsboys were on the streets with a four page sage. Such an extra is a striking example both of the development of journalism, of the wonders of telegraphy and of the extreme democ racy, the intent to get close to the istration. The text of President Roosevelt's message to Congress was communicated to The Star, under ington nearly a month ago. True President wanted his message, nominally addressed to Congress, to get to the I'liOPLE everywhere where the American flag flies, as quickly as possible, and in furtherance of this purpose he entrusted advance copies to the Associated ber. All over America, as in The nals awaited the same magic cable or telegraph sparks, to tell them that the matter was public. The Star is probably further from Washington than any other paper that succeeded in getting so early a release, 11 gave tne public the message more ington hour of the delivery of the The message is on the whole a the present crisis in American internal affairs. There are portion of the document that will be dry reading to many. But the American citizen who wants to be well informed .and able intelligently to con sider his country's affairs, owes it to himself to read the President's, words. 

ROOSEVELT President Roosevelt recommends both a ship subsidy and an amend ment of the coastwise laws, the latter for the benefit of Hawaii. The recommendation of a subsidy is found in the President's advice' that the Ocean Mail act of 1891 be extended, possibly the President purpose ly avoided use of the term subsidy, realizing that subsidies arc very much objected to by many Americans, There can be no doubt that as far as the matter of tourists is con cerned, Hawaii would be a great gainer if both these recommendations are carried. The subsidy so nearly carried before, and there have been so many signs since the adjournment of Congress that it has gained i'i' favor, that much confidence in its passing is justified. The President puts the matter strongly: "I urge that the Congress act promptly where foresight already knows that action sooner or later will be . in evitable." This simply means that action is absolutely necessary to save the American merchant marine. The President repeats, in another, form, his old declaration in favor of developing Hawaii on "traditional American lines." He wants European immigrants and such changes in the land laws as may be advisable to aid diversified industries. Perhaps the most important matter as far as the diversified industries are concerned, is the question of tariffs, and this the President lets alone. The land matter we arc in position to handle for ourselves, if Congress will let us, but we arc helpless except to agitate, regarding tariffs to protect our products from the competition of foreign tropical countries. Roosevelt has left the tariff alone intentionally, probably regarding it as a subject for the next Congress. In the matter of harbor improvements and naval and military work here, Roosevelt goes even further than before. He wants good har bors on every island in the group, and wants the great naval station at -Pearl Harbor, which will be able to defend itself from attack by sea, protected by military forts and garrisons so strong that it would oq folly for a foe to attack them. In an article yesterday reference was made to a New York Sun editorial as having been reprinted in this paper. It happens that the reprint in question has been delayed in appearance and will be found in this issue The fact that there is nothing about the tariff in President Rpose vclt's message to Congress indicates a special session of the new Con gress, to take the matter up. THE 

MYSTERY The last San Francisco newspapers to reach here contain the ao counts of the death of Police Chief pare them. As forecasted here, the Call, supporter of the graft prose cution, hints at something different from the suicide or drowning theory. The phrase "disappearance from the patrol boat and probable death by drowning" occurs in its accounts of the affair, though the paper was published only about three hours after the first news regard ing the matter reached San Francisco. The Examiner and Chronicle, both of which have long attacked such hints.

SENATE WILL W1AKEJHE TARIFF BILL (Special Correspondence to The Star.) WASHINGTON, D. C, November 15. The size of the Republican ma jority in the next House of Representatives is such as to practically insure the re-election of Speaker Cannon. This means that the tariff bill that will be drawn by the committee on Ways and Means, and will subsequently be rail roaded through the House in true Cannon fashion, will be far from satis factory to the country at large, and decidedly unsatisfactory to those Repub licans who truly believe in an honest revision of the Diugley schedules. The re-election of Cannon as Speaker means the reappointment of Repre sentative Payne of Now York as chairman of the committee on Ways and Means, with Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania as ranking members the Committee. Payne and' Dalzell practically run that committee, and they will of course run it iu a way that will meet the approval of Speaker Can non. But one vacancy exists in the Republican membership, due to the retirement of Representative Watson, who made an unsuccessful race for the governorship of Indiana, and the man appointed to the vacancy will be one whose tariff views coincide with the views of Mr. Cannon. Moreove'r, the Republican membership of the committee, as a whole, is not in sympathy vflth the demand for tariff revision, and the cuts made in the committee, bill -will not be of such a nature as to meet the popular demand. Once the Ways and Means committee reports its bill, a special rule will be, brought in which, in all probability will deny the House the right to amend the measure (this being the Cannon method of passing all important legislation which would be amended if submitted to the House on its merits) and the bill, after comparatively brief discussion, will bo passed, and sent to the Senate, where It will be entrusted to the tender mercies of the Finance Committee, of which Senator Aldrlch is chairman. The first real consider ation given the tariff bill will be that accorded It In the Senate, where the right of debate is unlimited, and where every' Senator has the right to talk to his heart's cotnent. Not that debate is going to influence the bill, particularly, but that it will afford the true revisionists an opportunity to point out the unjust provisions of the measure, and to offer amendments in accord with their respective views. Moreover, every amendment offered In the Senate must be voted upon, if the Senator proposing it insists upon a vote. The Senate, unlike the Hou se, is never compelled to accept any measure as reported by a committee. Hence, the report of the Aldrlch com mittee is bound to be more or less amended by the Senate, at the close of (what wf'i certainly be a prolonged discussion. , In the end the trfriff bill, what ever Its provisions, will follow very largely the lines' laid down by the S enate; it may bear very scant resem blance to the bill framed by the Payne committee In the House. Neverthe less, with a more favorable Ways and Means committee, there would be bet ter prospect of honest revision than there will be under prevailing condi tions. For instance, Representative Dalzell, who Is really the dominating figure on the Ways and Means committee,, is admittedly the representative of the Steel Trust and of the Pennsylvania coal barons. He was sent tp Con gress solely to protect their interests, and what more natural than that Dal zell should exercise his great power to so shape the original tariff bill as to offer no affront to the steel trust or the coal trust. And Dalzell is just big enough to force that committee to do his bidding In regard to the steel and coal schedules. Chairman Payne will back Dalzell In this particular, for Payne Is subservient to Dalzell, though ranking him on the committee. Dalzell will win out because ho will be able to coerce less influential mem? bers into supporting his views; he will threaten to modify other schedules affecting ' their respective states, unless they come to time on the steel and coal schedules. And those members, for the most part, cleverly chosen by Speaker Cannon, are just weak enough to bow down to Dalzell. This scheme will work, becnuse there are 12 Republicans on the committee, and only 7 Democrats, and In the next House the Democratic membership will not be increased; if anything it will -a curtailed, or else the Republican membership will be Increased. Therefore, It is true that the tariff law to be enacted at the special ses sion or uongress, wiiicn will assemble Senate. It will, in all likelihood, go cause Payne is chairman of the Ways and Means committee, and as such will Introduce the measure In the House. And yet Payne will not recog nize his child whon It conies back from the Senato, for final acceptance by the House. The present tariff law took Dingley's name because Represen tative Diugley. at the time of Its enactment, waH chairman of Ways and Means committee. For the same reason the two previous tariff laws were known as the McKInley law. and the Wilson law, respectively. 

WOMEN SEAFARERS. t er sex In order to carry out the every Emerson once rather pithily put It (lay atlea of Rfinfnrn- Tn fwinn. that with the wind always In tho southwest, iu other words, were the weather invariably agreeable and all clear lor running as .Jack says, wo - men might quite easily become sail- ora. Instances are on record, how- over, ot womon who have mado a name on board ship as sailors iu all sorts and conditions of weather. On tho wholo It may be asserted, without foar of competent contradiction, that tho guiltier sox are decidedly out of place, on a topsail yard, for example, and the now exceptions merely go to provo tho rule. Even tho few women who liavo uttnlnod to an unenviable notoriety under this lioad woro com pulled to adopt tho uui'b of tho stern. next March, will be made in the down In history as the Payne bill, be the woman sailor finds Jin attractive niche, and perhaps tho most laugh able of the longshore yarns In connec , tlou with women sailors Is that from n,0 j,e 0f W. W. Jacobs under tho title of "The Bully of tho Cavendish." Tills vessei nf um-niiac wni ,ie0n-wntPr s.iliin.r Hi,i nf h, ni.i typo which had among her orew n young ordinary seaman, nnd also a bully, who, on a previous voyngo, had ruled tho forecuBtlo to his heart's con tont.

Towards the close of the passage this phenomenal green hand was discov ered to be a woman, and, more cu rious still, the wife of the bucko. W. W. Jacobs has never been a sailor, but he can write a nautical short story far better than many men who have. Anne Bonney and Mary Read are not infrequently quoted as examples ot the woman sailor. Yet very much of the information concerning them Is ot a legendary character, and would not stand the test of legal analysis. They were not only women sailors, but also women pirates. Bonney was the daughter of a Carolina planter, and having clandestinely married a sailor named Rackham, then in command of a piratical craft, she assumed a manly garb In order to escape her parents' watchfulness and take part in her husband's exploits, which would have been impossible in petticoats with such a crowd of cut-throats. Mary Read is said to have been brought up as a boy; she served In various ca pacities ashore and afloat, and even tually married a man at whose side she had fought as a soldier In the war. As further illustrating this point of giving sea-going officers complete con trol, It is a matter of history and offi cial record that during Grant's first term his Secretary of the Navy, Borie, for a time turned the actual admin istration over to Admiral Porter. Ad miral POrter was a sallor'in the strict etymological sense of the term, In that he believed there was nothing like sails As soon as he was In authority- he caused the four-bladed propellers of the vessels to be removed and repldced by two-bladed ones In order that the ships might maneuver better under sail. The inefficiency thereby brought about is, of course, apparent to any engineer, as the size of the propeller opening was fixed and" l3 two-bladed screw could not be made large enough. A few years later, In a report to the department, he actually claimed that the vessels were faster under steam with the mutilated screws. The facts, of course, were just the reverse, and when his Influence became less, proper propellers were again fitted. This was when he was still in his prime, and his judgment was, at least, not Impaired by age. About twenty years later, when the Roach cruisers were being built, the dear old man, then over 70, went before the Naval Committee and said that the plans of these vessels were wrong, because they had only I auxiliary sail power. In his judgment ythey should have been given full sail wiiii BitHiiu us an auxiliary. Ho was still a sailor. Tho world had not moved for him. Engineering Mag azine.
