WHY A 

SPANISH FIRSi 60T THE CONTRACT i Ship Owners were Too Grasplmg It was tho Difference Between SU.SOO, OOO and 513,000 that Decided la Favor of tho Spanish Company Col. Wheeles Would TLtko to Meet Was. K Byasw Washington, Dec 10. The trans portation to Spain by the United States of the Spanish prisoners sur rendered at Santiago was taken up by the war investigation commission and Col. Hecker, who made the con tract for the United States, was re called to testify on this point. He said there had been a combine oi New York ship concerns which would have caused an outlay of $1, 400,000, while the actual outlay made was $513,000. The lowest bid was from a Philadelphia junk dealer, who, however, had no visible means of exe cuting the contract, and admitted his own doubt as to getting sufficient bond. This Philadelphian, Col. Hecker testified, protested against not being awarded the contract on the ground that he had "a chance to make some money out of it." The most feasible bidder was the Spanish Transatlantic Co. Their bid, unlike the others, relieved the govern ment of all medical, attendance and, finally, on the government's repre sentations, the company agreed to re duce its figures about $180,000. "What induced the government to send those people to Spain?" was asked. "Don't know. The terms of sur render provided for it." Col. Hecker read a long statement signed by one William E. Ryan, de tailing the alleged methods of the transportation bureau in connection with the attempted sale of certain ships to the government. Col. Hecker said he did not know Ryan. Several members of the commission said they would be glad to summon Ryan' if he could be found.' Asked if he was ever approached by Abner McKinley relative to the pur chase of ships. Col. Hecker replied: "Never but once. He spoke to me once about a water barge for which there was no use at the time, and I so informed him. I never had any other communication from him, either di rectly or indirectly." "What part did the firm of which Abner McKinley is a member play in the sale of ships?" asked ex-Gov. Woodbury. "None at all as to the army," re plied Col. Hecker. "I do not know as to the navy." THE SITUATION IN CHINA. Ex-Mlnlster Barrett to 81am Says the Pres ent Situation In China Is of tho Most Critical Nature. Shanghai, Dec. 10. John Barrett, formerly United States minister to Siam, has returned here after visiting Pekin and the principal Chinese ports. He says the situation in China is of the most critical nature, and that Man churia is no longer Chinese, but Rus sian territory. He asserts that New Chwang, the chief northern port for the movement of American products, is also practically Russian, and is lia ble to close any day. The only per manent safeguard to the paramount American and British interests, Mr. Barrett says, is immediate and united action by the interested governments to defend the territory of the Chinese empire; to enforce reforms in the gov ernment; to prevent further cessions of ports and provinces, and to insist upon the "open door" policy in all prots of China, including the spheres of influence claimed by Russia, Ger many and France. Otherwise, Mr. Barrett contends, the impending par tition of the Chinese empire will se riously curtail the field of trade by disastrously affecting American and British influence in Asia. THEY WERE COMRADES. Interesting Facts Belatlng to lieutenants Shlpp and Smith, Who were Killed at San Juan Hill. Washington, Dec. 10. Some inter esting history is attached to two bills recently introduced in the house by Mr. Underwood for Gen. WTieeler. The bills are to grant pensions to Mrs. Margaret B. Shipp, widow of Lieut. Wm. E. Shipp, who was killed at the battle of San Juan hill, and of Mrs. Louisa D. Smith, widow of Lieut. Wm. H. Smith, who was killed at the same place. There was a remarkable simi larity in the history of those two sol diers. They studied together at West Point, graduated together, and after leaving the academy both rose to the rank of lieutenant. They met their deaths in the same battle within 15 minutes of each other and, finally, the bills to pension their wives were in troduced in congress simultaneously.

The ex tremists of the Cuban republican party seem anxious to assume the re sponsibility for the outrage at the Spanish club Wednesday evening, when Juan Castillo, a former Cuban officer, accompanied by two negro subordi nates, rode into the club rooms, and with their machetes smashed several lamps and did other damage. El Povenir, the organ of this fac tion, claims that the act of Castillo "represents the feeling of a long out raged, but now sovereign people." Vice-President Barbarossa, of the San Carlos club, has asserted that if Castillo had not been promptly re leased from custody 10,000 Cubans would have known the reason why. But such expressions must not be taken as representing the views of the best Cuban element, which is really very strongly in favor of annexation. Gen. Wood's strong hand is much missed here, and his return, which is expected early to-day, will be doubly welcome.. Yesterday Col. Beacon had before him Lieut. Cranshaw, of the Third immune regiment, who repeated a conversation he had had with Capt. Bickham, of the Ninth immunes, which throws considerable light on the recent drunken affray of negro sol diers at San Luis, and goes to show that the affair was premeditated, and that the officers were more guilty than the men. Chief-of-Gendarmeries Valiente has now ready 1,300 men from whom Gen. Wood will choose a sufficient number to constitute the force of gendarmerie which he proposes establishing. Most of them, Chief Valiente says, were good soldiers during the war, but many have since been virtually ban dits, out of sheerhunger, as they could not get rations because they were armed and refused to disband. He be lieves that they would make efficient gendarmeries. The lawers are prepar ing a statement to be laid before Gen. Wood, asking him to repeal his recent regulation regarding the foreclosure of small mortgages, claiming that it makes a big difference in their fees. CABLEGRAM FROM DEWEY. Favorable Report of Affairs in the Philip pines Particularly Gratifying to the American Government. Washington, Dec 9. The navy de partment has received a telegram from Admiral Dewey summarizing the ex isting conditions at Manila and such points in the Philippines as have been visited by his officers. Advices also have been received from Gen. Otis, the commander of the United States mili tary forces in the island, and they both go to show a notable improvement in conditions and the growth of a better spirit among those factions of the na tives which promised to give trouble. This fact is particularly gratifying as the United States government is al ready giving consideration to the best means at hand to redeem the pledge it will be placed under by the treaty of Paris, to secure the release of the Spanish prisoners held by the Philip pine natives. There are about 500 clerical prisoners, and the government is confident that their captors will de liver them up upon proper representa tions from Gen. Otis and Admiral Dewey, made, possibly, through Con sul Wildman. It may be necessary to call the navy into service in this mat ter for the reason that some of the prisoners are held in captivity on oth er islands than Luzon, which can be reached best and most effectively by Admiral Dewey's ships. Besides these clerical prisoners, the Americans themselves hold nearly 15, 000 Spanish soldiers as prisoners, men captured at the fall of Manila. These are actually on parole about the city, and the question is how are they to be returned to Spain.' This must be settled by the peace commissioners in Paris. SUPERSENSITIVE SPAIN. The Nation of Brutal Record Restive Un der the Charge of Blowing Up the Maine. Madrid, Dec. 10. The Imparcial publishes another inflammatory article on the subject of the Maine charges. The paper intimates that the explo sion was the outcome of an intense de sire "upon the part of certain factions in the United States to see the out break of war. which was unnonular with the majority of Americans." lhe Imparcial adds: "The partisans of the war realized that something startling was neces sary to arouse national sentiment it was a remarkable chance. .Almost all the Maine's officers were on board an other ship at the time of the catas trophe. Those who charge the Span iards with beinc capable of such a monstrous act are well capable of com mitting it themselves." In conclusion the Imparcial says: "Spain can not remain under such an infamous charge. It would be pre ferable to give the world the spectacle Df national suicide." FIVE POWDER MILLS BLEW UP.
