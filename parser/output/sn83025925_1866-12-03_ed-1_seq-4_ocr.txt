MONDAY, DECEMBER 8, 18C0. The President's Message. Tub President opens with a recognition of Congress as "the Congress of the United States." De alludes to the abatement of the pcstiiVnce which has visited some parts of . our country; says that peace, order, tran ; qulllity, and civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the United States ; that in all the states tbe civil authority is maintained by tbe people thereof; that the r enforcement of the laws is do longer ob structed ; and that the animosities engendered by the war are rapidly passing away. lie then alludes to the measures of "restora tion" In the insurrectionary States instituted by the Executive, as set forth in his Message ot December 4, 1805. Having progressed thus . far, the Executive had nearly exhausted his constitutional authority in the promises, and Jt only remained for Congress to complete the work by the admission of Senators and Re presentatives from the rettored States. The President then proceeds to argue at length the question of tha admission of ' loyal" Senators and Representatives from thesa States. Ten States are unre presented; the seats of fifty members of the Ilouse of Representatives and twenty Senators are Tacant. Their admission would have done much to renew our relations as a people, and to remove causes of discontent on the part of those States ; it would have ac corded with the principle that taxation and representation should go hand-in-hand; it would have fulfilled those provisions of the Constitution designed to secure to the people of every State the right of representation in Congress. The assumption that the existence of the States was terminated by the rebellion of their inhabitants, is said to be incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and with the avowed objects of the war. The func tions of the States were not destroyed, but merely suspended, by the Rebellion. He again urges the admission of "loyal" Senators and Representatives, recapitulating the argu ments there'or. Disloyal applicants may be returned to their constituents without ad mission. II, in the exact condition of these btates at the present time, it is lawful to ex clude them from representation, he does not see bow the question will be altered by the efflux of time. Tbe President next drops a word oi caution in regard to infractions of the Constitution and the dangers of consolidation, quoting from Washington, Jefferson, and Jackson. This closes his remarks upon the great politi cal topic of the times. 7 here is no allusion to the Constitutional amendment, none to amnesty or suffrage, none to the New Orleans massacre, none to the late elections. His tone Is perfectly respectful towards Congress and in every way unexceptionable. ..The remainder of the Message is taken up with embodiment of the facts contained in tbe reports of the various Secretaries, and with comments thereon. .' He reoices at the exhibit of the condition of our financial affairs made by the Secretary oi the Treasury, urges economy in expendi tures, and a reduction of taxation, and says that the who'e national debt can be paid off in the next twenty-five years. He commends the condition of the army and navy, and urges early action upon the bill accepting League Island for naval pur poses. The postal service is in good condition, although there is a ' decrease of revenue in that department of one and one-fifth per cent, and an increase of expenditure of twelve per cent., over last year. The beneficial workings of the Homestead law are commented on, and the necessity of more stringent safeguards in respect to lands granted for railroad purposes is sug gested. ' JTlie progress of the Pacific Railroad is most gratifying, and gives promise of its com pletion within the time prescribed by Con gress. Such legislation as may be necessary for tbe preservation of the Mississippi levees is recommended ; also, for the removal of ob structions to the navigation of that great river. He recommends the passage of a law allow ing the people of the District of Columbia to elect A Delegate to Congress, with the same rights and privillges as are now accorded to Delegates from the Territories. The tone of the Message with regard to France is decidedly suggestive. The Em peror, it seems, not long since, determined to postpone the removal of the , November Contingent of French troops, as he had agreed with this country, with the avowed purpose of recalling them in a body in the spring. Although this determination was not ofll cially communicated to our Government, it at once took notice of It, and expressed its dissent therefrom.' The President hopes that France will re consider the subject, and adopt some resolu tion in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus meet ' the just expectations of the United States. It Is believed that, .with the evacuation of jyetlcobythe expeditionary forcw, no sub ject for serious differences between France and the United States would remain. lh expressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship between the twe countries might, tn that case, be renewed and permanently restored. General Sherman's mission to Mexico Is aid to be to obtain suah information as may be important to determine the course of the United Mates in re-establishing and main taining proper Intercourse with the republic of Mexico. With regard to Great Britain, the Presi dent regrets that no considerable advance has been made towards a settlement of the differences between the two countries grow ing out of the depredations upon our com merce, and other trespa-ses of British subjects, during our late war. He excuses the delay, however,on aesount of the domestic condition of Great Britain, but adds that whatever might be the wishes of the two Governments, it is manifest that good-will and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity, in the practice of good faith and neutrality, shall be restore i between the respective nations. '1 ho, Fenian invasion of Canada Is alluded to, and In regard to the convicted prisoners now incarcerated there, the President says that, fully believing in the maxim of govern ment, that severity of civil punishment for misguided persons who have engaged in re volutionary attempts which have disastrously tailed, is unsound and unwise, such represen tations have been made to the British Govern ment in behalf of the convicted persons, as, being sustained by an enlightened and humane Judgment, will, it is hoped, induce in their cases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty to all who were engaged in the move ment. He adds that he has regarded the ex pedition as not only political In its nature, but as a'so in a great measure foreign from the United States in its causes, character, and objects ; and that, as long as the neutrality laws remain upon our statute-books, they should be faithfully executed, and If they operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively, Congress alone can apply the remedy, by their modification or repeal." With regard to the right of self-expatriation, the President sajs that, as "peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, the present seems to be a favorable time tor an assertion by Congress of the principle, so long main tained by the Executive Department, that naturalization by one State fully exempts the native-born subject of any other State from the performance of military service under any foreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits." The President closes by saying that "our Government is now undergoing its moit try ing ordeal, and his earnest prayer is, that the peril maybe successfully and. finally passed without impairing its original strength and symmetry. The interests of the nation are best to be promoted by the revival of frater nal relations, the complete obliteration of our past differences, and the reinauguratlon of all the pursuits of peace. Directing our efiorts to the early accomplishment of these great ends, let us endeavor to preserve har mony between the co-ordinate departments of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing the maintenance of the Constitution, the preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity of our free institutions. The Message is well written, and while we cannot coincide with the President's views upon the subject of reconstruction, we are gratified with the moderation with which he seta them forth, and with the respectful tone which he maintains towards the "co-ordinate branches of the Government." The Woik before Congress. At noon to-day the gavel of Speaker Col fax called the House of Representatives to order, and the second session of the Thirty ninth Congress commenced. It is in no spirit of exaggeration that we say that the duties devolving on that body are the most vitally important of any that have ever come belore our National Legislature. The whole land has been ploughed up by the war, the old ordtr of things has been overturned, and eighteen months of peace have utterly failed to arrange a new foundation. It is for this session to rectify the mistakes of tbe pasti and provide lor enlightened progress in the future. It would be well if, in its efforts to improve, it avoid the rocks on which the good intenti ons of so many of its piede cessors have been wrecked. ' . y The most obvious advice which the North ern people give to their Representatives, and on the adoption of which rests all the hope of successful and efficient action, is to avoid speech-making. The past few months have afforded every man who had a speech pre pared on any subject, an ample opportunity to "get it off" as many times as his ambition desired. All the ground of political argu ments have been gone over again and again, and no set speech will tend to throw any more light on any subject. Remember ing the adage, that' "Speech is silver, silence U gold," let us return to a gold basis as soon as possible, j , , , : , ; ; ; Having adopted this cardinal principle, a fair opportunity will be allowed for calm and dispassionate argument, and the preparation of such measures as the public welfare de mands. It requires no spur to prick the sides of those Intent to avenge political treachery, and remove from office all those who have purchased pUce at the sacrifice of pilncL pie. That sich is the evident determination, tbe fixed purpose of , the Congress , of the nation, we ore perfectly assured. So, also, in regard to the lawi properly applicable to that arge territory which . one was composed of the Southern Rebel States. Con gress will, without doubt, make all needful regulations for tbe government of that sec tion, and take such steps as will, indeed, make treason odious, lhat issue has been settled by tie Northern people, and will be executed by their Rcpreaentatlves. While, therefore, these important questions will, we doubt not, be well attended to, we have grave tears lest the excitement of this political work will so far distract attention as to cause them to lose slrht of yet more im portant issues, which do not properly fall under the head of politics. We refer to the questions of finance and tariff. If there is an instrument which must be handled most delicately, that instrument is the circulating medium of a country. Any violent measure, whether for good or ill, will at once produce a bad effect. Gradual and careful change must be made where anything Is wanting, and deliberation and financial skill must guide all who seek to control tha woild of commerce. Until the report of the Secretary of the Treasury Is made public, we forbear to recommcnJ such mea euies as we feel are necessary to the national welfare. We wi I, however, lay down but a cardinal doctrine on which we are to move. CoLtract gradually, fund immediately, and protect American Industry. The Insinuations thrown out by Mr. David A. Wells, lead us to distrust him and every bill which is framed by his sanction. He is willing to sacrifice Pennsylvania in order to aid New England. Wo direct the especial attention or our dole pation to his measures, and feel suro that by timely watchlulness we can defeat any such combination. But we do most earnestly hope that the short time allowed for action will not be frittered away in speech-making, or so engrossed with other things as to lead to the neglect of our most important interests. Although the present is the short session, there is no need of any hasty legislation. The assembling of the Fortieth Congress on the 4th of March will insure proper delibera tion on all important questions. The power is in the hand of the Republican party. All of the glory of successful administration, and all of the responsibility of heedless legislation, will rest on them. If, through neglect, they allow the nation to be injured, they will be held strictly accountable. Let them so act that the people say, "Well done, good and faithful servants; the confidence we have reposed in you, and the interests we placed in your hands, you have guarded most sacredly." Report of the Secretary of War. Tuk report of Hon. Kdwin M. Stanton, which we publish elsewhere, deals rather in statis tics than opinions, but the figures given speak in language unmistakable of the energy with which the War Department has been con ducted, and the wonderful spirit and resources of our nation. A people who can furnish on demand an army of a million and a half of men are indeed great, but still gieater is the nation that can within a year receive back into its ranks of subjects an army of that size, and yet feel none of the tumults which have alwajs attended the disbandment of a military force. The rapid increase of our martial force when needed is only equalled by the rapidity with which it was diminished when the emergency was passed. When the war terminated, on May 1, 1806. we had a force of 1,034,C64 men. On the 1st of Novem ber, 1866, the number stood 11,042. Within eighteen months more than a million soldiers had become citizens, and yet no derangement of our civil polity was felt. That country may well be proud of her sons who, while invincible in war, can as easily adapt them selves to the requirements of peace. At present our total military force counts up 11,000 volunteers and 54,000 regulars a grand total of 65,000 soldiers, where but two years ago 1,200,000 weie employed.' . ; In reference to the arms used in our service, the Secretary appointed a commission, who, after three months' investigation, have secured a weapon which we are assured is "better in all respects than tbe Prussian needle-gun, while its metallic ammunition is regarded as superior to the latter." This piece of infor mation, together with the assurance that our fortifications are much strengthened, and that, although disbanded, an army of 1,000,000 men could be collected together at once if needed (an assertion made twice in the Re port), will do more to keep peace with for eiirn powers than any of the cringing com promises favored by tbe Secretary of State. The Secretaiy assares us that the Freed men's Bureau is working energetically to educate the freedmen, and now 150,000 chil dren attend its schools. On application of the States, rations have been, and will be, dealt out to paupers. The estimates needed by the War Depart ment tor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1803, is $25,205,600, while the Freedinen's Buieau asks $3,830,300 as Its share. Such is the substance of the boty of the Report, while the voluminous documents which accompany it give details, none or which aUract much attention, except the Re port of the General-in-Chief. Rhxigioub Pkogbess. The Southern Presbyterian General Assembly, lately in ses sion at Memphis, after a long and interesting debate on the relations of the freedmen to the Church, finally decided, by a unanimous vote, that they should be received into full fellowabip in the Church, and on equal grounds, as brothers in Christ. Such a deci sion would have been impossible during the days of slavery. The idea of Christian fel lowship with a valuable piece of property that you were about to sell on the auction block to the highest bidder was simply absurd. THE

It is not expeotod, nor is it perhaps desirable, that tbe same rate of rcduotiou should be continued. A considerable diminution of taxes was effected by the aincudmi nts of tbe Internal revenue law, at tbe last session of Congrets A lurtaer diminution of inter Lai taxes, and a modification of the tariff, which will doubtless lead to a reduction of customs duties on many articles, will bo required, in order that produc tion may be increased and new life intUBed into cer tain blanches ot inaustry that are now languishing untiei tbe burdens which have been Imposed upon them. .. . . - But, alter the proper and necessary reductions shall have been mado, the rovonues will doubtless bo sufliciour, if I be Government shall be economi cally administered, to pay tbe ourrent expeases, the nileiest on the publio debt, and reduce the prinolpal at tbe rate of from lour to five millions per month In oider that this may be oone however, thore must bo no additional-donationsto railroads, no payments but in ibe fulfilment ot comraots, and no unneces sary ex pcndituie of money lor auy purpose what ever. With proper economy io all the departments of the Government, tbe del t can be paid by tbe peiieratu n that created i, if wise and equal reveuue laws shall be enacted and continued by Congress and there laws are iaithiu ly enloroed by the officers charged with ibeir execntlun. 1 bat it is the will ot the people thai it should be paid, and not perpetuated, Is clearly indioated by tbo lavor with whio'j its rapid reduotiou during- tbe pust year has been rerardod. Tbe idea that a national debt can be anything e'se than a burden in which there are some compensations, but still a burden, a mortgage upon the propeitv and mdustiy ol tbe poop e s lor uuateiv not aa Amorican idea. In countries in which tne publie expenditures are so heavy, or the resources are so small tnat no reduo tiou of lher publio debts is practicable, ana where national securities fcocorue monopo Ized capital la the bands of moneyed aristooracles, who not only absorb the means, but give direotion totuesenli. ment of tbo peoplo, public dobta may be regarded as pubilo blessings; but no such fal aoy will ever be countenanced by tbe free and inteliigen pjopla ot the Cniitd States. , . " v Mothine in our history has orealed so much sur prise, both at borne and abroad, as tbe reduction of our national debt, jne wonder excited by tbe rapidity with which It was cieated l greatly ex ceeded by tbe admiration of the resolution of the tax-paveta themaolves that it shall be speedily ex tinguished. The oocytotion Is becoming fastened upon the popular tuiud that It is Important tot eA6b6rn InlbO na'lonal OspArtSAs. Mr tot mainte nance of a tiae democracy in tbe administration of the Government, lor the cause ot good mora s and of rubllo virtue that tba policy ot a stead r aanaal reduction ol the dvbtshou d be definitely and inexe. rvbly established. Nothing short ol this, and that economy in tbe national ex penditu tea which Will renoer It p aciirabio, will rtoonoile tbe people to Uie bnroens ol taxation. A national debt most ever be a severe strain ipo repnbl.oan institutions, ana oars should not Oo sub. Jcct t It one cay longer than la neoe-sarv.
