SATURDAY DEC. 10. 18U8. No. nt; il was not a race war in tho Carolinas, it was race massacre. It is absolutely essential that -should do all in our pojwag, const with right to retain the good-wii? of our white friends. at ie sisiefnt Colored men should reid and pay tor journals devoted t* thvir racial in? terests. A bli id man can see the Ne? cessity for this now. Let the Negro-haters howl. Let them abu.se and persecute u?. Let them legislate and malign us. We will not yield one *j it ar tittle" of our rights, and will light all along the line. Wa mun not forget that g >oi man? ners will aid us much at this time Lat us be polite, but not servile. This tis a dark night, but the streaks of dawn axe -lready observable. Tbs Baptist Congress held at Lynch? burg, November 30th was a success. Virginia .Seminary was endorsed and the work of r*rof. G, VV. Hayes recog? nized. This wan the right move. Let the people o! the state* rally to the capp, rt of this grand institution. It seems th nt tne League of Ameri? can Wheelmen is going tu pieces. This is the in JjMlintlnsj which discriminat? ed against cyclists of African descent. The new organization,?the Amer - can Rttrlni Cyclists Union has thrown ?wide its iio >rs, and no one is barred therefro.ii un account of race, color, n lilies or religion. A td thus the good work goes on I Bi-n jp W. J. Gaines of the A. M. E. Ccur.h made a caustic attack upou Bishop H. M. Torver in the last issue of toa Philadelphia, Pa, Christian Rb corokr, the official organ of the Church. He charges that able divine with having exceeded his authority in the Appointment of a vicar-bishop in South Africa. It is expected that much con? troversy will result, and that the ques tiors raised will form the basis for radical action at the next meeting of the biennial conference of that body Bishop Turiibr is yet to be heard from. A boars of military examiners wat convened and re- orted adversely on ana case of Capt. Uubbbt A. W. Mb* kui (colored) of the Third North Car? olina Volunteers. Infantry. He wai. discharged from the service Dec. 3d, 189**. with one month's pay and allow? ances. This shows that the officers of tne Sixth Virginia Regiment were not at mil io error, when they presumed that they would be treated in like mannei by the men who were to paps upon their capabilities. District Attornxt Bbbvabd hat been instructed by the Department ol Justice at Washington to proceed Against those white men at Wilming ton, H. C., who foreed United Statei Comm issioaev Buatzk* te letYf) thsj ity, and hs has complied with that astruction. Indictments will no doubt be found against thtm and the trial of the ac :usei parties proceeded with. This louotry ha* not been making laws for >ne hundred years for nothing. There ue plenty of laws. All that is lacking is some one to enforce them. Send the guilty scoundrels to the penitentiary, and let us have peace. And now they are after Hon. H. A Rocker, Collector of Internal Reve nue at Atlanta. He is a citizen of col? or, and is charged by Mrs. Barbour with being responsible for the suicide of her husband. It seems that Barb vb (white) wa} appointed janitor and was putout at the instigation of Mr. Rocker. He took his own life. The last information we received from that neighborhood was to the ef f-ct that no white clerk would work under a Negro collector, and now we have the fact presented that this one killed himself because he was not per? mitted to work as a menial under one. Strange world this, and strange things these Mr. Rn kkk has asked to be relieved as custodian of the custom housr, so that his cfllcial d'ti bi could have no bearing on the investigation which he has demanded The latest information from the re? gion of the anarchists Bays that two c >lort d m?n, named Hern and Riob? ard* in were tried by a mob orderly disorderly people, Dec 6th, and after i a trial of several he ure in which the ! accused wt re not permitted to send for [witnesses or to raise the ne *esst.ry funds to employ proper counsel, they i were fousd guilty ard sentenced to 'death upon ths r*har^e of killing Lak ?-.*? VA**Ct (white). The victims wera at once taken to . limbs of trees about half a mile ncrt'.i I of the town. The reporter assures the I public at the conclusion of the des? patch that the disorderly mb was 'very orderly, and that the murders . were p-omptly committed, The colored men protested their in ! nocer.ee to the last, asked no favor* I and di-, d gtme. There will vet be a reckonirg day for all of these fiendish crimes. A change must take place ere long an 1 the guilty will yet be punished for their nefarious crimes. Lyoch-law must go! TELL IT ALL. A Mr. R. L Berkeley, of Morgan? town, VV. Va., in a communication to the New York Eyemno Post tells of an incident, where an oil colored man. Robert Hamilton by name, was rob? bed of $000 by a white man. who gave him a note for it as security for the loan of the amount cited. In his misery, he said he longed for hi* old master, whom he knew would befriend him and see that he got his money. Hamilton had a right tu do this. The old, aristocratic slaveown? ers, when they liked a colored man would go to any reasonable extent to kid and defend him. This feeling has extended even to thia day and forms thu bond of union between certain element* of the white and colored people of the South today, lt is not the old ex-elave-owners who stab, shoot and kill colored people in the Sooth to day. lt is Ita lawless, shiftless, irresponsible white elements who are guilty of these crimes, and many a white man has risked his life in an effort to save a faithful servant oran old ex-slave from their fury. Mr. Bkrklev told thu truth, ho stated one bide of the question. Now, let him deal with the howling, con? scienceless devils who despoil virtue, butcher children, cripple youngsters, and murder fathers. Tell this side of it, please, and you will get a faint idea why some sections, of the South are equal to hell, and the inhabitants thereof akin to the devil himself. THE SIXTH VIRGINIA. The Sixth Virginia Regiment is as yet under {arrest at Macon, Ga. It is reported that the court-martial decid? ed that some of those engaged in the recent disturbance should be confined to the camp,and others required to per? form hard labor for the period of thir? ty days. It might as well be understood now that this regiment is composed of the flower of our citizeu soldiery. The men come from the best families in Virginia and are thoroughly patriotic and independent. They volunteered with the undei standing that they would be commanded by officers of their own race. The violation of this compact has caused all of the the trouble. It is the sam** old story. Ceriaio white men, out of a Job wish the best paying posi? tions and have entered into a conspira? cy to secure them. The virtual dism ssal of the nine col? ored ollijers was a part of tue plan which was miscarried, lt was though'. that the colored troops would t%sjsi yield, but the men cone-ried hue found out that they have an entir.ii different kind of a colored brother ta deal with, and that hu is as per al at emt in his demands as he is uevrmiucJ. Litutenant-Oolonel Caoxroa? is the cause of all the trouble. Ths Sixth Virginia Regiment must Ja? t as a unit It will not do for it to give one -nen, ot to accept any compromise whatever. If the government is unwilling to keep to its part ot the agreement, let il mus? ter Ike reg mont ou?. THE FOST'8 ADVICE. I? The Washington. D. C..Post in its ?sue of Dec. 1st. under the caption of Compulsory Political Action," while lot so intending, gave good advioe to he colored folks as well as the white mes. It said: "We should probably have better j*overnm??nt in this country if allciti sens who are entitled to the ballot were careful to attend the primary Bleetio**8of their respective parties, and, after having performed that duty, would go to the polls and discharge th? higher duty of making their votes effective in the choice of public ser? vants. It ouiht to be esteemed a duty as well as a privilege to take at least such part in polities as is included in the intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage. The citizen who neglects to do this does not discharge his obliga? tion* to society, no matter how much time and energy he may expend in grumbling over the evils he finds in politics and government." It gave its reasons for this position in the following language: "The worst phase of abstention is that it robs the verdict of the ballot box of an infiuerce that ought to be good, and thus enhances the power nf any element that is not desirable. In other words, the intelligent, educated, rt-flned and responsible citizens are far more apt th sn the course, ignorant and irresponsible to narlee*; their po'.i tical dutks. In every large city there are thousand* of "tha best citizens'' who seldom or never take any p ri in Kctl politics. In Presidential yesYs mont of these men manage to work up sufficient inteiest to vote. But in the ch"ice of those officials whot>e duti> s affect their interests most directly and seriously thny show no concern what? ever. Municipal corruption owes more ti the indifference of rttptciability Utah to any other cause " There is no need for further com? ment. The language quoted applies to all citizens, and weare at a loss to understand upon what ground, the theorists and latter day philosophers, can base their recommendation that the citizen of color decline to perform one of the most solemn political duties ever enjoined by the Constitution and the laws. We egree with the Post, every citi? zen should exercise or make an at? tempt to exercise the elective fran? chise, THAT PB03PE0TIVE LTKOHIHG. According to the North and South Carolina policy, it is in order, i.ot only to t\ ile the correspondent of the\ As? sociated Press at Parkersburg, W. Vis,, but to treat in a similar manner the\ publishers of the Journals, who per? mitted the publication of the items. The Washington P ter of the 1st inst, contained the following: "Parkersburg, W. Va., Nov. 30.? Circulars were secretly circulated throughout the city last night calling fora meeting of masked citizens la bc held at midnight to-night to ditcuss the advisability of lynching Wade Grant a Negro, now in jail awaiting trial for felonious assault upon Mr*. Barry, ?*?ho has fully identified him, and George A. Melat, a white man, sent to jail yesterday to await trial on the charge of like assault on Liura Shat? ter, a five-year-old chid, who tills a straight story of the crime. At 10 o'clock quite a crowd had gath? ered at the county road bridge, the rei.di 2yo is designa'-ed in the circulars. There was no leader, however, and no action was then taken." And again: Judge Jackson, of the Criminal Court appeared at the ]\il at 10:30 and at once assumed charge of affairs, di? recting the Sheriff and officers from the Sheriff's office. The cause of the gathering of tho mob was a rumor that some white women admirers of Wade Grant, the Negro, who assaulted Mrs. Barry, had aOuut completed arrange? ments to secure his release on bond. Judge Jackson stated that no appli? cation had been made for bind fur Grant, and that the report was un? true." It says further: "At 12:25 a crowd of over 500 men, mostly white, started for the jail, and in ten minutes toe point was reached. The mob broke open a blacksmith shop and looted it of every thing which could be of us^ in effecting an entrance. When the leader reached the door the first moo to appear was Sherjff Wade, wno appealed to the crowd to disperse. His officers were heavily armed and their appearance seemed to quiet the who gathering.The t Ulcers dr.ive those entered back to the btreet, and Judge Jackson made a speech, which was cheered. He was repeatedly asked if justice* would meted out to men, and if ne would prevent white women Rend? ing bouquets and dainties to the Ne? groes. He assured them that he would, and that the full extent of tne law would be given the culprits if found guilty. The angry crowd lin? gered about the jail till 1:05 when an? other attempt was made to effect an entrance. Again they were dispersed and at 1:30 but few remained." This ia an extract from a white journ? al, and Editor Alexander Manley is in no way connected with its staff. What have the Negro-haters to say to this? Why bo silent, brethren? Speak hp,?speak up loudly 1 THE SUiFBAGE QUSSTI0H. Wa confess that we have lost all faith in the editorial utterances of the Richmond, Va. Thies. It had publish? ed platitudes upon the necessity for an honest ballot, and declarations in favor of great principles and, we were under the impression that it could stand the test. lt bad denounced the policy of the Richmond, Va., Dispatch, whieh j< urnal at that ti ase was known Ko be uncompromisingly against the "broth? er in black," and known to be in favor of the denial to him of all of his rights and privileges as a citizen. Bat when the first opportunity esme for it to exhibit Its eou.age it ignomi? niously retreated at thc first fire and jomwd hands soon thereafter with thc ?t r memy. It aided ?d abetted the mar-\? lera at Wi lining td, N. C. It justified the reasonable action of k. M. Waddell, the bogus mayor in .he same city, wm, in most countries, lad he been guilt | of a similar offense would by this tin , have been shot for n's crimes. But the Times has been discussing the elective franchise iwith the Black stone.^Va. Coober, and iain favor of a restricted si ff rage. It say?: "We determin d that we would nev? er compromise with btllot-box ssuffiog, but we were met constantly with the argument that in the black districts thtse practices were necessary in order 1 co prevent Negro rule, and while we did not and do not believe it, we have finally come to the conclusion that so lmg as there is even a threat of Negro rule in any section of Virginia the present system will be continued. We believe that anything honest is better than dishonest elections, for we believe that nothing is more demoralizing and corrupting. Therefore we meet the apologists on their own ground and say to them 'If you will guarantee an hon? est ballot through constitutional amendment we will assist you in g?t ting such an amendment adopted.' " The proposition is this: If you wi. rob the Negro once for ali by constitu? tional methods and be done with it, we will go with and support you. Could any position be lower ? Could it be any more immoral ? Cou d it violate to a greater extent the higher law of ethics? For God's sak^, tell us, what is the Timbs' standard of morali? ty and right-doing? Its quibbling po? licy is disgusting. If you wish to ba a ballot-robber, take off your robes of piety, and stand before us undisguised. It say*: "But we save the point that any raeaure that may b^f.dopted must be honest and must deal honestly wiih ail clasees of voters without regard to their race And we say tri* not in the interest of the N.'gro, but in the inter? est of the white man." How can honesty be born of dishon? est? Before the above words are hardly written, it uptets all it has said by the usa of the following language: "We eay that it will ne a NBjroaea to this generation and to ?ur cHil lren, if we c.>ntinutj*s>to practice trickery. If w<* disfranchise the great body of Ne? groes let us do it openly and abovr* boaid ard let there be an end of all sorts of jugglery." It gives Its influence and support to robbery ia preference to thievery. It advocates boldness in preference to cowardice. But, it has forgotten that the laws of the land bavejmade the lat? ter (thievery) a misdemeanor, punish able by confinement in jail, and the \former a felony,punishable by confine ent in the state's prison or death, uu advocate like your colleagues wrdjng-doing, only you would have thean perpetrate the greater of the twc is this your standard of morality ? ? the avow'd, the erec*., the manly foe. l can meet?perhaps may turn hia blow; f all plagues, good Heaven, thy wrath can send, sav*4. oh I save me from the can it nd."

PRESIDENT MoKINLErS ME33AQE j The message of President McKinley has been transmitted to Congress. It embraces the stirring events which have transmired during the recess ot that body, and states . plainly the atti? tude of allthe nations of the world, so far as our relationship with them is concerned. lt is more remarkabla for what it does not, than for what it does say. Ia this respect, it is similar to the previous message on the Spanish American situation. There is absolutely no reference to the internal disorders at home, and the butcheries in the Carolinas find no place in the lengthy document. He speaks of the killing of the Austro Hungarians in Pennsylvania. Their government is demanding pay for them. We are inclined to think that the President was ashamed to put it there. The reference to the deplorable enac? tions in Cuba, and the necessity for in? tervention is set forth in the following language: "It was felt by the continental pow? ers which on April 8'h through their ambassadors and envoys, addressed to the Executive a hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this government and people and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which, while securing the maintenance of peace, would afford all necessary guarantees for tha re-estab? lishment of order in Cuba. In re? sponding to that representation, I paid I shared the hope the envoys had ri pres*ei that peace might be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of disturbance in < uba so in? jurious and menacing to our interests and tranquility as well aa revolting to our sentiment of humanity and, while appreciating the humanitarian and dis? interested Character of the communi? cation they had made on behalf of the powers, I stated the confidence of this government, for iti part, that equal appreciation would be shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfil aducy to humanity by ending a situation the indefinite, prolongation of which had been insufferable. And again: "Thegrounds jus'.ify:ng that st*p were theimeres??of hu < a ny, the du? ty co protect the hf *?">.' property of c ur emeus ia Cob ; tl e right to chect injury to our eo?,merce snd peo pie through tae devastation of the is? land, and, must important, the need of removing at once and forever t ie con? stant meases and the burden* emailed upon our goran* **eot by the uncertain? ties and per.\s of the situation caused bv the unendurable disturbance lu Cu? ba." Injthe above, the President makes thc preservation of property para? mount to the security of human life, for ho refers U thc "b jrdens entailed upon oar governmsat," whfeh. m c->n .rue to mean expense of guarding gainst filibustering expeditions iand lie injury to commerce as "most im ortant In his sppeal to Congress for the au bority to act, he said: "In the name of humanity, in the tams of civilization, in behalf of en langered American interests which (ive us the right and the duty to peak and to act, the war in Cuba must nop." He says further: "In view of all this the Congress was tsked to authorise and empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba sad to restore in the uland the estab? lishment of a stable government capa? ble of maintaining order and observ? ing its international obligations, insur? ing peace and tranquility and the tee uurity of its citizens as well as our own and for the accomplishment of these ends to use the military and naval force* o.' the United States as might be necessary with added authority to con? tinue generous relief to the starving people of Cuba," Here, yon have the President of the United States asking the Congress of the nation to give him the power to se? cure a condition of affairs abroad, which hs will net, or cannot secure at home. Why did he not say in the same mes? sage, ''In the name of humanity, m the name of civilization, in behalf of en? dangered American citizens' interests, which give me the right; and the duty to speak and act, the butcheries of our citizens in the South must stop." Was there not abundant cause and justification for such an appeal ? During the year 1S97, one hundred and sixty-sev-*n persons had been mir der?d by lawless mob*. Some were shot to death, some were hanged, some were burned at the stake and some wert il '.yed alive. On J<tuuary 7, 1698 four were lynch? ed in Arkansas. Od June 17,1S98, four were lynched in Alabama. On August 9,1898, five more were lynched in Ar? kansas On September 8th, 1898 three wera lynched in Texts. On October 23, 1893, nine were lynched in Mistis eippi. In but two of tua cases did the stereotyped charge of "assault" figure. These are bu", a few o' the many, there having been more than one hun dred and Arty cas?5 of lynching during this year. In the neighborhood of Wilmington, N. C., the lynchers not only butchered colo;ed men, and forced their haplesb wives and children to the woods, but confiscated property, exiled the owu ers thereof and took forcible posses sion of the ci y government, without "let or hindrance," and even while this message is being read to a wonder ing, world hold possession Jof offices, which are the rightful property of the men chosen thereto in accordance with the laws of the state of North Caroona But why refer to South Carolina? Why tell of Poo? lix? Wny ref Jr to the mute forms of eleven colored men, innocent and helpless, whose blood erics from the ground to God for ven? geance ? No Cuban rec msen'radoes were eve butchered in a more barbarous fashion. Their relatives are suffering. Today, their children are crying for bread. No Red Cross Mig Wave* over Wil? mington. No Ked CroHS ll Ag is heard of |in the neighborhood of Pine lix, s.e. The Post says that President Mo Kislkt told a delegation of colored man from the meeting of citizens of c tior, held at the Vebmont Ava. Bap? tist Church, Rev. Db G. W. Lee, pre? siding officer, and W. Calvin Crabb, Esq., chairman of the committee, that this was a time to be conservative. The colored people at Phoenix, 8. 0. thought so too, but what was the an? swer of the murderous white out throats who shot the life out of their quivering bodies? Ths colored people at Wilmington thought so too, when they relinquish? ed their right to vote and hold office, but what answer did the murderous A. M. Waddell and his fiendish Red Shirts give when they shot down about twenty-five inoffensive colored men in toe streets of that city? The President is ri^ht. This is a time for conservative action. It is a time for that kind of conservatism which eschews lawlessness, and ap? peals to reason. It is the time when grand juries should indict and the petty juries con? vict the murderers. It is the time when the machinery of the law should ba conservative in its action and care taken that only those white men who were actually concerned in the mur? ders, swung from the gallows by the officers of the law. Today, Postmaster F. J. Baker of Lake City, 8. C., is Bleeping beneath the clods of the valley. To-day, his murderers are defiant as they were at the time they encompassed his mur? der. His family are poverty-stricken and helpless. A government thateould give ship-loads of food and suppli-s to another country, and donate a million and a half dollars for the transporta? tion to their mother country, the troops of Spain is silent to the appeal* of tue residents nf our native land. Shame on the government! We are not surprised thea thst thc President did not refer to the butene ries in thc South. We arc not *** ! sounded that he did not ask Coigresi j for the power to act. Thc appeal of ths Lyceum of thc j Second Baptist Church of Washington j presented by committee Nov. 5,1898 one week prior to the hatcheries rn WiLMiuaroi, N. C., will stand ou bolder and gran let as tho years roi by. It said i u We do not com* lo you m politi cisns seeking some partisan end, nor simply as colored men aroused by the passions of the hour; but, sir, we come as economists, aa ttudants of history and the science of government, as pa? triots zealous of our country's weal, and as American citiz * is to ask you, the Chief Executive of this great nation and Commander-in-Chief of the land and naval forces, to exi*rjise all con? stitutional power in you invested to protect every Vmeriaan citizen in the ec joyment of his constitutional rights." ? ? ? "The present situation ii a grave one and the attitude o' lawlers men in the state of Ntr-h Carolina wiil be far reaching in its effect, unless it is coun? teracted by tue strong arm ot the gov? ernment." The law, Section 5299 reads t "Whenever insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combinations, or conspiracies in any State so obstructs ar hinders the execution of the laws thereof, an J of the United States, ae to deprive any portion or class of the people of such Sta<e of any of the rights, privileges, or immunities, or protecti >n named in the Constitution and secured by the laws for the protection of such rights, privileges, or immunities, and the constituted au? thorities of such Stace are unable to protect, or, from any cause, fail in or refuse protection of the people in such rights, such fact shall bs deemed a de? nial br such State of the equal protec? tion of the laws to which tney ar- en? titled under the Constitution of the United States; and in all such cases, or whenever such insurrection^ v.o lence, unlawful combinations, or con? spiracies, oppobes or obstructs the laws of the United States or the due execuion thereof, or impedes or ob? structs the due course of jostles under the eim% it shall be lawful tor the President, and it siall be his duty, t<* take tuch measures, by the employ? ment of the militia, or the land ani naval forces of the United State*5, or of either, or by other me *iis, as h?? may dat in necessary, for the suppression of sucn insurrection, domestic violence, or combinations." The President had heeded the plea of the Spanish-Cubans. Did he heed the appeal of the American cit Did he confer with Gov. Russell >y letter, telegraph or telephone? Did he recommend any action in the prem? ises? On the contrary, did not the United States Naval Reserves aid iht revolutionists? Did they not act ii; accordance with their order*? "O, the pity of it!" It is useless to liok to Washington. The President is hunt! 

PERSIAN RULER'S JEWELS. : nbnloa? Worth of th?> C<>m> lo ths Pea? cock Throne Itoom. Who has not heard of the Persian iewels?their glory, their number, tin ir .iriceless worth? When the doors were tnlocked and I was taken Into the pea ock throne room I found myself sur? rounded by a mass of wealth unequaled in the world. Nowhere are such treas? ures, but nowhere also ls there such an accumulation of rubbish. 1 will, how? ever, dismiss the rubbish and refer only to the treasures. Down snell side of the room were chairs entirely cover? ed with iii .('.. and at intervals were tables of gold, nailed. I shudder? ed to note, with the commonest of black-headed tacks. At tho far end of thc room was the r of the world, thc pr throne. Whether it is one of the seven thrones of the croat mosul and was brought from Delhi, I don't know; but it ls certainly tho most costly orna? ment that the eye of man can look up? on. I Ina petted K most carefully. It is entirely of silver, ? | . ;)-bed structure, but modeled in lovely de? signs. It is encrusted from end to end and from top to bottom with diamonds. At the back is a star of brilliants that makes you blink. The rug on which the shah sits is edged with prec? ious stones, and the pillow on which he reclines is covered with pearls. I could keep on writing about the dczzling beauties of the throne of the king of kings, but I never could get beyond de? claring it to be a superb jewel. Some people have valued it at ?5.000.000. Its real value is between ?2,000,000 and ?3,000,000. But though the peacock throne is the magnum opus of the Persian crown jewels it by no means extinguishes the magnificence of the other treasures. Who can attempt, however, to recount the number of bejeweled arms, the royal arms, the flashing aigreta, the trays piled up with cut and uncut stones, and the bowls filled with pearls that you can run tlirough your fingers like a handful of rice? Everyone has heard of the Daria-i-Nur, or Sea of Light, sister diamond to the Kohinoor, or Mountain of Light Every one has also heard of the Globe of the World, made by the late shah, of seventy-five pounds of pure gold and 51.33G gems? the sea of emeralds, Persia of tur? quoises, India of amethysts, Africa of rubies, England and Prance of dia? monds?and valued at ?947,000. Mark Twain's I>eenHarlttea. Mark Twain has an Intense dislike for clothes, and If lt were possible would remain in his pajamas day in and day out. And whenever he can do so he eats breakfast in them, receives his friends and works in them. His favorite mode of writing is to lie flat on the floor on his stomach In his pajamas, with a pipe in his mouth.
