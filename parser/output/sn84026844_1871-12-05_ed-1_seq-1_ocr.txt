Mr. itoiixwui.1. always lias something to say and says it au interesting way. , President 0 rant's message lias few striking leatures. It ts a plain, uupreti'iiding review of thu current business of the government, rather awkward in style sometimes, and pro 'forma In the main. There is, however, a Dot unskillful avoidauee ol specific opinious or recommends' lions on controverted questions where antagoniuna might Bl'exefled. Thomesaago is not likely to create irritation in any , ipiarter. Thu most iui|>ortaut recommendation* aro those lor amnesty and Tor u reduction of internal taxes and tarill' duties. The latter, however, is recommended aud fully discussed by Secretary IIoutwki.i., so it is only in liia discussion ill' amnesty that the President stands on his own ground, liven that is very carofully i|tiulilled and tempered by Ihe sug- i grstlon that while amnesty might be a wise policy It would bo best, if that suits . Omgresa, to discriiuinulo agalpat con- , s|iieuous leaders. The President, while furnishing a good argument in favor of a j sweeping amnesty, avoids committing himself at nil.

I THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Report of Secretary Boutwell. Thkasuuy Dki'Autuent, Dec. 4. Silt:?The country has been prosper0119 during the year now cloning and the public lliiuncra Iihvo shared in tlio general prosperity. During the tlscal year ending .1 uno itOth 1871, the reduction ofjtlia public debt wus <04,.'137,704 B4. The total decrease ( in the public debt from March 1st, 18111), 1 to December 1st, 1871, was $377,211,- 1 803 1(1, and during the same period the | tnnual intiTc.it has licen reduced $1U , 1 Ml, 130 01. The rovenuo for the year 1871, und the 1 receipts since the first oi July last, show 1 that tho time has arrived when a consul* ' eralile further reduction in tuxes can lie made, and yet leave tho Government In a 1 position to pay (50,000,000 annually ol iho principal ul thu debt, including the ' imoimtpledged through the sinking fund. I In my auuual roport to Congress for 1870, ' [ expressed thu opinion that the settled wllcy of tho country should contemplate \ revenue sulUeicnt to meet tho ordinary expenses ol the Government, pay the inerest on tho public debt and from twenty ;o fifty millions of the principal annually. I\> that opinion I adhere, and 1 have -Vcn a stronger conviction that tho paynent annually upon tho principal of tho liiblic debt should not bo less than fifty nilllon dollars. Large as tho revenues of tho country >ave been during the last three years our ysteni of taxation has not been oppressive o individuals, nor has it in any sensible legree embarrassed tho business of the ountry; and while relief from taxation is Icsirnhle, it is more desirable to maintain he public credit in its present elevated 0 usition, not only as an example to other 0 lations but for its historical valuo in ena- * iling the government to make a transler of M urge amounts upon mvorauio icrma, 11 inbappily in tho future an agency should ? eauiro such loans to be mado. * The power to negotiate a largo loan at * Ive per cent, ana enter upon negotia- J ions for the sale of.bonds beariug live, I )iir and a half and four per cent interest, u ?derived entirely from the exhibition of a n honest purpose on tho part of tlio ^ eoplo to maintain tho public faith, which n an lie best shown by large and frequent avment* upon tho public debt. The revenue from customs for tho year Jj 871 was greatly in excess of tho esti* J rntes, amounting to $'200,270,408 05, 01 gainBt *104,588,1174 44 for the proceding P ear. Tho cost of collecting this revenue 11 m $0,500,572 01 for 1871, being fl.ll 0 or cent, while the cost for the your 1870 ma $0,2:17,1117 25, or 11.2J1 per cent. Tho <j< pproprlatlon for tho collection of ustoms, wlthjtho additions derived from " nes and |>enaltles, and for failures, ex- w ceded tho expenditures by tho stun ol ?oro than $800,000, and there is no oubt that tho permanent approprla- " ion win uu uinpiu lor uiu prcscm unu lur ? jo next fiscal year. c' The reduction for tlio rates on duty to J" 10 1st ol January, 1871, under the net 11 t' July 14,1870, diminished the Importa- J5' ion of many articles during tho lust six J.1 lonths of tlio year 1870. but tliero was 'n Dnsequcntly a largo addition to tho rev- J11 mies for the first six months ol the year [' 871. A comparison of the first six ,j.' lonths of the calendar year 1870 show n n increase ol 55 percent on tho quantity P1 I tea imported, 20 per cent in tho quan- K1 ty of colfeu, B3 per cent In the quantity I brown sugar, 120 per cent In the quan- " ty of pig Iron, 18(J per cent in tho quanj C( ty ol melado, 15)1) per cent In tho quan- JJ ty ol spices, and a largo Increase In 11 ?any other articles.

In tho estimates for the next fiscal year i ! have not included in the receipts the i iremium on gold which may hu sold nor | nthu expenditures the premium which i nflv hu nidd on bonds to lit! norchascd in * lurrency. lu tlio suggestions I have the honor |to { nako in relerenco to a reduction of tuxes, I keep in view two important lads: First, i bat tho ability ol tho Nation to pay at j east liily million dollars annually of < lie] principal of tliu public debt g hall not no impaired; ami secondly, < hat in tho chatigo of tho revenue system 10 violence shall lie done to the business < nteresls of the country. While 1 do not t indertaka to state precisely 1 lie cuuscs t rhicli have contributed to tliu public t irosperity, there is no substantial reason ir questioning tho truth oi the statement ? liat tho last few years have been the t aost prosperous lu the history of the a ounlrv?years without example in our fc wn affairs, and without parallel in the i Ifalrs ol any other government. It Is i racticable to dispense witli all revenuo i rom internal sources, except that derived I oin spirits, tobacco uiiil malt liquors, c 'heso sources should furnish for tho years [ 87i and 1873 a revenue of about $110,- o 1)0,000, making a reduction ol taxes ol i 10,000,000. The revenuo Irom customs t nder the existing laws and from lands nd miscellaneous sources would amount li i about $31111,000,000 more, making a total u avenue lor that year ol $!1H!,000,000. The t xpenses ol the government, not Including |j le amount payable on account of (the n nklng fund, are estimated at $373,025,- t 71190. If to this sum be added $30 000,- s DO (or payments on account of the 1 ublic dent, including the amount due on r le sinking fund, there remains a balance t I about $30,000,000, within which reduc- d ons may bo made in tho revenuo from d iistoms. This amount added to the re- ii ucllon proposed under tho Internal Kevo- e lie laws gives a total reduction of $!iU,- tl 10,000. h In this view I respectfully recommend t| i the consideration of Congress tile re- o uction of tho duties on salt to tho extent h [ flfty per cent; tho duty on bituminous n ml to filly contfl per ton; tho reduction a F the duty on raw hides and Kleins, and c ?o removal of nil duties from a largo asi of articles produced In other coun- a lea which enter Into tho arts mid manu- d ictures of this country, and wlilcli are ft i>t produced in tho United Btates, and b 10 revenue lrotu which Is Inconsidera- p lo. Huch n list, with the rcvonuo do- n ved from each article, is in course of ti reparation and will be submitted to Con- a rim Tho removal ot the duties from a 8 iffi) class of articles used in manufac- li ires, and liic reduction ol the duties upon ti >al, furnishes an opportunity lor a mod- ft 'ate decreoso in tho rates of duties upon ioso products whoso cost will bo di- p linished by this change. u Whilo nothing ns the consequence of ai gishition could bo more disastrous to c< le public prosperity tlinn a policy which h loiild destroy or seriously disturb the lanulacturing interests of the country, h is still possible, by wiso and moderate ci ..........

The value of the paper currency a; I tho country during tho years 1801) and I <7(1, wim apparently appreciated by tho ii icreased uae of paper money in tlwi Boutli, tl at chiefly by tlio establishment of the t< rcdit of the United Htalcs upon a c rm bt sis. On the first of January, 1871, it io last named fact was Cully accomplish- u I, ami sines that timu tlio appreciation p [ tho paper currency has been iluo wholly p I the increased demand for it in the busl- ti ess affairs ofthe country. Tho dillorenco p otween tlio valuo of paper money at the r resent momcut and ils valuo on tho 1st fi I December, 1870, may be attributed to t io latter cause, and furnishes the best n loans which the country has yet lmd lor li wertaining the quantity o! paper curren- si j which can bo used and its valuo kept fi tpar with gold. The result of this test p incurs with what seems tn me to be the fl est oninlnn unon tho subject, that tho n mount of paper money In circulation is lill so groat that It cannot bo maintained v lvalue at par with coin. There arc two li iodes ol relief:, ono la to rcluce the Ii olurao of currency as recommended by o io in my annual report submitted to b longrera In Doccmbcr, 1809; Uio otbor s lode Is to await tbo growth or the a ountry and tlio increasing demands of I uslness, which in tliat time will produce a he desired result. The chlcl means of tt scuring the end sought for, without a re- tl uctlon in the volume or currency, would ( e the use of paper money upon tbo fa- J i(lo coast. With this object In view steps ( avo already been taken by (tils depart- 1 lent lor tuo purpose of ascertaining u rhether It la practicabfe to substitute t aper for coin; and I havo reason to an- c Iclpato that a change may be mado In the n minting tn nntinnfil liftnk* 1/?nillntr Ii [) that reault, which will not nllect unfa- n orably the general character of. the t jratem. 1 It la my duty to call the attention of i !ongresa to the importance of abolishing n lie system of shares or mocllesns for the C enetil of revenue officers and other per- t una officially connected with the govern- i lent. This measure was recommended I 11 my last annual report, and a statement 1 fas submitted to Congress showing the I lie amount received by the officers ol i ustoms, together wltli a bill increasing t lieir salaried without any increase or a ppropriation from tho Treasury, the sum t ow paid from moieties being <|Uito suffl- ( lent to place the entire force upon n sat- I ifaclory footing In regard to nay. Dur- c ng the lasi fiscal year the office of cniector aiul surveyor of tho port of New | i'nrk each received from moieties thesnm n r?in,3irs.m>, and the naval office the sum r f |48,19.r> 59. In most cased tho officers lo not perform special services entitling < licm to the amount* granted, and repor- ( prs and others whose act* are made the I object ot investigation complain, and I ,1 tliiuk with just reason, tliut the agents of the Government have a pecuniary interest in pursuing those charged with violation uf the law. The Government ought to pay lair salaries and rely upon the good laith of its oUlcers lor the ]>erlonnanco of their duties. One of the dilliculUes which the Department has to meet frequently is that custom ollicers have au interest in the proceedings tor the discovery of frauds ami the settlement of cases and the prosecution of them, which is diifereut from the real interest of the government; and as a necessary result the conduct ol such ollicers Is open to suspicion, both on tho part of those who are punished by them und tho government they ostensibly represent. It may be deemed expedient to leave tho law as it now stands in regard to tho informers who are not ollicers, : making it a penal otftnee for any ottlcer to enter Into an arrangement with au informer for any share ol tho proceeds of i tho information, and giving to the inform- . ur perpetual right of action for tho recov- t zry of any money or other valuable thing i paid or given to an olHcer engnged In tho j Jlgcovery or prosecution of a fraud or legal c wrong against tho government. ( The report of tho Comptroller of the Currency shows that ono hundred and 1 brtyfive banks have been organized tin* I lor tho act unproved July 13th, 1871, t iroviding (or tho issue ol $.">4,000,000 ml- g lilional bunk circulation, aud that the c nun of $2a,tW3,W00 has boon issued by i rirtno of the saino act. 1 The Treasury has redeemed $32,230,000 t if tho three per cent, certificates tbeu in t circulation, leaving the sum ot tweuty- r hree million lour hundred nnd ninety r housiuid dollars now outstanding. 1 take the liberty of suggesting that it jj mpcars to me to be wise to leave the dis* L ributiou ol' the circulation authorized by t aid net as It now reads. Bhould tho t Jtates that have already received their '1 ironortlons ot the circulatiou bu author- f, /.eel to take what may remain only a brief v Ksriod will elapse before a demand will 3 iu made Iroin the States with a limited H :irculation for an lucrcoso. It seeins L irudont, therefore, to retain tho balance r >f tho flfty-lour millions for distribution in 0 hose States now having a claim to it on t bo basis of equality of apportionment. j The details of tho subscriptions to the a Dim show that the national banks have |, 1 min thn whole acted liberallv. more 1; t?n a hundred millions of dollars having 8 icon subscribed for them on their own t ecounts.

It is estimated that an appropriation of $5,000 will he sufficient for ? suitable buildup on each inland. The igsnts charged with the management ol Llie seal fishery have been detailed from the custom service. I respcctlully recommend that authority be given lor thu ippointiuent of two agents or two asais* juit agents, and that suitable appropriates bu madu for their salaries and expenses. The necessity of two agents at inch Island is apparent.

At ircsint there is ureal inequality and Inuitico existing. Tho First Comptroller ocelves a salary ol $5,000 a year, whilo he Second Comptroller and other bureau Ulcers, whoso duties arc hardly less nilortant, receive only $:),000.
