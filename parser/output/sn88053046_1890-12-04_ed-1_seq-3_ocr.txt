MESSAGE. Press Opinio Upon Ilarrlsim's Deliver Philadelphia Record: The President's Message to Congress has bet*it composed under circumstances of irritation and dif ficulty, and it is chiefly noteworthy in showing how unable the writer is to adjust, himself to the political situation. Philadelphia Pirn*: The portions of the President's message which will command most attention, as h ing by odds the important in the light of the i, are those concerning the tariff', with •ciproeity features, and t he discussion of honest election methods. This has been made natural by the practically unani mous claim of the opposition that the tariff bill, which was passed, and the elec tions bill, which was not passed, were the cause of Republican defeat. Philadelphia Time*: President llarri sneond annual message is an elab orate matter-of-faet paper, excepting tin* few paragraphs apologizing for the McKin ley tari II law und demanding its contiuu ; his demand for subdized steamships nd his special pleading l'or the Force Elec bill. Outside of these three features, which occupy only a few pages of the formidable document, the message is a dry summary of department reports; and as the material features of these reports have been already given to the public, there is little of the message that could interest the irai reader. The one fact. clearly taught the message is that, the I'resi akes the old Bourbons of comparatively respectable by learning nothing and forgetting nothing. The people have declared against tho in crease of already exacting taxes its dent the •essaries of life i inn* of peace; against of the masses for the bene fit of limited classes; against the profligacy that lias ercated the first treasury «lefieit since the war, and against a Purer Election Gill that no business man, north or south, Republican or Democrat, is willing to'ap prove. In the face «»f a popular revolution entirely unexampled in magnitude, the President demands the continuance of taxes which the against; demands steamship subsidies to si and abroad when free si establish of loss people have Jditiotial nro revolted fligac.y by »cculiitors at. home tips would at commerce without dollar outlay, and demunds that the Force Election hill shall be passed for the special reason, as he states it, of enabling irresponsible Federal officials to certify all election returns for President and congrcsa Philadelphia Imjtihvr: The feature of the message is the backbone) displayed by the President. In spite of the Democratic whirlwind lie stands just where he did be fore the elections, unless, indeed, he has advanced a step or two upon the subject of : *i procity. But of one thing he is positive. There should be no attempt to re» »pen t lie McK inley bill until it has hud a fair trial. : Any dire«* allusion to the result of the November elections would probably be thought of place in the President's message, and tft«*r«-forc the puhiic will not be surprised at the absence of any such allusion In the present message ot President Harrison. That the result of those elections might have some influence upon the recommen dations of the message or its treatment of some of the questions and measures upon which the American people arc supposed to have expressed their opinion in Novem ber would not have been unreasonable to expect. If there be any persons who cherished such an expectation, however, they will find themselves disappointe«!. Th«*r<» is not one syllable in the message to indicate that President Harrison attaches the smallest importance or significance to the expression of the opinions of a majority of 550,000 «if his countrymen ' ' conduct of his administration <»r the work of the Fifty-first J'«ingress in its first sos . only, one thing is evident, ami that agree with the majority of his fell« »w-cottn try men. Baltimore American: A consistent Harrison has never issued from the White House. Evidently 1»«* does the recent crushing defeat to the efforts of Congress and his administration to carry mit the policy of the Republican "party. Every measure of inii»«»rtan«*e «indorsed by tin* majority in the Fifty-first Congress is endorsed by the President and the passage of those bills on the eulendur which stiff habg fire beeuusc of lack of time at the first session strongly urged as an evidence of good faith to the public and as necessary to the peace and progress of the country. ' Philadelphia A ortn American : President Harrison ims prepared nothing for cranks, kitellyers amt d«jctrinaires in his annual message to Congress. He has taken the view of a practical business man, and his message is a business statement to u com munity of practical men of business. He hus no theories to exploit,. He does not with great parade bring forward a jumble of oh {theories us something new. in ing the statement of u good business man wc should expect to find information touch ing the conduct of public business, and that is wlmt we find in the message. Philadelphia Ledger: As to some of the topics discussed by the President in i message sent to Congress yesterday, espec ially flic tariff, the silver question and the Feilend Election bill now pending, there will, of course, be differences of opinion; but those who reu« I it carefully can hardly Tail to award it t Go credit of being a plain, dispassionate and business-like document, unless they are inclined to be hypercritical. New York Herald: Mr. Harrison's mes tin* is that Mr. Harrison does plucky and •ssugo than that of President attribute I the ni.fiv ,.... t he contrary, does the dull monotony of platitude. It lacks the merit of either rhetoric or logic, will be read from courtesy, but without inter exhibit of statesmanship it is a serious disappointment, for ini pression that the '• thinks it impolitic to express them. He calls for the passage of a tore«? bill by a political party which was con demned at the lust elections and he does this because the political party which re ceive»! the people's approval at the polls will be on hand ut the next session and it rise above eat. As conveys an writer has no convie will then be too lute. New York Times: The President has forgotten little und learned nothing. lie meets tiie Congress in which his party pro voked defeat, on its reassembling, with a tediously urgent exhortation to remedy ; of the mistakes already made, to press forward in the same line, and to that Providence which the French say watches over "Americans and fools." One subject Mr. Harrison was bound to discuss —the tariff; a second he has chosen to bring forward—the Force bill. On neither lius he anything new to say, the only ele ment of novelty in his treatment of them being tiie Complete change i sentimont of the people since he last ad dressed himself to Congress. * * * Mr. Harrison's stupid adherence to the policy of his party leaders will only convince the country more completely that, the party machinery is hopelessly under the control of the rich and powerful interests that dic tated the McKinley bill. New York 1 Voilà: The message is a thoroughly partisan hut otherwise color jess document, whose author writes it vthing to say or to sug gest, but because, in the course of his tine duty, he is required to send to Congress at this time. It makes no effort to grapple with the problems of the time or to direct legislative policy in harmony with tho needs and aspirations of the peo ple. It is not a state paper, hut a perfunc tory and by no means candid review of the departmental reports, conceived in the spirit of a Bourbon and expressed in th«.* tone of a Pharisee. unwavering courage and fidelity to his con vietions of duty.
