It CHICAGO AGAIN. The great convention fight has been decided, and Chicago again captures the prize. We are honestly sorry for Minneapolis. She made a gallant fight, anil the fault is not hers that she did not win. It is due entirely to the ob tuseness of delegates who may some day know better. But the effort of Minneapolis was not all in vain. She has shown the entire country that Western energy, even in a losing con test, is something not to be spoken lightly of. She has informed every state in the union that the Twin Cities have grown to that point where they are quite capable of taking care of a na tional convention, or two of them for that matter, and though many knew it before, to others not so well informed it will be new. The spreading of such information is certainly worth the ef fort. Therefore, while we condole with our sister city we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the trip of her famous dele tion lias been to no purpose. And after everything is said it must be admitted that Chicago is not such a bad place, ex cept for the unwary delegate, for hold ing a convention after all. The Garden City should not consider, however, that because she has had a convention once or twice she is to have it every time. The Northwest will be ready to extend another invitation in the future. She is not accustomed to being daunted by one refusal. Better luck next time. BLAINE DOESN'T LIKE IT. Mr. Blame does not like the presi dent's message. It was hardly to be expected that he would. But the un derlying reason for his dislike is found in the concluding sentence of the inter view with him: "The Democratic party v power is a standing menace to the industrial prosperity of the coun try." That is the milk in the eocoanut Mr. Blame is trying to crack. The Democratic party is the root of all evil to him because it involves the exclusion of the Republican party, and inferen tially of Mr. Blame himself, from power. And there is another thing about this interview that should be clearly recog nized. It indicates beyond question that Mr. Blame is still a candidate for the Republican nomination. It clearly dissipates the various stories which have been told regarding his perfect indiffer ence, if not repugnance, to the consid eration of his name in connection with the presidency. It demonstrates beyond cavil that Mr. Blame wants the noni- illation, and wants it bad. Not only that. but. with the skilled finesse of which he is such a master, he is chasing it up very vigorously and not the less effectively because it is a still limit. Through his trusted lieutenants at home he can keep himself in the cur rent of home happenings. By his resi dence abroad he avoids complications which might prove disastrous. lie knows well enough that his margin of strength in the next convention will be great enough to obviate the necessity of "rustling," as they say in the far West, before the nomination, and he is shrewd, enough to recognize the fact that he will have to "rustle" his hardest after ward. That is why Mr. Blame so distinctly notes that the president in his message forces the issue between pro tection and free trade. The candidate bom Maine has carefully weighed the question from the standpoint of self interest and has decided to cast in his fortunes with the protectionists. And why? Because lie is a friend of monopoly by training and association as well as from interested motives. For he would be a credulous person indeed who Would credit such an adroit and ambi tious politician as Mr .Blame with the advocacy of protection ideas solely on the ground of disinterested conviction. There is nothing of that kind influenc- ing him. Principle is not a thing that Mr. Blame would allow to stand in the way of his ambit on He is sufficiently experienced in the devious ways of pol itics to know that in the Republican party the monopolists, the manufactur ers, in short the favored few who have been enriched by a policy of protection at the people's expense, hold the bal ance of power. Without their aid he might as well rigfa for the moon as for the presidency. In antagonizing them he would render hi- nomination as impossible as the draining of the ocean. Thus promptly recognizing the side upon which his bread is buttered, Mr. Blame could do BO less than attack the tariff reduction recommendations of President Cleve i,\vi»'-' message »nd to reiterate his ad herence to the monopolists. He brings forward m new jugumeut. He simply , <r- ';vcr the gronnd which baa so often I,. en eai froM ■A Hi" •< <•■' of the pro ' 'ii *n\__ i _*' '., act has become Vt ex **» . .

CONVICTIONS. The conviction of Murray upon the charge of rape, closely following that of Reed on the same charge is an indica tion that there is a very healthy feeling in Minnesota regarding the sanctity of woman's good name and the duty of the state in defending it. The law has al ways dealt leniently with the man who has even committed murder, in punish ing a seducer, and has in many cases held him guiltless. It is meet and proper that it should show itself obversely as severe when it deals with the culprit itself. There is no crime in the whole category of wick edness that deserves surer or more speedy punishment than that which seeks the ruin of women. Here in Amer ica, where we particularly pride our selves upon our chivalry, our deference to the gentler sex. there should not be a place throughout the length and breadth of the land where a woman would not be as safe from insult as in her own home. Unfortunately there are such places, many of them and many men, too, with whom a defenceless woman would be about as safe as in a jungle infested by tigers. The only way to decrease the number of both is to rigorously in flict the penalty of the law whenever it is clearly shown that a woman has been robbed of the honor which is dearer than her life, audit is a debatable question whether in extreme cases death is a punishment too severe. It is a gratifying indication of the chivalrous instincts of Minnesotians and of the intention in this state at least to secure the safety of unprotected women that the law should be so ready and conviction so sure for those wretches who in preying upon defense less women, forfeit all title to manhood. -**-_-» AN UPRIGHT JUDGE. Mr. Leiter is a retired merchant of Chicago, who possesses a score or more of millions. Mr. Leiteb is also a land lord, numbering among his possessions several tenement buildings. Recently Mr. Leiter and one of his tenants had a falling out. The matter was taken to the courts and pending its settlement Mr. Letter, the millionaire landlord, was forbidden to dispossess the tenant. Coolly disregarding the court's order Mr. Leiteb, through his agent, calmly locked the door on his litigious ex-ten ant, the tenant being on the outside. Thereupon the court waxed wrath and declared that Mr. Leiter should have a chance to reflect upon his obstinacy in the county jail even if he owned twice as many millions. It required the most energetic action on the part of Mr. LEITEB'S attorney to secure a stay of proceedings until an explanation can be made, and if it is not satisfactory the millionaire may yet have an oppor tunity to accept the county's hospitality since the judge reiterates that if cause exists he "would as readily put the i whole Leiter family in jail as the Jones family." Passing by the fact that there is no apparent reason why those persons ! bearing the name of Jones should be imprisoned it may be remarked that this judicial disregard of millions is refreshing as it is novel. It is some thing that should be more extensively cultivated, particularly in the state of New York. When a man enters the court room, he should, to all intents and purposes be financially naked. The millionaire and the day laborer should stand upon the same footing, and that is the intimation that the Chicago judge evidently intended to convey. He de serves commendation and encourage ment. Should Mr. Leiter be found guilty of the alleged contempt we look to see the indignant judge carry out his threat and will be ready to applaud him for it. — __•• MOST SENTENCED. So Blatherskite Most, would-be whole sale murderer, gets a year in state's prison at lord labor as the price of his incendiary moutliings. The judgment is a fitting one except in one regard— the term of imprisonment is not long enough. However, if to the sentence is added the provision, "hard labor in solitary confinement," it may do. He should In given every opportunity to reflect upon the fact that freedom and anarchism are incompatible, and nowhere could he do so as well as in strict seclusion. Foreign importations of human rub bish coming to this country for the avowed purpose of making war on American institutions, and of spreading seditious doctrines among the discon tented, should be taught that freedom of speech and liberty of person do not mean that inciting to pillage and mur der shall go on unnoticed, and that the Instigators of rapine and slaughter shall preach their diabolical creed with iiu •''.*iiit\ M sooner they learn that in this ■country, as well as in any other, prisons yawn for just Mich scoundrels and that their conviction is sure, the better will it be for all. Most and his kind have no place in this country. There is not room enough for them and for the hon est immigrants too. A line must be drawn somewhere and it is going to be drawn at the blatherskites and anarch ists, terms essentially synonymous. The conviction of Most may serve to impress that fact upon them. And if it fails— well, almost any sheriff in the land is ready to perform lirst-class exe cutions at short notice. Yesterday a milkmen's convention in this city considered "the best way to decrease the price of milk to the consumer without de creasing the profits of the dealer." The solution seems absurdly simple, unl-. ss coun try wells freeze up in the winter time. It is definitely settled that Hon. Ignatius Donnelly's new book will make him rich. Let's see.which party's executive committee's treasurer will now have the honored privi lege of addressing Hon. Ignatius for the favor of a campaign contribution. Congressman Kncte Nelson strongly in dorses the president's message. We have al ways thought Hon. Knute an extremely level-headed citizen, and it should be re membered that he carries the Filth district in his "west cutt" pocket. The Hebrew Charity Ball last night was the success it deserved to be, and many un fortunates will find themselves better off be cause of the warmheartedness of a people who get too little credit for generosity. -*-**^ Senator Saris says he believes in striking the duty off sugar and all the necessaries of ' life.

He Was at Least on Friendly Terms With a Female Employe. An Assault on a Tennessee Girl Avenged by a Triple Lynching*. A Sensation at Peoria, 111.— The General Record of Crime. Cincinnati, Dec. B. The Enquirer this morning prints the fac simile cipher letters which it says were fur nished by Charles Hopkins, son of Ben E. Hopkins. They purport to be letters sent by Harper to Miss Josie Holmes, his former exchange clerk. The letters were in cipher which was easily read. Harper alse sent three checks to Miss Holmes, which Hopkins suppressed and turned over to District Attorney Burnett. They aggregated S7oo,ooo,and it is presumed they were intended to be placed so as to cover up some ef the crooked transaction. of his bank. One for 1900,000 was dated Feb. 28, the others for '200,000 each were dated June 27. The letters of Harper to Miss Holmes are as ardent as those of any lover could he. In the first one be in structed her about what she should say in her testimony. She asked him to send her a lawyer to advise her how to testify. He reminded her of his talk during their hist talk together; that he said the worst thing would be their separation and that she said that would never be, and pressing a kiss on his lips said she would go to prison with him. or if that could not be. would visit him daily. He begged her to get well and come to him, before she got into the sale deposit box. otherwise AIL WOULD BE SPOILED. He also urged her to take no more of the drug, and decline to be interviewed. in one of her notes Miss Holmes said to Harper: "Your wife has 1306,000), I have noth ing now to do but to die, with your family disgracing me a* they have done in the last two days." Mr. Harper was asked this morning what he had to say about the publica tion of his letters to Miss Holmes. Harper, with clenched teeth, said: ••You can say that Charley Hopkins did not publish the other letters that would have benefited me as much as it would his father, and that he did not publish anything about the $10 1 gave him for her. Now will you excuse me?? and he finished his toilet and went stairs. There is no doubt of the authenticity of the letters, and they place in the true light the relations between the ex banker and his fair clerk. The publication of an attempt to bribe District Attorney Burnett was headed: "The defense make an unsuc cessful attempt to bribe Mr. Burnett.'' When court convened, District Attorney Burnett made a personal statement, saying that he especially desired it to be understood that there was no ground whatever for involving the counsel now representing the defense in any such statement or insinuation, Judge .lack son thought it due to counsel for the de fense to say that so far as the court could judge, their conduct had been all that honorable gentlemen could de mand. Judge Sage also said that he wished to correct a statement in the publication which ascribed to him pre vious knowledge of the attempted brib ery, lie said he had no information on the subject whatever. The prosecution made no reference at all to the publica tion of the cipher letters between Harper and Miss Holmes. Mr. Hayes finished his testimony and with it the government rested the case. The de fense called Mr. Eckert for the purpose of finishing its cross-examination. After finishing the cross-examination of Mr. Eckert, the defense cross-exam ined Mr. Haves very briefly. Then Judge Wilson asked the court to give him a little time to prepare for opening the case for the defense, and court ad journed until to-morrow at 10 a.m. It is expected that Harper will be placed on the stand, and that no other witness will be called. A TRIPLE LYNCHING. Three Negroes Suffered Death for Assaulting a Child. Oniov. Ti;.\N.. Dec, Judge Lynch is a favorite tribunal in Tennessee, and one that settles most disputes that the unwritten law applies to. The neigh borhood of Hives, a small town in Ten nessee, was yesterday the scene of a triple Lynching. Adam Charles. Andy Miller and William Smith were the vic tims. The cause was an assault on a ten-year-old child, the daughter of Mr. M. Myers. The story of the crime was as follows: Minnie, the little daughter of Mr. Myers, Wednesday morning started to school alone. When about half a mile from home, in a lonely wood, she was accosted by the negro, Charles, who induced the child to enter the woods with him and she was there as saulted by the negro, Miller. Charles and Smith were present and witnessed the crime. Minnie reached home more dead than alive and told her story. An alarm was sent out and in less than an hour 100 men were on the trail of the fiends. Among them were a number of negroes. Miller was captured early in the afternoon in a negro cabin. As soon as he was captured he revealed the hiding place of hi-- companions, who were found in the woods near by. Mil ler accused his companions of the crime and protested his innocence. No ac cusation was made by the pursuing party, who proceeded in ominous si ! lence to a wood near by, where the three were hanged. The negroes in the community were thoroughly in sympa thy with the actions of the avenging party and condemned the assault in unmeasured terms. Miller was a negro of considerable respectability in his neighborhood, having a wife and sev eral children. His companions were considered worthless. The child at last accounts was in a very precaiious con dition. A 

PEORIA SENSATION. A Marshal Arrested on a Charge of Murder. Peoria, 111., Dec. B.— A great sensa tion was caused here last evening by the arrest of Hartman Plaag, the mar shal of South Peoria. He has, it ap pears, been indicted for the murder of his father-in-law, John Colditz, on the evening of July 5, ISSO. Plaag was lodged in jail without bail. Colditz was found dead on that date with a bullet through his heart, and the instrument with which the deed was committed was found within three feet of him. The coroner's jury at the time of the murder was adjourned from day to day, finally bringing in a verdict of murder by unknown parties. Now, after the long lapse of time, Plaag's sister-in-law, Mrs. Becker, and a Mrs. Weiss come forward and swear that Plaag killed his father-in-law; that they witnessed the deed, but were so much in terror of Plaag that they swore falsely at the in quest. Plaag says his sister-in-law has secured his indictment because of an unsuccessful attempt to blackmail him, she some years ago having threatened to bring suit against him for seduction unless he paid her $800, which he re fused to do. ■- * - v - The Chicago Anarchists. Chicago, Dec. B.— Police Captain Lewis, in whose district most of the an archists live, said in an interview to-day that he had private information to the effect that the revolutionists are highly incensed at the authorities for their in terference with the proposed benefit to the families of those who were executed. The police, however, have a complete list of all the places where they meet and are watching these points of ren dezvous very closely. They have given up the idea of mass meetings, and when anything important demands their ac tion they adjourn to the residence of some one of their number. Their real meetings are held only in this way, and they never go to the same, house twice iii succession. But the houses are spotted. ".-.".. ■ifi i HEItR MOST. He Is Sentenced to One Year in ',:• !;■ the Penitentiary. ■'■' New York, Dec. Herr John Most, the . anarchist, who was convicted of misdemeanor, was arraigned in the gen eral sessions court to-day. His counsel, Mr. Howe, argued in his behalf for a new trial, but it was denied. When the clerk "of the court asked Most what he had to say why sentence should not be pronounced ou him. Most, in a very dramatic manner, said: <, "Your honor, from a legal point of view it may appear very difficult to stay a sentence when the jury has rendered its verdict. But there are certain occa sions when the court should and must rise superior to a jury finding. There fore, with all respect to your honor, I consider it my duty to reply to your question, 'why sentence should not be pronounced upon John Most,' to state that it is in your province to-day to de cide whether free speech and lawful as semblages should be destroyed in this country. The sentence which your honor is about to pronounce will be en grafted upon the history of the United States. 1 again protest my innocence of guilt of the offense for which I stand convicted, and appeal to your honor to make use of such discretion as lies within your power." Judge Co wing's only reply was: "The sentence of the court is that you be confined in the penitentiary for one year, without the fine."' Then Most was taken back to the Tombs. Landed in Jail. Fort Worth, Tex., Dec. After months of watching and pursuit the ringleaders of the famous Brooking thieves and train robbers were last night landed in jail. The entire ranger force of the Panhandle, in command of ('apt. McMurray. and the sheriffs of three counties with their departments have been at work on the cases for nearly a year. The scene of the depre i dations was in Childress, Wilbarger, Tylor and adjoining portions of the state. The robbers lived in canons and caves and were a well organized band. All the big ranchmen have suffered at their hands, and in one case a whole herd of cattle were stolen in Green county and taken to Kansas and sold. They Shot to Kill. Cadillac, Mich., Dec.

The report of the umpire committee appointing Gaffney, Doescher, Ferguson and Me- Quade was received and approved. It was also made a rule that no umpire hereafter can be suspended without the concurrence of at least four clubs, and it was further stipulated that in all cases of accusation and trial the um pire shall have an opportunity to make a defense. This ended the work of the meeting. W. A. Watkins, manager of the fa mous Detroit champions and who suc ceeded in gathering the members of that great aggregation arrived to-day- "I -'came here" he said, "to arrange dates with Cincinnati. Louisville and St. Louis, also with the Southern league clubs represented at the board of arbi tration meeting. 1 have about settled to open the season with our team at New ""Orleans and play up through the South. Cincinnati is hold ing 7 off, but I am confident I will compete with St. Louis for the spring series between the two cham pionship nines. We will open in New Means with two games, and in all prob ability play in Memphis, Birmingham and Nashville. The Detroits will then 'go to Louisville and probably Cincin nati. From here they will move to St. Louis for two games before the Ameri can season opens, making a series of seven games between the St. Louis and s>etroits." THE 

TROTTING ASSOCIATION. McGuigan, Expelled Twelve Years Ago, Reinstated. New York, Dec. B.— The board of review of the National Trotting associa tion finished its session in this city this morning, having taken action on 112 cases altogethew. The remainder of the docket will come up for consideration at the next meeting of the board, which will be held in Chicago in May next. Edward Lally, owner, and Frank Casey, driver, were expelled for trotting the mare , Belle Kidder, alias Galbraith Maid, alias, Fanny, out of herclass in a "ringing" campaign in the West and East, and the mare was also expelled. Frank R. Hajden, for furnishing testi mony in case, was reinstated during good behavior, {is wa§ also George Hos sack, suspended a yeAr ago for fraud, and Frederick W. Noble, who was sus pended a year ago for pulling Fred M in a race. The most notable case be fore the board was that of William McGuigan, of Michigan, who was ex pelled twelve years ago for being a party to the famous "ringing" cam paign with Small Hopes, which re sulted in the expulsion of the horse and all concerned. The late W. H. Vander bilt afterwards bought Small Hopes, and, with him and Lady Mack to wagon made the then best team record of 2:23. McGuigan has been trying for reinstate ment ever since, and succeeded to-day. POLO ON SKATES. The Team From Minneapolis De- feats the Saintly City Boys. Polo on skates was inaugurated for the season at the Jackson street rink last evening, the contestants being teams representing St. Paul and Min neapolis, the latter winning two straight goals. Minneapolis put out Capt. Dick Moore, first rush : W. Heffel finger, goal; F. March, second rush; J. Urquhart, cover; A. S. Heffelfinger and A. C. McClellan, half-back. St. Paul's team comprised Capt. J. L. Barrett, first rush ; J. S. Smith, second rush : F. Mar shall, cover point; S. G. Painter, home; W. G. Odell, goal, and T. Spear, cover. Standing room was at a premium and the crowd at times encroached on the domain of the players, caus ing a cessation of the games which were marked with the most brilliant play throughout. Both goals obtained by the visiting team were won by their captain, who showed himself a plucky, expert polo player, and his work was very encouraging to his men. Steps have been taken looking to the organ ization of a polo league in this city, and communications on the subject to be addressed tothe manager of the Jackson Street rink. Next Tuesday evening the championship season will begin with a game between the St. Paul and St. George clubs, and Thursday evening the St. Pauls will play the Lelands, who vanquished them last evening, the game being merely an exhibition, and will not count in the championship series. TO THE TURF CONGRESS. A Delegate From the Twin Cities Driviiii; and Jockey Club. The directors of the Twin Cities Driv ing and Jockey club held a meeting yes terday afternoon at W. L. McGrath's store for the purpose of selecting a dele gate to attend the Turf congress to be held at Cincinnati, on the 14th inst It has been determined by the club to hold a running meeting here, providing the proper dates can be secured. Such a meeting can be held here only by fixing dates between the St. Louis and Chicago meetings, so that the horses can be brought right, here from St. Louis, on their way to Chicago. Unfortunately, Kansas City desires to hold a similar meeting, aiid. and it is supposed that she will want the same dates that St. Paul desires. The only way to secure the meeting is to send a delegate to the Turf congress. Probably Kansas City will also have a delegate there to urge the claims of that city for the meeting. The fact that Ed Corrigan with his large string of horses lives in Kansas City, will naturally have some weight in favor of the latter town. 1). W. Wood mansee was elected and he will leave Sunday night for Cincinnati. Cushion Caroms. There was some lively belting at the cushion caroms tournament last even ing, on the game between Hay ward and Cohen, the former having to play 85 to his opponent's 80, but he was equal to the task and finished his string while Cohen was piling up 56 by hard work. lay ward's highest run was ~ in the forty-eight innings played. Waterman and Smith played] an interesting game, the score at the finish showing the first named a winner by 60 to 40. although the loser made the highest run. 7. An other surprise came when Wolfson. by same plucky uphill playing, wrested a victory from Miller, who had conceded odds 60 to 50, but could only obtain 47 for his work. McDonald and the St. Joe Kid. A match was made yesterday between Lemuel McGregor, "The St. Joe Kid." and Paddy McDonald, of Duluth. It is to he and eight-round glove contest, Marquis of Queensberry rules, for (X) and 40 per cent of the gate receipts, to occur the evening of Jan. 10 at Dulutli. The '•Kid" will weigh, when in condition, 160 pounds, while McDonald will prob ably tip the scales at 170 or 175 pounds. Both men are known to be came, and the match should be a good one. While McDonald is a little heavier, the Kid will more than offset this advantage by superior science. Glove Contest at Kau Claire. Special to the ('lobe. Eau Claire, Dec. B.— A glove con test has been arranged to take place Monday evening atthe Griffin Rifles' armory between F. A. Cook, of St. Louis, the "boy heavyweight.'' and J. W. ('in of Hail ('[aire, with three ounce gloves, for **I<K) and 75 per cent of the gate receipts. Cook is 0 feet 3 and weighs 180 stripped. On a Solid Basis. Special to the Glohe. Oshkosh, Wis.. Dec. Manager Seele, of the Omaha team, is in the city. He says that the Western associaton is on a solid basis and will make a great showing next season. lie has signed nine men of the Oshkosh pennant team and Miller, of La Crosse. Kansas City, he claims, has a rattling nine. Posted a Forfeit. Special to the Globe. Omaha, Neb., Dec. s.— Ed Rothery, one of Omaha's moneyed sporting men, called at the Herald oflice to-night and posted a forfeit of £00 for a light be tween Tommy Miller, Omaha's feather weight, and the winner of the Warren- Weir fight for $500 a side, the only con dition stipulated being that the fight must take, place within fifty miles of Omaha. The Chicago Anarchists. Chicago, Dec. B.— lnstead of the one entertainment at battery D armory, that was choked off by the hostility of Mayor Roche, or the three that were talked of yesterday, the anarchists to day deei'ded to have no less lian five different festivals at five different halls in various portions of the city for the benefit of the families of the dead or imprisoned anarchists. One will be held Saturday, two Sunday and two Tuesday. The halls engaged all have licenses to sell liquors, so there will be no further diffi culty on that score. The tickets for the collapsed festival are to be honored at any of the others. It is announced to night that the burial of the executed anarchists will take place at Waldheim Christmas day. A Dynamite Package. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. B.— A Topeka special says that United States Marshal Jones received by mail this evening a small tin box. Efforts were made to open it successfully by Col. Jones, ex-Gov. Glick and Deputy Marshal Sharett. The contents were found to be nitro-glyce rine in sufficient quantity to have blown up the building and killed a dozen men. No clue to the perpetrator or his motive can be given, except that the box was wrapped in a Denver Republican dated Dec. 6. The postmark was illegible. Imprisonment for Life. Marshaletown, 10., Dec. The jury in the Nathan Rainsbarger murder trial brought in a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and fixed the punishment at imprisonment for life. Motion for a new trial will be made, but will probably be denied. A Bulgarian Candidate. Vienna, Dec. The Correspond ence de lEst states that Russia has agreed to accept tbe Duke of Gothland, the second son of the king of Sweden, as a candidate for the throne of Bulga ria in place of Prince Ferdinand. Murder and Suicide. Montbose, 10., Dec. B.— Thomas Ellis, Jr., who. was being sued for di vorce by his wife, went to her house this afternoon and shot her fatally, lie then killed himself. . DANGER OF LEPROSY. A Well-Known Scand navian Says the Disease is Not Contagious. How the People of the Nor wegian Hospital City, Ber gen, Regard It. The Theory That It Is Brought On by Fish Eating Prob ably Not Correct. No Cause for Apprehension in erica— A Thrust at Sensation Mongers. To the Editor of the Globe. Your editorial columns of Thursday contained an article bearing on the sub ject of leprosy, which, owing to the coiispictiousness and prominence of your widely circulated journal, necessarily challenges great attention. I am con vinced that you do not desire to serve any other end than that of legitimate public discussion of what you discern as a possible danger. May I therefore be permitted to state the following facts bearing on the case: The writer was born and raised in the city of Bergen, Norway, where are located the only two hospitals in Scandinavia exclusively de voted to the cure or life-long care of sufferers from this deplorable disease. The two hospitals contain from 500 to 100 patients of both sexes and collected there from the entire coast of Norway, covering with its inumerable fjords, islands and bays at least 10,000 miles of shore line. These two hospitals are located, one almost in Till-; HEART OF THE CITY of Bergen, a city appproximating 50,000 people. The other in the immediate suburbs, surrounded with line gardens. One of these hospitals is some fifty years old ; the other about twenty-five, and was built not so much because it was wanted as with a view of seeing what more modern architecture and favorable surroundings would do for the victims of this sad affliction, for be it borne in mind in Norway as well as all other portions of the world subject to modern civilization, the disease is stead ily- declining. What I particularly de sire to call attention to. however, is the well known fact that the residents of my native city had just about as much dread of these men and women thus ■stricken, as far as contagion is con cerned, as the residents of St. Peter in this state have of being 

AFFLICTED WITH INSANITY, because of the location of the state hos pital for insane in their midst. These patients, so far as they are able to be about, have the perfect freedom of the city. From earliest chidhood I was in the habit of meeting them on the streets without a vestige of dread. Many of them are expert makers of brushes, combs, etc., which they were permitted to peddle on the streets. The physicians in charge of them reside at the hospitals with their families. They are generally men of the highest stand ing in their profession, and are conse quently greatly sought after in outside practice, from which neither law nor custom in any way debarred them. One of them, I recall distinctly, was for ten years TIIK MOST COURTED CLUBMAN and considered the most eligible match in the most cultivated and aristocratic circles of Bergen society. On Sundays it is a common thing tor the religious and philanthropically inclined citizens togo to these hospitals, carrying flow ers, fruit, etc.. and extend such cheer and favor as are possible to the inmates. Asa child I often accompanied my pa rents on such trips, for these lepers are almost entirely separated from their kindred. Owing to the distance they are brought, one could scarcely claim any relative in the city. They invaria bly belong to the peasant class and, to that class of peasantry which occupies the extreme west coast, getting a pre carious existence from often uncertain fishing. Whether or not the fish diet these men consume is responsible, for the disease is something the greatest medical experts differ on. What is far more likely, is that GENERATIONS OF TOILERS subsisting on poor diet in general, mixed with very bad whisky, subject to months of exposure in an extremely damp, cold climate, forced during the winter time particularly to sleep and work in the same clothes, crowded into miserable lodging bouses, badly built, because serving only a temporary pur pose—conditions like these and inter marriage between this particular and almost isolated class of fishermen-peas ants, appear to be the underlying causes. That this is so is attested by the fact that very often the further progress of the disease is arrested as soon as the patient is transferred to the hospital and put under more natural conditions of existence. Whether or not this ailment is contagious, at least in the form in which itappearsin North ern Europe, is a point on which the greatest experts have been unable to reach an DEFINITE CONCLUSION. It will be borne in mind that neces sarily the character of this ailment dif fers and is modified in its manifesta tions in a cold Northern climate from what it would develop in Palestine or on the Sandwich islands. Dr. Daniels, of Bergen, is a recognized authority the world over in this branch of medical science. After thirty years of actual residence among those afflicted he was the very personification of health and vigor, and was present some years ago at a medical congress in Paris, after more than half a century of experience of meeting men and women afflicted with more or less leprosy in the streets of Bergen. The citizens feel no more apprehension from their two hospitals, containing these unfortunates, than they do from the yellow fever hospitals in Sew Orleans. " These are the actual facts in the case. THE 

PUBLIC APPREHENSION, therefore, which has been aroused by some highly seasoned asinine press dispatches, is absolutely without basis in fact. Of course it is eminently proper that the patients in question should at once be put under proper medical care whenever discovered. The Scandinavian race of to-day, including the Swedish Finlanders and Icelanders, represent a total of about 10,000,000. They are in descent and general race characteristics identical with the great Anglo-Saxon and German types. The fact that they occupy the northwestern frontier of Europe simply means that their forefathers were the banner bear ers, the pioneers of new homes, the most venturesome and the pluckiest sons of the great Aryan family. The Northwest has welcomed 700.000 of them. Uncle Sam has granted them THE only boon they have asked— the privilege to toil. They have worked with a will, and while all Scandinavians freely concede the commercial generalship to the sons to the manner born, we claim a front rank among the rank and file who have made the Northwest what it is. Out of nearly a million immigrants of the Scandinavian race, I doubt if there are 3,000 of them belonging to the class of fishermen peasants referred to. I do not believe that there are one dozen authen ticated cases in the entire United States from this class.and from the above facts you will see how utterly unfounded are the fears sought to be nursed by sensa tional correspondents. The Scandina vians are to-day what they always have been, among the most vigorous and morally wholesome nations in the world. From the very class above spoken of have come some of the BRAVEST SAILORS, and pilots on any coast in tlie world men to whom it is an everyday occur rence to face the raging North sea, with a view to saving life and treasures, often -hazarding everything they hold dear to rescue others. As a class, they do not immigrate. If they do. the clim ate and conditions in the interior act as a positive antidote. This has been actually investigated by Norwegian scientists sent here for that specific purpose, and officially so reported. In view of all these facts, the writer be speaks for the unfortunate few dis covered to be so afflicted, the most hu mane and considerate treatment con sistent with their condition, for they do not. I emphatically insist, involve 'any danger to their keepers under the proper conditions, and finally, in justice to Scandinavians at large, and in order to allay utterly unfounded and worse than useless apprehensions, the papers which have published these false alarms should be courteous enough to print this refutation. Respectfully. O. Ellison. A FAMOUS POEM. Why Mrs. Sarah J. Hale Wrote "Mary Had A Little Lamb." Philadelphia Times. The authorship of "Mary had a Little Lamb" has been ascribed to various persons and many romantic stories have been told regarding its composition. To Mrs. Hale's family we are indebted for the following account of the circum stances which led to its production. In 1827 Dr. Lowell Mason was induced to lend his musical talents to Boston, and while there gave especial attention to the training of children in vocal music, being the first person to introduce singing into the public schools. In order to make these singing classes at tractive Dr. Mason requested Mrs. Hale and other writers to furnish him with verses suited to the capacity of children, and of a kind to interest them. In re ponse to this request, Mrs. Hale, ever ready to lend a hand in any good work, composed a series of little poems for childien, which were set to music by Mr. Mason and sung in the schools of Boston and afterward throughout the country. Among these were the well known, "If ever I see, on bush or tree," and the world-famous "Mary's Lamb," which was founded on an incident of the writer's own childish experience. A farmer's (laughter, she had had in her New Hampshire home her own little pet lamb, that followed her wherever she went. Devotedly fond of animals and making pets of birds and kittens from her earliest to her latest years, this busy editor and mother of a family turned aside from her pressing cares to write these verses, which have found a sympathetic echo in the hearts of chil dren all over the country. In 1830 the poems thus composed were published in book form under Mrs. Hale's signature, with a number of other songs and rhymes, affectionately dedicated to all good children in the United States. BUFFALO IRISHMEN. They Meet and Pass Resolutions Buffalo, N. V., Dec. 8 A meeting of Irishmen was held to-night at which resolutions were passed denouncing Joseph Chamberlain because of his op position to home rule for Ireland, and regretting the fact that Secretary Whit ney's wife had arranged to entertain Mr. Chamberlain at Washington. The meeting was rather boisterous, and the principal participants were men who went from Buffalo to Hamilton to act there as a body guard for William O'Brien, editor of United Ire land. The meeting was held at John Nelson's place at the corner of Massachusetts street and Prospect avenue. There wire about 100 Irishmen present, most of whom be long to the Fenian organization here. Hon. T. B. O'Brien was president of the meeting, and James P. McMahon, formerly foreman on the government breakwater, was secretary. The fol lowing are the resolutions adopted: Whereas. Joseph Chamberlain, who is a strong opponent of home rule in Ire land, is now in this country, and so dis trusts the government that* he has with him paid hirelings as detectives to pro tect him from no real danger, thereby easting reflections on our form of gov ernment with the idea of reflecting on such a form of government as Ireland wants, therefore Besolved, That the Irishmen of Buf falo in meeting assembled repudiate any movement that may be made to wards entertaining Chamberlain, who is chiefly responsible for the defeat of home rule in Ireland and the despotic coercion laws now existing, whereby Editor O'Brien and Lord Mayor Sulli van and other patriots are immured in Tullamore dungeon. Resolved, That the Irishmen of Amer ica ought to arrange for a convention to show that this country is not opposed to home rule. Judge Rea at Columbus. Columbus, 0., Dec. B.—Commander in-Chief Pea, of the Grand Army of the Republic arrived here early this morn ing, and was escorted by the reception committee to the Neil house, where the council of administration was in session all day. The question of time of hold ing. tlie national encampment next year was the main subject nf discussion, but this was broken in upon by the receipt of several letters urging that it be held at some other place, that Columbus would not be able to accommodate so large a crowd. This proposition is not likely to carry. The time will probably be fixed for some date in September. A reception at the board of trade was ten dered to-night. Barbour for Senator. Richmond, Va., Dec. B.— A caucus of Democratic members of the geheral as sembly to-night nominated by acclama tion Hon. John S. Barbour for election as United States senator to succeed Sen ator Riddleberger, whose term will ex pire March 4, ISN9. The caucus also made the following nominations for state officers : For secretary of the com monwealth, Henry W. Flourney; for auditor of public accounts, Morton Marye; for second auditor, F. (1. Puffin; for treasurer, A. W. Harmon; for super intendent of penitentiary, W.W. Moses. All of the officers above named arc the present incumbents. "*■•'?: Sensational Divorce Case. Chicago. Dec. Council for Mary Oakley Carson, the wife of James D. Carson, general manager of the Cliicago & Western Indiana railroad, and also general manager of the Belt line road, filed a bill for a divorce to-day in the circuit court. Mrs. Carson charges in her bill that her husband has been cruel, unfaithful and. drunken. She is the daughter of James \V. Oakley, a Chicago millionaire, and is a leading so ciety lady. Her husband is the son of John B. Carson, the railway magnate. The case promises to be very sensa tional, as Mrs. Carson's charges are, it is stated, supported by strong proof. An Oversight on his Part. Altoona Times. The other day a loving husband took his wife's best pitcher to draw some cider. As he was going down stairs he slipped, and in order to save the crock ery, injured himself considerably. While he was rubbing his shin very vig orously the wife, thoughtless of his in jury, cried out, "Oh. mercy I have you broken the pitcher?" "No,' £ hays he. in great wrath' "but I'll be d— d if I don't," and ging-a-ling went the pitcher against the cellar wall. Has Paid the Penalty. Chicago, Dec. B.— Word was received here to-da/of the death of Mrs. Re becca Hall at Lexington, Ky. She was noted as the wife of Capt. W. W. Hall, of the United States secret service, who met a tragic death at her hands. Steamship Arrivals. Queenstown— Britannic and Ne vada, from New YorS. Southampton— Aller, from New York for Bremen.
