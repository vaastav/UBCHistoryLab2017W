Wt .hope .the gallant Democrat- of New Jewer' will tee to it In Advance of the Constitution. One ' of' the Abolition revolutionary newspapers, in referring to the Emancipa tion Proclamation, pats Lincoln on the shoulder in the following atyle : It says of hint:1 .... ,.. "Jl cast! loose from all political entangle- menu and than the moulbe of all partisan caviller, by taking a ate 4a enhance of the constitution and drawing the nrord to defend it tie attack) only rebellion; he make wnr upon no institutions and no political or social rights. Ha presents to treason the alter native of nabmiatioo or puniahrnetit, not by the law, but by the sword.'' Not by the law, but by tho sword ;" that's the idea. Mr. Lincoln has cut the gordian knot ; he has crossed the Rubicon; he baa advanced, beyond the constitution, and drawn the sword to defend his posi tion. By usurpation he presents the al ternative of submission or punishment. By an act of treason to the government he proposes to punish treason. - Both being traitors, it is only a question of brute force between them-t-the strongest must con quer and the weakest must yield. ' It is no longer a cohtest for Union, constitution or government of any kind, but a gladiator ial struggle for supremacy, to be decided not by the law but by the swonl. For this conflict Mr. LitroLS, by the voice of his partisans,- is no longer - President he waa only President tinder the constitution -but having taken a step in 1 advance of the constitution and draw the sword to de fend it. ha has abandoned the government, and is now only . the big bully uf the crowd. ' " .. JQTThere is no word in tho Luglibh language which has bceu more abused thuu the term loyol. It is a good, honest word, meaning faithful aud true, sincere and con sistent. It is a catholic word not a sec tional, sectarian or party designation ; it expresses frank, bold and open' adherence to principle not a blind devotion ot ser vile submission to power, A loyal uihu is notlieCefsaTfly a loyalist to fie lrfjTrl' is to be true to himself, true to his obligation to tivialiows, to society aud to his tiouu try ; the loyalist is simply an adherent of kingly power, and may be false to every principle which governs tho truly loyal man. The distinction between the two par ties at the present time is that between the loyal and the loyalists the one believing they have fullfield all their obligations to the government when they have met ull the requirements of the constitution nnd the laws ; the other holding every man disloyal who does not yield unqualified submission and approval to the ruling party.'-' When a man becomes a loyalist, he parts with everjr prerogative of a soy. ereign citizeu'and becomes a subject.

Seward and the Elections. The New York Herald, In speaking of the recent letter of Secretary Seward to the Ameri can Minister at London, explaining the recent elections in the Northern and Western Status, says: ' "-i .;v- "Mr. Secretary Seward, in bis letter to the Hon Charles Francis Adams, our Minister at London, explaining the elections in the loyal States fur the Information of the English Cabinet, .throws out the idea that these elec tions do iiotatnoeat to much In their politic! party results, as applied to the important quss tions of this war. We can tell Mr. Seward, however, that in this idea he is very wide of the msrk, and that the late remarkable popu lar reaction in the loyal States amounts to nothnsj less Uiau a condemnation by the peo ple of the way in which the war, under the evil counsels of ths Abolition radicals, has been mi'mnnnged down to this time. ' The people, with the pressure : upon them of war taxes, war prices, and a depredated shinplaa ter currency, kc, Ac , have simply declared that their blood and treasure must no longer be squandered under the foolish and ruinous instructions of the Abolition taction. Let this faction continue, therefore, to guide the parly in power, and next year there will be great improvement upon thesu late elections; and in ltf'it, with the Presidential olection, every vestige of Abolitionism, with the domi nant party of this day, will be swept off. Such is the meaning of these lata Northern, elec tions, which, Mr. Seward , unfortunately has failed to discover." ' '- - -- - - - ' ' The President's Logic. Ths Boston Cburirr, In an article nu that portion of the President's Message which at tributes the cause of the war to the existence of slavery, says: - . . i : " "Mr. Lincoln's ingenious, though not origi nal . obsurfatiouj that, if there had ti o slavery there would have been no re bellion, bos somotitneg 'been compared with the equally logical sequence, thut if no one travelled on the high-ways with money in his pockets, there would be no highwaymen The truth is, we msy begin in such a chain of reasoning just where we ' see tit If the world bad not been created, with various races vpon it, of diverse characteristics, ' capacities and dispositions ; if the necessities, or opin ions, or prejudices of society were not such as they are; we should have had no freesoil party, no Chicago platform, no division among the Democratic party, giving the opportunity for the Republican minority to succeed, uud Consequently, no Mr, Lincoln for President. In tbe latter case we should, of course, have bad no rebellion." The Dubuque Herald. , Said Dr. Olds to "Judge Advocate" Tur ner : "The Administration may persecnte me eveu unto death, 1 am iu its power, but it cannot take from me my hohor.or self-respect." Thu world need Dot look further for true heroism, for it has it here. It need uot re-in. state Bomba in order to feel (ha heavy hand of tyrranny, for it has it here. There are but two figures in this picture the one, Abraham Lincoln, or some one of tho many creatures to whom he has delegated his own usurped power, and his victim. The Government, em ploying all the power legimately within its employ, und failing iu thut overstepping lim its which it has sworn to observe, to punish one ol its citizens whom it does not dare to put upon trial for any oll'ausa ; whatever. Wrilhing under the punishment which this betieficeiit Government is, without aggrava tion, indicting, the victim calmly declares, "I am in ilt puKer ; i'Iimm jtertecute me even unto ileal h, but it cannot take away from me my honor or my telf-respeet." Glorious Dr. Olds. As the reculleetion of the Administration which oppresses you shall become a slink in the uostrils of men, your memory rising higher in our estimation day by day, shall prove to us a valuable exemplar teaching us how to aut, when an nnworthy deed is demanded from us as the price of liberty or ease; and these words of yours, while they shall be branded upon the forehead of the usurpers, as the sentence of their con demnation shall be to us apples of gold in pictures of silver.

Mormonism and Double Love. Not long since a company of Mormon emigrants arrived at Boston oa their way to Ltah. Among them was noticed a young man more distinguished in bis appearance ttoan the remainder of the company, and ne r fciro -two young, femalos deeply veiled, whose delicate grace Snd reserve indicoted them as belonging to a superior social posi tion. Their history merits relation. Lud wig Keroe was the son of a rich land owner in 6woden; and the two young ladies were two orphans who were brought op with him in his father's family,' until he left for College at Dou the im, where ho remained several years, and afterwards traveling over the greater part of Europe, his former play mates were forgotten. ' Returning at last to his home, ho ' was astonished to find two beautiful women, dazzling as the Undine of . tie was struck to the boart as with an ar row. Love conquered him at first sight He was in love, but with which one? Both Were splendid! v beautiful. He was enam ored of both. Ila was in a whirlpocl of doubt, indecision, and perplexity. It was necessary to come to some decision, and he naturally came to the most droll one. In an excess of despcrsto frankness he related to tha two young ladies the state of his feel ings. They laughed at him at first, then they reflected, and the result of their re flection was that they both loved Ludwig, and were as embarrassed as he. About this time ens of the Mormon; apostles, passing through the plsoe.sought to make proselytes to the doctrines of the riaintu, and converted the young man and the two girls. Thus Ludwig Feroe and biscompaiiions,Mina and Kvohe.form a part of the Mormon emigrants on their way to Salt Lake, where their ro mance of love and duplication of wives will be 8eedily divested of all charm by the low associations sround them. ' i. "Poor" Children. There are philanthropic ' people in New York, who make it their business to look af ter the half-clad, shivering children of the poor. ' This is all right. I propose now, that there be another set of philanthropists started, to look after tbe half-clad shiverme children of the rich,, It is a novel ides, I know, but if you jutat use your eyes as you pass about tbe streets, you will acknowledge that I am not so crazy after all. See the fur-border that forms the trimming of thut little live year old-ei's velvet coat, reaching with a beautiful consistency, hmt tn thnealvnu of her little bare purplo legs, with a rim of ttiiu wnite stocking peroeptiblo just above her fairy foot. See the jaunty little crown of foathors and velvet perched on the very top of ber head, leaving the entire back of it, as well as tho red ears, exposed to the biting cold winds. Look at the thin, white embroidered Crock, appearing Just below the utiia veivot coat, ana see it there is not work hsro for a ."city missionary," as well ss a good fouudatian laid in earlv life for rheumatism, neuralgia, croup, and forty oth er pleasant things most agreeable to the medical fraternity, and undertakers general ly. To be euro tho children of fashionable mothers, who porpotrate such -folly, were better, porhsps, for their own sakes, under ground thsn above it, and thsl is the only reason I haven't before this orgsuiaed the philanthrypio society I have above alluded to, for tho amelioration of thoir suffering. 

FANNY FERN. Our "Turret Batteries" VS. Foreign Intervention. appears from a experiment that a fifteen inch gun, charged with thirty-flvo pounds of powder, snd a solid ball, the force of which no marine armor at present is use can resist, csn be fired from the turret of one of our new first-class gunboats without pro ducing much mora noiso inside tbe turret than would be occasioned by the discharge of a muket in the open air; and furthermore that one of these enormous weapons can be served and managed by three men ! The idea of firing guns of a smaller bora than the oue referred to, from Iron cupolas, was re cently given up in Mngland, partly from fear of the effects of the conclusion, and partly bcrausa it was deemed impossible to crowd into ths enclosed space a sufficient number of men to work the pieces! '. Our transatlan tic noighbora will learn with astonishment that we have overcome the -obstacles they deemed insurmounable, and are prepared to sitrti their Warriors, Black 1'rinces and Le Gloircs with our irresistible "Monitors" as easily as those mnch vaunted "monsters.' could riddle tbe wooden wall of an old fash' ioned 74. "Forcible intervention" in our domestic affair, on tho part of oither of tbe two "groat maritime powers ol Furope," would under these circumstances be rather hazardous; and, besides we are about to build some new plated craft.
