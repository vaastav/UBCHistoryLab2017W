R. Ü. HUDSON, EDITOR. TEURE HAUTE. IND. WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 12, 18C0 -. . South Carolina Secestisn. If there is any species of the genua homo for which we bare doubla superlative contempt, it is one of those blustering, brawling, loud mouthed, street corner bra TtJocs. Those fellows who are always courageous when there is no danger; brim fall of heroism when a reasonable distance from attack, and pugnacious only when ell protected from harm. There are such men in every community, in every State and ia every nation. Terre Haute has bad tome illustrious examples of this kind of ßghting men Indiana is blessed with a few, and South Carolina, Georgia and Al abama are now full of them. Gaseous, fulminating, exploding braggadocios, who threaten, days, weeks, months and years to strike a blow, but never do it. .Our contempt for those South Carolina heroes who con gre gale around Washington , crowd into the lobbies and fill some of the seats in the Representatives' Hall, has ac tually ripened into perfection. If this tur bulent littla State with her great excess of negroes, bas determined to go out of the Union, TAy does she not go along 7 She will nerer be able to generate enough gas, to push bcr out. All of her rain boasting and supercilious threatening will never get ber out. Her hypothetical assumptions tod dogmatical declarations will never separate her from the rest of the Union. She must strike the blow commit the "orert" act resist successfully all the powers of the Federal gorernment, before she can be sovereign and independent. Why does she not do it f v by wait ? Why bait when revolution is the watchword and revolution the remedy. The coiled up serpent when it rattles its death rattle and hisses its warning to the approaching foe, strikes instantly, imme diately, certainly and heroically. It hisses and strikes, rattles and gives the death blow. Why does not South Carolina strike her contemplated blow and stop ber bias ing ? Why burden the telegraphic wires with further declarations from Southern members in the national Congress, that tfcej are "already out of the Union !" If so, why are they not hissed from the Fed eral Cengress and driven from the Federal capital ? Washington should not be a rcn- desTous for traitors to the Union and pa IrioU should not associate with those who breathe treason against this General Gov ernment. If South Carolina has determined to go out of this Union, why does she not go along T Why so much bluster and bravado? Let her strike the blow, if tht daret. If she is stronger than the Federal govern tneut she will succeed, if not she matt come back to her allegiance. The great North, conscious of being in the right, has no compromises to make with this rcbl Slate. The North bas battled alone for principle it is victorious gloriously, proudly victorious, and it can not compromise principle. The time for compromises to appease traitors has gone by. Let the doctrine b now maintained, once and for ever, that the will of the majtrity is the supreme law, aad that the majority of the American people mast, and will rule. Let the rebel Stato of South Carolina but know this let ber statesmen, politicians and slaveholders but know and feci the full force of this unshaken determination en part of the free people of the North, and her vaporing will end in smoke, and if the Union can be saved, this will im it. We must not givo back one inch ef ground we have already gained surren, der not one doctrine which is right yield nothing which conflicts with the geeat interest of humanity and deter mine to defend our present position at all limes and under all circumstances. What else can we do and be men? What other coersocaawe pursue and maintain that dignity ef individual feeling and collec tive respect which becomes a free, inde pendent, American citisen. We have in terfered with none of the rights, privilegos, r immunities of South Carolina. We have never disturbed Lir institutions in anyway, and have always declared we had not the least idea of ever doing so. Tt S II im -personal noeriy laws ' of some of the States of this If u ion, if they are unconstitutional and conflict with the Federal laws, are of coarse inoperative aad void, and are as dead as tbocgb tbey were repealed. The nJt f the master to follow his escaped hlave into anj o the fre Slates, capture and take hicn Lack ts a constitutional right, which has hardly ever teen interfered with by the Worth. But tb doc tri do thai the ilire- holdcr has the right, under the constitutisn to take his klares into the corumou territo ries; which the South aud the President are now asking tLe North to concede, wil nerer be conceded nerer, so long as there is freedom north of Mason and Dixon's line so long as there is ore sympathetic impulse for our common humanity thrilling the heart of free men so long as patriotism is cherished and the right respected, this most unconstitutional doctrine will never be acquiesced in by true men any where Let South Carolina secede, if the let dissolution come if it will let civil wsr with its infernal brood sweep over this fair land, devastating our fields and checking our prosperity but If we adhere to the right-stand boldly forth as champions of a great truth and an unfaltering failh, as did Sbadrach, Meshaeh, and Abed nego, refusing to worship the image which has been erected for that purpose, like those heroic and cosciencious men, we will come out of this fiery furnace, cleansed of all i mpnritie, more glorious Ibaa heretofore. and with not even the small bf fire upon wir firmest. What win h9 the ltesult! The telegraph informs us that theeicrht Gulf Stato i are certain to secede from the Union, a'td will form a separate and in drpeJst government. What kioj of a government this will be the secedcrs do not inform us. Whether Stato liaes will be obliterated, aad all units in one consoli dated government, we are not told. Whether it will be a limited Monarcy, a Despotism, a Republic, or a pure Democ racy what kind of a " Southern Confed eracy" it is going to be, we opine even the traitors themselves do not know. And whea they come to organise-when all the conflicting interests, all the ambitious hopes, all the personal aspirations, ae.1 all mooted interests have to be accomodated, we are impressed with the belief that Southern agitators will find the inaugura tion of h new government a more difficult undertaking than the anticipated. There ie hardly one roan in any of those Gulf states, equal to the task. Hot heads and Aery hearts ar nt the men te baild up a system of gcvernmect they are only fit to pull it down. The merest pretender and most unskillful botch can pull downjihe most beautiful fabric ever reared by mortal hands. The mere apprentice in building, can destroy at one fell blow, the patient work of a great mauler. The almost di vine creations of Angelo and Jiaphacl those immortal productions upon which they spent almost tteir whole lircs, can be obliterated, cut In fragments in a few mo ments, by the rack less desperation of a madman. Th eEphsian Temple, the proud est work of ancient architectural art, was de stroyed in a few hocrs, by the vandalism of one man. A Mow from the arm of a sav age can knock the A polo Belvidcre into fragments, and the strength of an infant could hurl from itsezact equipoise the most nicely balanced spe;imeoof the mechanical arts. It is easy to destroy, but difficult to erect. How thoso Southern fire-eaters will succeed in hnUding up a govern ment, remains to be seen. That they are expert in pulling ouedown, seems to be the fact. It requires patient toil, disinter ested labor, and a cool, clear head to lay the foundation, erect the pillows, and turn the dome of a gret.t governmental fabric. Impulse will not do itjangerwillnotdo it; imbittcred feeling will not do it nothing but the most enlightened labor, persistant toil, christian philmthrophy and disinter ested benevolence can do it. Arc these qualifications common among the fire eat ersofthe South? Who is to be the ßnt man in this "Southern Confederacy?" who the architect.? who will hold the rule and the square? who direct the gavel and the plumel? Shall it be Yancey, Keith, Toombs or Iverson? Who is to be the President, Emperor, Monarch, Despot? These arc questions mora difficult to set tle tkao perhaps th it of secession. Yet.thcse are questions that will hare to be settled. and settled by these exceeding States alone; if, in their madness, they ever sever the allegiance which they owo to the Feder al Constitution. It is easy to pull down, but it is diülcult to build up. The woodsman, iu an hour. prostrates on the ground the giant oak which it has required centuries to pro duce it was easv to fell it, but it would require the uuited strength of giants to erect it aeain. It may be more diffi cult aye, a thousand fold more difH cult, for a Southern Confederacy to bo formed fully and completely organised all the different departments in full harmo ny each wheel revolving without a jar within a wheel; then it is to abjure all al leeiance to this Union and scperatc forever from the parental euro of this General Gov ernment.

She was only brought bsck to com parative reason under the heary touch of Andrew Jackson's iron rod. In I860 tho same Stale avows ber fixe! purpose to set the Federal authority at de fiance, id assorts the right of separat sot reign ty just a the did twenty seven years ago. It is instructive to compare tho sentiments expressed by the Chief Magistrates of the nation then and now. Getcral Jackson told South Carolina, in words so plain that in the hottest fury of her mal fever she could not choose bnl stop and listen, that her act was treason and that its punish ment was death. James Buchauan a de generate and degraded Democrat meel a similar issue by frankly avowing that the threats of South Carolina havo frightened hire, and that he has no power to act, neith er has Congress; to coerce a rebellious State would be n act of usurpation;" to deny the right of peaceable secession is to "make war gainst a State;" to employ force wonld bo "to banish all hope of peaceable reconstruction." Comparisons are sometimes opposite, aud precedents are the strength of legal argu mcnt. Suppose wc put Mr. Buchanan and General Jackson in contrast, disagreeable though it must be to the former to be plac ed side by side with one so raueh his su perior in all that constitute courage and manliness. Hero is what Jackson said lu 1832, and what Buchanan says in 18G0: James Bcchaxax, Dee. 3, 1860. A Dart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable, the Execu tive lias no a u lb only to decide wiiat shall be the relations between the Federal Gov ernment and South Carolina. lie has been intrusted with no such discretion. He possesses no power to chsnge the relations hereto I ore existing ietwcen inera, mucu less to acknowledge the independence of that State. This would be to invest a mere Executive officer with the power of recoz niztner the dissolution of the confederacy among our thirty three sovereign Slates. It bears no resemblance of the recognition of a foreign de acte government, involving no such responsibility. Any attempts to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress me whole question in all its bearings. The coarse of events is so rapidly hast ling forward that the emerg ency may sr in ante when you may be cal led upon to decide the momentous ques lion whether you possess the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union. I shoal 1 feel mypelf recre ant to my duty were I not to express an I opinion ou this important subject The question, fairly stated, is: lias the Constitution delegated lo Congress the power to coerce a State into submission, which 19 attempting to withdraw, or has virtually withdrawn from tho confederacy?

Having the fullest confide nco in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my du ties which has been expressed, I rely with equal confidence on your undivided sup port in my determination to execute the laws; to preserve the Union by all consti tutional means; to arrest, if possible, by moderate but firm measures, the necessity of a recourse to force; and if it be the will of Heaven that tho recurrence of its prime val curse on man for the shedding of a brother a blood should fall upon our land, that it be not called down by any offen sive acton the part of the United btates. tTBut little good was expected of Mr. Buchanan's message; thereforo, its perossl will not c reite any great disappointment among the people. The present slate of publio affairs af forded him a fine opportuaity to rise, su perior to the mere politician, and lo act the part of a patriot and a statesman; that opportunity ht has failed to improve, and his administration will be recorded on the page of history as distinguished for noth ing, except corruption and impecility. The times require a Jacksonia the chair of Stale, and we have simply got Buchanan. lie shows conclusively, by his own rea sou ing, and by the authority of illustrious names, that a Slnte has no right to secede; that secession is soother name for revolution aud yet denies that either, the President or Congress has any power under the Con stilution to prevent such a catastrophe. In 1833 , Congress passed a law, commonly called the "force bill," authorizing the President to use the whole military power of the nation, if necessary, to secure the enforcement of the laws in South Carolina That was considered good constitutional law in the days of Clay and Webs' T and Jackson and Benton; they were men who were supposed to know something of the powers and duties of the varioua depart tuenta of the Uovernment; they were statesmen, not mere partisans, and when resistance to lho laws was threatened, and the integrity of the Union was assailed, they rallied around the old Hero, whose motto was: "The Union; By the Eternal, it roust and shall be preserved." That sentiment must be fully and unreservedly endorsed by our citizens, and maintained, if necessary, "with our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor,1 or else the wisest, and best syatein of Government ever in stituted by Din, will soon be destroyed by demagogues and traitor, and we shall leave to our children, not the glorious In heritance ol freemen, such as was be queathed to us by our ancestors, but the vile heritage of slaves. 

CONGRESSIONAL. Washhtotok, Dec. 10. HOUSE. Mr. Hawkins gave additional reasons why he had asked to be excused from serving on the Union select committee. Florida is a small Slate, but nevertheless is entitled to all the rights and immuni ties of the other States. She caonot be forced lo remain in the Union, and the Southern Stabs are pledged to defend her in the event of attempted coercion. Ho was satisfied of Ihe unanimity pervading that Slate lo seek redress nf its grievance in its own way, and by means oilier than by Cougressionul compromises, which I at tr have never accompPshed nucccssfu purpose He regarJed tho component parts of lho committee as particularly unfortunate. He referred to Mr. Davis of Maryland as not a fit representative f that State; arguing that all who voted for Mr. Pennington for Speaker were disloyal lo the rights of lho South; he regreltod that the resolution for the appointment of the committee came from one of ihe most e-iftcd sons of lho South. Ho gave fair warning that Mississippi Alabama, Florida, Georgia and S Carolina were ccrtr:n to secede, and lo be followed by Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Mr. McClernand remarked that a troub lous future opens up beorus, bulhedi not believe our government can be dissul ved by the eouscnt of any one of Us parts there is more strong la in the government than is generally believed.

RAILROAD OPENING. Public Dinner and Jolification at Rockville. A day of Feasting and joy of Mirth and Gladness. Oriental" Magnificence. ALL ARE SATISFIED. In company with a large number of our fellow-citizens, we accepted an invitation to attend the Publie Dinner given to Gen. Steele, and the grand jolIiScation at the fonnal opening of the Rockville extension Weleft the Union Depot at 9 1-2 o'clock on Thursday morning, on a train composed of 5 passenger coaches each one well filled. The crowd was very appropriately inter spersed with many of the fairest daughters of our fair city. There was als on board a large number of citizens of Evansville, Vincennes and other towns on the south portion of the road. Threading our way slowly through the suburbs of the city, the champing iron steed took his way across the beautiful Prairie to the north with a merry neigh.as if in sympathy with the bounding, joyeus hearts of the human freight he drew. As his reius were loosed by his careful driver. he leaped forward to his task with twice the vigor of a hundred giant, breathing steam aad fire from his nostrils. thk scixiar. As you leave home on this new road the view of the city, receding in the distance, is meanest urn can no naa irom any j point surrounding it; at least such was our impression, and such, we think, was the impression oi miny omers, irom express- ions of admiration uttered in our bearing. The view of Fort Harrison Prairie is de lightful. With its finely cultivated farms. its neat and comfortable looking dwell ings, and the herd3 of well fed cattle, it presents an aspect of thrift and wealth. " , . -;-!,...

TlB Bpeaker briefly re- viewed tho rise and progress of commerce contrast mir its condition ia Ibe earlier aces when it was confined to a few ports In the Mod iterianeian Sea. with its present cen- dition when it whitens with iu sails every ocean, aod traverses every laod. The development of the commerce of the world was a most interesting study. Tbe most rapid development had been made in the new world. Our counUy was adapted to the people and the people to the coun try. The age in which we live is a remar kable one. Instead of the slow methods ot travel of years past we now fly over the country annihilating time aad space. But a few days ago he had been traveling amid the rains and storms on the plains of Kan sas, and was now in the heart of Parke county ..being scarcely able to realize the transition. The Telegraph is the twin brother of Railroads. By the one merch andize of the Atlantic seaboard is laid at our doors in Ihe space of three dsys by the other we are enabled to read yester day's proceedings of Congress at our breakfast tables this morning. The opening of this road put the people of Parke county in immediate connection with all the rest of mankind. Enumerating the benefits to be derived from the opening of this road, the in creased value of real estate tho advance in the price of produce and the reduction in the cost of goods consumed the speaker expressed his astonishment that people should oppose the construction of railroads or should be so illiberal iu their subscrip tions towards them.

Like a successful Gen eral after a victory he felt th at he waa main XJ indebted to tho brave men by whom be uau oeen aurrounuea. as ne had deter mined lo live and die here, ho desired to have speedy communication with the rest of the world. He spoke wilh much feel ing of the energy, enterprise, and public spirit of Mr. Chauncey Hose, and of the dee p debt of grateful due to him for the great efforts he had made in behalf of tho Terre Ilaute and Richmond R. R. Indeed each ap üker was earnest iuh is acknowledge merits that Mr. Rose stood pre eminently at the head of Railroad men in the Wabash raiie.r Judge Ilall of Princeton, was called up on but excused himself after expressing his gratification upon beholding the suc cess of this enterprise. Rev. Aaron Wood, paid a fittiog corapli mcnt to Wm J. Ball and John Ilieo, whose abilities were eu clearly manifest ia the construction of this road. Capt. Thornburg of Qreeocaslle, spoke with much eloquence and earnestness, Rep resenting the Directory of the Terre Ilaute A Richmond R. R., he bad fall a deep interest in the success of. this enter prise. He closed by congratulating lho people of Rockvilleon having opened op lo them an easy communication with the ret of the world, at the same lime con- gralulaling the rest of mankind thitlhey now might have an opportunity of visiting and adm ring ihe fair daughters of Parke County. Mr. John P. Ueher, being called upon said, while he rvjeieed in the completion of this road he could not bat recur to years gone by, and imagine the intense picas uro it would have a Cordte" him had this speedy and convenient melhod of reaching Rockville existed some iflecu years ao when used to plod his way weekly through mad and rain, a task which aothing could havo inspired but that senti mcntof the human heart that puts a man on his highest mettle the love of early man hood. He then gave ihe people of Parke some excellent advice and proceeded to Fpeak al some length on topics appropriate lo lbc occasion in lhat forcible and argumentive style M;highly characteristic of the think ing man aod profound lawyer. His remarks were listened to with fixed altention;being frequently interrupted wilh applause and laughter. Col. Edwards, who had been pre vion sly called upoD.next took the stand and closed this part of Ihe programme, with one of the happiest (Torts of his life. Thia speech was in fact the deteertot this intel lectual feast light,andluxurious. We give his speech entire. Bit. President, Ladies and Cen'.'.emcn: All that can be has already been well aaid. Called out I am obliged lo say something lo bo privileged t retire. This occasion aud the merited eomplimenss bestowed upon those connected with the Railroad inU rests, who have contributed to the result thai brings us together to receive the kindly greetings of the people of Ihe county of Parke, are appreciated; In olden limes, beforo railroads were in operation, when tha water ruled com merce, those living by the sea coast, and upon Ibe borders of inland lakes and rivers, claimed to be within Ihe heart of civilization lo enjoy more fully its bless ings and privitigos. Those residing off from water eotnmouic u i. cred lhat far removed from the benefits and cujojments of refined life. Railroad en terprise, by its wonderful success, has changed Ihis rondilion. and chaioed the leading trade of the world to the ear of commerce, giving lo those living on the lice of railroada lha fullest realisation, and benefit of all the blessings lhat flow frrm progress and matured civilization. That is your position for your are now connected by bands of iron wilh Terre Uaute "and lho rest of mankind. I therefore in the name of the assembled people, declare Rockville from this lime henceforward to be a sea-port town lha head of railroad navigation and from the number of visitors whe have, today, for the first time entered within her galea will say it is a port of entry collecting duties only in the exchange of generous feeling giving the hospitality lhat adorns the heart and dignifies life. Of that mission through mud and wa ter, refered to by Mr. Usher, I was with, him, at thia placo, to witness the success ful accomplishment of his fiaal pilgrimage of love. He married into a family, which with former alliances caused them lo move to Terre Haute, and thereby depopulate your town of the best half of your popula tion; with the present facilities you may lo a greater extent be depopulated by the same law of love. Oa this fcsliro dsy I can say lhat the bands of iron connecting us, were laid by Steele and wilh this expression I am done that Steele vill arter reif. This speech was received with unboun ded applause and closed the ceremonies at the Court House. The company then returned lo the depot precedence being given lo strangers from abroad where ex tensive tables were spread most profuse ly laden with the fat of Ihe land. It was indeed a sumptuous feast regal in extent and every way worthy the hospitable people by whom it was provided. Wilh whetted appetites, hundreds par look, wero sufficed and left, and yet Ihe diminution of these rich viands was scarce ly perceptible so bounteous was the store. These retired and fresh troops continued tho battle-but it was no use we dsubt indeed if all Parke and the adjacent eoun ties could have exhausted lho supply . After the feast, at 4 o'clock, the train re' turned to Terre Haute, leaving however a small Iraln and a large number of Terre Hautcans and olhera, who, after enjoying the hopitalitirs of the people of Rockville, returned to the depot at night and "tripped .la . t aa aa a a iaa XIni ntasuc loo until u o cioc, wheu the wi,d f Ihe locomotive caned us to ibe ears, and we were borne rapidly and safely to our Prairie City home, with a roost vivid impression that this had boon a proud day to the people of Rockville, and ono brim fall of delight to heir gucats from Terre Haute and else where We saw not the alightcet thing to roar the general joy.
