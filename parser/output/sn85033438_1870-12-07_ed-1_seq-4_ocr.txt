Vance is elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat. Zcb's coureo lias been a tortuous one. First, ho was an Old Line Whig ; then aUnlon man ; then a rampant rebel, swearing "ho would fight the Yankees until h 11 froeo oTer, ami then light them on tho ice." Now wc have him in the role of a Democratic Uni ted States Senator, when he is admitted. He entered political life as a Whig member of the North Carolina Legislature, and in 1S7 beat Col. Avery, late of the Confede rate army, for Congress. He went Into the Confederate service in 1S61, as Colonel of tho Mth North Carolina Volunteers. In 1602, he was elected Governor, and dis tinguished himself by his classic expres sions in regard to his own soldiers, as well as Yankees, ono of which was, " that the Confederate soldiers would charge h 11 with n barlow knife for a haversack, if thore was anything in it." He held up his head throughout the war, making moro noise than any man iu the South ; but wince having " lit, bled and died in the last ditch," has been docile as a Iamb until re cently, when he has set his mind on the .Sonatorship. Ho is a fit exponent of the "Young Democraoy " of the South. EDUCATE THE PEOPLE. So say wc. So say all reasonable men, who believe that a Republican Govern menta government of the people and by the people is made stronger and more permanent by tho intelligence of the peo ple. Wc rcjoico to see an interest mani festing itself in tho cause of education. The party in power iu this Stat lias man ifested its opiKsition to popular education by repealing the only school law that we have ever had that was wortli a cent, and not enacting any other in its stead. But a number of tho progressive journals of that party arc coming out on tho subject and demanding action. Our neighbor, the Whig and Register came square out on the question yesterday morning, and talks in the right spirit. We see light breaking. Let tho subject of free schools be thor oughly agitated, and our law-makers will be forced to act. Let us know if they be lieve a people can be better governed in a state of ignorance than to be educated. In this connection wo call attention to the communication of "Amicus," in an other column, on the subject of city free jjchools. His idea is a good one. We would liko very much to nee the experi ment made. It would bo very easy to as certain what Buch schools would cost u. Some of our teachers might enlighten u on the subject. Put the matter in a tangi ble shape. Let the people know what would be required to support such a sys tem of schools, and wc belicvo they would readily agree to it. THE rami CEOP. There has perhaps never been a more bountiful fruit orop in this country than that of the present year. In portions of New York the yield of orchards has been ho great that one-half of the crop hna been paid for gathering the other half. Apples are said to be so plenty in New England that it is impossible to procuro barrels in which to ship them. A farmer near Springfield, Ohio, haa gathered four hun dred bushels of cranberries oft of three acres of greund, which yielded a net in come of. $1,020. Hero, in East Tennessee, we have an abundant yield of applos, which, if properly managed, will bring the fruit-growers a fair profit. We have long believed that, with proper care, more money could bo made in East Tennessee, and mado easier, by growing fruit thau by almost any other avocation. We could, by cultivation, very much improve tho quality of our fruit, and render tho crop certain, A great many persons have been turning their attention to canning and preserving fruit, and we dare say that tho quantity of canned fruits shipped here from other States is not as largo by half as it was five years ago. There is no necessi ty for us bringing any more from abroad. In fact, it is no credit to our industry and enterprise if we allow it. We can raiso just as good fruit, and can put it up for preserving just as well as it can bo done in New Jersey, or any of the Eastern States, if wo will only do it. And while on this subject, we would drop a word to our farmers, and the city population as well. There is much of the vile stuff we buy for vinegar that is abso lutely poisonous, and unfit to be tuken in to tho human system. If our fanners would only supply thornr-elves with bar rel", and put up cider, from which we could have pure apple vinegar, they would -tt a fair price for applos which would oth t itvjo rot, and at the same I'.ux confer a ' r .iL'fiton tin oonimuuity 

KNOXVILLE WEEKLY WIDENING PBINCE STREET. Now thut the new Custom House and Postofllco is an assured fact, so much go that even political domogogues have ceased to publicly throw doubts upon Its comple tion, and as tho assurance of Mr. Mullet that it is to bo built In tho most substan tial manner, and in tho most modern stylo is generally satisfactory, wo suggest that the proposition to widen Prince street bo soriouly considered and adopted. That tho project to widen it at least from tho river to Market Square is entirely practicable admits of no doubt. There aro but half dozen buildings that would require mov ing, aud Ihoy can all bo removed with lit tlo trouble or expense. Tho street is, with the exception of its width, one of tho best in the city, and when tho improvements in the Holaton river aro mado so as to glvo us navigation all the year, tho street will become ono of tho most important in the city. We regard tho improvements in tho Holstou as certain to bo made at no distant day, and as Prince street must bo the avenuo through which tho freights from the river will be transported, its improve ments is a question of great interest. The completion of tho Custom Houac, and the location of tho two churches at tho corner of Prince and Church streets, will always make that locality a point of attraction. That other buildings of the same clasd and style will eventually be constructed in the same neighborhood, is entirely probable. It Is desirable, there fore, not only by reason of tho improve ment it would mako in the general appear anco of that part of the city, hut also for tho moro practical and substantial reasons already named, that the street should bo widened. Tho time is opportune. Tho prospects aro that tho Government will inoreaeo ma terially the size of tiio lot upon which the cuotom house is being built and place the building homo twenty feet further back from Princo street. If tho city will widen the street the house would probably bo fetill further retired, thereby adding much to the appearance of tho building and to tho improvement of tho street. If tho project i to bo successful, it is therefore desirable that it should bo speedily determined. The street is now too narrow, as all will admit. It would improve it, and tho value of every foot of property fronting on or ad jacent to it, if it wan widened. It can be done at a trifling expense, and, if the pro per efibrt aro made, can be done at once. We arc glad the city authorities have act ed in tho matter, and we hopo the effort will bo encouraged by every citizen. We ought to take a greater interest in these mattem, for every step we take towards improving tho beauty or practical advan tagen of our city is an investment for tho S future from which wc will all speedily reap material advantage-.. WHO ABE INTERESTED IN FBEE SCHOOLS The establishmentof free schools in Ten ncasee would bo one of tho most powerful inducements we could offer to immigrants The better class of laboring men in the United States fully appreciate the advan tages of a liberal education, and they are determined that, as farasin them lies, they will give their children a good education and thereby place them in a position where they make a fair race in life with the chil dreu of more wealthy parents. In Amer ica a man is juat what ho makes himself. Wealth and social position are very desir able and powerful aids in the conflict, but integrity, education and perseverance aro of more worth. All tho latter are in the reach of every youth in the land. The abionce of free bchools bears moro onerous ly upon the poor, for without education they must always labor under great dlsad vantages as compared with tho rich There are n certain class of rich men who appreciate this, and therefore- oppose gen eral education. They feel thut when schools are free and open to all, their sons loie their present vantage ground. It is thereforo more to tho interest of the labor iug men thun to any other class that this great question should be agitated, and it is in their behalf we plead. 3

WEDNESDAY, REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDU CATION. Gen. Jno. Eaton is now Commissioner of Education for the United States, and ha recently mado a report, which is re ceiving tho encomiums of the press all over the country. Tho New York Herald pays the report this high compliment : Tho annual report of the Commissioner of Education is an earnest of tho intelligent and thorough mnnnor in which it may bo expected that the work of tho Bureau of Education will bo nono under tho supervision of ono of tho most competont living writers on tho subject of education. Tho report trivw tho most complete view of tho subject which lias ever been presontcd. Gen. Eaton way Superintendent of Pub lic Instruction in this State, whilo wo had a frco school system, and if ho had receiv ed tho support and encouragement that should have been given him, wo would havo had free hchools equal to any in the Union. Bat, actuated by a blind partisan zeal, the Democrats firat elected an utterly incompetent Superintendent, for tho pur pose of bringing tho office into desreputo, and then abolished tho office, and repealed the school law. A 3H0XIT SESSION. The MemphisiSiin urges upon tho Legis lature the importanco of a short session, it being the third session since their election, and there being no reason why the work they have to do should not be put through at once. After pointing out what ought to be dono, the Sun closes with this unkind cut : Wha Governor Brown is Inaugurated, ho will be prepared to recommend somo dennito State policy, and his friends in tho Logislaturo will carry it out. But both Sonter and his Gen eral Assembly havo bean tried, and it mnv bo only a waste of timo to require their longer ser vice in regard of matters wherein thoy have so signally failed. Wo repeat, then, that this Gen eral AscemDiy ongni to do wnatevor may dc es sential immediately, and go home. The idea of ordering the S0I0113 homo is proposterou. Why Hornbcrger will re quire at least two weeka for tho evapora tion of gas, accumulated during tho vaca tion. How theso mighty intellects must chafe under the nieddleeorao spirit of their frionds, demanding that they shaV go home. t 4V PROTECTION. The Nashvlllo Banner fakes us to task for our position on tho subject of protect ing homo industry. It Bays tho growth of manufacturing enterpri.-es in Tennessee is only to be attributed to the "growth of time," and that tho growth would have been much more extensive, but for too much protection elsewhere. Now wc aro unablo to eco why protection elsewhere is not protection also for Tennessee. The Banner entertains the idea that but for a protective tariff tho manufacturers of the North would long sirfee have transferred thoir machinery to our iron and coal fields, where they could manufacture articles cheaper, and lie able to compete with for eign producers. Wc do not believo a word of this. If that wore true, they w'ould do so, tariff or no tariff. If with the tariff thoy can mako money in Now England and Pennsylvania, they could mako some hero, according to the Banner's theory, and. being men of common sense, would como at once. Capitalists will go where thoy can make most money, and if thoy can do it iu Tennessee, they will como hero in preference to staying clsowhere Tho Banner furthor says : "Considered nurelvaiamattarofsolf-interest. tho iron and ooal rcgiom of tho South, it seems to ui. havo nothing to loso and everything to fain by thejabolition of high protective tariff lis the opinion oftho best informed iron men in this State, that tho result wonld increase ton- torn us manufacturing entorpnso." Now, if we could see the matter in that light, wc would at once como out in favor of frco trade. Wc would like to know who some of " tho best informod Iron mon in State" aro, who believe that tho abolition of the tariff would increase manufacturing enterprise in a ten-fold proportion. If we believed this, wo confess that our mind would be materially modified on the tariff question. Wo desiro to sco tho manufac turing ontorprlee of the State increase "ten-fold," and would favor any policy that would do it, hut tho mere assertion of men fails to convince us that the abolition of tariff duties would do it. A yea it ago, Mi's. E. A. Pollard, wife of Lost-Causo Pollard, was the lessee of the St. Cloud Hotel, in Washington, which slio kopt on the EuroiKJau plan. She, not being altogether void of fascinating quail ties, naturally had her admirer.-, ono of whom was a certain steamboat captain It having been promulgated in and about Washington that she was guilty of iin proper intimacies with this steamboat cap tain, she became insane, and was sent t( an insane asylum. She has recently been released, and now charge that her insani ty was the result of drugs administered by tho owner of the hotel of which she was the lessee, with the design of getting her out of the way and securing control of the property. She had employed eminent counsel, and will bring suit against tho owner of tho hotel for heavy dumages, al leging false imprisonment and assault an battory. It ia also naid that she has writ ten to her husband in New York, consult ing hi 111 ulxiut tho matter, and i-ooldng a reconciliation. Tun cruulost Joko on Pomeroy is that Tuniniuiiy ha bought his Democrat for $2),0 K for tiir purpose of Mint tine him up DECEMBER 7, 1870. OEN. SHERMAN'S REMARKS BEFORE THE ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND. The re-union of tho Army of the Cum berland at Cloveland last week, was a grand success. Tho closing oxercisca con sisted of a banquet, at which toaata wore proposed and spceohoa made. Tho twelfth toast was : "From Chattanooga to Atlan ta," which was responded to by General Sherman. Wc glvo his remarks, which will bo highly interesting to a largo por tion of our readers who participated In tho movemont referred to: From Chattaaooca to Atlanta, ono hundred days under Are. It was my good fortuno to command you when yon woro already goodsol- diors, ana 1 nati out mua to do. ino war was then Doing carried on in Virginia and Georgia. I having the latter command with Thomas and SchoSold. How well I recall tho day when tho order came to advance, on a bright May morn ing, and nt goon bore down upon Joo Johnson. Tho battle then lasted one hundred and nine teen days, and night and day tho firing of guns camo to our ears. Wo only awolco when the guns wero silenced tho soldiors being aocua tomod to their sound could sloop always when thcro was no lull. 1 wish I had timo to follow theno armies. My first purpoeo was to destroy that army at ono blow, and whilo you were pouring down hero and thoro. I waited for Mol'herson.

Then Schofield and Hookor woro 6ont in two different directions, and wo eaw Unrdeo, who was retreating slowly. I havo it from John son's own lipa that ho intonded to fight in tho rear f Cnasvillo.

Ono day a tpy was brought to me bringing mo a paper coiunining a uiauii.-ani ui tiuiuieuii and the acceeeion of Hond to tho command. I dMired then to learn Hood's character.

When I left them in a position I bad no fears, for I was suro to find them thero on my roturn. Tho Army of tho Cumberland ought to ask no high er praise than that recorded by history that it was true, sure ana laitmui. That man was J. M. King of the Cth Tennesseo Infantry, and a- citizen of this county. He enlisted in tho Spring of 1S02, and was as gallant a soldier as ever bora a musket. Ho waa killed by a sharp-shoot er, jiwt ad he was relieved from tho ad vance skirmish lino to join hla regiment, in tho movement on Joncsborough. THE PEOOBESS OF THE WAR. The position of tho German armies is more favorable now than at any timo since tho invasion began. The forces about Paris aro strongly entrenched and in strength sufficient to repol any sortie tho French attempt, as tho events of tho past few days demonstrate. Their whole forces aro as well in hand as they have ever been The advances mado by tho Frcnoh armies organized in tho south of Franco can bo cheeked whenever they como within strik ing distance of tho armies co-operating in the siege of Paris. Our dispatches this morning hhow that tho Frencli army of the Loire was disposed of very summarily when its advance threatened tho success ful prosecution of the siege. Wo believe the French armies aro in better discipline and better officered than thoy havo been since the terrible 'opening battles of tho war; but however well handled or effi cient, there cau be no hopo for them to -overcome the terrible odds tho signal vic tories at Metz, Sedan and Stasburg gave to the Germans. Temixmiry suceesscH they may have, hut that their final defeat and overthrow can Imj averted, unless by intervention of other Powers, it is almost madnoM to believe. Wiiii.k Nevada and Massachusetts sjicnd $10.17 and $10.45, rcwjieotively, per head of the school j6pulaUon for educational fa cilities TcmicHteu spends 0!5 and Kentucky 73 cents per head.

Huch figures do us more damage unions desira ble lmmlj'i-HiiK than many aHrciattoiiH for itrMii .ii'-n .in ii us '01 1 OTTB OHEAT WANT. Every nine out of ten men who want to como to Tennessee to live, will ask among tho first questions as to tho inclucemcntu tho State offers in respect to its education al system. This is a point which ia of espe cial Importanco to hoads of families. What concerns them is, what additional expense must they incur in leaving tho free school system of most other States to como to Tennessee. Suppose wc take a family con taining fivo children, coming to this city for a home, aa a basis for" a calculation- Tho avcrago tuition for each child, is eaf three dollars per month. To a father of five children, this extra expense amounts to tho burdon&omo tax of fifteen dollore per month, or, at ten montha' schooling in a year, to ono hundred and fifty dollars per annum. This is what wo call a bur densomo tax to any working man. It Is a tax which ho will pay, of course, rather than seo hia children grow up in igno rance ; but it is a burden imposed upon him by tho iniquitous legislation of thh State, which ho ought not to bear. The highest and first duty every State owes to its people is education education a free and thorough as money and zeal can fur nish. It is tho best investment made by any people, and tho State that ia so blind to its own interests as not to provide for it. will pay tho penalty in a thousand ways Wo believe Tennessee Ls paying tills penal ty to-day in hor failure to catch even r small part of tho ceaseless tide of cmigra tion that is ao fast enriching and populat ing tho wiser States of the Northwest Wc havo recently had the opportunity 0 realizing how great a disadvantage tho fcfc senco of a free school system is to Tennes sec, and wo wish wo could bo ahlo to make others feel it. It ia tho great want of our State, aud we cannot longer afford to do without it. Sim plojusticoto tho thousands of poor chil dren who aro this day without the means or opportunities for making of themselves men and women in tho true sense, and aw God intended them to lie, domands such a system, whilo it is unmistakably to our interest as to those wo hopo to attract to our lands, that we should bo able to offc" to them as ono of our chief attractions schools, frco and good. Let every man tako this question home to his own door and see how much it would profit him to have such a system of education. We have organization and co operation in every business undertaking in life, and tho experience of the shrewd est and most successful men of business is favorable to such a system. If co-operation and organization aro good iu business why not in education ? By a good system of schools, a thousand children can be edu cated in thla city for tho money now spent in educating a few hundred. This is a question which is of great intcsest to every citizen, and ia particularly worthy of at tention now when so muoh interest ia manifested in immigration. Givo usgood schools, and together with tho other unsurpassed inducements nature enables us to offer, wo can attract hithor tho best and most acceptable class of immi grants. THE PRESIDENT'S ME6SAGE, Tee President's Message, a synopsis of which we print this morning, is clear and pointed upon all tho questions of public interest. It is practical, and takes hold vigorously of tho Alabama claims, San Domingo, Bevonuo Reform and Canada Fishery question. On this point hia Mes sage will be satisfactory to the border citi zens. Wo havo not been able, at tho lato hour it reaches ns, to do more than hastily look over it, and will reserve further com ments after a moro deliberate reading. We can't comprehend how a man 'a happiness can be complete without a good, readable, reliable newspaper. With the man who has a comfortable home, owes nobody anything, lias plenty to livo iiikjij has a loving wifo and pretty children, nothing is needed to complete tho picture of bliss, but tho newspaper. This is espe cially so, in tho long winter evenings when all aro gathered around the cheerful blazing hearthstone, while tho wintei winds aro howling without, and the pelt ing rain nnd snow aro rendering cheerless tho outsido world. Tho newspaper, with its lato news, gossip, short stories and gen eral information, occupiea niche ina man's social enjoyment that nothing else can supply. Then be suro and take a newspa per.
