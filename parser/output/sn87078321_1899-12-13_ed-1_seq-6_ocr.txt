BUD BY tMUllS GUIDES. HEAVY BRITISH LOSS. Gen. Gatacrt Surrounded by the Boert il Stormberg Lost 600 Men and Abandoned Equipment. The London war office publishes the following dispatch from Gen. Forcsticr Walkcr at Cape Town: "Gatacre reports: Deeply regret to in form you that I met with a serious re verse in the attack on Stormberg. I was misled as to the enemy's position by the guides and found impracticable ground. The war office has received the follow !nR dispatch from Cape Town dated Sat urday night: "The position of the enemy in Storm berg district last night was the foltow- "At Stormberg. six laagers, nt Dor drecht, 800 men; 23 miles south of Sterkstroom, 2JO men. "The railway bridge nt Modder river mas completed December 7. Mcthncn reports that he made a demonstration up the line of the railway at daylight with artillery. The enemy did not respond. Methurn is receiving the remainder of his reinforcements and supplies. He has established detached posts on his line of communication. The Times publishes the following dispatch from Moltcno: "Gen. Gatacrc attempted to assault the Boer position at Stonnberg at dawn to day (Sunday). The guides led us wrong and we were surprised while in fours and after a very trying night march. Our retirement was effected in excellent or der, there being no hurry even at the most critical time. The Northumber lands and Irish rifles behaved as if on review day. I fear our losses arc heavy. One of our guns we had to abandon.' It is hardly too much to regard Gen. Gatacre's repulse near Stormberg as the most serious defeat British arms have yet sustained in the whole campaign. Already the official advances show that 2 men were killed, 9 officers and 17 men were wounded and q officers and 596 men are missing. But it is evident that the worst is not yet known. The pro portion of wounded and killed is so small, when compared with the missing who are undoubtedly prisoners in the hands of the Boers that the supplemen tary list of casualties is awaited with se rious misgiving. It is also feared that there were seri ous losses of guns and equipment. The most serious aspect o the affair is the effect it is likely to have on the Dutch in Cape Colony, who have been wavering as to whether to throw in their lot with the Boers. Hosts of the north ern farmers are now likely to join the rebellion. The defeat is also serious be cause it will delay the function of Gen. Gatacre and Gen. French at Naauw poort. The plan was for their combined forces to relieve the pressure on Lord Mcthucn's column. The disclosure of such a strong force at Stormberg was quite unexpected. Doubtless Gen. Gatacre was the victim of treacherous guides. But the result points also to the absence of proper cav alry scouting. Some interesting light is thrown on the position of affairs along the western frontier in South Africa by a dispatch issued by a Boer agency in Berlin, which says: "Commandant Frins Loos' force is near Jacobsdal, between Mod der river and Kiel river. General Cronje is still on the north bank of Modder river, his rear being protected by forti fied positions at Spytfontein. The hills between Modder river and Spytfontein and those between Jacobsdal and Riet river are occupied by Boers. Command ant Delarey's force is stationed between Gras Pan and Honey Nest kloof." If this Berlin dispatch be correct and it is especially significant when judged in connection with General For-estier-Walker's advices to the war of fice there must be some 15,000 Boers around Lord Mcthucn, who is believed to have 11,000 men. Kimberlcy, how ever, possessing an armored train, can materially assist Mcthucn by harrassing the Boers from the rear. According to a special dipatrh from Lourenzo Marqttcz the Moducr river battle is described by a Boer corre spondent with General Cronje as "one of the fiercest the Boers ever experi enced." The correspondent goes on to say: "General Cronjc's wing sustained al most solely the fearful attack of the British right throughout the day. The Transvaalcrs tenaciously held their po sition until 7 in the evening, when the Free State burghers were forced to re tire by the heavy British shell fire. Gen eral Cronje then retired under cover of darkness, after facing the concentrated fire of all the British batteries. "The Boers freely acknowledge the herculean assaults o( the British and the death-dispensing fire of the attack ing infantry, but they held their po sition for 13 hours against the flower of the British army, replying solely with their Mausers and maintaining an uninterrupted rifle fire. The Boer ar tillery was silenced early in the battle through the overwhelming number of the British artillery." Modder river dispatches say that the Boers are encamped amid the hills half way to Kimberlcy, but it is also asserted that a 'large body of the enemy has gone in the direction of Jacobsdal. It is pos sible therefore that Lord Methuen may endeavor to clear his right flank as far as Jacobsdal before continuing his ad vance. He is still waiting at Modder river for stores, guns and ammunition. A dispatch from Frere camp, dated December 5, says: "The Boers are firing into Ladysmith entertaining the gravest fears as to the safety of their own country." The hottest bombardment of the siege at Ladysmith took place last Thursday. The Boers got a new big gun in position on Lombards Kop, completely commanding the town, and shelled the English camp, planting shells with great accuracy in the camp of the Gordon Highlanders and the Manchester regiment, where there were many narrow escapes. Two Russian colonels and a French general and colonel have engaged with the Boers. General Joubert has been forced by sickness to relinquish command of the iioer army. Americans in Pretoria complain that the Boers do not respect American passports or flags. ... : A Chicago firm has shipped 750,000 pounds of canned beef to the British Army in Alrica.

CAUGHT IN A MINE. An Explosion of Firedamp Causes Terrible Lost ot Lifo at Carbondale, Wash. Soma Herolo Rescues. In a mine explosion at Carbonado, Wash., last Saturday. .12 miners were killed. The theory of Superintendent Davies is that a small pocket of gas was opened, became ignited and caused the terrific explosion of dust which resulted in all the damage and loss of life. The explosion occurred at it a. m., and shook the mine from the water level to the surface, nearly t.ooo feet above. Nearly a hundred miners were at work, and between 30 and 40 of them were killed outright Of the 20 or 30 miners who were in the upper levels and who escaped unhurt, several immedi ately started down again to rescue their unfortunate companions, but at the lower levels were overcome by the after-damp, which killed a number. The noise of the explosion brought the entire population of the town to the mouth ot the tunnel, wives and cnii dren of the doomed men were wild with Brief. Governor Rogers arrived in the evening and took charge of the mine. He began an investigation to determine the responsibility for the accident. Miners who were brought to tue sur face alive were nuiflledd in sacking to protect their burns until they could be carried to the hospital. Many instances of heroism were re corded. Rescuers would continue at work until overcome by the gas. They would be carried to the upper air to re vive them and then descend again. None of the bodies so far recovered were crushed. Timbering and excavat ing are being carried on as rapidly as possible. Nearly all the men killed were smothered by the gas ana altcr-uamp. As to the cause of the explosion, even the miners rescued cannot give the slightest explanation. (July safety lamps are worn when at work. If, how ever, a man carelessly opens his lamp the coal gas quickly explodes. The only open light known was that irom the small locomotive used to haul the cars in and out the cannon on the main level. When the first rescuing party reach ed the mine workings they found that timber and coal pillars had been ground into an inextricable mass. By the dim lights of their safety lamps they found charred and twisted bodies behind piles of timbers and tons of coal. Whenever a live man was found a rope was placed about his body, under his arms. With tliTs he was dragged 400 feet, to a point beneath the nearest tim ber chute running to the surface. From the surface the maimed men were car ried a mile or more to the foot of the big incline, running too feet up to the top of Carbonado. On this journey the wounded men were carried on stretch ers and on horseback. The mine belongs to the Southern Pa cific Railroad Company. The coal is a soft, bituminous variety, productive of a large proportion of gas. and has been much used in gas manufacture. The total number of men in the unfor tunate shaft was 76, of whom 44 arc alive, having escaped or been rescued. Immense Cotton Yields. The final report of the department of agriculture on the acreage and produc tion of cotton in the United States for the year ended August 31, 1899, shows a total acreage of 11,189,205 bales, an in crease of 291,349 bales over the preced ing year. The average production per acre was .448 of a bale. The total value of the crop was $305,467,041. The tele graphic report to be issued on Monday, December it, at noon will relate to the present year, 1809-1000, and will com prise an estimate of the ncreage by States and the indicated yield of lint cotton per acre. Aged Couple Burned. A fire at Gloucester, N. J., Monday morning cost two lives and destroyed the Green Tree hotel and stables and the Clifton house.

Suicide First Called His Wife.

Hcin told his brother some time a no some one was following him and gave his revolver to his brother and asked him to keep it for him. But he secured it later. The dead man was 36 years old. Mistaken for English. Lieutenant Stacker and seven mem bers of the First Tennessee volunteers arrived at New York Sunday on the steamer St. Louis from Southampton, on their way to their homes in Clarks ville, Tenn., after having seen some months' of active service in the Philip pines. They came home via Europe in order to see the sights.

POLYGAMY IN UTAH. II Is Still Practice! by the Highest Cttldcrs In (ho Mormon Church. Jndae C. C. Goodwin of the Salt Lake Tribune says regarding Scnntor Raw lins' resolutions to investigate polyg amy: KcBardma the Rawlins resolutions congress and the country should not be deceived. If the resolutions are amend ed so as not to carry nn implication against the president, nnd if the presi dent of the Senate will appoint some other senator rather than Kawlins as chairman of the committee, and then if the order be to the committee to have the hearing here with open doors, the committee will be most heartily wel comed. "And it will be shown that every guarantee was given that polygamy should cease in Utah, both the marry ing of new wives ami living with old ones; that this was affirmed by the pres ident of the dominant church under oath, by one of his counselors, Joseph f. smith; by Apostle (now President) Snow, by the petition for amnesty, by every o-4lvard evidence of sincerity. further, that it was fully understood and made clear by the act of the first state legislature, which legitimized polyga mous children born up to a certain date. further, it will be shown that sev eral of the very highest officers of the dominant church have taken new po lygamous wives, and that the state is being filled with children born of po- lygamous parents. "Rawlins does not want any commis sion sent here; his resolutions were but a diversion in the hope of helping Rob erts." 

COINAGE OF THE MINTS. The Production of Gold Coin Last Year the Greatest In History. George F.. Roberts, the Director of the Mint, in his annual report, says: the mints and assay offices operated upon more bullion in the aggregate, and a greater coinage was executed dur ing the last fiscal year than in any pre vious year. Original deposits of gold w;erc slightly less than during the pre vious year, amounting in value to $14.1,- 497.t9", against $147,093,104 in the fiscal year ended June 30. 180a. Domestic deposits were the largest in our history, amounting to $76,252,487 against $69, 881,120 in the preceding year, but there was a falling on in foreign coin and bars. "The coinage of gold was the greatest in our history, amounting to $108,177, 180, against $64,634,865 in the preceding year, and might have been considerably larger if the capacity of the mints had been greater, the stock of gold bul lion on hand increased from $1)6.688, 582 on July 1, 1898 to $119,882,772 on July 1, 1899. "The coinage of silver dollars from bullion purchased under the act of July 14, 1890, was $18,254,709 against $10, 022,780 in the preceding year, and the coinage of subsidiary silver, $9,406,877. 65 against $6,482,804. CERVERA'S BOOK. The Defeated Admiral Writes About the Santi ago Battle. Another contribution of the naval lit erature of the Spanish war has been published by the Bureau of Naval In telligence. It is a history by Admiral Ccrvera of the fleet under his command which was destroyed by the American squadron off Santiago. The oriental publication was autfiorized by the Queen Regent of Spain, on the petition of Ad miral Ccrvera, who wished to vindicate himself for the loss of his squadron, nf tcr having been sent to Cuba against his earnest protest. The document is of historical value, as it is made up entirely of official let ters and dispatches, and includes the re port of Admiral Ccrvera and his fleet commanders on the action of Santiago bay. There is nothing of news value in the compilation which has not already been printed from time to time. Admits England's Power. Three Hundred Armenians Murdered.

HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE. Enemy Had Planned Pitfalls and Used Artillery Police Lead an Uprising In Negro. There was considerable relief in Ma nila when the news was received Satur day that General Young's small force had arrived safely nt Vigatl, province of South Iloeos, December 6. Anxiety had been felt for General Young and the garrison at Vigan since it was known that General Tino had a large aggressive body of insurgents operating in the vicinity. General Tino made a stand in the mountain pass between Narvacan ami San Quinto. The natural strength of the position was augment ed by trenches and pitfalls. General Young had three companies of the Thirty-fourth infantry, under Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Howze, and two troops of the Third cavalry. Captain Swigart commanding, and one troop under Captain Chase. He was reinforced during the fight by Colonel Luther R. Hare, with a battalion of the Thirty-third, en route to Vigan. Gen eral Young ended the fight by charging and routing the enemy, who left 25 dead, several ritles and thousands of rounds of ammunition in the trenches. The enemy employed artillery. Only one American was seriously wounded. The uprising in the island of Ncgros was led by the police of La Corlata dis trict, where there is a small American garrison. The police inspired false re ports of insurgent victories in Luzon and Panay. There are 250 native police in Ncgros, uniformed and armed with Springfield ritles. General Otis Thursday cabled the war department that he has had no word of General Young for a week. This is taken to indicate that Young is con tinuing his hot pursuit of Aguinaldo, and is probably in a country where he regards it as unsafe to use couriers. General Otis' dispatch, which follows, gives an official account of Lieutenant Colonel Parkers engagement nt Vigan: "Insurgents, 800 strong, made attack on Colonel Parker's force at Vigan, consisting B company and 153 sick and footsore men Thirty-third infantry, 4 o'clock morning 4th, entering city in darkness; severe street fight ensued; continued four hours; enemy driven out, leaving behind 40 dead, .12 prisoners, in cluding many officers, nnd 84 ritles; now on outskirts entrenching. Parker says can hold out indefinitely; plenty rations and ammunition. His loss 8 enlisted men killed, 3 wounded. One hundred and sixty men now being transported from San Fabian to his relief; Young must be in vicinity with large force." A force of 100 insurgents Monday at tacked, near Baliuag, a wagon train es corted by 30 men of the Sixteenth in fantry. A sharp engagement followed. The Filipinos lost 18 in killed and nine in capture. THE DEATH OF LOGAN. A Slory Which Says He Was Shot by His Own Men. If stories told by men who returned on the transport Sheridan, which carried the Thirty-third infantry to the Philip pines, are true. Mai. John A. Logan, Jr., may not have met his death at the hands of Filipino sharp-shooters, as reported. According to the statement of George Kappitz, purser of the Sheridan, sup ported by others of the crew of the transport, Logan was shot by some of his own men. Maj. Logan, Kappitz de clares, made himself offensive to the men, and this feeling was heightened by an incident which occurred one day at sea, when Maj. Logan seized a soldier's pet dog and threw him overboard. A threat was openly made and repeated many times that Logan would not last alter the first battle. CABLE FLASHES. The whole French press is urging war with f.ngland. There is a strong sentiment against the Iransvaal war in Australia. A fund is being raised in France to erect a statue of Rochambcau in Wash ington. An American has donated $250,000 to build in Condon a hotel lor poor wo men. Pretoria is preparing for a sienc. Enormous quantities of food have been stored there by the -Boers. French statistics for the year showed an alarming decrease in the birth rate and increase in the death rate. The federal governments of Germany have assented to the repeal of the law prohibiting workmen's associations. Later the rcichstag passed the first and second reading of the bill repealing this law. The Danish steamer Vladmir Sawin is on its way to Philadelphia carrying 5,000 tons of heavy and light guns, am munition, time fuses, torpedoes and other war material for the Russian war ships being built at Cramps shipyard. A special dispatch from Durban says the Boers lost 1,800 men at what has been popularly known as the battle of G.lcncoe. It is also said that scurvy and dysentery are rampant among the burghers wno are ocieagunng cauy smith. The "Standard and Diggers' News," of Pretoria, says that Wednesday last Cecil Rhodes' dispatches, intercepted near Kimbcrley, said the De Beers mines were filling with water, and that Mr. Rhodes estimated the damage' at $50,000 per day. In the Spanish chamber of deputies Thursday Premier Silvela announced that as a result of the representations of the Bovernment of Spain, the United States Government had instructed its authorities in Cuba, the Philippines and Porto Rico to recognize the nationality of Spaniards in these places. Montagu White, former Bo'er agent at London, said that the Dutch women will not permit the burghers to surren der, even if they should wish to do so, and that Johannesburg will be laid in ruins before it is yielded to the English. Main Survivor Dead. Commander Charles P. Howell, chief engineer of the United States battleship Maine when that vessel was blown up in Havana harbor, died last Thursday at his home in Washington from an apo plectic stroke. He was 50 years old and I was born 10 uosnen, in. x. HORRIBLY TORTURED. Negro Ceiled by a Mob and Burned at Ih Slake. Richard Cotenmn. the nrirro who out raged and murdered Mrs. James Lash brook at Maysville, Ky., last August, was burned Wednesday morning. Coleman was bronchi to Maysville by Deputy Sheriff James Robinson and six deputies from the jail at Covington, where he was taken for safety as soon as captured a few davs after his crime. A crowd of 7,000 citizens of Mason county, including nearly every resident of Mays villc, was nt the station when the Chesa peake & Ohio express arrived with the prisoner. The mob was headed by the nmrrtprrrl wnmnn'a tiiinlinnrf and brother. Hoyt Long drew a gun as Coleman was led from the train, but he' was overpowered and the gun from him. The mob sursed like maT I after the prisoner. They grabbed him J from the officers, dragged him along r the Chesapeake ffc Ohio, track into a deep pit near the junction round house. Here he was tied to a bush. Brush was heaped at his feet, saturated with oil and set on , fire. Blue vitrol nnd cayenne pepper were thrown into his eyes; his skull was crushed in with a club and his eyes were gouged out and his body hor ribly disfigured. In his agony the cul prit arose to a sitting posture and shrieked: "If you take the flames away I want to say something," but he fell back dead.

ROBERTS EXCLUDED Until an Investigating Committee Can Examin Ihe Charges Against Him. By an overwhelming majority the House of Representatives Tuesday even ing voted to exclude Brigham H. -Roberts, of Utah, from the body until the charges against him can be investi gated, which means that Roberts will never be allowed to take his scat The yea and nay vote on the exclusion reso lution of Mr. Taylcr, of Ohio, was 30a to 30, while the substitute offered by Mr. Richardson, of Tennessee, was de feated on a rising vote, 247 to 59. Mr. Roberts was allowed to speak in his own behalf, and held the floor for over half an hour. As a speaker he made a favorable impression, having good voice, which he uses well, and his manner being earnest and serious. But he did not even attempt to refute the charge of violation of law brought against him, nnd his efforts therefore did no; help his case. Tucs'.iy's action in the case is practi cally the end of Roberts, for it" is a foregone conclusion that the investi gating committee will find him guilty as charged, and that the House will, when the committee's report is present ed, declare that he was ineligible to ' Congress.
