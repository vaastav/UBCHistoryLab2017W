This Withdrawal was to be effected la three da--taafcaMrata, the first of whioh, tt wu un derstood, woald leave Mexico in Novem ober, aow pest, and-the second, in March twact, and thcthird end last in November, 1867.- ' Immediately noon the oomnletion - the evacuation, the French ' Govern-1 went' irai to assume the same attitude of ' -Mninterrentien, in regard to Mexico, as iie held by the Government of the United States.

' J Bach was the condition of affairs in re ard to Mexico, when,' on the 22d of -Novemhr Inst, official information wu teoeived from Paris (hat the Emperor of Trance had some time before' decided not to withdraw a detachment of hiB forces in ttie month of November past,' according 14 'enafjethent, but that this decision wu Vadc with the purpose of withdrawing lhebolp of' those forces in the ensuing SpriDir.
