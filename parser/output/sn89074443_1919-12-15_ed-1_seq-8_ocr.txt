(An editorial) HE president's message to the first regular session of the new congress is a conglomeration of conflicting political and economic theory. In places it contains lofty statements of the justice of the aspirations of the struggling masses of the world in others it adopts the theory that the present unrest is "superfi cial" and can, be remedied by suppressing the radicals. Both free trade and protection are advocated. Most of the sweeping demands of labor are' given indorsement, including the right to strike, yet the injunction as a means of crushing labor is defended. Nothing is said of the pressing railroad problem, the Mexican situation or the coal crisis. He promises to cover some of these questions in later statements. Liberals will find passages of the message which seein to in dicate a statesmanlike grasp of the fundamentals of political arid economic reform so sadly needed in America, but, remembering the fate of the 14 points, will not be inclined to consider the mes sage seriously. The statement is notable for its lack of definite proposals.. It deals mostly in generalities only and the president's general statements have been found by sad experience $6 mean nothing..'--' ^k' In one place the president says: I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness of our body politic. The causes- of-the unrest, while va rious and complicated, are superficial rather than deep-seated. Broad ly, they arise from, or are connected with, the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and, permanent peace, permitting return to normal conditions from the transfusion of rad ical theories from seething European centers pending such delay irom heartless profiteering resulting in the increase of the cost of living, .. and lastly, from the machinations of passionate "and malevolent agi tators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear. This is one of the current' conflicting theories of unrest. Under it, the condition is not looked upon as deep-seated. To re store normal conditions it is only necessary to pass the peace treaty-, cut the high cost of living (or wait for Jt to subside) and deport or lock up the agitators. This is the conservative theory-—a very stupid one. However, the president also states with equal force and clearness the opposite, liberal theory of the present unrest. Further on he says: The only way to keep men from agitating against, grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the ex treihe elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retalia tion and repression. The seed of revolution is repression. The real antidote for the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression, but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and this application of a remedy. It (congress) must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring, about a genuine, democratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work, in Ct? whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. .* The great unrest throughout the world, out of Which has emerged a demand for an immediate consideration of the difficulties between capital and laboi, bids us put our own houses in order. Frankly there can be no permanent and lasting settlement between capital and labor which does not recognize. the -fundamental concepts for which labor has been struggling through the years. To analyze the particulars in the demands of labor is to admit the justice of their complaint in many matters that lie it their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live in comfort,, unhampered by the fear of poverty and wapt in his old age. He demands the right to live and the right to work®' amidst sanitary surroundings both in home and in workshop, sur roundings that develop and that do not retard his own health $ndi^if well being and the right to provide for his children's wants in" thevVJ at of he a an at on Let us be frank about this solemn matter. The evidence of w6rld-| wide unrest which manifest themselves in .violence throughout the^V4 world bids us paus'e and consider the'meaiis to be found to st^p the*^', spread of this contagious thing before It saps the very vitality of thei .^: nation itself. Do we gain strength by withholding the remedy ,Or is it not the business 6f statesmen to treat these manifestationsyv of unrest which meet us on every hand as evidences of an- economic. disorder and to apply conservative, remedies wherever necessary? V* Inhere can be no recession of the tide of unrest until «on-: structive instrumentalities are set up to stem that tide.
