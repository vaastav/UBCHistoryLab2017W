TWO CENTS. lilUii uiiilift tJiiyB New Record for Kansas Farm Products and Live Slock. Passes the Four Hundred Million Dollar Figure. WHEAT ALSO HIGHEST. Crop Brings the Largest Sum in State's History. Ta4ue of This Year's Products $20 Per Capita. The Kansas State Board of Agricul ture todav issues its summary of the agricultural, horticultural and live stock products of Kansas yields, numbers, quantities, and values for the vear 1905. It says: Kansas1 Greatest Tear Agricul turally the year 1905 has been the most fruitful in the state's history, and the value of its farm products and live stock, $408,639,823, is the largest ever recorded for Kansas. It is greater by 541.222,703, or 11.3 per cent., than' in 1904; is over twenty eight million dollars more than tivice as much as their value in 1S9R, ten years ago, and is considerable more than their combined values in the first two years o the past quarter century. For the first time the value of Kan sas' agricultural productions and live stock amount to more than four hun dred million dollars the nearest ap proach to this being in 190 3, when the amount aggregated $387,500,000. As suggestive of the present situation, it mav be said that this year's wheat is worth more than that of any other year's cron; with one exception the same is trite of corn, and the state is richer in live stock than ever before. The year's aggregate value of farm products and live stock is sufficient, if equallv divided among the state's in habitants, to give each, whether adult or infant, $264, and this, together with the per capita amount of over $76 on deposit in Kansas banks, institutions patronized chiefly by rarmers, Indi cate a degree of prosperity most sub stantial and gratifying. Wheat The total yield of wheat, winter and spring, of superb quality, was 77.17S.177 bushels; this is over 12 million bushels, or 18.4 per cent., more than the output of 1904; 62 per cnt. greater than the annual average for the past twenty years, and is the fourth largest crop produced by Kan sas. Its home value is given as ?53, 871,624, showing it to be the greatest income bringing wheat crop ever raised in the state, nearly 4.8 per cent, renter in value than the 1904 crop, nrid $1,445,269 more than the returns from the crop of 19'"3, which hereto fore held the record for highest ag gregate value. That the Kansas wheat farmer has been particularly prosperous in re cent years can well be concluded from the fact that in the past rive, ending with 1905, Kansas raised two wheat crops of over 90 million bushels each; one of over 77 million bushels, one of over 65 million bushels, and one of about 55 million bushels, aggregating S81.344.039 bushels In the nve years, worth $23". 457, 229. or an averaere an nual output of 76. 268. SOS bushels, worth an average of $47,491,446.

Of winter wheat the area sown, as returned by assessors in March, was 5.835.237 acres. The largest yields per acre this year were in the eastern counties, in fifteen of which they ranged from 20 to 27 bushels. Lyon and Coffey reporting the latter. Thirty three counties each had one million bushels or more, aggregating 70 per cent of the year's crop. The leading six counties in winter wheat, and their output, named according to rank in yield, are: .H'irton 4. 009.3:15 bush.-'q Keno 2.91n,i.7rt bush,.)s 2.313. 654 bushels 2.3ii2.'24 bushels 2.22.4'',4 bushels 2.169.772 bushels report that this Sumner I'awnop IWePherson Stafford 'orrespondents fall's Rowing will nee-rps?;! tp alinnt r; 900,000 acres. an increase from one year ago of 64.763 acres, or 1.1 per cent.

Calling a satisfactory stand and healthy condition 110. the general average of the growing wheat for the strte is now 80.4. Five counties in the eastern third of the state have condi tions of in.) or over, and in fact the best conditions prevail throughout the xeetion named, most of the counties re porting 90 or better. Soil and weather in some portions of the state were quite fa vol able for sowimr. and since for germination and growth; in others opposite conditions existed, owing to lack of su!Iioic-iit moisture. Notably is this the case in about twelve of 'the prominent wheat producers, and to a gr-ater or lesser degree in localities here and there in other counties, for ine most part confined to a block of tec state's area 150 miles square meas uring westward from the eastern bor oer of Republic county, which includes the iwelve counties before mentioned 7,rt"n sports the lowest condition ;4, and Trego next with 58.

The corn, by more than one million dollars, outvalues that of the year's wheat, oats, rve, buckwheat broom corn, flax, and Irish and sweet potatoes combined. Thirtv-two coun ties, all except three in the eastern third of the state, report yields per acre of 30 or more bushels, the highest being 38 in Wyandotte, followed bv Brown, Jefferson. Leavenworth and Miami, each credited with 35 bushels per acre. Forty-three counties show aggregate yields of two million or xsj&ie bushels each, Jewell leading (as inst year) with 6.241,352 bushels. Mar shal! coming next with 6.173,898 bushels, Nemaha third with 5,853,854 bushels, Washington fourth with 5. 1 62.940 bushels and Republic fifth with 5,074.080 bushels. The area devoted to corn this year was .799.755 acres, an increase over that of 1904 of 305,597 acres, or 4.7 per cent. The average yield per acre for the entire state was 28 bushels. ' Sorghums for grain and forage The nonsacchartne varieties of sor ghums have all increased in acreage, while the sweet sorghums show a de crease; the combined value of these is $8,107,135. Hay and live stock -Tame and prairie hays yielded weil and in qual ity are probably above the average.

The Jefferson club of Topeka, a new ly organized Democratic club, will to night formally launch the name of Robert Elair of this city for the Demo cratic candidacy for governor. John H. Atwood, the stalwart Demo cratic leader of Leavenworth, will speak. He is a noted orator in political ranks and a great campaigner. He will talk tonight about the issues of Democracy and their relation to Kan sas. The boom being given to Mr. Blair lie -will use as a special text. The meeting will be held at Odd Fel lows hall, 117 West Sixth avenue. Spe cial accommodations are . being ar ranged to handle the crowd and every one will be welcomed. The Jefferson club is in charge of the meeting. The Democratic Flam beau club will attend the ratification headed by the Sons of Veterans' drum ; corps and will parade the streets before ! the hour of the meeting. The Han- ) cock club of North Topeka, another local Democratic organization, will also 1 come in a body. j H. C. Fraser, one of the Democrats of this city in charge of the meeting, j said today: "We are planning a great event. We are all in favor of Mr. islair. John Atwood, the principal speaker of the evening, is a noted Kansan. He is our national committeeman from Kan sas. We look forward with an im mense amount of pleasure to his speech. All of the Democrats in To peka are interested and we expect to have one of the best meetings in the history of the Democracy of this city." l6,00iAGE(iTs"0UlT. That Number Iert the Metropolitan In One Year. New York, Dec. 14. Haley Fiske, vice president of the Metropolitan Life In surance company, was the first witness to testify before the investigating com mittee today. When the committee ad journed yesterday Mr. Fiske was read ing a statement of the lapses in the in dustrial department of his companv's business. Mr. Fiske made a further statement on that subject. Mr. Fiske asserted that lapses cause no serious loss to the insured as the average amount paid on hipsed indus trial policies in 1900 is only 72 cents, for which the insured received protec tion for ten to twelve weeks. The to'al loss to company on lapses in 1900, Mr. Fiske said, was SI, 070,000; the number of policies cancelled was 575,392 and the average loss to the company was $1.86 on a policy. Charles K. Hughes, the committee's counsel, examined the method by whicn the company arrived at these figures. Mr. Fiske said that more than 16,000 acrer.ts left the employ of the Metropoli tan company in 1904. It had about 11,000 agents in its employ at the be ginning and about the same number at the end of the year. Mr. Hughes went into an exhaustive examination of the items composing the cost of getting new business in 1904, in order to compare it with the losses esti mated on new business in that year.

GI1EEN MAKES REQUEST Asks That All Land Entries Be Suspended. Special Grand Jury Resumes Sessions Today. Francis J. Hene3 formerly United States district Attorney of California, and now a special agent of the depart ment of justice of the government, will come to Topeka to try the land fraud cases unearthed by the special grand jury, which was in session all of last week, and again took up the work this morning at 10 o'clock, after an adjournment of three days. Heney made a reputation in the northwest in the manner in which he convicted there the men against whom cases of fraudulent land possession were preferred by a United States grand jury under - the direction of Colonel' A. R. Green, who is now wag ing the fight in Kansas against the same evil. He waa United States attorney for California when the investigation took place in that state. So well did he do his work that when the probing com menced in Oregon the department of justice appointed him a special agent and sent him there from California to try the cases which the jury preferred. He proved a host in himself, with the result that the government has now appointed him to try all important land fraud cases anywhere in the United States. Therefore he will be sent to Kansas to try the 24 indict ments which the jury returned here last week, and such additional as are expected to be returned by probably Saturday or next Monday. Harry Bone, the man who will suc ceed United States Attorney Dean, will therefore not have left to him as a legacy the land fraud prosecutions. It is not that the government does not believe that he can try them satisfac torily, but it is a new ruling by the de partment to have a special attorney for this character of cases where they are important, who is not a resident of the district in which the investiga tion is being carried on. Wherever land frauds are unearthed . in the United States hereafter, Mr. Heney will have charge of the trials. Jury Reassembled Today. The special federal grand jury- probing into Kansas land frauds which adjourn ed last Saturday night after returning 24 indictments for the week's ' 'work, came together again this morning at 10 o'clock and resumed the investigations. Today's work is confined entirely to the conduct of an official of the depart ment, although it was not said whether he is a past or present incumbent. It is known however that his actions are to be given a very severe threshing over, and some decidedly remarkable results are anticipated. The adjournment of three days was in reality made to give Colonel Green and the United States attorney's office an opportunity to lock deeper into this one particular case. Some developments appeared before the jury on Saturday morning which war ranted a thorough airing. But it is not only one official that will be put onto the rack. There are a number of them, and some of this state. Then there are actions of some past land department men which do not look unclouded on the surface and explana tions will have to be offered by the principals for these. This particular phase of the work is now on before the jury and it will prove the real meat of the investigation if it pans out as anticipated. Wholesale Suspension Asked For. It is understood that Colonel A. R. Green has asked the department at Washington for a suspension of the granting of entries of all kinds on all lands in Kansas until the present in vestigation is over. "Green generally gets what he asks for, too, I can tell you," said one government official at the federal building this morning. This is exactly the same action as wasiaken in the cases in the northwest. The department at Washington issued a wholesale order there for the suspension of entries on all kinds of lands, and now this will very probably be done in Kansas within a very few days. It will not hinder the filing of entries or the filing of proofs, hut it will hold up the granting of any patents upon them, which practically means an entire wip ing out of things for a time. It may he at least two years before the order is revoked. Only one acquainted with the land situation in Kansas can re alise the immensity of this move.

WESSEN, 507 East Fourth Street. Both telephones 504. 1 1 IS THE CATTLEMEN. II. G. Boiee Makes a Statement for the State Journal of Their Side. To the Editor of the State Journal: The wholesale indictments of cattlemen in southwestern Kansas on the fence question is censideied by their friends as a great injustice to them, and, generally speaking, the action wiH be condemned by the people of western Kansas. While these counties are now reasona bly prosperous, the action of the grand jury at Topeka will have the reverse ef fect, materially injuring nearly every one and doing - nobody any good. The best of the lands in that section can oniy be depended upon to raise rough feed, and a large portion of the lands are mere sand hills. Any of these lands can oe homesteaded now just as easy as if there were no fences ;in fact, have never known of a cattleman resisting or obstructing the settlers from locating when and where they pleased. I venture the assertion that 99 per cent, if not all, of the voters of these two counties would s'gn a petition to have the fences remain just as they are. To remove the fences would work niuea more of a hardship on the t,mall ranch man than on the larger one. The fences that are located there, with the view of keeping cattle from drifting or mixing, are the result of more than 20 years of adjustment between the residents, and as surances have been made repeatedly bv the representatives of the in terior department, that as long as there were not any- complaints against the fences that might be on government lands, notice would not be given for their removal, but that, should removal be necessary in any case, 60 days' notice would be given. Such assurances so of ten made from . these representatives of the interior department have certainly justified the very best law-abiding citi zens in allowing their fences to remain, even though on government lands, until receiving notice to remove them, and as these notices were not given, it is not "A square deal" to indict them. It hes often been the case where fences have been or dered down that they were allowed to stand or be rebuilt if the complaints ceased or were withdrawn. Whiie there may be some crimes bing perpetrated in some parts of the range country, it seems that a large class of respectable citizens engaged there in the cattle business are now having to suffer an injustice, probably, owing to the c ver zeal of some officials in this wave of re form. As for my connection with any of these matters, will say emphatically that my conscience is perfectly clear. Respect fully. H. G. BOICE. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 12, 1905. OURTOil in GOOD SPIRITS Discusses Public- Questions But "Not for Publication." Senator J. R. Burton was in Topeka today visiting- at the federal building. As usual he declined to talk, saying that he never makes any statements now for the public. He seemed to be in decidedly good spirits for he chatted merrily with the federal officers. He gossiped about the statehood proposition of the southwest and Senator Foraker's attitude con cerning it. Then he turned to the newspaper men and said: '-ii-ni Vs.-ftu'-YPon't use any of this. I'm not talking for pub lication, you know." SPECIAL MESSAGE From the President on Insurance Mat ters Is Expected. New York, Dec. 14. The Times to day says: Information has reached New York that President Roosevelt will probably send a special message to congress, asking for legislation de signed to cover illicit transactions in the insurance business. The message, according to the present programme, will deal only with insurance matters in the District of Columbia, over which congress has jurisdiction. The presi dent, it is said, desires to set an object lesson by recommending legislation for the District of Columbia, which may be considered by the state legislatures. 

MMIRISEY im LOSE IT. Believed Consul General to Mexico Must Scak Spanish. Washington, Dec. 14. Some doubt is expressed whether E. E. McJimsey, of the St. Joseph Gazette, will be appoint ed counsel general to Mexico, as an nounced last week. It is claimed that the information of his appointment was given out .prematurely. The information comes from a good source that, while no objection can be sustained to McJimsey on grounds of fitness, the policy will be to appoint no one consul general to the sister re public who cannot speak the Spanish language. This is a new policy recent ly put into practice, which has had no bearing on the qualifications of previ ous appointees. DROWNED If! BUMS. Four Persons Dose Their Lives by Sinking of a Tow Boat.

Mutiny Breaks Out on Battleship Czarevitch. the St. Petersburg, Wednesday night, Dec. 13, via Eydtkuhnen, East Prus sia, Dec. 14. The government's ad vices today from the Baltic province forwarded part of the way from Riga by courier are of the most alarming character. Bands of thousands of Lettish peasants are roaming the country in the vicinity of Riga putting the torches to the houses on all the estates and even threatening the town of Riga itself. The districts of Riga and Vendon are entirely in the hands of the insurgents. The revolt is spread ing to all parts of Courland. All rail way communication with Riga is cut. The insurgents have seized a number of stations on the three railroads lead ing from that city and are advancing against others. According to the government's infor mation all the sailors from the com mercial steamers in the harbor of Riga have joined the strike. The government claims that the troops there are loyal though inadequate. The situation is also bad at Mitau, where on December 11 the trops fired on the rioters. Mutiny on the Czarevitch.

Fire early today destroyed the four story brick business building at the corner of Fulton street and Bedford avenue in Brooklyn, the property of State Senator Charles Coop er, entailing a loss of $100,000 on the building and an additional loss to ten ants of about $150,000. "A most spectacular feature was pre sented when a tower had its supports burned away and. went crashing through three floors sending iup a burst of sparks and glowing embers and ad ding fresh fuel to the flames below The tower fell into the office of the Brooklyn Trust company, burying a safe that contained ?2,i,000 in cash, which it is believed will not be burned. On the second floor of the building, Senator Cooper had a store room in which he had many valuable paintings, bric-a-brac and other art treasures. These suffered from the flames and to day the senator estimated his loss on these at $50,000. Other tenants who sustained losses were the Prudential and John Hancock Life Insurance com panies, the American Harness company and the London Harness company. TWO JURORS FOUND.

THOSEOMLAHOfilABOfiDS Now School Fund Is In a Fair Way to Lose Them. The state of Kansas will probably have to bring suit against Day county, Oklahoma ,to collect S6.PJ0 worth of bonds which the state school fund owns, and which have been repudiated by the county. There is about ?1,200 interest in default. In 1S92 Day county issued a D.rge amount of warrants. In 1895 suit was brought to collect the warrants, and decided against the holders of the war rants. In 1896, supposedly by conspiracy. the court house and al lthe records were burned, all records of the suit th-s being wiped out. In 1899 another suit was brought, and this time it was decid ed in favor of the warrant holders. Tn 1900 the warrants were reduced to bonds. The total amount of the issue was about $16,000 ,and William Hunter, lean commissioner for the State Agricultural college, bought $6,100 worth of the Agri cultural college fund. The county now repudiates the bonds on the ground 01 fraud, and for the further reason that the issue was in excess of the 4 per c errt limit. John Dawson, assistant attorney gen eral, has just returned from Oklahoma where he investigated the matte-. lie thinks that the state can collect on the old bonds. TOPEKA FARES WELL.

Ways and Means and Commerce Committees Clash. Over Question of Which Shall Handle Insurance. THE CAS AL BOND BILL. Passes the Senate Without Debate as Amended. Places Bonds on Equality With Other L1. S. Securities. Washington, Dec. 14. The contest between the ways and means commit tee and the interstate and foreign com merce commission for control of insur ance legislation was continued in the house today. Mr. Payne took the floor to show that the power to tax was the only way in which congress could get control over insurance and the ways and means committee had jurisdiction over the taxing power. A review of judicial opinion was mada by Mr. Payne to substantiate his posi tion that insurance was not interstate commerce. He contended that in the face of the unanimous opinion of the supreme court the only explanation touching- insurance that would be held to be good would be to tax it. Mr. Mann (111.) said he saw great dif ficulty in regulating insurance through the taxing power but he did believa regulation might be secured under the commerce clause of the constitution. Regulation through prohibiting mail facilities to insurance companies which did not comply with prescribed regula tion was suggested by Mr. Davia (Minn.) As a precedent for the future Mr. Hepburn said he saw great importance in the manner in which the question should be decided. The supreme court view, he said, was not the view of him self nor of a considerable number of members of the house nor of the Amer ican Bar association."The recommenda tion of the bar association, of the en actment by congress of legislation for the regulation of insuranee,"was placed in the record by Mr. Bartlett (Ga.) Conditions regarding commerce wera infinitely different than when the de cisions in questions were rendered. By adopting the resolution regarding reference, taken with the statement of Mr. Payne that the taxing power was the only jurisdiction over insurance, Mr. Hepburn said the house would be sun ply proclaiming its lae'e of jurisdiction. Particularly was this so when, as he said, he ha been informed the majori ty of the ways and means committeo agreed with its chairman. In the Senate, Washington, Dec. 14.

Mr. Pettus at first object ed to consideration but a few minutes later withdrew his objection and the bill passed without debate. Mr. Elkins asked and obtained the consent of the senate to make a verbal report from the committee on interstate commerce concerning the progress of the committee's investigation of the railroad rate question. He said that the committee had found it impossible to report a bill ten days after conven ing of the congress as directed by toe resolution ordering the inquiry. "We cannot report today," he said, "but I am justified in saying that it ia the belief of the members that later the committee will be able to present a measure." He added that the commit tee had been in session from ;pril to June and again since November 21 hist, and was giving all the time ncssible to the rjuestion. The emergency canal appropriation bill was then taken up. After the amendment had been, agreed to' Mr. Teller discussed canal matters in gen eral.
