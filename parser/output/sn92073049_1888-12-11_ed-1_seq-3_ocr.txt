it' Tl IE PROGRESSIVE FARMER, DECEMBER 11, 1888. ; 1 1 ir THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. . The last annual message of Presi dent Cleveland, a voluminous docu ment, filling some seven columns of small type, has been laid before the Congress of the United States, and having appeared in all the daily papers, is now going through the weekly pn-ss of the country, either in wlmleor in part. It is noticeable that the press of the country, with singular unanim ity, pronounce it to be a splendid Siate paper, some going so far as to say it has not been equalled by any similar paper since the days of Jackson. Ev-n his bitterest opponents acknowledge it to be a masterly production and well worthy the careful study of every American patriot. It would afford us pleasure to make copious extracts from this able document, but as our space is limited, we must content our self -by copying the following brief excerpts which will be read with in terest by the patrons of Tiie Pro gressive Farmer: danger of unrestrained corporate 

POWER. As we view the achievements of aggre gated capital we discover the existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear, or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the. carefully restrained creatures of the law, and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters. Still congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country, and complacently contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citi zens to inquire at the present stage of our progress, how the bond of govern ment made with the people has been kept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of its economical administra tion, the government persists in exacting from the substance of the people millions, which unapplied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation, add to extortion the danger attending the diversion of the currency of the country from the legitimate channels of business. 

TAXING THE MANY FOR THE FEW. Under the same laws by which these results are produced the government per mits many millions more to be added to the cost of the living of bur people to be taken from our consumers, which un reasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. The people must still be taxed for the support of the govern ment under the operation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose and for the benefit of a favored few, the government, under pretext of an exercise of its taxing power, enters gratuitously into partner ship with these favorites, to their advan tage, and to the injury of a vast majoritv of our people. This is not equality be fore the law. The existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body politic. It stifles in those for whose benefit it is permitted, all patriotic love of country and substitutes in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice. . COMBINED WEALTH AND CAPITAL. Communism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized govern ment. But the communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness which insidiously undermines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not less dangerous than the communism of oppressed poverty and toil, which, exas perated by injustice and discontent, at tacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule. He mocks the people who - proposes that the . government shall protect the rich, and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor. Any intermediary between the people and their govern ment, or at least delegation of the care and protection the government owes to the humblest citizen in the land, makes the boast of free institutions a glittering de lusion, and the pretended boon of Ameri can citizenship a shameless imposition. REVISION OF THE TARIFF LAWS. A 'just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the relief of those of our conuntrymen who sutler under the present conditions : Such re vision should receive the support of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship; of all who realize that in this justice and equality our gov ernment finds its strength and its power to protect the citizen and his property; of all who believe that this contented com petence and comfort of the many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a few ; of all who appre ciate that forbearance and fraternity among our people, which recognize the value of every American interest as. the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of all who desire to see the products of American skill and ingenuity in every market of the world with a resulting restoration of American commerce. The necessity of the reduction -of our revenue is so apparent as to be generally conceded, but the means by which this end shall be accomplished, and the sum of direct benefit which. shall result to our .citizens, present a controversy of the ut most importance. There should be no scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the burdens of the. people are only ap parently removed. Extravagant appro priations f public money, with all their demoralizing consequences, should not be tolerated, either as a means of relieving the treasury of its present surplus, or as furnishing a pr etext for resisting a proper reduction in tariff rates. Existing evils and injustice should be honestly recog nized, bodly met, and effectively reme died. There should be no cessation of the struggle until a plm is perfected, fair and 'Uiservative, towards existing industries, but which will reduce the cost to consum ers of the necessaries of life, while it pro vides for our manufacturers the advant ages of freer raw materials and permits no injury to the interests of American labor. , THE 

STATE OF THE UNION. In pursuance of a constitutional pro vision, requiring the present executive to give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, I have the satisfaction to announce that the close of three years finds the United States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquility and at peace with all nations. 

ALLIANCE NOTES. Members of the Alliance, when writing to us, w ill greatly favor us if they will always give the No. of their Alliauce. We have given.the sixth and seventh pajres of our pajR-r to the exclusive use of the Alliance. Use them, brethren. For all official orders, rulings, notices, &c, the brethren will ex amine these pages. Piney' Grove Alliance, No. 51, resolved that they will not buy any corn, guano or meal unless the same is put up in cotton sacks, and they ask all Alliances to co-operate with them. Brook's Grove Alliance endorses the proceedings of the Granville County Alliance with regard to .the tobacco warehouse business, and pledge themselves to aid them, by their patronage. All Business Agents of Sub-Alliances in Orange county are requested to meet Bro. J. Y. Merritt in Hills boro, on the 18th of the present month, for the purpose of transacting important business. The Toiler s of Nashville, Tenn., says: "Every County Wheel in Ten nessee that has met since the recent agitation of the question of consolida tion with the Farmers' Alliance have strongly urged a union. Secretary, R. T. Sisstare, of Wal kup, N. C, who has recently been made correspondent for his Alliance, has placed us under obligations for a club of yearly subscribers to The Pro gressive Farmer. Thanks, brother. Bro. B. L. Mitchell, of Ridgeville Alliance, writes to correct an error in a resolution recently published from that Alliance. Instead of resolving that they would not use any fertilizer unless put up in cotton sacks, they did resolve to use none sacked in jute bagging. Bro. E. L. Stanly sends a note to informs us that his Alliance, No 287, Brunswick county, is prospering. Re cently, the interest among the farmers in the neighborhood has wonderfully increased and many who have hereto fore opposed the Alliance are coming into the order and acknowledge that it is-doing a grand work. On account of other pressing duties, Bro. W. H. Humphrey, Asso ciate editor of the Alliance department of the Robeson ian has withdrawn from that excellent paper. The editor ex presses the hope that the retiring brother will at least furnish an occa sional communication. He has ren dered the cause valuable service and is entitled to the thanks of the brother hood. Alliance, No. 1206, of Gaston county, adopted a resolution a few days ago calling upon the Legislature to make a law requiring all Judges of the Superior Court to be promptly on hand at the time set for the opening of Court; and if any expense shall be incurred by reason of a Judge's failure to put in his appearance, the amount shall be charged against such Judge. They also ask that Judges be forbid den to grant the use of the court house for public speaking during court week. Secretary Campbell, of Red Hill Alliance, Columbus county, writes as follows: " At our regular meeting last Saturday we heartily and unanimously endorsed the demands of the State Alliance. The brethren seem to be ready and willing at any and all times to stand bv the Alliance and do all in their power against trusts and mo nopoly. The farmers in this section are late in selling their cotton there fore they, have not all paid their sub scription to Business Fund as yet but will pay it very soon. I have a good list and aim to send in what I have collected in a few days. Crops in this section have turned out well; corn is very good and cotton generally an average. Deputy Organizer, P. M. Rhyne, of Gaston county, reports having or ganized Alliances as follows during the month of November: On the 2d he organized Chapel Alliance, with J. L. Rhyne, Secretary; on the 3d, Beaver Dam Alliance, with S. L. Carpenter, Secretary; on the 8th, Little Salem, R. A. White, Secretary, (oirr member elect to the Legislature); on the 9th, Turkey Hill, J. J. jWhite, Secretary. Gaston county not- has sixteen Alli ances all in fine working order. According tO i previous notice, there was a meeting of the Secretaries and Trade Agents of the . several Sub Alliances of the county of Moore held in Carthage on the 30th of November, and quite a number-of live, energetic Alliance men were present and showed by their very looks that they were de termined to make the Alliance just what it should be. A short lecture was given by the County Secretary in regard to the reports of the Sub-Secretaries, after which the agency busi ness was taken up and discussed in all its bearings to the satisfaction of all present. ' V; nWe regret to announce that Mrs. Eliza Walker, a most estimable lady, departed this life, near Byrdsville, Columbus county, on the 14th day of September last. She was a consistent member of Cheerful Hope Baptist Church for many vears, and was a de vout christian. She was also a mem ber of Cheerful Hope Farmers' Alli ance and was loved and respected by all who knew her for her many rare qualities of head and heart. Her Alli ance passed a suitable tribute of res pect to her memory which was given a page in the minute book of the Lodge. Cor. Secretary, A. P. Cates, of No. 643, says: " Our Lodge is in good working order, though some of the brethren are timid as yet, but I think they will soon get right. Times are very hard, crops are light and money is scarce; therefore we have not done as much for the Business Agency as we would like to do, though we are in full sympathy with all the great move ments of the Alliance.' We oppose all trusts and indorse every effort that is being made for the advancement of the farmers' interest. We endorse The Progressive Farmer and its editor. May they be a- tower of strength in this land." , Secretary W. P. White, who dates his letter Wilton Post, Granville county, informs us that Bro. J. G. Thompson, of Alliance No. 198, had his mare stolen November 23d, at Ox ford. The following is a description of the horse: Small, light bay mare, all of her feet being white; the right fore and left hind foot are white to the knees. Blaze face and tick spots on her shoulders. On her right jaw she has a small white spot ; on her back she has one or two white spots. When any one comes about her she backs her ears Has a black main and tail, and is ten years old. All Alliance men are requested to keep a lookout for her, and, if found, will please inform, fraternally yours, W. P. White, Secretary No. 198.

In the Federal Court, upon motion of District Attorney Busbee, the proceed ings against Messrs. Primrose and Stamps were set aside. A few Sundays ago Dr. Talmage said: ''Many a man sits in his pew on Sunday night and sings "Rock of Ages" and rolls up his eyes very piously, who, on coming out at the close of the service shuts the pew door and says " Good-bye, religion, I will be back next Sunday !" Rev. Dr. A. W. Mangum, of the Uni versity, was stricken with paralysis in one side while in attendance upon Conference at New Berne. It is now reported on good authority that President and Mrs. Cleveland will take a tour through the old world next spring and summer. The venerable and much beloved Jefferson Davis is in very feble health and it is feared that his . end is tiear at hand. A grand old martyr. The Washington Star says the next House is Republican. There are four candidates for Speaker Reed, McKinley, Cannon and Burrows. - The -terms of 75 Presidential post masters expire before March 4th, and will doubtless bh filled by Democrats. Among the number is Concord, N. C. The Pittsboro Record makes this in-' teresting f-announcement : "Our highly esteemed young Mayor has just passed safely through an attack of mumps." - It isTiimored that Mr. Thos. P. Dev ereux, of ; this city, is to be the next United States District Attorney for the Eastern district of North Carolina. Bishop Lyman, of this city, is now in the city of Rome, Italy, and probably occupied the pulpit of the American (Epis copal) Church on the first Sunday in this month. See the mammoth advertisement of Messrs. Hume, Minor & Co., and the liberal-offer contained therin, on the 8th page of this issue of The Progressive Farmer. The government has given directions relative to the destruction and disinfec tion of bedding, clothing, etc., in Jockson ville, subject to an ordinance of the city council. A call was issued for a constitutional convention to be held at Jamestown, Da kota Territory, December 5th, to further the early admission of the Dakotas into the Union. Mr. L. O. Lougee, treasurer-elect of Wake county, has declined the position owing to a mistake in the returns, in his favor, which he is unwilling to take ad vantage of. The Danbury Reporter suggests to farmers to try the experiment of raising rice for their table use, if not for market. New ground is considered the best adapt ed for this crop. The Wilson Mirror says that when "clothes-pins are selling for a cent a dozen there is no good reason why a man should snore in church, and keep his other brethren from sleeping." The New York . World is disgusted over the constantly recurring pedestrian displays, and asks if it " is not about time to substitute something novel for the idiotic walking-matches." There were twenty-three candidates for admission as ministers at the present session of the North Carolina Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, at New Berne. London is again .greatly excited over the attempted murder of a disreputable woman in Whiteehat-1.

It affords us pleasure to be able to present to the brotherhood, through the columns of The Progressive Farmer to day, a life-like picture of our grllant leader) Capt, Sid. B. Alexander. The like ness is perfect and we doubt not will be prized and preserved by all who are so fortunate as to receive a copy. We call attention to the interesting report of Mr. Van Lindley, the State's delegate to the recent National Farmers' Congress, held in the city of Topeka, Kansas. Mr. Lindley is one of our most liberal and public-spirited citizens, and he does not hesitate to use his individual funds to further the interests of his na tive State. The Charleston (S. C. Vorld, edited by A. Oldham, formerly of the Winston Sentinel, this State, says : " As two-thirds of the members of the North Carolina Legislature are farmers, it begins to look as though they will elect their candidate to succeed Senator Ransom, notwithstand ing the reports of the certainty of his re election." The editor of the Raleigh Chronicle says: "Rev. J. H. Cordon, who has been appointed to Edenton Street Methodist Church for the coming year, is one of the most popular preachers in the body of Methodist ministers. He is a capital preacher and has the tact of linking men to him with hooks of steel. He will at once rank .with the most attractive and popular Raleigh preachers. ' A fourteen year-old daughter of Mr. Wesley Bradshaw, of Burke, was stand ing before the fire a few days ago. Her. skirt caught fire and she ran into the yard where the wind was blowing and it fanned . the flames. Her body was burned so terribly, says the Star, that she died in a few hours. This is another argument in ; favor of women adopting mode of dress,; which wjll not easily take tire. A Portland groom got a decidedly rmvpil rpppntion on returning from his wedding trip. He was received with out stretched hands" by a vast army of credit ors, including the clergyman who tied the knot. The young man gave a check to a chum to pay all the expenses of the mar riage, but the chum, . instead of putting the money to its intended use, went off and had a "good time" with it. The Persian Shah has contributed to a Teheran publication an article in which one scene might be set to the air of the camels are coming. He says: "At this time, when most of the camels had brought forth their young, the greenness ot the plain, the clearness of the air, the lake, and the reflection of the sun on its waters, the vastness of the plain, the many camels and their young, the camel men and their children, who were all busy tending the camels," etc. The annual meeting of the stockhold ers of the Richmond & Danville Railroad Company was held in Richmond, on the 5th inst., at which a resolution was adopt ed looking to the issue of $5,500,000 in equipment trust bonds.

The New York Tribune says there are more printers in the present House of Representatives than members of any other single occupation or profession ex cept law. Amos Cummings, of New York, was a -tramp printer, and has set type in every State in the Union. Senator Plumb was first a printer, then an editor, and finally a banker. Gallinger, of New Hampshire, was a printer, but afterwards studied medicine, Farquhar, of New York, is not only a printel, but was once presi dent of the Typographical Union. "Tim" Campbell was a compositor on the New York Herald when he was elected to the New York Legislature. O'Donnel, of Michigan, learned the printing .business, and has always kept at it. Dingley, 6f Maine ; Foran, of Ohio ; Nichols, of North Carolina; Wickham, of Ohio; Huddj of Wisconsin; and Yost, of Virginia, were all printers. In the last issue of this paper we gave an account of the cold-blooded murder of a farmer named J as. Philbeck, in the county of Cleveland, but at that time it was not known who the murderer was. A day or two after the crime had been committed suspicion fell upon a dis reputable mulatto by the name of Van Canadj who, upon arrest and examina tion, confessed his guilt, and was com mitted to jail in the town of Shelby. On. the night of the 3rd inst., twenty mounted men rode into the town, dismounted, went to the jail and called for the keys. The jailor refused, when the mob pushed the door open, broke the locks to the cell, tied a rope around the negro's neck and carried him a mile east of town. Here the negro made a full confession and was allowed time for prayer, after which be was hung by the neck from the limb of a tree. After hanging about five hours the body was lowered to the ground by 1 order of the coroner. Verdict of the jury was to the effect that deceased came to his death at the hands of a company or unknown men. t Help TnE Wotj-nded. Mr. L. Turner, a very worthy citizen of Cary,Wake county, N. C.,.and one of the Gettysburg unfor tunates, offers his services as Door Keeper of the Senate.
