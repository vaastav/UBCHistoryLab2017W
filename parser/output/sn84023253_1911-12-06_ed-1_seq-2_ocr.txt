Boaton Eagle News Co., 597 Wash ington and 76 Summer Streets. Lyndonvllle Campbell and Blodgett. The McNamaras Confession. The canfession of James B. Mc Namara that he was guilty of murd er in the first degree in causing the explosion in the plant of the Los Angeles Times, which killed twenty one people and of John J. McNam ara that he dynamited the Llewellyn Iron Works in the same city on Christmas day, 1910, were the most sensational news developments of the past week. These confessions brought to an end two trials that promised to become historic and which had been in progress since Oct. 11, without even filling the jury box. Every laboring man identified with labor organizations had contri buted a part of his meagre wages to defend these two men in the courts and, if the allegations of the defense that they caught detectives in the employ of organized labor bribing men who have been summoned to serve as jurors are true, openly try ing to defeat justice. These acts as well as the horrifying crimes for which these men were indicted gave to the case unusual interest and a national importance. The confessions were made for one purpose an attempt to escape tbo maximum penalty for . their crime. Knowing their guilt and knowing that the only offense of their victims was refusal to ally themselves with organized labor, they maintained silence while tri bute from organized labor was be ing levied. The enormity of the .crime they had committed did not loosen their guilty tongues but when the web of evidence had been drawn so tightly that they saw no possibility of escape, they spoke in the hope of obtaining mercy. Their chief counsel, Clarence S. Darrow, said: "He was counselled to confess because it was the best thing he could do. I've studied the case for months. It presented a stone wall." This frank confession shows con clusively that the confession was only an effort to escape the conse quences of one of the most brutal and unexcusable slaughters of inno cents in the history of the country. Before this appears in public the court will have pronounced sen tence. But without knowledge of what the sentence is we state that to our minds their confession does not justify any mercy for them. The work of these two men has injured the cause of organized labor more than anything else that could happen. Organized labor is not bad, it has many deserving purpos es; it has accomplished much good; it has in its ranks much good citi zenship and it generally desires law and order but the McNamaras have brought a disgrace upon it that will require years of patient and honorable effort to efface. It deserves sympathy in its predica ment and all will hope that it will work itself forever ,free from the baneful and disastrous influence of the McNamaras. President Taft Again. On another page in this issue will be found an abbreviated report' of President Taft's message read to congress yesterday. We have not had the opportunity to read it thoroughly enough to offer comment on it at this time. It is plain enough for the reader to understand and approve or disapprove as his judgment dictates. We wish to refer at this time to an authorized interview published in last week's issue of The Outlook. It will be remembered that a few weeks before The Outlook published a signed editorial by Ex-Pres. Roose velt attacking President Taft's anti trust policy, more properly an at tack on the present law be cause Pres. Taft did not make the law, he only enforces it. Pres. Roose velt's article has drawn much com ment as to Mr. Roosevelt's political plans, all of which was guess work and some of it very silly guess ing at that. So it might naturally be expected that Pres. Taft would ac cept the opportunity to reply to his distinguished critic. But he has not done so. On the contrary he out lines his plan for the remainder of his term of office without mentioning the trust problem. His tariff policy will be to protect business from mere guesswork tariff tinkering and to make changes only as the "best available information is before us." That of course means upon information gained by the tariff board. Tariff reductions on the woolen, cotton and possibly the met al schedules, founded on the report of the tariff board, will be recom mended by him. He desires legis lation for the development of Alaska without infringement on the broad policy of conservation and the ratifi cation of the arbitration treaties, al so the fiscal treaties with Honduras and Nicaragua. After speaking of the tendency to charge x every act of his to some political purpose he closed the interview as follows: I am very grateful for the hon ors the people have given me. I do not affect to deny the satisfaction I should feel if, after casting up the totals pro and con, and striking a balance, they should decide that my first term had been fruitful enough of good to warrant their enlisting me for an other. Any man would be proud of such a verdict. But I have not been willing, nor shall I be, to purchase it at a sacri fice of my freedom to do my duty as I see it. My happiness is not de pendent on holding any office, and I shall go back to private life with no heartburnings if the people, after an unprejudiced review of my adminis tration, conclude that someone else can serve them to their greater ad Vantage." The courageous and rational pos tion our president has taken cannot fail to win him respect and increase confidence in him. Shipping for the Canal. We are glad to print another view of the' Panama Canal commerce. It will be remembered that last week we gave the story of a man who claimed that he was blocked by the railroads in establishing a line of ships to ply between the Atlantic and Pacific ports through the Panama Canal as soon as it was finished. Now George S. Dearborn, president of the American-Hawaiian Steam ship Company, says in an interview in the New York Commercial that when the canal is opened his Com pany will have twenty-three .steam ers, ensuring nine sailings a month from New York- through the Canal to San Francisco, ready for opera tion. These will be fourteen-knot cargo boats to handle freight -only. "I know," he says, "of two other companies right here preparing for its opening, just as We are, and like ourselves, they have not been figur ing on any subsidy. We are carrying now 750,000 tons of freight a year, every one' in , ten of which, I should say, is taken from the railroads, so that it does not 'look as though we were controlled by them, does it? We are building five additional boats to in crease our cargo capacity to 1,500, 000 tons and to fill those boats we will have to reduce the present rates. That is one of the objects of the canal. That the rates can be reduc ed when once the canal is open is seen to be reasonable when it is understood that the freight which is now carried by this company to the Pacific coast is taken across the Isthmus of Tehauntepec. Mails and passengers, however, will doubtless continue to go by rail, as now." He explains the fact that the gov ernment has received no bids for the $750,000 subsidy offered to the fact that sixteen-knot boats are required by the government, really passenger boats, and they cannot be made pro fitable as they would have to charge passengers from $125 to $150 a pas sage from New York to San Francis co and require from fourteen to eighteen days for the passage while the railroads will carry a passenger from one city to the other in six days for $75. Of course profitable pas senger business under those circum stances is impossible but all will be pleased to see that the canal is likely to secure more favorable freight rates between the eastern and west ern seaports of this country. Good Example of Town Spirit. Although Thanksgiving is passed we take pleasure in reproducing a part of an article written by Ex-Gov. Jordan of New Hampshire in re sponse to an invitation from the edi tor of the Coos County Democrat printed at Lancaster. The ex-governor closed his article with these words: We give thanks, too, that our town is so clean, morally and physically; that our boys and girls are bright and keen, and decently behaved; that we have so little bad and so much good in the community; that the new church edifice is nearly ready for services so that all in town will be able to worship God accord ing to the dictates of their con sciences; that ere long our school children will be gathered in from the byways to commodious quarters. that they may be prepared as well as they can for the responsible plac es and activities of the larger life awaiting them; for the quiet chari ties and liberal benevolences unos tentatiously bestowed upon the un fortunate and the deserving; for the good men and women we have reared who have gone from us into broader fields of usefulness, but who yet remember us with their bounties and benefactions to improve mind, body and citizenship, for the brave men to found this government, and as brave men who saved it; for the assured scenic railway to a scenic hotel on the top of our most scenic mountain, and "for the awakening of the people to efforts to preserve and conserve our forests and water pow er. And last (for we can take neith er time nor space to enumerate a hundredth part of our reasons for being thankful) that our ancestors, intelligent, . courageous men and women, through hardship, toil, trial and travail, founded this goodly town, a beauty spot among the ever lasting hills, and here established and handed down' to us so excellent a civilization. Mr. Reader, can you say as much for the town in which youTeside? If you can, are you doing it when ever opportunity offers? If you can not say as much for your town how much are you responsible for the less favorable conditions? Doesn't the above description appeal to you as a town it would be pleas ant to live in? Don't you want your town as attractive to the public? What will you do between now and next Thanksgiving to make it so? The selection of Sen. Max L. Powell of Burlington as one of the speakers at the new hotel meeting of the Commercial club, was one of the most fortunate selections the club has ever made in speakers. Mr. Powell has just passed through one of the most difficult fights in the history of Vermont to build a new hotel in Burlington. He ventured time and money where most men would have shown the white feather and having ventured fought to the end. He has not only succeeded in his fight but his new hotel is a real success. His experience gives him a high appreciation of Vermont op portunities and his hard earned suc cess has filled him with enthusiasm. These two things enabled him. to give one of the most hopeful and helpful addresses that has been heard in St. Johnsbury for years. The hotel proposition is the most tangible it has ever been and there is good ground for the hope it will be constructed. If it is built, and it must be now, St. Johnsbury peo ple will be indebted to Max L. Powell for opening their eyes and enthusing them with a spirit of con fidence that made it possible. We quite agree with the mer chants desire to have people do their Christmas shopipng early and as a means to that end we would suggest that the business men ad vertise early. Speaking of hotel sites it should be remembered that every practical hotel man who has been in St. Johnsbury favored the site now ad vocated by the hotel committee and perhaps it would pay better to fol low the opinions of practical hotel men than the opinion of Tom, Dick and Harry on the street. Twenty murders have been com mitted in Vermont within the past year and only one murderer recom mended for execution. Isn't it true that Vermonters have become too sentimental over the protection of murderers and too indifferent to the protection of law abiding citizens? Published elsewhere in this issue are the editorials written by Ver mont editors in response to the sug gestion of The Caledonian that they advertise their own community in last week's issue of their paper. While all of the editors did not re spond enough did to attract atten tion to Vermont's advantages in a way that should bring results. We believe the editors have done their community a real service. .

LACKSHAWS HOLE IN THE WALL The place to buy your DIAMONDS, ENGAGEMENT and WEDDING RINGS, HIGH CLASS JEWELRY, RAILROAD WATCHES FIRST-CLASS REPAIRING. A PLEA FOR DEBOER. Written by a Minneapolis Subscriber of The Caledonian. Nov. 25, 1911. Editor of The Caledonian: I have just now read an article in the last issue' of your paper re lating to the next Governotorial election in Vermont, and inasmuch as I am a native of that state and as such much interested In its peo ple, I have considered it not improp er to briefly express my views as to the candidates. I have known Mr. DeBoer for a long time and believe him to be one of that class of able men that from time immemorial have represented that state, not only as governors, but in the legislative halls of the na tion as well. Vermonters are scat tered all over the country and many of them are deservedly occupying positions of honor, and I. am sure that they are anxious that the ban ner of Vermont shall be carried near the front rank In the nation. There are. no doubt, others in the state who would represent it very creditably, but none who, in my judgment, would out-rank Mr. De Boer. Very truly yours, HENRY C. BELDEN. AVENDELL PHILLIPS STAFFORD. A Highly Appreciative Article From The Boston Herald. The Boston Herald of last Wednes day under the heading "In the Pub lic Eye" made the following com ment on Judge W. P. Stafford of Washington: Few who heard Judge Wendell Phillips Stafford of the supreme court of the District of Col umbia, speak last night at the Park street church on the character of the man whose name he bears, could fail to be impressed by the extent to which the speaker's life and tastes and aspirations had been influenced by those of his pat ron saint. A poor boy, reared on a Vermont farm, and working his way through preparatory schools and a professional course at Boston Uni versity, Stafford has been thoroughly earnest in all things. Many of the elder of his hearers "thought that he spoke much as Phillips did, and when he came to describe Phillips' type of oratory and how he put the ld bombast to shame with his grace ful and forceful diction, hearers could not help thinking of the char acteristics as a public speaker of tht man on the platform before them. Judge Stafford, although a nativt of conservative Vermont, a so-call ed federal office-holder, and a repub lican, did not hesitate to avow some rather radical doctrines. He thinks the objection to the initiative and the referenduln is he old grasp of toryism, in its distrust of populai rule. He rejoices, as Phillips woulc rejoice, in the six equal suffrage stars on the flag. In reviewing tht course of events since Philips' deatl the speaker said that while we had not caught up with him, we were "on his trail." Perhaps the most curi ous thing which Judge Stafford re called was Phillips' telling the schoo children of Boston in 1865 that the telegraph was nothing; that if he should live 40 years he believed he could communicate without wires, and that lhessages could thus be transmitted, two at a time, and in opposite directions. Marconi came along almost 40 years after that ad dress. The Washington judge is a singu larly effective public speaker. It is no Wettder that his services are sought for on a wide variety of oc casions. He was the orator of the day at the Champlain centennial. His oration at the unveiling of a statue to Robert Burns in Barre, Vt., creat ed a distinct impression. Postal Savings Bonds. Public announcement is made by the postoffice department that de positors in the postal savings system may exchange the whole or a part of the deposits on January 1, 1912 for government bonds in denomina tions of 20, 100, and 500 dollars. These bear interest at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum payable semi annually. These bonds are exempt from all taxes in any form and are both registered and coupon. Appli cations ' fbr the conversion of de posits into bonds must bp received before Dec. 15 at the office where the certificates were issued. Deposits thus converted into bonds are not counted as a part of the maximum of $500 allowed one depositor and there is no limit on the amount of these bonds which may finally be acquired by any depositor. These bonds can be procured only by the conversion of postal savings de posits and will not be issued to per sons not now depositors. Interest on the coupon bonds is collected by means of interest coupons while the registered bonds are payable only to the person to whom issued and the interest on these is paid by check. Further particulars con cerning the postal savings bonds may be obtained at the St. Johns bury postoffice. To the Traveling Public. When in Lamoille county, stop at the Hyde Park Inn, under the new management of C. E. Savery, late of the Brandon Inn, Brandon, Vt. Good cooking, clean beds, prompt service, steam heat, electric lights, reason able charges, homelike, pleasant and comfortable. BOTH PHONES PRESS COMMENT ' - "To Advertise Vermont." Speaking of booming Vermont the St. Johnsbury Caledonian is led to suggest that the editor of each Ver mont newspaper in his Thanksgiv ing issue publish something about that which he considers the best opportunity for investment and de velopment in his town or county. After this has been done then does The Caledonian further purpose that all newspapers that can do so pub blish all the articles that may ap pear. The idea is a good one, for what will advance the welfare of one town will advance the welfare of the en tire state. The larger White River Junction becomes, as a trading cen tre, the more varied its commercial interests, and themore people that come to live within its town limits the better will be the material welfare of all the people and interests in all that territory of which it is the natural centre. As a help to this growth and to impart information respecting the opportu nities that abound in White River Junction, The Landmark will gay that an urgent present need' is a department store of the most modern and comprehensive type. The peo ple for miles around come to White River Junction to trade, its out of town patrons are of continuously in creasing numbers and to the end that all this may hot only continue but keep on increasing, new factors of trade must be added without ces sation. A down to date department store has every chance to prosper and expand here in White River Junction. As respects . county improvement and development the one paramount need is the. removal of the county seat from Woodstock to White Riv er Junction. Such realization would infuse new life and vigor in all sec tions of the county, which today has 7,000 less population than it had 80 years ago, and only seven men in each 100 in the county attend church, and we fear this condition will continue as long as the shire town is Woodstock. A man to get to Woodstock must first come to White River Junction, and in view of this fact then it is but the part of wisdom to have the county seat here. There is utter lack of com munity of interest between Wood stock and the other towns of the county, while as between White Riv er Junction and all other towns of the county there is the same warm, harmonious, and cheering heart beat, The Landmark. Advertising Vermont. ' One of the best ways to advertise a town is to start something and then work to have it a success. The corn "show holden today and tomorrow in Windsor will work a great deal of good in the matter of placing this town in the front rank of Vermont towns which are making an effort to, keep in the public eye. We have always noticed that towns which never have anything of a public nature soon get to be "dead" towns. They suffer as do individuals who get into a rut and never make any attempt to get out. To say that the first state-wide corn show ever held in Vermont was held in Windsor is saying something noteworthy. We are a town with a long span of splendid history behind us. Now let's go ahead and make some more history. Hundreds o! active boys and girls are growing every day in our midst and immediate vicinity who need an inspiration. Such things as the corn show will give them one. It will stimulate a desire to acquire a farm some day upon which they can dig out the problems of agriculture, horticulture and forestry, since these three factors as never before in America, are now being safeguarded and cultivated. To our mind the holding of the corn show should prove, as an edu cator, considerably more than an or dinary county fair, where there is such a diversity of products. With one product specialized upon, a vast amount of useful information can be diffused. We can readily see why farming in Vermont has grown unpopular, and we believe that the continued practice of giving' expositions of a character relating to the profitable side of farming, will bring it into popularity. In the first place, for several years past, the education of youth has , been false. There has never been enough broadmindedness exer cised by older people toward young .folks to inculate in the latter the necessity of being a producer and a developer, in short a pioneer in in dustrial activity. A movement is now on foot in Ver mont to give the boys and girls some practical education and those who take advantage of it will reap a rich reward as they grow in years and experience. The Vermont Journal. Orleans County. Apropos to the excellent sugges tion of the St. Johnsbury Caledonian that each paper in Vermont have something to say during' Thanksgiv ing week about the advantages or oportunities in their respective sec tions the Monitor notes briefly three fields in Orleans county that demand development and wilj no doubt, re sult in good returns for money in vested. First, let us note the oft-mentioned field here for summer business. Orleans county has more lakes and ponds of beauty than any other county in the state and is so situat ed that it can command a handsome trade with proper hotel accommo dations. There is little doubt in the minds of those wno have studied the question thoroughly but there Is a rich local field in this line. Second, there are the asbestos and other mineral deposits in the Miss isquoi river valley that, with the coming of the new railroad, will yield prudent Investors handsome profits on their money. There can be little doubt of this in view of the ever increasing demand for asbestos products and the United States re port, after careful Investigation, de clares that the deposits of asbestos in and about Lowell are the best in the United States. Third, there is the development of the granite business in and about Barton. - Every indication from the first points to the conclusion that there is an unlimited quantity of granite of various qualities, shades and adaptabilities in the mountains surrounding this section. Outside parties already have the itching for this property that indicates a general awakening in the near future that will put our granite deposits on the map. These three fields of larger oppor tunities present themselves to the Monitor at once in Orleans county. There are no doubt many other fields in each town, as nearly every individual knows, in agriculture, water power developments, manufac turing industries, etc. Would that those of our county who dabble in stocks, could see the light, and with the same amount of money, worry, loss and achievement that they find in their present game, make our lo cal industries and undeveloped re sources flourish and grow in a manner undreamed of by the - most optimistic.

VERMONT NEWS Time to Apply for Trout. State Fish and Game Commis sioner J. W. Titcomb announces in a pamphlet just issued that brook trout, steelhead trout, lake trout, landlocked salmon and Chinook salmon will be raised by the state this season and may be obtained for stocking public waters by applying to him at Lyndonville, one blank being allowed for each stream or water it is-desired to stock. AH ap plications for fish to be planted in 1912 must be In the commissioner's office not later than March 30 of that year the number of fish as signed depending oh the size of the stream and the number of fish available for distribution. Fish to be planted in public waters will be delivered by the state free of charge to the applicant's nearest railroad station. . Commissioner Titcomb calls attention to the fact that fish may be obtained from the federal government by making application through the Vermont congressmen or through the state commissioner, and that applications to both state and the federal governments may be made for fish to stock the same waters. . The question of whether streams must be stocked before April 15 in order to make posting lawful has arisen so frequently that Mr. Tit comb has referred it- to the attorney-general whose opinion is to the effect that any person who has stocked a stream this year may con sider that his posting holds good for a year from the date the fish were planted. Getting Correct Returns. Mr. Titcomb is laboring to get a very accurate list of the deer killed during the past season and to this end a system of cross checking will be made to verify the reports. Cards were distributed at the opening of the season to the various wardens throughout the state and they were requested to. report daily by this means: The name of the hunter, residence, date and weight of deer were placed on the cards which were easily indexed at the Commission er's office and was a great improve ment over the old system of report tng at the end of the season. A list will he sent back to the ward ens to compare with their own list and any possible correction made Bv this means there will be practi cally no mistakes and until this is done the exact number killed will not be known. Any One who has failed to report or show the head to the warden is requested to do so as soon as possible to avoid de lay. Many new and interesting methods Of conducting the depart ment have been introduced since Mr. Titcomb assumed the office and the work has been greatly simpli fied in every line of the work and better results are obtained. Adjutant General Lee S. Tillotson has organized Company C, V. N. G., in Burlington to take the place of a company recently disbanded in Bel lows Falls. The officers are Capt., E. A. VanCor; 1st lieutenant, E. K. Allen; 2nd lieutenant, L. B. Timms At present there are 40 members. The Central Vermont has placed orders for 200 steel hopper bottom cars, 1000 steel underframe box cars and equipment for two new trains for the New England States Limited as well as for new freight and passenger locomotives. John Connell of Rutland, 44 years- old, died Thursday of heart failure. He was not very well the night before but it - was not known that he was dead until his wife went to awaken him. A. P. Leach of Enosburg Falls has given two large farms to the St. Albans hospital and one farm to the Warner home for orphans. The only proviso is that the income of the farm be used for the support of free beds and the care of the sick, aged and infirm who are unable to care for themselves. The hospital already owns five farms and the Warner home three. It has been decided that Roman Catholic pupils attending the Bur lington high school need not attend chapel exercises. Rev. Fr. Gillis of the Cathedral forbade his children to attend and their principal im mediately yielded to his wishes in the master as he did not wish a stu dent to attend exercises' against which he has religious scruples. William Wilson of Island Pond and his sister whom he had not seen for over 50 years have been spend ing a few days together . in Balti more. They were reunited through the efforts of a brother and sister across the ocean. Mr. Wilson left his home in Ireland in 1860 and hls sister left home seven years after Soon after coming here she lost her brother's address and they had not. heard from each other since. W. C.
