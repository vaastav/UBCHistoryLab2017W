I think it will be easily agreed we should let the Sherman anti trust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by fur ther and more explicit legislation ; but should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facilitate its administration and make it fairer to all concerned. ... I shall take the liberty of addressing you on it in a spe cial message at a later date than this. I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through out the country at which the voters for the several parties may choose their nominees for th presidency without the inter vention of nominating conven tions.

Chapman, in charge of the Oregon exhibit at Chicago, states that his section of the show is crowded at all times by farmers and others eager to secure first hand information regarding this state. The Oregon display is declared by competent judges to be by far the best at the show when quality, variety and effect iveness of staging are considered. Mr. Chapman and his assistants are kept busy all and every even ing in answering the vast number of inquiries showered upon them by people of every class. The demand for public talks and lectures on Oregon and the Pacific Northwest generally is almost too great to be satisfied. "OUR 

BILL" HANLEY IS BOOSTING FOR HARNEY Government To Aid In Forming Juvenile Clubs "Oregon First and All Oregon" is suggested as the slogan of the Oregon Exposition commission in charge of arrangements for a display from this state at San Francisco in 1916. In addition to a building of Oregon wood, furnished with Oregon furniture, with a restaurant serving Oregon food and with sidewalks made of Oregon brick, it is now proposed that soil be taken from Oregon to completely re-surface the Oregon building site on the Ex- iHisition grounds, and to plant therein native Oregon flowers, shrubs and small trees. To secure the necessary material for such planting, it is suggested that an exhibit garden be established in Portland and school children all over the state be enlisted in the work of collection. The com mission has been assured that space for such a garden would be provided, free, on the campus of Reed College. If but one speciment is received from each of the 2500 schools of the state a considerable tract of land will be required to care for them until they are shipped south for per manent planting.

The shipments included four carloads of apples returning an average of $800 per car to the growers. The carloads sent to the East have been sold at more than $2.00 per box, of which 50 cents is deducted for freight Two carloads of prunes were also shipped, each car bringing about $2,500 to the producers. Declaring that speculators by combining for the control of prices have made fortunes at the expense of the hop industry during the last 20 years, a meet ing, attended by 70 representa tive hop men, was held at Salem a few days ago. Deciding that by an organization of their own the hop growers can regain and keep control of the market in the future, a committee was appoint ed to draft a comprehensive plan for a statewide union among the growers. According to the plan discussed, the union will main tain an information bureau with agents at London and New York to keep it advised as to market conditions and prices. It is es timated thai through such organ ization at least $76,000 per year can be saved to the growers in the matter of supplies, which could be bought in wholesale quantities, and an additional $125,000 in commissions which have heretofore been paid to middlemen for disposing of the crop. The Oregon Farmer, a publica tion of the State Immigration Commission is just off the press, and copies will be supplied free of charge to anyone interested. It is a careful resume of the agricultural situation in Oregon and contains a vast amount of valuable information for every farmer in the state. Fit Hit Cm. E.actly.

Eastman's it isn't a ed attention by the newspaper interviewers, for, in the congest ed metropolis he is a celebrity from the wide west whose epigrams and bits of philosophy are as welcome as fresh air. A year or so ago Mr. Han ley chaperoned Governor West and his fellow executives on a tour of the east and he arrived in New York wearing a necktie, the red ness of which flagged even the jaded eyes of the hotel rejiortcrs and at once his droll recitals of the landless areas of the far west won columns of recognition. As a publicity scheme for Oregon he was a net success. This year his triumph has been repeated, for upon running up to New York after attending the conservation congress at Wash ington Mr. Hanley's views on Wilson and war and incidentally on farms and foodstuffs were much sought after. In its last Sunday's number, the New York Times devoted more than a column to Mr. Hanley, who in the course of his remarks, took occasion to plug liberally for Oregon in general and Harney county in particular. His re marks are quoted in part as follews: "The stale of Oregon lately has gone in a great deal for de veloping by putting up to the agricultural college the responsi bility for the success of the farmers of the state. Demonstra tion farms, short courses in agriculture, and traveling ex perts have had great results. Farming is cattle raising and cattle raising is farming now days. Meat producing is no long er a free-range business. Food for cattle has to be grown. "The great opportunity nowa days is in the country, and not in the city. There is no question but that we should be able to meet any local demand for beef and farm products in this country, and at reasonable cost, if the same amount of interest were turned to that line of endeavor that has been turned to other lines that have done so well in this country. There is still plenty of land to be had in Oregon at from $5 to $30 an acre. Harney county alone has about 4,000.000 acres open to homestead. People can come in and take it up nnder the government land law. The enlarged homesteads of 320 acres are now based on a cultivation of crops, not upon living on the land, which is fairer. "The people in Oregon," said Mr. Hanley, "ure very happy just now because they are getting big prices for all their products. Those who have worked long enough, now have automobiles and all the modern luxuries, and those that haven't feel that they soon will have such things. Most of the farm boys and girls are taking courses in agriculture or domestic science, and expect to go back to the farm. "If we are going to keep up the kind of government we have now, we have got to have a new condition of distribution between country life and city life, and a bigger percentage of people in this country must own pieces of the country. 1'eople who live in Sauer kraut cities must own property in the Dalton & Co. I Transportation is a big equalizer I of sentiment. Nobody is any I farther away from a place than i the time it takes to go there, and home is really only a place where you can make a living. "The old fireside," said Mr. Hanley, "is mighty chilly when you haven't the wherewithal to keep a fire in it." An Interesting Program. A group of ladies of the Libra ry Club presented a very inter esting and instructive program at the home of Mrs. I. H. Hol land Saturday evening, it being the annual open meeting of the Club when the gentlemen were permitted to be present and en joy it. The evening was an en tire success in every particular and those present were well en tertained. The discussion of the evening was the Panama canal. Well prepared papers were read and Dr. Ellis gave an illustrated lec ture on the canal showed many good pictures of the work, which were thrown on a serene by a stereopticon. Mrs. W. L. Blott was first called upon and told the "Story of Panama," from an early time when it was first con sidered possible to build a canal and of the efforts of those in the past and finally the successful fulfillment by the United States. Mrs. ('has. Kohn read an in teresting paper on "Sanitation on Panama" which gave one an idea of the tremendous under taking to make it possible for white people to live there and finally accomplish what has been done. Enormous expenditures were made and lives sacrificed to bring this about. Mrs. Harrison Kelley next gave those present "A Journey Through the Canal" in a most interesting paper. This was followed by Dr. Ellis with her illustrations. Miss Georgia Ellis read an address de livered by Mr. Hart before the teachers of Washington on "The Panama Canal and our Civic Responsibilities." This was a most enjoyable number and much appreciated as was the entire program. Several selections were played by a Victrola during the evening and at the close of the literary program those present were ask ed to join in singing the Star Spangled Banner with Mrs. Kembold at the piano. A delightful luncheon was serv ed following the program during which the Victrola was again placed in motion for the enter tainment of the guests. It was a very interesting and profitable evening and the ladies are to be congratulated on the excellent work they are accomplishing and the intelligent manner in which they discuss practical things of the day. The United States Department of Agriculture will cooperate with the Oregon Agricultual College, through its Extension division, in forming girls' and boys' clubs in Oregon. Satis factory assurance of interest in the work of promoting these organizations among the young people of Oregon was given by the Federal authorities to Pro fessor R. D. Hetzel, director of College extension work, at a re cent conference held in Washing ton, D. C. It was further stated by the Federal officers that educational funds will soon be appropaiated to assist in form ing the juvenile clubs and carry ing on the lines of work best suited to Oregon conditions. As guaged by their popularity in other parts of the United States, these clubs are eminently successful in encouraging study and work along the lines of the chosen subjects. In the corn states many corn clubs have been formed among the boys. In the work of the members was in cluded study of scientific and practical questions, such as those of seed, soils and management, and the practice of testing and and judging the corn. Boys' pig clubs are just now receiving especial attention from the De partment, and may be made a part of the club plan in Oregon. Already cooperation exists be tween the College Exension divi sion and the Federal department of Agriculture, and its applica tion to the work among Oregon farmers is to be made more general and effective. Profes sor Hetzel has just made a very careful study of the cooperative extension work in the Southern and Eastern states, and hopes to see its best features utilized in bringing to the Oregon farmers the advantages offered by the combined service.
