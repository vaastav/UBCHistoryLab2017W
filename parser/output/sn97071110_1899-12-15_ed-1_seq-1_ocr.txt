EXPLOSION OF GAS Killed Many Miners at Car. bonado, Washington. CAUSE OP ACCIDENT A MYSTERY Deadly Itlackdamp Followed the Ei ploalon, but the Mine Was K 11 Ventilated. Tacoma, Dec. 12. A mine explosion at Carbonado, 40 miles easterly from Tacoma, at 11 o'clock this morning, killed 33 men. Identification of the dead men is almost impossible. The scraps of clothing thut'iTiW cling to the bodies of the men are carefully pre served, laid aside and labelled to aid in the identification. Frenzied relatives of the missing men gathered at the mouth of the mine and watched eagerly to catch a glimpse of the forms as they wore hurried by to the coroner's office. The work of rescue is being rushed forward, but it may be days before the last blackened form is taken from the mine, for many men are believed to lie buried under masses of earth and rock. To extricate them will take time, and thus far the work of rescue has lieen pushed forward at the extreme endur ance of the workers, for the black damp and noxious gases have driven tho rescuers back repeatedly. When the explosion occurred a rush of the inhabitants was mado in tho di rection of the mouth of tho tunnel. Women, the wives of tho men supposed to be in the shift, ran to and fro, screaming and wringing their hands with anguish, crying children clinging to their skirts. It wag all that D. T. Da vies the superintendent of the mine, could do to stop the wives and friends of the doomed miners from plunging madly into the tunnel's mouth. A revised death list follows: Company men Leonard Johnson, Henry Soni, Matt Rehela and Victor Ruhinaki (formerly given as John Hill) all Finns; Michael Kichinko, John Mellon and Andrew Gecey, Poles; John II. Jones, David X. Thomas, Howell Meredith, sr-, Watkln Jones, Evan M. Lewis, Daniel Davis and Rees Jones, all Welsh; William Wilson, Joseph Lee and Riolmrd Dare, Amer icans, and Ben Zeidler, jr., German. Contract miners August Ilainut and Emil Ilainut, Belgians; Paul Cur tiss, Adam Pavoll, John Flota and Stephen Kraunoga, Poles; Ben Zeidler, sr., Germans; Matt NuUtnd and Jacob Lands, Finns. The cause of the ex plosion is a mystery to every one. " Only safety lamps are worn when at work. Governor Rogers will con duct a searching examination as to the cause of the explosion. He hag tele graphed State Mine Inspeator Owens, now at Spokane, to attend the inquest and examine witnesses himself. The question of the ventilation of the mine, in conformity with the state law, will be thoroughly gone into. The total number of men in the un fortunate shift was 76, of whom 44 are alive, all of them having escaped of been rescued. The mines are owned by the Carbon Hill Coal Company. They give work to 400 men, and have an output of 800, 000 tons annually, and are situated 40 miles from Tacoma, on the Cascade division of the Northern Pacific The mines are in a deep ravine, through which the Carbon river flows. The mines are supplied "with every appli ance for safoty. They are largely tun neled, and the tunnels are so big that locomotives are run into them. In 1890 an explosion at this same mine cost two lives, and John Hartman and some others were severely burned. Aid for Needy, Seattle, Dec. 12.

Ono of tho most singulur suits on record has just been decided in tho city court in this city, Marcus Braun having secured a judgment against the Wagner Palace Car Company for $750, as damages for a mistake made by ono of ti e com pany's conductors, who alotted a berth already sold to Braun to a woman. When tht error was discovered every berth in the train was sold, and Braun was compelled to sit in the smoking compartment during a trip from Cleve land to this city. When Braun bought his coupon for the berth he left his luggage in the seat and went to the smoking compartment. He did not return for two hours, ac cording to his own story, but when he did, he found the berth made up and occupied.

Ho believes that this is the simplest solution of the whole Sampson-Schley controversy, and it is expected that Senator Well ington will introduce a bill in a few days providing for the appointment of two vice-admirals without specifying names. The president very frankly said that If such a bill became a law, he would promptly nominate both Sampson and Schley in the order named. This ar rangement, both the president and Sen ator Wellington believe, will meet the approval of a majority of the friends of both officers. Railroad Conforenoe. In New York. New York, Dec. 11.

SAVED BY ARTILLERY His Batteries Kept Gatacre From Heavier Loss. TUB GUIDES NOT TRUSTWORTHY British Bet at An Impo.slble Tank and Agalnat Superior Foroes-Oiilu-lou. of the I'res.. London, Dec. 13. Later details re garding the disaster to General Gat acre's column show that but for tho magnifloent work of the British artil lery the diaaater would hnve boen tar more extensive, as' the luoeasant Boer Are in the midst of repulsed infantry ultimately led to disorder, which only escaped developing into rout through the batteries of artillery ocoupying suc cessive positions, covering the retreat, thus drawing a portion of the Boer's galling fire. Apparently, the British were set at an Impossible task, and were treacher ously guidod. After a trying march and being under arms 18 hours, they attacked the wrong part of the Boer po sition, where, the hill was impregnable, and the burghers were estimated to number 6,000 men instead of 500, as spies had reported. There is little in the story to mitigate the immense hu miliation caused by tho episode, which as almost an exact counterpart of tho battle of Nicholson's Nek. Tho war riflce was besieged by anxious relatives today, and successive editions of tho newspapers were eagerly scanned. Men and women are equally persistent in pleading for information, but the authorities either do not possess any, or are not prepared to publish it at present. The affair has caused a most de pressing influence everywhere, not ex cepting the stock exchange, where consols were at the lowest price in many years, and South African securi ties slumped, not so much on account of the military reverse, which is re trievable, but owing to jirofound appre hension as to its political effect. No great surprise would now be felt in Cape Colony's becoming aflame from end to end. ENGLAND IS DEPRESSED. London Paper All Regnrd the Defeat a. a Mo.t Serious One. London, Deo. 13. Discussing the defeat of General Gatacre at Storm beru, the Daily Mall saya: "Quite apart from the loss of 800 fighting men, tho unex peted Boor suc cess will probably cause a more gen eral and serious movement among the Cape Dutch. The government must promptly face this by the immediate dispatch of further troops." The Daily News says: "The reverse General Gatacre has suffered is a sadly emphatio commentary on the peculiar difficulty of military operations in a semi-disaffected country.. The en emy's spies are everywhere, aud no where can we rely confidently on any counter information. General Gatacro seems to have been completely trapped. Of course ho will immediately be rein forced." . The Daily Chronicle says: "There is only too muoh reason for fear that this is tho worst illustration we have had yet of inadequate equipment and insutficient scouting, now far this disaster was due to lack of judgment on the spot and how far to lack of ar tillery is not quite clear, but the pa tient public cannot holp reading that General Methuen's victory at Modder river was won by artillery reinforce ment at the critical moment, and all they would like to know is how many times this particular lesson is to be learned." The Standard gays: "The event is in the highest degree deplorable. It will tell against us unfavorably in the Free State, among the colonial Dutch and even among the natives. A great deal of evidence has been accumulat ing during the past weeks to show how deeply the colony, or at least the north ern and western portions of it, are honeycombed by dissatisfaction. Our generals have to cope with a rebel col ony as well as hostile republics, and must take measures to lay their plans in accordance with the details." SHERMAN REGRETS. Bay the Presldent'a Philiplne Policy I. Wrong. Philadelphia, Deo. 18. In response to an invtation to attend an ftnti-im-perialitit mass meeting to be held at the Academy of Music, on the centennial anniversary of the death of Washing ton, December 4, the following letter hag been received from ex -Secretary of State John Sherman, dated at Washing ton: "I have a strong conviction that the president erred in sending soldiers to the Philippines to take possession of their country. The United States had wisely, as I think, assisted the Fili pinos in driving the Spaniards out of the Philippine islands, and should, I think, have aided them in protecting their country against all assaults. He no doubt was advised to adopt the measures taken, and all I can do is to express my regrets. Yours very truly,
