2 IMPEDE IRRIGATION Obstacles That Must Be Removed by the States. MUST EXAMINE CERTAIN RIGHTS South Dakota Furnishes Proof of the .Need of Canteen* In the Arm jr. IVoin The Journal Jiuruau. Hoom *S, Post Building, Washington. Washington, Deo. 9.—Friends of irriga tion in the west realize that great care must be exercised in the initiation of an irrigation policy. There is a particular point where friction between the irriga tion states may occur unless there Is a perfect understanding beforehand. Many of the western rivers -which will be tapped for ditches flow through two, three, four or more states. What are the rights of these several states, collectively and in dividually? Has one the power to divert the water so that it will not flow through another? In Montana this question is likely to arise, and In Washington, Ne braska, Kansas and Colorado. Perhaps there are other states which belong in the list. Kansas and Colorado are now en- j gaged in a contest to settle one of the phases of the question, and when the su preme court has told the country what Its opinion is the way may be clearer than It now is. The Arkansas river flows through both Kansas and Colorado. Colo rado, where irrigation on a large scale has been under way for years, has di verted the water of the Arkansas so that Kansas is herself getting ready to irri gate and needs the Arkansas river for that purpose. The case has been in the courts for several years and came to the supreme court of the United States sev- j eral months ago. | It is also possible that an occasional International question regarding irriga tion rights may come up. The Mouse river, for instance, flows through North Dakota and has its mouth in Manitoba. Should the Dakota people, through irri gation, take practically all of the water from the Mouse river, what would the Canadians say, the river being quite a Urge stream in their country? Beforo the national policy is announced It Is believed that the states must, through their legislatures, reach some harmonious basis of action with regard to flowage rights and the numerous other questions of au interstate character which Irrigation Is likely to present. It la President Roosevelt's idea that there should be co-operation of this sort be tween the states and the general govern ment. Possibly congress will begin the work without it, but there can be no such results as the western people desire until the legislatures have taken hold in an intelligent way. Army ( an teen Aeedeil. Francis Buchanan of Sioux Falls, S. D., tells a story that is a strong argument in favor of the army canteen. To some newspaper men in Washington he said: The year before the canteen was estab lished there were eighteen murders commu ted by soldiers at Fort Meade and forty-five CUM of highway robbery. Within 100 feet of the reservation there twenty-two saloons. A large per cent of the faunates of the post hospital were insane patients, brought to their end by drinking liquor. The second year the canteen was in operation at the post there were no murders, not a case of high way robbery, and not a case of Insanity la the hospital. Two years before, the general court-martial sat constantly to dispose of cases against the soldiers, and even then tho minor offenses could not be investigated for lack of time. As a consequence, soldiers went unpunished for slight breaches of regulations which would otherwise have been taken up. After the canteen was in operation, it was only necessary to hold general court-martial two days each month. 1 am anxiously await ing the result of the abolition of the canteen at this post. Antl-Oleo Bill Chairman. Representative Wadsworth of New York will be reappointed as the chairman of the committee on agriculture, notwith standing all that has been said to the contrary effect. It is everywhere known that Wadsworth is against the oleo bill. Last congress he did all he could to defeat it, and he may be expected to renew his fight in this congress. But that is not a ground for refusing to rename him as chairman of the committee which will handle the bill. The speaker would get himself and congress into a nice snarl if he were to make up his important com mittees entirely with reference to wheth er certain men proposed for them were in favor or against certain legislation. Such an attitude would not be indorsed for a moment in or out of congress. Mr. Wads worth is one of the strong and reliable members of the house. He is a practical farmer, and singularly enough for a man of his calling, he thinks that the principle of the oleo bill is wrong, and therefore he is against the bfll; but the majority of the committee on agriculture will be against him, and so will the majority of the whole house. The bill will go through commit tee and house without difficulty. The fight in the house will be led by Congressman Tawney of Minnesota, who has been act ing In that capacity at the request of the officers of the national dairy association for several years. Loyally aiding him will be McCleary of Minnesota, Davidson of Wisconsin and others. Senator Spoon er will lead the fight in the senate, aided by Haosbrough and Proctor. Diuiiitt AVlth the Preildent. Senator Clapp has been to the White Hou9e for a formal dinner. There were with him two cabinet officers, several other senators and a few representatives. At every session of congress the president is compelled, by custom, to invite every member of both house* of congress to dine with him. He is also compelled to invite the cabinet, the supreme court and the members of the several legations. It is a big job keeping track of these din ners, and knowing ju3t who has and who has not yet been invited. This work falls on the private secretary of the pres\;lent, who divides the numerous persons entitled to dinner invitations into a number of •mall groups. The invitations began to go out a week ago, and the list will not be finished until late in the winter. It is lots of fun for the senators and congressmen, who only go once a year, but it must get to be quite a bore to the president. Senator Clapp has gone to the Cairo for the session. Congressman Stevens of St. Paul, also lives there. Senator Dol!i --ver lives at the Portlier, Senator Gamble «t the Normandie. where he has lived for several years, Senator Gibson of Mon tana, at the Cochran. Senator Kittridge at the Shoreham, Senator McCumber at 1534 Twenty-second street NE, and Sen ator Quarles at the Normandie. The Nor mandie is a popular hotel for congress men, because Speaker Henderson lives there. The Senate Conimitteen. Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, is a member of the senate committee which will decide about the rearrangement of the standing committee lists. The repub lican majority in the senate is now bo large that there is a feeling that the re publicans should have more places on committees than they had in the last congress. The changes will be brought about by dropping the lowest man on the democratic side of each committee and Catarrh Is a constitutional disease.

In the direction named. It was stated at the meeting of the business men that the encampment fund would have to contain about |50,000. The G. A. R. has not met in Washington for a good many years. Richard Croker is going to West Ba den, Ind., to recuperate. Several of the big chiefs of Tammany hall will accom pany him. Senator Tim Sullivan is now there. As West Baden Is a good deal nearer Minneapolis than New York, Mayor Ames will have an opportunity to study Tammany methods at comparatively short range. After staying several weeks at West Baden, Croker will return to New York, and iheu sail for Europe. Congressman Tawney's address ia St. lx)uis, Dec. 20, on the occasion of the breaking of ground for the big exposition, will be a notable effort. He has been busy two weeks preparing it and those who have talked with him about It say it will be the greatest speech he ever has delivered. —W. W. Jerraane. 

BOERS IN TRANSVAAL HI IK.il Kit* MIST BE KEPT MOVINIi Thin Is the Only Course Open to the British, Who Are in Need of Store Troops. Pretoria, Dec. 9. —Much remains to be done in the way of partitioning the coun try by means of lines of blockhouses be fore the British can hope effectively to clear the Boers away from the large dis tricts of the eastern Transvaal. Block houses a mile or more apart are usek/ss in preventing the passage of Boers at night when 'they are determined to cross. Nothing short of blockhouses six or seven hundred yards apart and connected by means of formidable wire entanglements will prove effective. To thread the country in this way is, in the opinion of the military authorities, the only method of dealing with an enemy who refuses to tight and adopts guerrilla tactics. ' North of the Delagoa railway line the Boers are momentarily free from the presence of the British columns. The mountain ranges afford endless hiding places for the enemy, supplies are plenti ful and wheat which finds its way all over the country Is carefully concealed for future use. It is impossible to avoid this unless the Boers are kept moving, and to effect this many more troopß are required. The most noticeable development in the Orange River colony Is the concentration under De Wet, south of Heilbron, of a thousand men.

MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL*. BANE RUN IN OMAHA City Savings Bank Had Piles of Gold in Readiness. WRONG IMPRESSION GOT OUT Xo Connection Between the Concern and Loan .V Trust, but Depoai tori Thona-ht Differently. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 9. —There were sev eral depositors of the City Savings bank present to withdraw their money when the doors of that institution opened this morning, owing to a misunderstanding, said Vice President Flack, that the savings bank was connected with the Ombaha Loan and Trust company, which was re ported Saturday to be In financial diffi culties. Four tellers paid the depositors as fast as they presented their books, but many of them on learning that the bank had become distinct from the trust company, returned and again deposited their money. The bank officials were pre pared for the run and had great piles of gold on the counters with which to pay the uneasy depositors. '•The run is due solely to the wrong Im pression that the savings bank is con nected with the Omaha Loan and Trust company," said Vice President Flack. "There is no connection whatever between the two companies, but as the owners and officers of the City Savings bank a short time ago bought the savings bank depart nietn of the Omaha Loan and Trust com pany and is occupying the offices formerly occupied by it, several persons do not yet realize that the two Institutions are en tirely separate and distinct." "While there is absolutely no occasion for the run." continued Mr. Flack, "the City Savings bank is prepared to meet any demands that may be made and will pay promptly every depositor who pre sents his book."

PRIEST MARRIED Fr. Politeo of Kansas Says That He Waa Entrapped. Ifoui York Sun Speoiul Servio* Kansas City, Dec. 9.—Rev. Father An thony Politeo, a priest of Kansas City, Kan., who was secretly married at St. Joseph, Nov. 19, to Eva M. Springstein, sometimes known as Eva Fair, who clalma Chicago as her home, claims that he was led into a trap and denounces the woman as an adventuress. Father Politeo was exiled from Dal niatia, an Austro-Hungarlan state, be cause of his liberal political views and fearless advocacy of them. He labored for a time among the people of his own nationality in Johnstown, Pa., then came to Kansas City two months ago and es tablished a new parish among the Cro tlans. He made considerable progress to wards securing funds for the erection of a new church and was very popular with his parishioners until the crash came. Now they accuse him of various offense* of which the poor priest is probably as innocent as a lamb. The young woman is living at the Midland hotel, where she is registered as Mrs. Eva M. Fair. Her marriage to Politeo she admits, with the explanation that she did not know he was a priest. She declares that Father Po liteo has contributed toward her support and that part of the money was in coin of small denomination, such as pennies, nickels and dimes. Father Politeo was in his university days a friend of Henrlk Slenklewicz. STRICKEN IN THE PULPIT St. Paul MinUter Dies o* Paralysis at Gladbrook, lowa. Special to The Journal.

GREEN TIMBER Minneapolis Lumbermen Are i Given a Hearing by In dian Commissioner. From Th» Journal Bureau, Jtoom *J, Pott ■ Building, Washington. Washington, Dec. —Ray W. Jones, \ president, and Nathan Clapp, counsel for • the Commonwealth Lumber company of' Minneapolis, had a hearing at the Indian j office to-day, at which the demand for! payment for green timber cut by that company on the White Earth reservation was thoroughly discussed. Besides the representatives of. the com- j pany and Commissioner Jones, Special j Agents Farr« O'Neill and McComas and t other representatives of the department j were present. Farr and O'Neill each | made separate investigations of the green timber cut on the reservation, which re sulted in the demand for the payment of about $31,000 in excess of the dead-and down price for logs cut by the Common wealth company. At to-day's hearing Ray Jones and his attorney contended that the department's agents went too far in their findings in j that much of the timber they classed as i green, was legitimately "dead or down." They also contended that under the con tract approved by the department they had a right to cut green timber for necessary roadways and were also allowed to cut green trees for booms and other neces sary works incident to getting out logs. Another contention of the companies was that the price set by the government was j entirely too high, and that it was far j above the market price for the same grade of logs sold by private parties. In reply to these statements, Special Agents O'Neil and Farr vigorously de fended their findings. They took up each camp separately, and pointed out that all their notes and reports of their discov eries and classification of green logs were corrected, to defense of the price put on green logs by the department they and the commissioner quoted prices ob tained from their contractors in Min nesota, showing that they were not above market price and were practically the same as those that ruled among private owners last season. The hearing was concluded without any action on the part of Commissioner Jones. He announced that he would take it under advisement. Before any conclu sion ia reached all the papers will be 'briefed and submitted to Secretary Hitch cock, who will probably give out a state ment showing every detail of last win ter's d«ad-and-dcwn operations on the ceded Chippewa reservation. —W.

As time draws on, party leaders are beginning to realize that John Lind is in deadly earnest in his with drawal from stats politics. He tells them frankly that the party has no more claim on his services, and that he proposes to fol low his own bent hereafter, which is to earn a competence in the practice of law. Chairman Rosing and a few others still hope to prevail on Lind at the last minute, but Minneapolis democrats who are close to him have resigned chemselves to his with drawal. E. S. Corser, one of his most trusted lieutenants, who held the office of surveyoi general for this district, said the other day: I have not talked politics with Governor Lind for a good while, but I do not expect to see him lead our party again next year. He has responded three times to the call of duty. Twice I have gone to him with a good grace and have urged him to acept the nomination. I could uot do so again. When asked whom the mantle of Lind would be likely to fall upon, Mr. Corser confessed himself at a loss, but thought there would be no trouble in finding a good candidate. Without doubt there are plenty of strong, high-minded men in the opposition ranks, but who is there that can get the votes? This problem will be a worry from now until July. Dan Lawler tg the strongest man iv sight, but he could not hold the populist wing,' and would not have the hearty support of enthusiastic Bryanites. Other possibilities are Thomas Canty, S. M. Owen, E. S. Reishu* and L. A. Rosing. In each case there are arguments pro and con. The local democracy are not worrying much about the state ticket. They hope to take advantage of republican dissensions in the county and city, and are figuring on a strong local ticket. It is believed that John Lind would be much more likely to accept the nomination for congress than anything else, and hopes ars being built up on him. Fred B. Snyder has consented to be a candidate for renomination to the state sen ate In the thirty-ninth district. This will be good news for fri-ends of the university, •who have been anxious to see Senator Snyder stay in the legislature. He has been a tower of strength in getting recognition tor the Institution, and since the death of Gov ernor Pillsbury will be needed more than ever. He Is one of the really able men in the state senate and exerts an influence on all legislation. As the champion of the board of control bill in the upper house, he can plead with a good grace for the exemption of educational Institutions from that act. He never, favored 6uch a broad application of the system. Friends of Senator Snyder have talked of him as a candidate for congress, but he has evidently decided that the field is already vueU filled. He has already one rival for the nomina tion. E. F. Comstock of the ninth ward, a member of the courthouse and city hall commission, has announced his candidacy. He has served three terms in the lower house, but has not been actis-e in politics since he opposed Senator Da^is for re-election. lit. came out as a candidate before Senator Sny der announced his '■andidaoy, and may con rlude discretion to be the better part of valor. John C. Sweet would have been a candi date for the senate had Snyder kept out. He will in.all probability try for another term in the house. Editor Gordon of the Orookston Journal wants a special election in Polk county to elect a senator, so that the county will be represented at the extra session. The argu merit is* put thus cogently: Among the many Important matters which will come up for consideration by the special see«ion of the legislature which will be held this winter, !s that of considering the report of the tax commission and acting upon it. This is a question of great Importance to every part of the state and in its determina tion Polk county must certainly be given its proper share of representation. Various rail road questions of unusual weight will also demand attention and no part of the state is more vitally concerned in demanding judi- MONDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 9, 1901. clous and equitable measures than is the northern part. We have at present no reprp sentative In the upper house. Senator Ry der's removal from the county leaves Polk county's senatorship vacant, and unless the vacancy is filled it will be an act of injustice to her people. It is not likely that this will be accom plished. The seat could not officially be de clared vacant until the legislature meets and the senate passes on the case of Senator Ry der. No one doubts that he Is ineligible, but , each house is the Bole judge of the qualifica tions of its members. Warren Potter of Altkln Is mentioned as a successor to Senator C. C. McCarthy in the fifty-second district. —C. B. C. 

NOWTHEN'S CREAMERY Pay* fB,OOO Yearly for Milk.— Output In Great Demand. Special to The Journal. Auoka, Minn..
