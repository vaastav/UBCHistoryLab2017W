m BRAKES OX CITY FUXDS MF.TZ SHUTS DOWN HARD. Improvements Costing $122,000,000 Held Up Temporarily. The Hoard of Estimate yesterday shut down hard on money spending by passing a resolution intro duced by Controller Metz providing that all un eward^d and unregistered authorizations bo held tip until r- latrodac d and reauthorized by the board. This means a temporary suspension of proprr*"ss on proposed improvements acgrepatinp $n2/MX).OQO. The board has authorized improvements to the c ]-j.-> of about 1300,900.000, of which contracts to th« amount of fT". ■••'■>•> have already been awarded. The .-'..-;• - si m of the tentative contracts moans a winter of idleness for thousands of employes of contractors who are ready to co ahead with con struction work. Controller Met* is findinc it difficult to g«t the banks to !>:;y the city's short term revenue bonds, although they command about 6 per o^nt interest. "I think that ■M one ouphl to apply for ■ re ceiver for the city of New York." hotly declared . Barm President '••]• r. 'What condition Bin your streets be ■ -■• "Does that hold up all contracts?" asked Presl . dent Ahearn. "Does that hold up sewers in The Bronx?" asked President •! :rf. vof that lmnii.li President emu well of the rtoimn.ll of Richmond and President T bml of the Borough of Queens looked dazed. "How can you do it? It is not even legal!" cried President Coler. "It is legal If it is economical and the hoard dees It." replied Controller Metz. "You can't repudiate these authorizations," re turned Mr. Qatar. "Did you ever stop to think of the debt limit?" demanded Controller M-t7. "I know all about it." replied Mr. Coler. "You don't seem to know anything about it or you wouldn't talk like that." retorted the Con troller. "Get a receiver for the city!" exclaimed Mr. Color. "I won't vote for anything like that." S The Mayor was evidently pleased by the pros pective backing of the Board of Estimate in his •eracUce of economy, and had the resolution read apa«n. , "That's fair." he said. "The question la on th» resolution. " "AH those present voted in favor of it except President Coler. who said "Xo: 11 vehemently. Early in the hearing the determination to re trench on account of the financial condition of the city was emphasized more than once. Controller ■eta at the start favored puttinc off Indefinitely the expenditure of ■->■....-. for the acquisition of property for the Manhattan approach of the Biack well> Island Bridge. Uo said it would 1,..? be re quired for several rears to come, and miclit be ob tained more cheaply in a year or so. President iloGowar, said lie did not think that was true, but rather that it would cost more. There will be a Jicarinß 0:1 the matter on January 10. The original authorization of $1450.000 to meet the cost of abolishing prade crossings of highways and railroads was c;;t down to $300,000 in a new resolution. President Cromwell tried hard to get an appro priation of J165.W0 for a topographical bureau which he declared was needed for the future welfare of the borouph. He finally compromised and accepted 57:.."" which was granted. "Every department of the city government is laying off employes now by the hundreds because ■we haven't the money to ray them." said Mayor MeClellan. An objection -was also made to the approval of the plans for the Riverside Drive extension to the Hudson Memorial P.ridce. behause it would involve payment for th« preparation of the plans, a natter of n«.«f«>. "I haven't the money to pay it." said Controller Motz. "You would have to pay it now if I sent you the bill." said President At,, .in. "No. 1 wouldn't," said Mr. M»tz. "You'd have to mandamus me to set the money." Chief Engineer Lewis, who had his salary raised recently from v:.:*. to n2.«M. recommends th* dismissal of thr«*e law clerks in his office because they were not ■ eded. President Ahearn did not like this idea, but it prevailed. The application of the Park Commissioners for an appropriation of J2.:.76.7W was passed by <:: tirely. This was la he used for the improvement of Centra! Park. There was objection by President Ahearn when the Street Cleaning Commissioner recommended that the bids of Thomas Crimmins and others for the removal of snow in Manhattan and The Bronx Be withdrawn. "Why da you want to do that?" he asked. "Because of excessive coat," saM Mayor McClel lan. "I think the contractors ought to get a hearing and '" given s.»m« reason for this action." "It is not officially f^fore the board,"' insisted the Mayor. Th« jiverape iiid was 4; cents ■ cubic yard. The Brooklyn bids were approved and awarded to Hush '.. Starr, Charles Crawford and the Bracken - McAvoney company. These bids ranced from 3S to IS cents a «--jnic yard. When a resolution providing for an emergency appropriation of 

IMW.OOO for the removal of snow jvas introduced. Controller Metz asked that it be referred to him. "Referred to the Controller, and trust to God that it won't grow." said Mr. Metz. and the reso lution was *=o referred. The applications of the several independent tele phone companies were scheduled for consideration by the board, but on account of the illness of Martin W. Uttleton. the counsel for the Atlantic Telephone Company, which is seeking ■ franchise to compete with the New York and New Jersey Telephone Company, the consideration of the fran chises was put off for two weeks.

CCARREN UNLIKE SAT t Colcr and Mctz Fervently Thank God lies Not Behind Them. A vision of Senator P. H. McCarren as a lobbyist round the Finance Department was conjured up yesterday at the meeting of the Boa>-d of Estimate by Soroush President Color of Brooklyn, who tried to link the Controller with the Senator. The Queens Lighting Company some time ago applied for a franchise for electric lighting in the , new parts of the borough. The Woodhaven Light ing Company, which seems to be worling in bar mo]-. wit', the Lighting Trust, has opposed the n#»w company. The new company sought to man damus the Board of intimate-, but the courts de nied its application. •■] am not in favor." BaM the Controller, "of granting any franchise for $I.™°. They all ought to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.- The counsel of the company did not tl ink it worth while to come to my office. Instead, they went to the courts and got the rewupapern to say that the. Consolidated Gas Company »as holding up the franchise." -U'cl!. I know something about the lobbying that has been going on behind this application." said President Oder. •The lobbying Is behind you. not behind me," said Controller Metz. ■'McCarren was never behind me. thank God," said < 'filer. •Nor behind me, thank God." said Met*. "Since this franchise was held up the Wood haven Gas Company baa rapidly been laying mains in .1 large arm of the territory wanted by the new company." sai.l Borough President Perm.] of Queens. "The Woodhaven company has had the right to lay these mains since ISO, but it did not get busy till the new company tried to pet this franchise.** "This board is simply holding up the franchise till the Consolidated pets its mains in," asserted Mr Coler. who sail!, after the adjournment: "McCarren is at the bottom of this thing.

BOSH, SAYS BINGHAM. No Crime Increase, hut Persons Rob Themselves for Insurance. Police Commissioner Blngham issued the follow ing statement yesterday in reply to a published story that crime was increasing: The statement th.it more burglaries, larcenies ami thefts of all kinds ii.iv. !>• •!, committed in New York in the last sixty days than in any like period in its history is simply not true. If there are others who know more about these matters | than the polio who .••i they, and why don't they helri the police? It is true that the Police Department does not give out for publication certain cases that are re- ! ported unless arrests are made. One of the chief I reasons why the pol •• don't make public the burg laries ti.it occur is because of the pernicious ac tivity <■>: the solicitors for burglar Insurance com panies. Tho minute a person is unfortunate enough to have bis bouse or Mat robbed and t\e victim's ; name is made public, these solicitors get busy and , made the victim's life miserable. As the cold weather comes on, the kinds of ' crime that must »••■ expected to Increase are burg- < laries robberies and larcenies. This happens every I year and undoubtedly will occur this year, .ii though so far there has been no unusual Increase in either of these kinds Of crime. It may be that the situation this year may be worse than other years because there will probably be a larger num ber of men than usual out of employment. i ,,. a ... . one suppose for a moment that trie burglary insurance companies are doing business Ht .-•. loss? "Which is what would seem to be Implied, by the article In question. The police are not un able to cope with the situation, but on the con- ■ trary are doing the best work that has ever been ; done in N« w York City. QUIZ N. G.N. V. CONTRACTS. j ' ! i Officer Tells Investigators About the j Purchase of Uniforms. j The Walnrlght Commission, appointed by Gov- : ernor Hushes to investigate the National Guard. ; observed -..-■.■ afternoon some of th«- ways in • which the business end— the purchasing of uniforms and supplies— is managed. The commission met at ! the Stab Arsenal 25th street and Seventh avenue. ; and the witness of the day was Adjutant General j Xelsnn H. Henry. j The adjutant general was risked concerning the methods of purchasing supplies. He produced a contract made with Browning. King A- Co. on No- I vember 23. 1306. providing for one thousand coats. ! nine hundred trousers for foot soldiers and one ; hundred trousers for mounted, tiif- material to be ; olive drab covert cloth. One week later. November j •■". the contract was modified to provide 22-ounce j kersey cloth instead of the first rain.! material This resulted In a reduction of nearly 50 cents for each rment, but the commission wanted to know why new bids had not been Invited. General Henry said that the mills bad stopped making the olive drab covert material, and since the Browning- King Company bad been the lowest bidders among the original contract peckers he supposed there was no use of going through the formality and accept ing the delay Incident to new contracts. This was an unusual proceeding, be explained. Witness said that the cloth for service uniforms, both for the United Btates army and for the na tional guard, was made by the American Woollen ! Mills. and said the reason the government could get uniforms cheaper thai: the Slate of New York was because the government f'rdered in larger ] quantities. The hearing was adjourned until II o'clock on Tut ii in the Hall of r:<-corils. Th«» Armory Board will appear before It. as well as several city officials. ■ m ' | STEAMER BURNED IN MARYLAND.

He has had important duties devolving upon him. including such service as chief pay master In tli-'- Philippines, Porto Rico and Cuba. He will serve as paymaster general of the army until 1913. There is no more modest man In the Unit States army than Colonel Whipple. and his career, when he is asked for .in account of it. is usually summed up in the statement that he "tried to do bis duty." The official records, however, bear testimony to at. event of much interest in his service and one which is typical of the officer, In .1 communication to the War Department from Brigadier cleneral James M. lull, from which th«; following extract is taken: Colonel Whipple had a lons and arduous service on the frontier in a tli.-trn t where lone, tedious overland trips had to be made, being often exposed to the Intense old and death dealing blizzards. For many years while stationed at Fort Kim'kli he paid the troops .it Kort Buford, where I was sta tioned. ■■■■:. from the railroad, and at l'oplar River seventy miles to th»^ northwest.

Fortunately Colonel Whipple had the funds under the seat of the ambulance. Alone with the dying servant, his clerk having jumped from the ambulance. Major Whipple, gath ered up the reins let fall by the wounded driver, and tinrinn the team to its greatest speed, managed to escape and reach Scott's ranch, seven miles away, thus Bavin? the government fund.*.
