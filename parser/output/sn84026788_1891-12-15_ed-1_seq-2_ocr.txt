SPIRIT OF JEFFERSON." Chaulbs Toira. JnTtanton Codstt, W. Va. TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 15. 1831. The grip is again becoming epi demic. The Now York Cauip of Confeder ate Veterans will give a benefit in aid of the Grant monument fund. Washington correspondents say that Stephen B. KIkins will be nomi nated by the President for Secretary of War. _ Senator Kenna ha? been selected as a member of the committee to ar range the organization of the Senate for the Fifty-second Congress. Charles Town asks that the next Democratic state convention be held there. The request deserves consid eration.? Morgantown New Dominion. A Washington special to the Wheel ing Register says it is believed that Hon. Wm. L. Wilson will be placed on the Way3 and Means Committee.' Colonel Thomas W. Higginson will contribute a eharming paper, entitled "The Lilliputian Theory of Woman," to the forthcoming number of Iltxr per's Bazar. Senator Faulkner will introduce a resolution authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay over West Virginia's share of the direct tax, about 8181,000. The defeat of Roger Q. Mills for the speakership has given widespread support, it is said, to the efforts of his Texas admirers to elect him to the United States Senate. The next number of Harper's Week ly, published December 16th, will contain a four page map, giving a bird's-eye view of the exposition grounds and buildings at Chicago. The West Virginia Congressmen say they would have voted solidly for Mr. Wilson for speaker at any time, and proposed to put him in nomina tion and support him until he or some one else were chosen. It is safe to predict, if not a long "run," at least a large number of productions on the amateur stage, for "Bobby Shnftoe," the comic operetta by H. C. Butler, published in the Christmas number of Harper's Young Peoitle. If we were asked to select from our exchange list the paper of the most sterling worth, we would have no hes itation in choosing the Baltimore Sun. Its editorials are able, its news full, well classified and generallj- accurate. In a word, The Sun is a model news paper, and its popularity in this sec tion is best attested by a large and constantly increasing circle of appre ciative readers. To the enterprise of friend Avirett, of the Cumberland Daily Times, we give credit for the first full copy of the President's message placed in our hands last Wednesday. The Times supplement containing it was printed and well on its way towards Cumber land before the message was offered for sale on the streets of Washington. A good bit of journalistic enterprise, which we are pleased to chronicle. The message of President Harrison contains nothing very striking. The tariff law is, of course, approved, and the usual matters touched upon are spoken of in a way complimentary to the administration. Touching the New Orleans episode, he recommcnds that Federal courts be given jurisdic tion iji offences against treaty rights. The. tone of the message in dealing with the attack in Valparaiso upon the sailors of the I5altimore is strong and aggressive. The change of method in selecting presidential electors in Michigan is referred to with some feeling, and is made the occasion of a recommendation that Congress should fix the method of such appointments so as to be uniform and free from the gerrymander. On 1 his scorc thePhil adelpliia Record sugge'sts that the Michigau scheme is not a gerryman der, and is innocence itself beside the policy of admitting new State3 in or der to defeat the Teal choice of the people. Senator Faulkner has introduced bills for the relief of the trustees of the M.-E. Church at Harper's'Ferry, trustees of M. P. Church of Middle way, for the relief of William M. Morrison, Adam Kidwilcr, Edward Tearney, administrator of Wru. Mc Sherry, deceased ; a bill providing for the payment of the amounts due the employees and the contractors who furnished castings to the United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry, from January 1 to 19, 1801, inclu sive ; a bill to authorize the Secretary of War to cause to be investigated and to provide for the payment of all claims for the use and occupation of church, college and school buildings for government purposes by the Uni ted States military authorities during the late war, and the value-of such buildings destroyed during such oc cupation by the United States and all claims for repairs to any such build ings and the furniture of the same, rendered necessary by such occupa tion by the pnited Slates army. Cleveland Favored Wilson for Speaker. If the Deadlock Had Continued, the TPest Tirginia Man Would Have Been Offered. The regular correspondent of the Philadelphia Press, writing from New Yorlt under date of December 7, as serts that it was the intention of greater politicians to cause a dead lock in the speakership caucus, by which ultimately a certain candidate could be accepted by a sufficient number to make his nomination as sured, and then goes on to say: A few days ago the Press was the first to hint at the name of the roan whom those who are nearest to Gro ver Cleveland here really have had in mind for the Speakership for several months. This morning the World which is frequently the first to scent important political moves, of all the ne**papers here, in a, double-leaded article indicated the possibility of an ultimate concentration upon Judge V\ iJson, of West Virginia. Although not named in caucus, the politics which have brought his name in view will be of interest and impor tance to narrate. Early in the sum mer. just as Grover Cleveland was going to his summer home on Buz zard's Bay, a meeting of his friends took place here. It was ostensibly for the purpose of consultation re specting his prospects, and what should be done in case it appeared i!inn chance for the nomination in - was a very dim one. At that time the Press printed an account of the meeting of these men here. The gathering, however, was not for the purpose which was then an nounced. It was to talk over the Speakership matter. AH of Mr. Cleveland's friends were in favor of the nomination of Mr. Mills, for they said that he alone of the prominent Democrats in this Congress repre sented fully the ideas upon which the Democratic party went before the country in 1888. Cleveland heard them all, and when they were through he said that he had been thinking the matter over somewhat carefully,?and had reached the conclusion that per haps it would be wiser to nominate another man than Mr. Mills. He ex pressed in the highest terms his ad miration for Mills, for his honesty and sincerity, but he thought that contingencies had arisen which would make the selection of another man for Speaker a matter of higher value for the party than even the choice of Mr. Mills could do. The ex-President said that, some times it was dangerous for a man to have a too strong following. Not only dangerous for himself, but for the party which he represented. He feared that a very stiff line would be drawn separating the friends of Mills from the friends of another candi date who might represent some oppo ! sitiCH , to the extreme tariff views cif 11Ir. Mills. In such an emergency it was always wise to look for a person who cammanded the respect of everv j ?MM,',aniJ 'le Ilac* 9Ut;h ? man in mind. Hurt man he said was Judge Wil son, of West Virginia. Among all the acquaintances whom he made when he was President there was no man in either house of Congress who had won a higher regard from him than Judge Wilson had. He regard as 111 so,ne respects, one of the ablest politicians.whom he had ever met, and also as possessing the highest qualities of statesmanship borne of his intellectual qualities sug gested those of Senator Carlisle Moreover, Judge Wilson, while'in ! entire accord with the tariff views of that section of the parly which Mr. Mills eonspieiously represented, was I also not regarded as an extremist by the other wing of the party. In addition to that, although it was a matter of minor expediency, it could not be said of him that he rep resented the extreme South or the Northern Democracy, but, living in West \ irginia, occupied a sort of neutral or impartial position. The ex-1 resident said that he did not of fer these Views with any purpose of influencing the decision of the Dem ocratic caucus, but simply to suggest to his friends that if any emergency WUson a graDd n'an JlldSe It was apparent to the men who heard the ex-President that his choice for the Speakership was Judge Wil son, but that lie felt that it would !>ci unwise and unfair for him to throw a single straw in the way of Mills' success, provided he could secure enough of the members to nominate him. What these men have done since is, of course, a matter of surmise, but there is an unquestioned feeling here on the part of the politicians who are closest to the ex-President, and who intend to secure his renomi nation, that the deadlock may possi bly bo traced back to the day when Cleveland expressed in such em phatic terms his opinion of Judge Wilson and his qualifications for the Speakership. The Western Settler's Chosen Specific. With every advance of emigration into the far West, a new demand is created for HoStet tcr's Stomach Bitter*.

A Cure fS Almost Miraculous." ** When I was 14 years of age I had a sever? attack of rheumatism, and after I recovered had to go on crutches. A year later, scrofula, In the form of white swellings, appeared on various parts of my body, and for 11 years I was an invalid, being confined to my bed years. In that time ten or eleven sore3 ap peared and broke, causing me great pain and suffering. I feared I never should get well. *' Early in 188G I went to Chicago to visit a sister, but was confined to my bed most of the time I was there. In July I read a book,A Day with a Circus,' in which were statements of cuf es by Hood's Sarsap.irilla. I was so Im pressed with the success of this medicine that I decided to try it. To my great gratification the sores soon decreased, and I began to feel better and in a short time I was up and out of doors. I continued to take Hood's Sar saparilla for about a year, when, having used six bottles, I had become so fully released from the disease that I went to work for the Flint & Walling Mfg. Co., and since then
