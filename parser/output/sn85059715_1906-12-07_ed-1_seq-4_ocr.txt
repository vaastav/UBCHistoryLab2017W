Japanese Invasion. There is to he a Japanese invasion fnto the United States. This declaration at first startles many who have entertained the idea for some, time that Japan was preparing to en- j gage in a war with the United States. But. luckily, though there would not be the long-drawn-out trouble | Russia had with the Japs, that is not j the sort of Invasion announced. ! There is nothing military about it. I Instead, colonies of these energetic. | thrifty, intelligent people are to be | established In the Mississippi valley. ( if news dispatches are correct.. "This { invasion Is proceeding already ai a surprising rate, hut so quietly that it Is scarcely observed, and Is being done without objection or protest by j those who are so situated as to ob- \ serve Its progress and realize its sig- | n I flea nee. At present Bay City. Wis., a small I town on the Mississippi river about ninety miles below St. Paul. Is the I rallying place of the Japanese. There ' a small colony has lioutrhr several j hundred acres of land on a lake | shore, including practically all of the , beach and the point making out in- i to the river, and locally famous as one of the best fishing places on the upper Mississippi. A score of Japanese have been at work for several weeks cleaning this land and the beach, and In the spring a landscape gardener will arrive from Japan and lay out the property in true Japanese style, making of it a beautiful and unusual summer resort. , But the Japanese are not to be . content with an Industry that is profitable only in the summer. They , have bought the Bay City roller mill. ] and are negotiating for other prop- , ertlos |n and near the town, evident- s !y with the purpose of establishing j a manufacturing centre. It is likely that the first buildings put tip will . be a canning factory and a pickling , house. These )vill be some distance' , froDi the resort. f? ? T- ...i.- ... i),.v ntv ; Ur. 1 . rvuuicl. ?

Last September he went to Bay City to deliver an ad- j dress in a lecture course, and re- , muinod several days, ostensibly for no other reason than that he enjoyed , the r *st. But a few weeks later he r, returned, began negotiations for r property, and made several parch as- v es. Then several young Japanese x came and took up their homes in ( houses Dr. Kama had bought. Now there are more than a score of ehar< acteristicallv industrious and reti- ^ cent Japanese in the town. Evident- \ t ly they are well-educated men, of , . good families, and the Americans In | the town have received them cor- 1 dially. Among the newcomers are I several Japanese who had worked as f bellboys in Minneapolis and St. Paul . hotels for many months, learning to f speak English, and some of them ^ studying in the schools or colleges. ^ It is understood that the Bay City colony will number at least 2 00 next , .summer and that Dr. Kunia intends to establish other colonies a favorable points in the upper Mississippi valley when this one is well under way.

One of the very Important matters which President Roosevelt In his annual message to Congress urges the national legislature to give attention 1 to 1s the question of marriage and .< divorce. It. is a question of vital importance to the nation because it relates to the home, the vital spark t of a nation's life. j The President believes that the ^ whole question of marriage und di- j vorce should be relegated to the au- t tliority of the national congress be- ^ cause "the wide difference in the j laws of the different States on the ( subject result in scandals and abuses." "There Is no thing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation." he says, "nothing around 1 which the nation should so bend it- f ;clf to throw every safeguard as the ^ iome life of the average citizen." 1 This is true. When the safe- 1 guards of the home become weaken- ^ <1 permitting the home to dlsinteg- ^ -ate. disaster confronts the nation. 11 r\> 11?*?- :?k tip rh^ home would mean :s h? death of the nation. Willful 1 t**rflity nn ;<ns race suicide and that >espeaks decay and demoralization j or our government. Laxness of the j t nnrriago and divorce laws tends to j \> ?reak up homes and deprive not only i nan and woman of their pleasures i iml privileges afforded l>y i he home p >tzt also blights the lives of the o hildreu by raking away from thoni p he privileges and the advantages e vhich the home gives them and E vhich they should have. The fate w >f government depends upon the ducat ion of the youth. This eduation in the broad sense means ^ 11 oral as well as mental developnent of the young, they who will ^ ottie day take their part In the op.- ^ ration of the government. ^ There should be stricter marriage ^ ml divorce laws. And there should >? a uniformity in those of the var- ^ ous States to prevent the abuses of hem. Federal regulation of the ?rimary principles of these laws vould bring this about and surely 11 Congress should give attention to 1 his all important and vital subject. s< m Is Hartuerized, Vou Know.

We in/er from this that the"'Register had Its eye dressed (clothed), when It read the message, and. if so with what? An ordinary glass or something that j magnifies? And does that paper : mean to say that Its readers had to j dress their eyes to read the message as printed in the Begister? If so, is j not. i he Register very hard on the j eyes? , A grapevine dispatch from Grape- I vine fork of Fourpole to Huntington has it that a man drilling a posthole struck a milky fluid In the nature of oil and that the denizens are burning the stuff in their lamps. The dispatch falls to say whether they are using it in their coffee. The mere fact that it burns does not necessarily classify it as oil. as all know, who have gotten hold of hotel soup sometimes. The Parkersburg Dispatch-News, he puper with a double name at 1 east thinks there is something up in j eference to the postmastership in ts city. Of course, there is somehing and something up, else Gibbens 1 vould hold the job. This, however, i s not meant to be a reflection on jibbens. nor the other fellows either. I If the j>ersonnel of the representaion this State has at the Rivers and iarbors Congress, now in session at .Vashington. is a criterion no State 1 s more capably represented. Among he delegates attending from West Mrginia are Senator S .B. Elkins. G. t l Northcott and ex-Governor W. A. lacCorkle. The representation is " ssuredly a credit to any State in the "nlon. 1 While prosperity is one of the j hings that counts in the increase of jg 'ages that is being granted all over | lie country, there is every reason lo | j elieve that labor and capital begin j r? more keenly appreciate one an- j ^ ther than ever before and that em- ! lovers are recognizing the fact that ^ very man is worthy of his hire. ^ tetter wages usually means better 'ork. i r| Harry Woodynrd will dictate the n ppoint.tnent of a postmaster at Par- c ersburg, notwithstanding the > atement that the Dispatch-News F ays there is something up. We are S i I ling to wager?not beyond our b leans, however?that the name of le next postmaster there will be m i t h. F ^ n A Parkersburg paper imputes to le coming legislature monkey talk. ^ 'hat paper probably knows as it nds out a Rood deal of stuff in that ? inguage during the session of the gisluture, but the secret is it is jlS lostly its own. >|j? - ^ Because of the attack made by a j arkersburg paper on him as to Ills j nowledge and familiarity of his of- ' /j> :*e Internal Revenue Collector j ^ Iasscock would be justified In hav- j jjj ig the office moved to Morgnutown. j jt there are others In Parkersburg. : J ?
