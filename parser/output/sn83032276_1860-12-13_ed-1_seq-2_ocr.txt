are then formally recorded, compliments being paid to Comtnodore? Poor, Porter, and Brent, for prompt action in righting the wrongs of American citizens. The Japanese Embassy, reports as to the marine corps, surgeons, and quartermasters, togeth er with brief statistics of the various ex ploring expeditions, form the main balance of the Secretary's report, which closes with a summary of naval estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, ISG2—total amount, SI 1,513,904 01. Report of the Secretary of War. This report alludes to the recent hostili ties on the part of the frontier Indians in Texa3, New Mexico, and Utah. The Ki owa, Camanehe, Payute, and Snake Indi ans are referred to as the principal depre dators. The Secretary states that while the appropriations were sufficient to sus ta rv the army upon a peace footing alone, the loiter has been subjected to the expen ses of a distant and sanguinary war. The report opines that the Indian Bureau phould be placed under charge of the War Department, since it is impossible to impress the savages into obedience by oth er than military means. The Quartermas ter's Bureau has expended 524.000,000 since the Secretary went into the Depart ment. The inarch from St. Louis to the Oregon river is detailed at length. Its ob ject was to demonstrate the fact that a line of communication could be made available for removing large military forces from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The Secretary al ludes to a special report of a board of ord nance and artillery officers. They recom mend that our cannon be rifte-grooved, and adapted to the use of James' elongated ex panding projectiles. The Secretary asks lor an appropriation of 850,000 for the ex periments for the improvement of arms, lie also suggests the necessity for a nation al armory for the fabrication of cannon. During the year a large quantity of con demned muskets have been sold from the different arsenals to make room for more modern arms. The Secretary holds it to be an inhuman economy which sends a soldier into the field without furnishing him with the best weapon that can be made. He be lieves that the breech-loading gun will shortly drive out of use those that load at j the muzzle. The explorations undertaken \ by the Department of War across the Great Basin and the Rocky Mountains are referred to. The Massachusetts, a ship with auxiliary steam power, has been used ! upon Tuget's Souud and the adjaceut wa ters, to resist the incursions of Indians from the British and Russian provinces. ; The latter come down in canoes, which will carry one hundred warriors, and move with great speed. They give no warning of their approach, and defy pursuit with ordinary means. The Secretary proposes to se'.i the Massachusetts, and substitute a : light sea steamer of considerable speed. Fort Wise is adverted to. This post lias * been erected by Major Sedgwick, among the Camanches and Kiowas, to protect the emigrants to Pike's Peak. THE GAZETTE. LEWISTOWN, PA.

President's Message. We furnished this document to our read ers last week in an extra, in advance of city and all other papers. It needs but little comment. While we find little ob jectionable in its concluding portions, and cordially agree with it in its tariff views, the weak and imbecile reasoning in the first part relative to the right of States se- j ceding from the Confederacy, leaves but little hope for the preservation of the Un ion. His retention too of notorious trait ors in his Cabinet who have used their pla ces and power to embarrass the govern ment financially, and furnish an unusual number ot arms to bout-hern armories, so that the disunion tories there may seize them whenever needed—his failure to strengthen the garrisons in fortresses in threatened sections—all point to the inevi table conclusion that James Buchanan's want of foresight or energy to do his du ty fearlessly and impartially, rather strengthens than restrains the disunionists. His only ambition now seems to be to per suade the tories to await the close of his administration bef ore resorting to open and avowed treason. Old Hickory made no pronations br traitors or their treason in his day, under precisely similar circum stances, and ae soon would have harbored a nest of venomous serpents in the depart ments as mauy of the men now holding of fice. B@lsrael Stewart, a sort of hermit in Centre county, fell from a wagop while haul ing corn fodder on the farm of Samuel Mc . A'illiams, sen., and broke his n a ck by the fall. Evils of Disunion. Although our Southern neighbors have j had, for years, the sad spectacle before their eyes of brother fighting against broth er and friend against friend, in Mexico and South America, a few mad leaders are urg : ing the masses on the very verge of the 1 abyss which disruptured MexicCkand the ! South American Republics. At present ! the Union is strong and respected by all ; foreign nations, for although wc could nei ' ther eope with France or England in na val warfare, nor for a time with the first nam ed on land, yet the greatest of European nations know that if uny part of the Uni ted States, as now constituted, was invaded, millions of men, if needed, would rise in arms to repel the foe. In this lies our se curity, and especially the security of the I South. But let a Southern Confederacy j rear its head, and whether embracing five ! or fifteen States, the moment the deed of ; disunion is consummated, Spain (probably backed by Napoleon) will make prepara tions to re conquer Mexico, and if success ful follow up that with an effort to recover p)ssessio of Central America as well as the South American Republics. ><o read : er of history can fail to have marked the ! desire cf Spain again to obtain possession ' of those countries, and, unless we much ! efr in our judgement, nothing hut the con viction that such an act would result in a war with the Lnited States, (under what is called the Monroe doctrine,) has hither to deterred her from making the attempt. Disunited from the bonds which heretofore bound the North to the South, the Monroe doctrine would no longer he regarded in the North as a cause for war. The alter native would then be presented to the u Southern Confederacy" of engaging in war with Spain, or they would have to set down quietly and see a nation of strangers —one too that is fast recovering power — acquire possessions in dangerous proximity to the southern border, and ready, perhaps willing, to seize Texas on the first signs of j a further disruption. Are Southerners re- ' ally so blind as not to see this plain page j of history ? Another curious commentary on the dis- j union feature of the South is that while j they arc taking measures which the past j has without exception stamped as a step towards ruin and desolation, a population far inferior to ours, under the lead of Gar- j ibaldi, thus far the Washington and Boli- ' var of Europe, has effected a union of the j greater part of Italy, and consolidated that j heretofore divided country under one gov- j ernment. That ambitious men in the South, un der pretext of ideal wrongs, are mislead ing the people for ulterior purposes we have never doubted. These men know full well that no man holding their views can here after be elected President of this country, nor can they expect to monopolize the prin cipal offices as they have done since the formation of the government. In a South ern Confederacy they not only expect to continue in doing so, but we have never doubted they expect to do more, i. e. they have in view a Dictatorship or Limited Monarchy, with Titles of Nobility and Hereditary Estates. A portion of this is already foreshadowed in the proceedings of the South Carolina Legislature, to which we invito the attention of our readers, as detailed by a correspondent of the Balti more American, one of the most reliable papers in the country : 

COLOMBIA, S. C., Dec. 5, 1800. Yesterday the debate in the House of Rep resentatives was unusually warm. The par- I ties arrayed against each other in the matter of organizing an army, and the manner of appointing the commanding officers, used scathing language and debate ran high throughout the session. So far as lam able to judge, both the opposing parties are led on by bitter prejudices. The Joint Military Committee, with two or three exceptions, have pertinaciously clung to the idea that a stand ing army of paid volunteers, to be raised at once, to have the power of choosing their of hceis, up to captain, and to require all above to be appointed by the Governor, is the or ganization for the times. Mr. Cunningham, of the House, who is put forward by the Committee to take all the responsibility of extreme sentiments, has openly avowed his hatred of democracy in the camp. He con siders the common soldier as incapable of an elective choice, lie and others of his party wage a bitter war against democracy, and in uicate an utter want of faith in the ability of the people to make proper choice in elections. The party opposed to this, the predomi nant party, is ostensibly led in the House by Mr. MoGowan, of Abbeville, and Mr. Moore, of Anderson. These gentlemen have a hard fight of it. They represent the democratic sentiments OT the rural districts, and are in opposition to the Charleston clique, who are urged on by Edward Rhett, Thomas Y. Sim mons, and B. 11. Rhett, Jr.. of the Charles ton Mercury. The tendencies of these gentle men are all towards a Dictatorship or won arehial form of government, at least it ap pears so to my miud, and I find myself not alo*e in the opinion. They fight heart and soul for an increase of gubernatorial power, and one of their number, as I have already stated, openly avowed his desire to make the Governor a military chieltain with sovereign power. See the working of their views. They will enrol! a body of 10 000 men for an ostensible : purpose. That purpose is alleged to be the protection of their homes, wLes, altars, fire sides, and other patriotic intentions. They place the supreme military power into the hands of the Executive ; he appoints whom he plepses, and oertainlv he will choose none but those of his way of thinking. The offi cers will impart sentiments to the men, the country will be under the rule of the army, and one man at the head—and what next can easily be imagined. The power of the Rhett party has already been felt. Thus far it has been in the ascasdancy—and it haagrown so powerful thai thpre ar# strong fears that Ed mund Rhett, of the Senate, will be elected the next Governor. If this is the case, the thing will be all on one side, and the worst is to be feared. The election of Governor, you know, is by the Legislature. All the domi nant power has to do therefore is to pitch up on a man, and he is elected. Certainly they will not choose a person who does not reflect their sentiments,. Proceedings of Congress. On the reading of the President's Message in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Clingman led off the debate in a violent speech. lie pre dicted dissolution within sixty days, and said the wisest thing Congress could do would be to divide the public property as fairly as ; sible. Mr. Crittenden, with some words of calmness and moderation, rebuked the vio lence of the North Carolina Senator and dep recated angry debate. He held the Union to be worthy of great sacrifices and concessions, and must search for the means of conciliation. Mr. Clingman responded, approving of the desire to preserve the Union, but avowing a belief that he would be sustained in what he, said by a majority of the people of North Carolina. The usual motion to print the Message was then adopted and the Senate ad journed. In the House after the reading of the Mes sage, Mr. Sherman, Republican, moved to re fer it to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union. Mr. Boteler, of \ irgin ia, offered an amendment referring so much of the Message as related to the present per ilous condition of the country to a special committer of one from each State. Utber propositions and amendments were offered, but finally the house voted on Mr. Boteler's amendment. A number of Southern mem bers declined voting on the ground that their States had called Conventions to act upon the questions involved. Mr. Boteler's amend ment was adopted—yeas 145, nays 38. Mr. Morr s, of Illiuois, attempted to introduce a resolution declaring an unalterable attach ment to the Union and declaring that the election of Mr. Lincoln did not justify its dissolution, hut objectio . was made to its in troduction, and a motion to adjourn prevail ed. Mr. Ilale, of New Hampshire, opened the debate in the Senate on Wednesday, with a motion to reconsider the vote to print the President's Message. He thought the contest between the States must be settled at the bal lot box or by war, and whilst hoping for a peaceable settlement, urged that the danger should be looked straight in the face. [These remarks of Mr. Hale were certainly not much out of place, especially after Clingman's vio lent speech the day before, yet we find the whole locofoco press charging Mr. Hale with having introduced the slavery or disunion question.] Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, follow ed in a violent secession speech, avowiug that the withdrawing States disclaimed (ill further allegiance, and they intended to go out of thq Union before the fourth of March, "peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must." Mr Davis, of Mississippi, said that as long as the States were in alliance threats were of no avail. Mr. Wigfall, of Texas, favored secession and at tacked the President's Message. He gave notice of an inquiry to ascertain whether any order had gone front the War Department in relation to holding possession of the United States f rts in South Carolina. It was ne cessary, he said, to know what the President intends doing in order to understand the Mes sage. Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, uttered some Union sentiments that were warmly ap plauded by the galleries. Delaware, he said, was the first to adopt the Federal Constitu tion and would be the last to do any act countenancing a separation of the States.— The debate then terminated. Mr. Green, of Missouri, gave notice of a resolution inquiring into the propriety of providing for the establishment of an armed border police to prevent the invasion of States and to aid in the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. The Ilouse had a quiet and dull session.— The Homestead bill was called up by Mr. Grow, of Pennsylvania, and passed—ayes 132, navs 70. The bill requires a payment of ten dollars from actual settlers for oue hun dred and sixty acres of land. In Committee of the Whole the Pension and Military Acad emy bills were agreed to, the various portions of the President's Message referred to the ap propriate Standing Committees, and the House adjourned. There was nothing of importance done in the Senate on Thursday. A memorial from California, asking for the establishment of a daily overland mail, was presented by Mr. Latham. Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, offered a resolution referring that part of the Presi dent's message treating on the secession ques to a special committee of thirteen, with in structions to enquire " whether any addition al legislation than already within the sphere of the Federal authority aud duty to be ne cessary for the protection and security of the property of the United States, and if so to report the bill; and that said committee be al so instrueed to consider the report whether it is deemed expedient to propose an amend ment or amendments to the Constitution of the United States, so as to ensure prompt and full protection of the right and property of the citizens of every State and Territory, jvnd ' insure the equality of the States aud equal rights of their citizens under the Federal j Constitution." The consideration of the res olution was postponed, and the Senate ad journed till Monday. In the House of Representatives, Mr. Mor ris, of Illinois, gave notice ho would intro duce, on Monday, his resolution on the Union. A bill abolishing the franking privilege was reported. A bill to construe the meaning of the words "minimum of the price of public lands" was passed. It provides that the word 1 minimum shall be construed according to I the land-graduation act, so as to apply to alter nate and reserved sections of lands granted for railroads and other internal improvements aud in favor of actual settlers, aud not to mean $1 25 per acre, as now officially con strued. The Speaker announced the special committee on the Secession question, which consists of the following members: Mr. Corwin of Ohio, Chairman. Virginia —Mr. Wilson. Massachusetts—Mr. Adams. North Carolina —Mr. Winslow. New York—Mr. Humphrey. South Carolina—Mr. iJojce. Pennsylvania —Mr. Campbell, i Georgia—Mr. Love. Connecticut —Mr. Ferry. I -Maryland—Mr. Davis.

Maine—Mr. Morse, i Missouri—Mr. Phelps, j Arkansas—Mr. Rust. Michigan—Mr. Howard. Texas—Mr. Hamilton. : lowa—Mr. Curtis. Oregon—Mr. Stout. Mr. Hawkins, of Fiorkkv asked to be ex cused from serving, alleging secession sym : pathies as the reason for his course. A mo. j tion to excuse him led to an angry debate, amid which the House adjourned without act ing upon it. The Senate and House of Representatives met again on Monday. In the Senate the j standing committees of the last session were continued. A memorial from Thaddeus Ily ! att, praying for relief for the Kansas suffer | ers, was presented by Senator Sumner, and i referred to the Committee on Territories.— | The Homestead Bill, as it came from the House, was taken up and passed on tirst read | ing. In the House the question of excusing | Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, from the Union j Committee, vyas again taken up. Mr. Sher ; man, having obtained the consent of the j House, reported a bill the relief of the Treasury. It authorizes the President to is sue treasury notes, for such sums as the ex igeneies of the public expenses require, not exceeding ten millions. Several amendments wero offered but defeated, and the bill as re i ported passed. The Full Electoral Vote. We present herewith a tabular statement of the result at the electoral colleges:
