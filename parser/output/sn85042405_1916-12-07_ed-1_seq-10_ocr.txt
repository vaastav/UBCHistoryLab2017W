MINNESOTA WILL GRANT SUFFRAGE Confident Expectation of Delegates at Minneapolis. Minneapolis, Minn., Dec., 4. A new day, a day of equal suffrage, is dawning in Minnesota, speakers de clared at the 35th annual convention of the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association, which opened here to day. "The fight,"' asserted Mrs. Andrea Heland, president of the association, "has been a most trying one, but we at last see our way clearly." Speaker after speaker declared that Minnesota soon would take its place among that steadily growing group of states which have extended equal suffrage to women. Flans for a campaign in behalf of the presidential suffrage bill to be introduced at the coming session of the Minnesota legislature, were dis cussed at length. The convention also went over plans for raising ?30, 000 pledged by Minnesota at the na tional convention at Atlantic City for state and national work. A na tional fund of $1,000,000 is to be raised. "Every suffragist in the country," said Mrs. Ueland, in discussing the proposed fund, "should feel it her duty to extend every effort in behalf of this great united drive by which we hope to reach the goal of en franchising all the women of the Tnited States. This goal should be reached within a few years. "We heartily agree," the speaker continued, "with that public senti ment which recently resulted in a special session of the Minnesota Ieg isature for the enactment of a law permitting soldiers on the Mexican border to vote. The great value of the ballot is realized, and we con tend that a government which guards so carefully the rights and privileges of its citizens on the border should be equally solicitous to do justice td its women. "Minnesota's suffragists must make haste to join in the united effort to throw from the women of the coun try for all time the yoke of indignity and injustice which places them, in regard to the franchise, with the group who are morally unfit, or men tally defective or undeveloped." Out of town delegates were guests this morning at a breakfast given by local suffrage workers. Tonight Mrs. Nellie McClung of Kdmonton, Canada, will address a mass meeting on "In Times Like These."

Declares That Their Opera tion Should Not Be Stopped or Interrupted by the Con certed Action of Organized Bodies of Men Until a Pub lic Investigation Shall Have Been Instituted. INevertaken one of the shortest messages sent to congress President Wilson urges that early action be to complete his pro gram of "settlement and regulation" recommended at the last session. The message in full is as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the constitution of communicating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your con sideration such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedi ent I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine my self to those matters of more general public policy with which it seems nec essary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible. But there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once. The Railroad Problem. In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settlement and regulation which I had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in vtew of the public dan gers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed and which still unhappily continue to ex ist between the railroads of the coun try and their locomotive engineers, conductors and trainmen. I then recommended: First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the linos embodied in the bill recently passed b.v the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various du ties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroughness which are. with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway employees who are ac tually engaged in the work of operat ing trains in interstate transportation. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight hour day in railway transpor tation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. Control by the Executive. And, sixth, the lodgment in the bands of the executive of the power. In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority tb draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted OD: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a commis sion to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed, but It postponed action upon, the other sug gestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consider ation of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem it necessary to' renew. The pow- THE 

WEEKLY A) CRT OPERATION OF RAILWAYS SHALL NOT BE STOPPED To pa«* a law which forbade or prevented the individual work man to leave his work beforo re ceiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jurispru dence which I take it for grant' ed we are not prepared to intro duce. But the proposal that the operation of the railway* of the country shall not be stopped or •interrupted by the concerted ac tion of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at is sue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted ac tion of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial procssses of the na tion. er of the interstate commerce commis sion to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear, and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission's authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the increase in the interstate commerce commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—I now very earnestly renew. New Legislation Necessary. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action. Not only does the interstate com­| merce commission now find it practical ly Impossible, with its present member ship und organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thorough ly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbi tration and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the efficiency of the interstate commerce commission, the house of representatives has al ready acted. Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. To Safeguard Industrial Processes. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or pre vented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our Juris prudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the Concert ed action of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the Industrial pro cesses of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportu nity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider all practi cable means of conciliation or arbitra tion. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous re gard for the interests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the per manent interests of society itself. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives—the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro- 0- V Urges the Passage of the Corrupt Practices Act Reg ulating the Expenditure of Money In Elections and Fa vors More Freedom of Com bination to Those Engaged In Foreign Commerce. moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal' under the terms of the laws against monopoly, the bill amend ing the present organic law of Porto Rico and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, commonly called the corrupt practices act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest cir cumstances which render their adop tion at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay 'would se riously jeopard the interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, because at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. And a delay would have the further serious disadvantage of postponing action un til another election was at hand and some special object connected with It might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. Enlarging Our Export Trade. I shall not argue at length the de I slrability of giving a freer hand in the I matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, o a 

REGULATE EXPENDITURE OF ELECTION MONEY Immediate passage of the bili to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the imme diate enactment of the other measures to which I refer, be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which federal offices are to be filled, but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spend ing campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience. has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessa^ instrumen talities for its prosecution. It is deem ed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale un der our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesi tate or delay. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto Itico Is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of Its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions I 'oncerning them which the adoption if the pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. Legislative Annals Enrichsd. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which It is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis 'action I have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive policy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such "ompany. I take the liberty of con-, gratulating you upon the completion -t a record of rare ger vices bleness and listinction. r-: A

NO INAUGURAL BALL AT BISMARCK Governor-elect Frazier stated yes terday at Fargo' that there would be no inaugural ball at Bismarck this winter for the reason that it is de sirable the members of the legisla ture and state officials get down to business without loss of time or un necessary display. The Governor is quoted as saying: "This is to be first of all a peo ple's administration. It is to be an administration in the interest of all the people, not for any class or spec ial interest, and such an administra tion does not need a 'send-off' at an inaugural ball. "This administration just wants to get right down to business with out any flourishes, if I understand aright the sentiment of the newly elected legislators and state officers. We don't want the legisature to sit a day longer than necessary to do its legitimate business, and an inaugu ral ball would be a distracting influ ence not in accord with the spirit of the new regime." Speaks at Equity Convention. The governor is to speak at the Equity convention in St. Paul and at the livestock show in Chicago and left for those cities for that purpose. ^ASTORIA For Infants and Children In Use cr Over 30 Years Always bean the Signature of There is no more fitting or appropriate gift than Money.
