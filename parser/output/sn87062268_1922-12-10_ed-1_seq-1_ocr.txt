They must be told that a war of revenge will find the same Allies side by side inflicting punishment on the peace breakers." "There are men in France who counsel annexation of territory populated by another race. They must be warned that such a step will alienate the sympathies of Britain and America and that when the inevitable war of liberation comes the sympathies of America and Britain will be openly ranged on the side of those who are fighting for national freedom." "The time has come for saying these things and if they are not said in high places, humanity will one day call those who occupy high places to a reckoning." "Clemenceau ought to have made his complaint in Paris against men of his own race and not in New York against Englishmen." "Trie pact (guarantee to France backed by England) lies for the moment in the waste paper basket. But we never Hung it there." "At Genoa there was a passionate sincerity of desire for peace but the European nations could not help seeing that one of the great powers was working for a failure." "Alas, Satan is not through with Europe." "The offer of a pact guaranteeing France against German aggression was definitely renewed at Cannes and M. Pcincare lias not r"?cepted it. I have my own opinion to whv he has not done so. It France accepts urit- as s prouorea answer that t t ) thoe !'-it 1)1 who nk of ain's guarantee of defense of her frontier every excuse for annexing the left bank of the Rhine disappears.. If the French ministers have made up their mimfe that they will not withdraw from the Rhine, then a new chanter opens ir the history of Europe and the world, with a climax of horror such as mankind has never vet witnessed." Is it too much to ask that America should in time fake an effective interest in the development along the Rhine? To that extent I am in complete accord with M. Clemenceau. It is a far cry from the Rhine to the Mississippi ! : t not so far as it used to be. There are now graves not far from the Rhine wherein lies the dust of men who less than six years ago came from the banhs of the Mississippi." ffA MR VMWW . -X '' '''4, V, & TOM A SK TROOPS RYA GEN1 HELD SCOVERBOBW; Y ST1LLERS II W 1100 I in R ht s oua ussell Case Prohibition Officer Killed by Moonshines'.

Amer- ' inevitable war in day The pact, giving guarantees tc France against possibility of German agression, was designed to strength en the hand of M. Clemenceau against the aggressive party which was then and still is anxious to commit France to tho colossal error of annexing ter ritory whicii has always been purely German. M. Clemenceau knows full well that Britain has been ready at any time during the last three years, up to a few months ago, to take upon herself the burden of that pact, with or without the United States of America. ' At Cannes, early this year, 1 made a definite proposal to that ef fect. It was a written offer made by me on behalf of the British govern ment to M. Briand. who was then prime minister of France. I war anxious to secure the cooperation of France in a general endeavor to clear up the Kuropean situation and estab lish real peace from the Urals to the Atlantic seaboard. French suspicions and French apprehensions constituted a rious difficulty in the way of set tlement and 1 thought that if it were rr ule clear to FTance that the whole strength of the British empire could he depended upon to come to her aid, t, event cf threatened invasion to discuss the outstanding ques ould be in a better i- i enc ii "I'll"" thins which agitate Europe. international good will is essentia to reestablishment of the shattered machinery of international commerce. .. eonntrv ItKe r ranee. iu which the issue of the war had given .. position on the continent ;r Furore in a condition of fretful- ness it was impossible to settle Kit itoni-p the offer which was made by the British government. M. Briand was prepared to welcome this offer and to proceed to a calm con sideration of the perplexities of the Fm-oneaii situation. It was agreed tc si innion a conference at Genoa tc discuss the condition of European exchange, credit and trade. It was also resolved that an effort should be made to establish peace with Kussia and to bring that great country once more inside the community of nations. A great start was made on the path of genuine appeasement. The Ger man government was invited to send its chief minister to the Cannes con ference in order to arrive at a work able settlement of the vexing question of reparations. The invitation re ceived prompt response and Pr. Kathenau, accompanied by two oi three leading ministers and a retinue of financial experts, reached Cannes in time to take part in the discussion'. The negotions were proceeding help fully ami another week might have produced results which would have pacified the tumult of suspicious na tions and inaugurated the promise of fraternity. But. alas, Satan is not done with Europe. A ministerial crisis- in France brought our hopes tumbling: to tlu ground. The confidence, was broken up on the threshold ot fulfillment I vi declined to enter into. Europe has suffered too much from military conventions to warrant repetition ol such a disastrous experiment. The pact with Britain lies for the moment in the wastepaper basket. But we never flung it there. M. Clemenceau ought to have made his complaint in Paris against men of his own race and not in New York against Englishmen. With the pact went the effort to make peace in Eu rope. The history of Genoa is too recent to require any recapitulation of its features. The new French ministry did not play the part of an inviting government responsible fos pressing to a successful end the ob jects of the Cannes conference, but rather that of the captious critic, who had to be persuatled along- every inch of the road and who threatened at every obstacle to turn back and leave the rest of Europe to struggle along with its burden amid the mocking laughter of France. I am aot complaining of M. Bar thou. He did his best under most hu miliating conditions to remain loyal to the conference which his govern ment had scoffed in the .summoning. But his task was an impossible one. He was hampered, embarrassed and tangled at every turn. Whenever he took any step forward, he was lassoed by a dispatch from Paris. I am cred ibly informed that he received SOD of these communications in the course of the conference! What could the poor man do under such bewildering conditions? Th I other European countries were per- ; plexed and distracted. They were anx- , ious that Genoa should end in a state j of peace. There was no doubt about sincerity the passionate sincerity of a desire for peace throughout Europe, but the European nations could not help seeing that one of the great powers was working for a failure. They had a natural anxiety not tc appear to take sides. It is a marvel that in spite of this unfortunate at titude adopted by the French gov ernment that a pact was signed which has, at any rate, peace in eastern Europe months. Before the conference wt had heard of armies being strength ened along frontiers and movements of troops with a menacing intent from the Baltic to the Black sea Genoa, at least, dispelled that cloud. But a permanent peace has not yet been established and the pact with Russia will soon expire. 1 am, how ever, hopfnl that the spirit of Genoa w-ill stand between the contending armies and prevent the clash of swords. All this, however, s leading: away from an examination oT M. Clemenceau's suggestion that Britain did not keep faith in the matter of guaranteeing France against German Chairman Colt of Senate immigration commission said it was unlikelv Gen eral Immigration legislation recommended by President-Harding in Friday's' message would be attempted at present session 

MILTON ELEVEN HAS GOOD YEAR Wildcats Won Five Games, Lost One and Tied One Goal Line Crossed by Only One Team. (By JOHN M. SHEPHERD) MILTON, Dec. 9. An inspection of the record ef the -Milton High School football team will prove that it had a very successful season. The team played its season with a three-man nucleus and a bunch of inexperienced material. Ten games were scheduled but only seven w-ere played, three being can celled at the last moment. In the seven games Milton was victorious five. times, tied one game and lost one. The Wildcats' goal line was crossed but once and that by an Ala- scoreu Lonely, Wives Since have ; bama team.

The German provinces of the let' bank of the Rhine are intensely Ger man in race, language, tradition and sympathies. There are 70.000.000 o! Germans in Europe. A generation hence, there may be 100.000.000.

Is it too much to ask that America should in time take an effective interest in the de velopment along the Rhine? To that extent, I am in complete accord with M. Clemenceau. Xeither Britain nor America can afford to ignore the maneouvres going on along its banks It is a far cry from the Rhinje to the Mississippi, but not so far as it used to be.
