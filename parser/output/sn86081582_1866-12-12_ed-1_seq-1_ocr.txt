IiliSTOIiATION 01' THE SOrTHHliN STATICS, III my message of the -1th ot Decem ber, 18115, Congress was informed ot tho measures whiuli had been instituted by the Kxeuiive with a view to tin.' gradual restoration of the States in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the General Government. Provi sional Governors hud been appointed, Conventions called, Goeiiiois elected, j Legislatures assembled, "nnd Senators 'and ltepiis in nines chosen to tho t on I gnu of ihe Unite. I Stales. Courts had I been opened tor the enforcement f laws long in abeyance. The block ido had been removed, custom houses re. estab lish d, mid the ntei nal revenue, laws put. ii. force, in order ilia1 tho peoplo i .. .;..i. . , i...... ... .1 i : ini.ii u.iiLiiuuiu iw iiic nairoiai incoilie, 1'ostnl operations had been renewed, -md efforts were b dug maili' to restore ihem to iheir former cc million of eflioiuiuiy The States thein.-elves h d been asked to take part in I e high function ol amending the coi.stitution, and of thus sanctioning the extinction of Alriean slavery as one of the legkimalo rcsuliu ol our lnteniecino struggle Having progressed thus far, tlio Ex ccutivo Department found that it hud accomplished nu:uly a'l that was within lliOHUopu of its iRmst national authoiity. One thing, however, yet remained lo bo done betol'H the work ot recotisti notion could be completed, and that was the admission to Congress of loyal Senators and Itepreseniatives Iroiu ihe Stat' h whoso people had rebelled apamst the lawful authority of tho General Govern ment. This question devolved upon the respective Houses, which, by the -Constitution, are mado tho judges ot the election, returns, and qualitioatioi'.s ot their own menibors; and its considera tion ot once engaged the attention ot Congress. lu the meantime, the Executive. De partment no other plan having been proposed bv Congress continued il effort!) to perfect, as tar as was practi. cable, the restoration of the proper re lations : etween tho citizens ot llio re spective States, the Slates, and the Fed end Government, extending frc.-m time to time, ns the public, interests seems to require the judicial, revenue, ard postal system ot the country. With the ad vice and consent of the Senate, tho ne cessary officers were appointed, nnd ap propriations Hindu by Congress for the pay.ientof their salaries. The propo. sition to.umend the Federal Constitution, so us to prevent the existence ot slavery within tho United Males or any pl.ieo subject to their jurisdiction, was ralilied by the requisite number ot state1 ; and on the lbth day of December, 1BG.", it was officially declare.! to have become did as a part of llio Constitution ot the United States All ot tho Stales in which tho insurrection had existed promptly amended their Constitut oni s as to make Ihi m conform to the great change- thus atl'ected m tho organic law of the land ; declared null and void all ordinances and laws id' secession ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolu tionary purpo-ics ot tho insurrection i and proceeded, in good faith, to the en actment ot measures tortho protection and amelioration ot the condition ot the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesit. led to admit any of these States to representation i and U was not unlil to- wards mo eiosc oi mu eigmii inouiii oi , ., i -i.i... .; i. . i i. z tho session that an exception was made in favor ot Tennessee, by tlie ndmission of bur Senators and Representatives. ""'" " ! " I deem it a subject of.profound regret that Congress , has thus tar failed to ad - mil to seats loyal Senators an. I Kepro- sentalive from the other states whoso inhabitants . toiruther, wiih those nt Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion. Ten Stales, mote than one fourth ot the eulire number, remain without represent . and the permanency ot our torm of Uuv. tntion. ' The seats of 5U members ot tho eminent, my conviction heretutor. ex IIouso ad '20 of the Senate are yet va j pressed buye undergone no change, but WAYNESMJltGr. umrnsracoQasia cant not by, their own consent, not by a tailure ot election, but by retosai ot Coiiaress to accept their credentials. l'lietr adimsKioii, it is believed, would havo accomplished much toward llio rencA'til and strengthening of oty rela tions as one people, and removed serious cause for discontent ou tho part ot the people of '.hose states. It would havo accorded with the great principle enun ciated: in tho (leehiriilion id' American Independence, that no people ought to bear tho burden of taxation and yet be denied the right of representation. ItVouId hivo been in consonance with the express provisions of llio Constitu tion that each Stuto shall l ave nt least one representative, and that no Statu without its consent shall bo deprived id' equal eutlVago in tho Semite These provisions were intended to secure to ever)' Stale t,:o right of representation in Congress, and so important was it deemed by the t'rninoM ot the constitu tion that the equality of tho States shall bo preserved in the Semite; that not even by an amendment of the constitution can any State without its consent be denied avoiioinlhat branch ot the National legl-latttre. It has been assumed Unit these Slates, by rebellion, became ter ritories; but till departments of the Gov ernment, wi ll great distinctness, refus ed to sancli' ti an a-'sninpliou so incom patible tvitli tho nature of our Kepub lieau system ai.d tho professed objects ef the war '1 hroughoiit tho recent legislation of Congress, thu undeniable fact makes itself apparent that these ten political communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At tho very commencement of iho rebellion, each house declared with tin unanimity ns re markable as it was sigmlicant, that the svar was not 'waged, up,.ii o r part, in any tqiiril of oppression, nor for any purpose ot conquest or subjugation, nor purposu of o,ei throwing or interfering with tlie rights or established institutions ot those S nes, but to ileKnid aud main tain thu supremacy of the Con-tii lilion and all laws made in i-ui'suaiice thereof, and to preserve thu Union with nil thu dignity, equality, and rights of the soy oral Mates unimpaired ; and Hint as soon as the-e objects were arcomplisl.e 1 tho war ought to ceasu." In some in stances, Senators were permitted to con tinue their legislative function, while in ,tlu-i' i i.Miiiiu.c-a Ki-,i L-Hi'jilul u ch wero elected and admitlcd lo souls iifu.-i- their States had t rinally declared their rights lo withdraw ti'Mii the Union, and were endeavoring to maintain that right by force ot arms. All ot iho Sta'cs whose people iv i re in insurrection, ns Stales, were included in the apportionment ot the direct lax of twenty millions ut dol lars annually laid upon tho United Stales by ' hu Act approved oth August. 18GI Congress, by the Act of March 5. 18ii2, and by the ai poinlinent ot repiescnta- ilon thereunder, also recognized their presence as States in the Union ; and they have,, for judicial purposes, been di vi led into distifcts, ns States alone can bo divided. Thu sa.ne recognition ap pears in tho recent legislation in refer, once to Tennessee, which evidently rests upon the lact that thu functions ot thu Statis were not destroyed by the rebel lion, but mere y suspended ; and that principle is of course applicable to Chose State which, like Tennessee, attempted to renounce'their place in the Union. Tho action ot the Executive depart ment of the Government upon this sub ject has been equally definite and uniform ami the purpose of tho war was ppeci lieally stated in the I'roclaniali in issued by my predecessor ou tho 22d day of September, 1 8ti-2 It v. ns then Kohuni ly proclaimed and declared that "here-utter,- ns heretofore, tho war will be pro-ecuted tor the o'ject of practica'ly res'.oiing the constitutional relations be tween the United Slates and each o! the States aud the people thereof, in which Slates that relation is or may bo sus pended or disturbed." Thi! recognition ot tho Stales by the Judicial Department of the Governiicnt has also been clear and conclusive in all proceedings iiflecling them ns Status, had in thu S promo, Circuit and District Courts.

IU.TV OF Till-: KXICCUTIVU, Tho Constitution makes it tho duly ot the 1'iesideiil lo recommend to llio consideration id' Congress such meas ures as ho shall dot in expedient. I know (d no measure, more imperatively demanded by every consideration ot national interest, sound policy aud eipial justice, than the admission ol loyal menibors from thu unrepresented Stales. This would eonsutnuio the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary m llilence in life reestab ishment of peilco. lii!tT..ony and fraternal feeling It woi.l.l lend greatly to renew tho confidence of the American pe -pi in the vigor anil stability, ot their institutions, h would bind us more closi ly together as a na lion, and enable us to show to tho world the inherent nrd recuperative power of a Government lounded upon the will of the people, and established upon the prim iplus of liberty, justice and intelli-. gtnee. Oar iuciea-ed strei.gth and en hanced p'rosp illy would irrcfnigibly demonstrate the fallacy ol ihe iitguinents against free institutions drawn from our recent national disotders by Ihe enemies of republican goveinnunl. The ad mission of loyal members from the St tea now excluded from Congress, by a'lay lttg deiibi and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into thu channel ot trade and industry. It would alleviate the pteseiit troubled condition of those States, and, by inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of t.-rlilu regions now uno'dlivntcd and lead lo an increased production of those staples w hich have added so greatly to llio wealth of the nV.ton and the' c inmeieo ot thu world New fields of enterprise would be opened to cur progressive people, and s"on the1 devastations i f w::r would be repaired, and all traces ef ourdnmest o diflerences elt'aci'd bom llio nilmla of our country men .
