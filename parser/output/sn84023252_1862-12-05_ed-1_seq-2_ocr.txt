It .vill be noticed that all our subscribers who pay down for their paper (and they are inany now "may their tribe increase") get it at the old rates, the same as they did when paper cost only half what it now does ; and that the advance is solely upon those who prefer to wait until the year is partly or wholly past. j It will be for the interest of all to take ad-1 tae of the advance terms, and it will also hc' " they do not howl about " nigger on the !

The Difference. Senator Douglass was an able man, a true I democrat and a patriot. He was ready to lay j a.side all party feeling and fight manfully for the Union. Oen. O. B. Wilcox was a leading man in Michigan, a strong democrat and a worker for the party. He says : " We should think ofnothing but crushing the rebellion, and i whatever m&y have been the eauses that led to this war, we ought all to stop twitting and go to fighting. The man who stays at home ( cursing the government and the abolitionists, i O O vou may depend upon as being either a cow- . . . . ard who wishes to shield himself from going ( to the war by howling out against the way it , . , rAn,iIIflf,i. nr pIsp 1.p has in his heart ! the VPnom of atraitor. (ien. Dix is a democrat, and he wiites to , the committee of New York, that this is no I time t0 get up party feelings. Qen Hookcr is a democrat, but he chooses I to fcupport thf government rather than stay i at home denounchg it. Gen. Burnside is a democrat, yet he would blush to hear men denounce the government. Gen. Halleck is a dt-mocrat, and yet he iinds his opinions th& same as the president's Stcretary Stanton is a democrat, and yet j he has nothmsr to sav atramst the nresulent s i pohcv ot emancipation. Gen. McClellan is a democrat, and yet he Kustains the governmeot, and though scme of his too zealous friends think he ought to de nounce the government and stir up sedition, he thinks himself Lound to be as loyal a citi zen and as faithful a soldier as ewr. It is evident that those fellows who abuse every thing but the rebels are no more democrats than are the fungi which grow on the oldest oak a part of the solid wood. Some would have us believe that Ihere is little difference between a democrat and a traitor. This is false. The difference is as wide and as distinct as that which divides vice from virtue, light from darkness, truth from falsehood. The democratic element in cur country is true. The genuine democrats in the army do not say, as their pseudo dem ocrats would have us believe, " I will resign ;f j cannot iave this or that General if the President tries to carry out this or that pol- i caused the war.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The late hour at which the Message was received, and the early hour at which we go to press, forbid our laying anything bt an abstract before our readers this week. The president commences by reviewing our koreigx relatioxs. jf tj,e conditions of our relations with other nations is less gratifving than it has ' USUally been at former periods, it is certainly more satist'actory than a nation so unhappily j di.stracted as we are inight reasonably have 1 apprehended. Our struggle has been, of j L l - OO 7 !course, coutemplated bv foreign nations with i " . reference less to its own nierits than to its SUpposecl and often exaggerated efiects, and J ,, cCno,, ,.aBh;nn t.,o. themselvea. eveithrfe8s, complaint on the part of this government, even if it were just, j would be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the sup- pression of the African slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion ol especial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part ot Her Majesty's Government has been matked with a jealous respcct for the authority of the Uniled States and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens Our relations with Gi-eat Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Kussia, Prussia, Denmark Sweden and Austria, the Xetherlands, Italy and some of the other European States, re main unditurbed. Very favorable relations :ilso continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan." On the subject of colonization the message is quile britf. The President says : Appli cations have been n.ade to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as was contempluted in recent acts of Con- gress. Other parties at home and abroad have suggested similar measures, while, on the other hand, several of the Spanish Amer- ,,. , ..i -..t ican Kepubhcs, have protested against the J sending ol such colonies to tneir respective . territories. Under these circumstances I have declined to move any such colony to any such State without first obtaining the consent of the Government, with an agree- ment on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all their rights of freemen.- And 1 have at the same time olfered to thp j several states situated in the tropics, or hav- ng colonies there, to negotiate with them, , . , , subiect to the advice and consent of the Sen-, ate, to favor the voluntarv emigration of per- atc, iuiaui lllt luiuiiiuM uiuiiuiiuii uv.i . , , , . . . sons of that class to their respective ternto- , ries, unon conditions which shall be eoual, ries, upon conditions which shall be equal, UJt lll.U ..UJll.llt.. The President has favored the projeot of connecting the l nited Mates with Kurope , by an lnternationai teicgrapti : says tlial tlie tiii: nationai. nN.Nci:s t,-, .n.ncco.l ,rrt lunmi, ; ).n i.mp u , . -iu -i , ,- m all their beanngs. J he Presulent beheves that the issuing of L'nited States Notes was . ..... ; period coinpatible with due regard to all in terests, is recommended. In speaking of a safe and uniform rurrencv the Presidnt says : " 1 know of no mode . . 1 1 1 -mtui..wm.s-.. ,u.. u..,,... .c, same time sr, unobjeclionable, as the organi- zdtion of banking asocialions under a gene- in appearan(;e and security and convertible alwajs into coin, would at oncc protect labor igainst Uie ovils ot a victous currcncy and hifiHtntn rommem. bv nlie.m nml safe f-v- chanjre." The Message fills three and a half columns in the Roston Journal. Two columi.s are taken up in considering the " Compensated f.mancipation l rociamation lssueu on tne 22d of last September.
