Ruef Found Guilty on Sixth Ballot Alter 24 Hours Eight Jurors Stand for Conviction From the First BOLD SEER IS EXPOSED BY WOMAN Miss M. C. Ellis, an Oakland school Teacher, Bares Queer Dealings of Clairvoyant Declares J. Hobart Deane, Act» ing for Promoters, Sold Her Worthless Stock Vi Dual Personality of So Called Mystic Comes to Light in Bay City Poses as Society Man, and Ad mits Scheme to Dupe Victims John F. Neylan WITH the assertion of Miss M. C. Ellis, a teacher In the Grant school, Oakland, that she has been made the vic tim of a rnlnlngr stock swindle by J. Ilobart Deane, "the world's greatest clairvoyant," who plies his trade at tl:'e. Adams hotel in the city across the bay, there has come to licht the strange story of a man who has trained himself to. emulate the dual personality of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,. It is a story t?i?fba-res once again the credulity and cjiildish simplicity and faith of eager for wealth. It U a story o* V::e promotion of dubious mining: stocks «>y means of the apparently occult and supernatural, based in reality upon the pimple apparatus and suave deception of the charlatan. And it is a story •which, while confirming: the axiom that a gullible fool is born every minute, specifically exposes these facts: That J. Hobart Deane, clairvoyant In Oakland, and Jack Coker, society man tr.d supposed lumber merchant of San Kranclsco, are one and the same person. That In the role of Jack Coker, Deane has baen Introduced Into local society by Major George E. Pickett, paymaster and popular officer at the Presidio. That Major Pickett has hitherto be lieved Deane, In the person of Coker, to be a secret service agent here on Important business. That Deane, by means of clairvoyant Frances, Induces those of h!s customers with money to invest In mining- stocks in which he is interested. That Deane is paid Jay the promoters of. these stocks to secure purchasers, and is paid half of the proceeds as his commission. That Deane, by means of a trick desk. Is enabled to obtain Impressions of the handwriting of his clients and can reitd the questions which they have wrjttcn and supposedly destroyed with out his having seen them. Finally, Deane has admitted to me, whom he supposed to be a man of wealth in search of Investments, that he Is daily on the llookoutt t for dupes with money. Taking me into his confidence, he pro- posed a. partnership whereby, upon the > jT-*yment' of $500, I was to become the sharer of : his spoils -and assist him in the landing of victims. Says She Was Duped So far as the dealings of Miss Ellis with Deane are concerned, she asserts tfaat she was cheated out of money which she paid to Deane for. mining' dtock, and the clairvoyant himself has admitted to me that he did sell the min ing: stock for the men, who now say that; they know but little about him and that they agreed to give him half of what he got. Further than this,- he has 'admitted to me that he is: laying plans to induce an Oakland banker to invest $20,000, half of which is to be hls.commission and the other half to go to mining promoters engaged In the business of peddling worthless stock. .•Deane, or Coker, has not, only bared The Inside workings of his own schemes, but,has ridiculed separately and collec tively those Individuals who are mak ing money by Imposing on the credulity qf simple xnindedTpeople In San Fran olsco and vicinity, claiming that -the superiority of his methods gives his rivals the appearance of three dimes In a fog. . Quick witted. a fluent talker, care ful!^ attired, Deane in talking to me, who'^he misunderstood for an addi tional victim, corroborated every state ment made by the woman who Fays that h«;r small earnings were stolen Continued OB F*J« 4t4 t Column I The San Francisco Call.
