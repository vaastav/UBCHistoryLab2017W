EBH3DURC. PA.. FRIDAY, - - - DEC. Hi, 1S37. One of the most prominent KpubU cana who supports President Cleveland's views ia his message oo revenue re J ac tion, is Hugh McCuIloch, who was Mr. Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury. E. L. IlAnrrn, Vicel'resirfent of the fidelity Cauk of Cincinnati, which Le wrecked some moDlhs atro by using up the deposits in enormous speculations in wheat, was convicted of his offense on Saturday last and on Monday was sen tenced ten years to the Ohio penitentia ry. If every bank officer who plays the eame rascally game that Harper did was arrested and should meet with a similar punishment, the practice of using other peoples money in wild speculative schemes would be more honored in tbe breach than in the observance. John S. JIakmoi r has been nomi nated by the Ihunocrata in the Virginia Legist iture for United States Senator to succeed Henry II. Iiiddleberger, whose term of cITtee wilt expire on the 4:h of next March. The election of Mr. li.ir fcour by the joint vote of the two houses will take place on text Tuesday. As Chairman of the iH-mocratic S:ate Committee Harbour drove Mahone out of the Senate last year ty securing the lection of a democratic Legislature, and in the :tm capacity this year and witli a similar result, he w ill perform the same pleasant duty for Iliddleberger.

A collection was taken up in aid of tha cause which amounted to J I,. "A ).( I. Five hundred and ninety-four tills were introduced in the Uuited States Senate ou last Tuesday, larger n umbo than vwre ever before introduced in a single day. Among them were bills calling fur appropriations aggregating nearly e'njlit millions for the erection of thirty-one public buildings all over the country from Oregon to Plor.da. Twelve out of the fo-irteen Senators who made this raid on the Treasury are Republicans. It is one of their ways cf getting rid of the surplus in the Treasu ry. Cleveland's plan is to admit certain raw matenaU of manufacture free of duty and to reduce the tax on the neccessaries of life. John .Most, the convicted New York Anarchist was sentenced on last Friday to one year's imprisonment in the Jl'ackwells Island penitentiary. From this sentence Most, t:rder the Jaw or New Vnk, had the right of appeal to the Supreme Court and he availtd fcim- self of the privilege, a female fympa- Ihiser, named Mr?.

There arequiie a numl er of foreign er? in the present Congress, and the Iiiahmen lead, numbering nine. There are seven Scotchmen and two Norwe gians. Minnesota, with a single excep tion, is entirely represented by men of i foreign birth. Leopoll Morse, of Huston, is a Pavarian, and Komeis, of Toledo, Ohio, the baggage master Congressman. ho defeated Prank IlurJ, is also a Ilavarian. John T. Caine, the Mormau delegate, was born on the lale of Man. There urn! to be a few colored men from the South in Congress and com plaint is being mule by the Republican papers that there U not a man of that race in the present body. This gives rise to the question, why don't the Re publicans give a practical proof of their afTction for the black man by aending J a few of them to Congress ? There is sorely one colored man in Philadelphia and likewise Pittsburg, the home of "Ajax" Smith, who Is fit to go to Con gress. The Republicans in both these localities have the strength to elect any man they see proper to nominate, and instead of railing at aud abusing the South for uot sending colored men to Washington they could best show their sincerity by doing so themselves. John J. Inoalls, of Kansas, who is President of the United States Senate, and whose tongue is steeped iu gall and biterness, was asked the other day what his idea was of the civil service question and answered as follows : "I believe in civil strvice reform.

PKESIDOT'S MESSAGE. T" the Con'jrtts or" the United States : You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition of the national finances which impera tively demands immediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually exAcifcd, through the opera tion of the present laws, from the industries and necessities of thi people, largelr exceeds the sum necessary to meet the expenses of the Government. When we consider that tbe theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise. with only such deduction as may be bis share toward tbe careful and economi cal maintainance of tbe Government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensi ble extortion, and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted upon thoee who bear tbe burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public treasury, which should ouly exint as a conduit conveying tbe people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, be comes a boarding-place for money need lessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling oar national energies, suspending our country's de velopment, preventing investment to productive enterprise, threatening finan cial distmbance. and inviting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our treasury ie not altogether new, and it has more than occei of late been submitted to the peo ple's representatives in the Congress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situation still continues, with aggravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial convulsion and wide spread disaster. Ic will not do to neglect this situation because its dangers are not now palpa bly imminent and apparent. They ex ist none tbe less certainly, and await the unforseen and nnxepected occasion w hen suddenly they will be precipitated upon us. On the .10 6ay of June, tr,e t cessof rever.n over public expenditures after complying with the annual require ment of the sinking-fund act, was J 17. S.V).7.'55.S4 ; during the year ended Jane HO. I"' such excess amounted to f !'.. 4'kT. M." X and during the yar ended June :&. 1S7. it reached the sum of f."..V.7,S4'J.34 The annual contributions to the sinking-fund during the three years above specified, amounting in the g gregate to f l..l.":,3-J0.f4, and deduct ed from that surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that ?urposs out standing tbrre per cent bonds of the Government. Poring the six months prior to June 3J.1S7, the surplus reve nue bad growu so large by repeated ac cumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the psople, would so af fect tbe TMisinessof tbe country that the sum of ?79, SOI. 100 of such surplus was applied to the pjyment of the pi:n"iple an. interest or the three percent bonds iji in ouaiuiiui., auvt v invn wric a, uvru payable at the option of tbe Govern meuf. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still needing rtlief, immediately after the 30ih day of June, 1S7. the remainder of the three per cent bonds then out standing, amounting with principle and interest to the sum of ?1S,s77,.7X). were called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the Treasury Department represen tations of distress in business circles not only continued but increased, and alosolute porit seemtd at hand. In these circumstances the contritution to the sinking-fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the ex penditure of f-27.(V4,2.' ."5 in the pur chase of Government bonds not ytt. due bearing four and four and a half per cent interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about twenty-four per cent for the former and eight per cent for the latter. In addition to thfs the in terest accruing amli.r the current year "Pon the outstanding bonded isdebted- ness of tha Government was to some extent anticipated, and banks selecte-I as depositories of pub'ic motity were permitted to scmewhat increase their deposit?. fcxoRMOcs .i-Rn.rs predicted. "While expedients thus employed, to release to the people the money lying idle In the Treasury, served to avert immediate danger, our surplas revenues have continued to accumulate, the ex cess for the present year amounting on the 1st day ot December to .j5.2oS,701. 11). and estimated to reach the sum of lFJ.OOO.OUOon the30tb of June next, at which date it is expected that this sum added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the Treasury toiiio.ono.oco. There seems to be no assnrar.es that, with such a withdrawal from use of the people's circulating medium, our busines community may not in the near future be subjected to tli9 same distress which was quite lately produced from the ame caus. And while the func tions of our Nall'Mtul Treasury ehould b9 few and simp'e, and while its bst condition would be reached. I beileve, bv its entire disconnection with private busir;ess iuteres:, vet when, by a per version of i's purposes, it iUiy hj'ds money uselessly subtracted from the channels cX trade, there seems to be reason luriw ciini iu Bome jeg.u- mate means fcl.ou:d be devised by the Government to restore in an emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If euch an emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of lhre per cent bonds, which were payable a( the. option of the Government, lias afloided a means for the disbursement of the excess of our revenues ; but tiles' bands nave all been retired, and there are no bonds outstand ing the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund which furnishes the occnsion for expenditure in the pur chase of bonds has been already made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. 

MIAUL THE rt r.CilASE OK It )NIS CON TINl'E ? In the present state of legislation the only preteriee of any existing executive power to restore, at this time, any pnrt ot our surplus revenues to th people by its expenditure, consists in the supposi tion that tin? Secretary of trie Treasury may enter the market and purchase tt;e bonds of the Government not yet due, at a ra'e of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power ou'.d te derived is found in an appropriation bill passed a num ber of years ago, aud it is subj-ct to the suspicion that it was intended as tem porary and limited in its application, instead of conferring a continuing dis cretion and authority. No condition ought to exist which would justify the gran: of power to a siuzle tiflicial, upon his judgement of its necessity, to with hold from or release to the business of rvheTdin-'iheT.e'a'u y nTt bus1 'affect l " WiU' lhe fiaanci ailuUn country ; and if it is deemed wise to the people, m an unusual manner, mon lodge in the Secretary of the Treasnrv the authority in tbe present juncture to purchase tonds, it should bo plainly vested, and provided as far aa possible with such checks and limitations as will define this cfficial's rleht and dis cretion, ana at the earn time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering tbe question of pnr chasing bonds as a means of restoring to J circulation the surplus mcney acenmu- biting in the Treasury, it should oe borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of theae bonds held aa investments which cannot be purchased at any price, and tbat com binations among holders who are will ing to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the Govern ment. It has been suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest, and the difference be tween tbe old and new security paid in cash, thus finding use for tbe surplus in the Treasury. The success of this plan, it Is apparent, must depend upon the volition of tbe holders of tbe present bonds ; and it is not entirely certain that tbe inducement which must be offered tbem would result in more financial benefit to tbe Government than tbe purchase of bonds, while tbe latter proposition would reduce the prin cipal of the debt by actual payment, in stead of extending it. The proposition to deposit the mocey held by tbe Government in banks throughout tbe country, for use by tbe people, is. it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as establish ing too close a relationship between the operations of the Government Treasury od tbe business of the country, and too extensive a commingling of their mosey, thus fostering an unnatnral reliance in private business upon public funds. It this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a temporary expedient to meet an nrgent necessity. Legjsla live and executive effort should gener ally be in tbe opposite direction and should have a tentency to divorce, as much and as fast a) can safely be done. the Treasury Depart men from private enterprise. Of course it Is not expected tbat un necessary and extravagant appropria tions will be made for the purpose of avoiding tbe accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure, beside the demorilization ot all iust conceptions of public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and btniticent puipoacscf our Government. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to tbe knowledge of my country men, as well as to the attention of tbeir representatives charged with the re sponsibility of legislative relief, the cravity of oar financial sitnation. Tbe failure of tbe Congress heretofore ta pro vide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily produce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your last ad journment, which taxed to the utmost all the authority aud expedients within executive Control ; and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued .inaction of Con gress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the situation thus far consid ered is fraught witn danger which should be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to tbe people as well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing cut of a perfectly rata ble and apparent cause, constantly re producing the '.a me alarming circum stances a congested national treasury and a depleted monetary condition in the business of the ccuntry. It need hirdly be stated that while the rresent bituation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme for taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from tbe people and put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad, and internal-revenue taxes levied upon th6 consumption of tobacco and spiritu ous and malt liquor. It must be con ceded that tone of tbe things subjected to internal-revenue taxation, are strict ly speaking, necessaries ; there appears to be no ju3t complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, an3 there seems to le nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to ry twrtion of the people. 

VICIOUS. TAHIFF LAW'S. But our present tariff laws, the vic ious, inequitable, and illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ouzht to be at once revised and am&ndd. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles imported and subject to duty, by pre cisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these imported articles. Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and piodncts are called protection to these home manufacturers, because they render it impossible for those of our people who are manufactures, to make these articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the import ed goods tbat have paid customs duty. So it happens that while comparitlvely a few use the imported articles, millions of cur people, who never use and never saw any or the foreign products, pur- j chas? and use things of the same kind 1 made in this country and pay therefor j nearly or quite tbe ume enhanced nrire j which the duty adds to the imported ' j articles. Those who buy imports pay I the duty charged tneieon into the pub- : , lie treasury, but the great majomv of I onr citizens, who buy domestic articles ; or the same class, pay a sum at least j home manufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but in or der that we may be constantly reminded of tbe manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume do mestic products as well ai those who consume impoiteJ articles, and thus create a tax upon aU our people. It is not proposed to entirelv relieve the country of this taxation. ' It must be extensively continued as tbe source of tbe ttoverdroe'jt's income; and in a readjustment of cur tariff the interest of American labor encaged in manufac ture shomd be carefully considered, as i we i as tne preservation or our manu i facturers. It may be called protection. or by any other name, but relief ?rom the hardships and dangers of our pre sent tariff laws should bo devised with especial precaution against imperiling the existence of our manufacturing in terests, not this existence should not mean a condition which, without re- I gard to th public welfare or a national ! exigency, must always insure the reali- i zatton of immense profi's instead of j moderately profitable returns. As tbe ' volume aLd diversity of our national i activities increase, new recruits are i added to those who desire a cootinua- j tion of the advantages which thy con- ceive tbe present system of tariff taxa-, tion directly affords them. So stuborn- , lv have all efforts to reform tbe present i i condition been resisted by those of our ' f!iow ctt!zens thus ensaod. that thev I I can hardly complain of the suspicion, I entertained to a certain extent, that j there exists an organized combination j all along tbe line to maintain tbeir advantage.

CELEIIKA1 IONS. "We are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and in genuity, in American energy and enter prise, and in the wonderful natural a Wantages and resources developed by a century's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a ocheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for tbe benefit of onr manufacturers, quite beyon l a reasonable demand for govern mental regard, it suits tbe purposes of advocacy to call our manufacturers Infant Industries, still needing the fciRhest and greatest degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from Federal legislation. It also said that the Increase in the price of domestic manufactures resulting from tbe present tariff is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to oar working men employed In manufactories, tban are paid for what is called the panper lapor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfar and liberal compensation of our laboring people. Oor labor is honorable in the eyes of every American citizen ; and as It lies at the foundation of aur development and pro cress. It Is entitled, without affection or hy pocrisy, to the utmost regard. The stand ard of onr laborers' life should not be meas ured by that of any other coantry less fav ored, and tbey are entitled to their full share of all our advantagee. By the last census It Is made to appear that of the 17.TO2.0P9 or our population en gaged In all kinds of industries 7.670,493 are employed In agriculture. 4.074.238 in profes sional and personal service, (2,934.870 of whom are domestic servants and laborers,) while 1.810,256 are employed in trade aod transportation, ana 3.837.112 are classed as employed In manufacturing and mining. For present purposes, however, the last number given should be considerably re duced Without attempting to enumerate all. it will be conceded tbat there should be deducted from those which it includes 375, 143 carpenters and joiners. 285.401 milliners, dressmakers, and seamtresses. 172.720 blacksmiths, 134,756 tailors and talloresses, 102,573 masons, 7G.241 butchers 41,309 bak ers. 22,083 plasterers, and 4.991 engaged in manufacturing agricultural implements. amounting in the aegreeate to 1,214,023. leaying 2,623,089 persons employed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a hlfcb tariff. To these tbe appeal is made to save their employment and maintain tbeir wages by resisting a change. There should bu no dis position to answer such suggestions by tbe allegation tbat tbey are in a minority among those who labor, and therefore should forego an advantage, in the interest of low prices for tbe majority ; '.heir compecsstion, at It may be affected by the operation fit tariff laws, t-hould at all times be scrupulously kept in view ; and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the tact thai they are consumers with the rest ; that tbey, too. have their own wants and those of tbeir families to supply from their earnings, and that tba price of tbe necessaries or life, as well as the amount of tbeir wages, will reg ulate the measure of their welfare and com fort. 

WORKIXCMEN TO BE PROTKCTED, But the reduction of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss or employment by the workiogman nor the lessening of tis wages; and the picfits still remaining to the manufacturer, after a cacessary read justment, should furcUh no excuse for the sacrifice or the interests of his employes either in their opportunity to woik or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the wotker in manufacturers fail to undet stand that while a hlch tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the pa; mentor rem unerative wa?ee, it certainly results in a Very larse increase in the price or nearly all sorts or manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, be needs tor the use or himself and bis family. He receives at the desk of bis employer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches bis home Is oblighed, in a purchase for family use of an article whicb embraces Ms own labor, to return in the payment ot tbe increase in price w hich the tariff permits, tbe hard-earned compensa tion or many days or toil. Tbe farmer and the agriculturist who manufacture nothing, but w bo pay the in creased price which the tariff imposes, upon every agricultural implement, upon all be wears and upon all he uses and owns, ex cept tbe increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry produces from tbe soil, is ioviteJ to aid (a maintaining the present situation ; and he Is told tbat a hlch duty on impott-d wool Is necessary for the benefit or those who have fcheep to shear. In order that the price or their wool may be Increased. Tbey or course are not reminded that tbe farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, In bis purchases of clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow-farmer as well as to the manufactur er and merchant; nor is any mention made of tbe fact that the sbeep-owners themselves and their households, must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from the wool tbey sell at tariff prices, aud thus as consumers must return their share of this Increased price to the tiadesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a j large proportion of the sheep owned by tbe j farmers throughout the coantry are found i in small flocks, numering from twenty-five j to fifty. The duty on tbe grade of imported j wool which thete sheep yield is ten cents each pound if of the valne of thirty cnts or less, and twelve cents if of the vtlue of ' more than thirty cents. If the liberal estl- I mate or six pounds be allowed for eacb , fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty or ! seventy-two cents, and this may be taken ' as the utmost enchancement of Its price to the farmer by reason of thisduty. Eijf.iteen dollars would thus represent th Increased price of the wool from twenty five steep ani thirty-six dollars that from the wool of ditlon would amount to about one-third or its price, ir npon its sale the Tarroer re ceive this or a leas tariff profit, the woo! leaves his hands chared with precisely that son, which in all its chances will adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other Roods and material ror use. Its cost I? not ouly In creased to the extent or lhe farmer's tariff profit, but a turther sum has been added ror tbe benefit or the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the mean time the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen (roods and mateiial to clothe himself and family for the winter. When he races the tradesman ror that purpose be discovers that he Is obliged not only to return in the xray or In creased prices, his tariff profit on the wool be sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but tbat be must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a farther increase in cost caoied by a tariff duty on taa mauufactcre. Thus in the end he Is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of thfe tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool seems d so profitable, an incresee in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff prfit be received upon the wool be produced and sold. When the number or farmers encaged in woolroising Is compared with all the farm ers In tbe country, and the small proportion they-bear to onr population is considered; when it is made apparent tbat, in the case of ! a large part or thot.e who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff on wool is Illus ory ; and, above all. when H must be con ceded that the Ineresse of the cost or living caused by such tariff, becomes a burden up on those with moderate means and the poor, tbe employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it con stitutes a tax which, with relentless crasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman, and child In tbe land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this dutv should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. COM 

PETITION AMOyfi DOMESTIC PRODUCERS. In speaking of the Increased cost to tbe cocaumer of our tome mauufacturef , re- Go to GEIS, FOSTER & QUIXN'S, Clinton St., Johnstown, Pa., for Carpets, Mattings, Rugs, Stair Fads, Stair Rods, Stair Buttons, Oilcloths, Linoleum, Lace Curtains, Feathers, Turcoman Curtains, Madras Curtain Goods, etc., etc. Quality of Coods unequaled and prices the lowest. suiting from a dnty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not overlooked that competition among our domestic pioduser sometimes has the e ffect of keeping tbe price of their products below tbe highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this competition Is too often strangled by combinations quite prevalent at this time, and frequently called trusts, which bave for their object the regulation of tbe supply and price of com modities made and sold by members of tbe combination. Tbe people can hardly hope for any consideration in tbe operation of these selfish schemes. If, however, In the absence of suchc ombi natlon, a fcealtby and free competition reduces the price or any particular dutiable article ot borne production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and ir, witn such reduced price, i's manufacture continues to ttrlve, it is entirely evident that one thins has been dis covered which should be carefully scrutin ized In an effort to reduce taxation. Tbe necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point furnishes proor that scnie one is will ing to accept lower prices ror such commo dity, aud tbat such prices are remunerative . and lower prices produced by competition prove the eame thing. Thus where either of these conditions exist, a case would seem to be presetted for an easy leducliwU cf taxation. KKDrCTIOV OF CUSTOMS DUTIES. The considerations which bave been pre sented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the Govern ment be prevented by tho reduction of our customs duties, and, at tbe same time, to emphasize a suggestion that In accomplish Ing ibis purpose, we may discharge a dou ble duty toour people by granting totheia a measure of reiitr from tariff taxation in quarters where it can be most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and j ustly accorded, Nor can the presentation made of such considerations be, with any daeree of fair ness, regarded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing interests, or of any lack of appreciation of tbeir value and importance. These interests constitute a leading aud most substantial element of our country's progress. But if In the ememeuey that Tresses upon us our manufacturers are ask ed to surrender something for the public good and to avert disaster, their patriotism, as well as a creatful recognition of advan tages already afforded, should Jead them to willing co-operation. No deruaud is made that they shall foro all the benefits of goy ejmental regard ; but they cannot fail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self Interett and 6fety, when thev are reminded of the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present condition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to oor manfacturers then to our ether Important enterprises. Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform Is now offsred , and none of us fchould be un mindful of a time when an abused aud irri tated people, heedless or those who bave re sisted timely and reasonable relief, may in sist upon a radical and sweeping recittlca tion ot their wrongs. The difficulty attending a wise and fair revision of our tariff laws Is not ucderesti mated. It will require on the part of the Congress great labor and care, aud especial ly a bread and national contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard or such local and selfish claims as are unreas onable and reckless or tbe welfare of the en tire country. 

METHODS OK RELIEF SUGGESTED. Und-ir our present laws more than rour thousand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufacturers, and many ara bard ly worth attention as subjects of reveuue A considerable reduction can be made iu the aggregate, by adding them to the free list. The taxation of lnxuiies presents no reatures of hardship ; but the necessaries of , life used and consumed by all the people, I the duty upon whicb adds to the cost ot liv ' Idb in every home, thould be greatly cheap ' ened. i The radical reduction of the duties itn S posed upon raw material used In manufac j tures, or its free importation, is cf course an i important factor in auy effort to reduce the j price of these necessaries ; it would not on j ly relieve them from the Increased cost j caused by the tariff on such material, but I tbo manufactured product being thus cheap 1 ene, that part of tbe tariff row laid -jp-n ! such product, as a compensatien to our manufacturers for the present price of raw material, could be accordingly modified. Such reduction, or free importation, would serve beside to largely reduce the revenus. It is appureut how such a change can hae any Injurious effect upon ur manufactur ers. On tte contrary, it would appear to give tbem a better chance in foreigu mark ets with the manufacturers cf other coun tries, who cheapen their wares by free ma terial. Thus our people miuht bave the op portunity t.f extendici their sales leyoud the limits of home consumption saving them from the depression, Interruption in business, and loss caused by a elutted do mestic market find affording their employes more certain and steady labor, with its re sulting quiet and contentment. Tbe question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached In a spirit higher than partisanship and considered in the light or that recard for patiiotic duty which should characterize the act it n of those Intrusted with the weal of a confiding people. But the obi'gation to declared pailv policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented In tbe Government have, by repeated and au thoritative declarations, condemned the condition of our laws which permit the col lection from the people of uunessary reve nue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correction ; and neither as cit izens or partisans are onr countrymen in a moot to condone thg deliberate violation ol there pledges. " Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling ipon the theories or protection a: d free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condition which confronts us not a theo ry. Iieiirf from this condition may involve a slight reduction or the advantages winch we award our home productions, but tbe en tire withdrawal of such advantages, should not be contemplated. The question ot free trade is absolutely irrelevant ; and tbe per sistent claim made In certain quarters, that , nil efforts to relieve tlia people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so called free-traders, is mischievous and k'ar removed from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe tbe people Is to reduce taxation to tbe necessary expenses of an economical opera tion of the Government, and to restore to the business of the country tbe money which, we bold in the Treasury through the per version of governmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our Industries, without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our woikingmen need, and with benefit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means or subsistence and increasing the measure or their comforts. "THE
