LOUIS Union News Company, Union Depot and Southern lioteL WASHINGTON, D. C.-Rgg Ilonse and Ebbltt Ilonse. District Attorney Chambers seems to have sized up Bailey. "Gad-fly" is as good an "Tom-tit." Southern papers are asserting that though Jefferson Davis is dead, tho cause for which he fought still lives. Just what do these editors mean? AN Australian-ballot bill has been in troduced in the Virginia Legislature. So long as men are selected to count votes who will return majorities for Democratic 'candidates, any law will be of little account. It is reported that Senator Vest and other Missouri Democrats are very fear ful that the Republicans will carry that State this fall. It would be the best thing for Missouri that could come to it sincePrices army was driven out. The average people! of this country consume more and better clothing and food per capita than do those of Great Britain. They do so because they have morcto buy them with. Let us adhere to the policy under which this condition exists. The St. Louis Kepnblic tells Senator Turpie that his pension bill is un-Demo-cratic. True; so is every Democratic bill to pension Union soldiers; but some Democratic Congressmen live in States that were on the Union side, and must be an-Democratic or go. In its leading editorial yesterday the St. Louis Republic informs Senator Tur pie thaf he is not a Democrat if ho be lieves in the trust Resolution which he introduced in the Senate the other day. Senator Turpie not a Democrat! Great Scott! what is he, then? District Attorney Chambers took the right view and tho right action in the. Dudley case. The whole, proceed ing was a sham, and the district attor ney would have been highly censurable if he hay! permitted himself to be used by the Bailev-Coy gang in the manner they desired. To put the matter brie'lly, tho question before the Hendricks Club now is: Which is the accepted test of true Indiaua De mocracy, to support Governor Gray for anything he wants, or for individuals to accept ofiiccs whenever they can get a chance? If put to a party vote, there is no doubt that the office side would have the affirmative by a large majority. Conflicting reports come 'from Ohio regarding tho chances of Mr. Hrice, of New York, to securo tKo senatorship. One Democrat who has been making a tour of tho Stato in the interest of Mr. Thomas, says that tho New York candi date has no chance. On the other hand, Sir. Brice, who is devoting all his rare business energy to his canvass, is radi ant with tho assurance of success. But he is a rainbow chaser. The last Republican city convention made a strong and pointed declaration ogainst disposing of city franchises without a full and fair equivalent. The Journal has indorsed the declaration in strong and decided terms. This is enough to determine the course of Re publican members of tho Council. They understand that if they triflo with the city's interests in this regard it will not bo good for them. Senator Tckpie has lost no time in getting on to tho Republican platform regarding trusts. Hit speech on the subject is an unequivocal indorsement of the views expressed in President Har rison's message. It is worthy of remark that President Harrison is not only tho first President to recommend anti-trust legislation, but he "was the first public man in the country to take ground against them. This he didin his speech at Danville, in November, 1887. Senator Turpie if just catching up with the Re publican'piocession. Southern sentimentalists of literary proclivities have not had such an op portunity fortiuo writing for several years as Jeff Davis's death affords them, and, as they are not likely to have an other soon, are making the most of it. Dispassionate readers who do not ad mire fine writing upon 0113- subject are of the opinion that they have made al together too much of it; but much is ex cusable in these gentry. Your genuine Southerner is bound to perpetrate a large amount of "gushM at intervals, or die, and the rtst.of the world 6hould not be too hard on him. Factional disturbances among Mis souri Democrats are causing much anx iety to the leaders in that camp. Senator Vest tells them that Republicans are so encouraged by the outlook in the Stato that they confidently count on carry - iug it at the next national election, and wani9 his brethren that the Democracy 19 in danger of sacrificing its chances by putting personal ambition before party success. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch takes up the refrain, and declares that if the Democracy of Missouri is to bo organized on a basis of personal ambi tion, tho Democrats may have very little interest in tho next senatorial election or in State affairs after 1802. According to all accounts, the differences in the party are too wide and deep to bo hushed by soft words, and eomo more active measures must be used by tho Democratic doctors. Vest, himself, is not so popular that he can force the party to "get together." No leader of greater force than he has come to the front, and Republicans are looking over tho once hopeless Democratic strong hold with calm and contemplative smiles. OUR 

NATIONAL PECKSNIFF. s Every State, if not every community, lis its Pecksniff, but the Republic has but one, and ho holds the position by virtue of accidents and crimes which once made him President of the United State, If a national Pecksniff is a ne cessity, doubtless another could be found, but not one who would so mag nify the position as Hon. G rover Cleve land. He lets no opportunity escape to appear in that role. Indeed, it may be said that he uses the slightest pretext as an occasion to extol tho political good ness and the unapproachable public virtues of Grover Cleveland. Last night, upon the invitation of the Merchants' Association of Boston, which invites retired aud alleged statesmen to address it in the month of December, Mr. Cleveland delivered a speech de voted to ballot and civil-service reform. The man who became President in 1884 because three thousand electoral votes cast for General Butler in Brooklyn, N. Y., were counted for him, and by the suppression of suffrage in South Caro lina Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, is not tho best person in the world to champion ballot reform, unless he appears -with a confession of his own experience in the character of the -awful example. Equally inconsistent is his going to a State which wa9 the first to adopt a secret-ballot system of unusual strin gency, and the only one to apply hon estly civil-service provisions to its local t affairs, because Republicans constitute two-thirds of its legislatures, and be cause it never had an out-and-out Dem ocratic legislative body. But his blun dering impertinence surpasses his incon sistency when he declares in Massachu setts, as applying to that locality, that "tho -free political preference of those whom fato has made dependent upon daily toil for hard-earned bread is strangled and destroyed by intimidation and the fenr of loss of employment." A more gratuitous insult could not have been hurled at those whose courtesy he was enjoying, or a viler aspersion cast upon the manhood of tho thousands of wage-earners in the Bay State. Mr. Cleveland undoubtedly feels that the Hill partisans sold him out in New York last fall; but if this is tho case, why does he go to a Stato always noted for fair elections to rebuke New York Democrats? Would it not be much bet ter for him to devote himself to enlist ing Democrats in tho New York Legis lature to vote for the bill for ballot re form, which Governor Hill has twice vetoed? Why does he go to Massachu setts to preach repentance to tho Repub lican righteous when at home Democratic sinners are perishing? Tho granite of New England is butter compared with that adamantino and boundless cheek which enables him to denounce crimes against suffrage. He knows, if he knows anything, that the suffrage of the Con stitution, and which is tho corner-stone of popular government, was obliterated twelve years ago in the South by a con spiracy of Democratic leaders that no such thing as a free election and a fair count has been known in six Southern States for years, because of Democratic intimidation, fraud and outrage. If Mr. Cleveland is an earnest ballot-reformer, -why does he not make a tour of the South where his political brethren openly boast that the votes of a million freemen shall not bo counted as tho evangel of freo suffrage and honest counting? That would bo honest and consistent, but tho professional Pecksniff is neither honest nor consistent, but is a posturcr and a sniveler. A 

BOLD CONFESSION. The Atlanta (Ga.) Constitution is at once one of the ablest, the most candid and most progressive papers of the South. Indeed, one of its editors is a brilliant man, who occasionally makes after-dinner speeches about tho new South in Northern cities. Consequently, when the Constitution speaks its mind we may take it for granted that the real sentiment of the best of the controlling element of the South is uttered. In a recent issue, evidently when in a most candid frame of mind, tho editor, in a leading editorial, said: There are tdgns that the color line is to be broken by the intelligent negroes, who real ize that their intercuts are. the interests of the white people ainoug whom they live. I11 Virginia, iu spite of the tremenaons ap peals made to race prejudice, thousands of negroes voted lor tho uemocratic candidate for Governor, rather than vote for on nu scrupulous and irresponsible manlike Ma- hone. Should this feeling develop among the negroes, we shall hear no more of the color line or tho negro problem, for the prcjudice of the whites will be disarmed, and the two races will llourish side by 6ide iu peace, prosperity and mutual friendli ness The above is entitled to more than passing attention. Tho present hos tility to the negro voter is duo to the fact that he is a Republican. Tho color line is kept up by tho Demo cratic leaders in the South be came the negro is a Republican. Suf frage has" been taken away from him by fraud, intimidation and violence, not because there is objection to tho ne gro himself, but because he exercises the right of an American citizen and of conscience, to vote the Republican ticket. The negro isnbw notified that if he will sacrifice his convictions and be come tho tool of the Democratic leaders in the South, as he was once their slave, he cannot only vote, but the color line will disappear, and he will have restored to him the right of suffrage and oi pro tection under tho laws. In short, tho "negro problem," about which so many essayists are writing, will be solved, and so solved that he can enjoy peace and justice where ho is, and will not be obliged to emigrate to Hayti or Mexico for the sake of peace and to secure his rights. Strip tho verbiage from tho Constitution declaration, and what is it? Simply a notice that the Constitu tion of the United States will be tram pled under foot, that thousands of vot ers will be robbed of suffrage and denied their civil rights and protection under the laws, if they insist upon exercising the first right of a freeman. THE 

EAID AGAINST DUDLEY. ' No more disgusting piece of false pre tense was ever enacted than the Demo cratic demonstration . against Colonel Dudley during Ids recent visit to this city. To those who know something of Indiana politics, the history of the charges against Colonel Dudley and the animus of the raid against him, the re cent demonstration was ridiculous and contemptible. In this respect, however, it was on a par with the ;crbwd that en gineered it, composed of active mem bers of the Coy gang, political corrup tionists of the Democratic reform school and professional politicians anxious to commend themselves to their party by an exhibition of zeal in dirty work. The fact that the raid -was led by Leon Bailey, Sim Coy's legal adviser and con fidential friend in all his political ras calities, shows how much honesty there was in it. This crowd knew, as every body else does, that the charges ngaiqst Dudley havo no legal foundation. They have been investigated and exploded. If the gang had wanted to cause his ar rest they could have' done so long hgo. It was not necessary to wait till he came here with his little boy on private busi ness and then enact a farce like that of Wednesday night. Tho whole proceeding is a revival of the Democratic scheme to weaken the effect of their defeat in this State Inst year by keeping up the pretense that the State was carried by fraud. No more barefaced lie was ever coined than this. Tho Republicans carried Indian? last year, against tremendous odds, by the sheer force of popular enthusiasni and hard work. They carried it in spite of Democratic frauds. Tho State was over run with federal officials working for Cleveland, and the Democracy spent ten dollars where tho Republicans spent one, but in spite of everything they were fairly outvoted and beaten. The Dud ley letter, whether written by him or not, had no more to do with the Republican victory iu this State than last year's almanac or the I'ope's encyclical. The recent demonstration against him was simply stage thuuder, and a gratuitous exhibition of malignity by one of tho worst gangs of corrupt politicians to be found anywhere, ' ; THE AG EI CULT URAL INTEREST. Prof. W. L. Chamberlain, formerly of Ohio, and now president of tho Iowa Agricultural College, is one of the best informed men in tho country in agri cultural affairs. In a recent letter: he compared the agricultural advantages .1 rti 1 T 1 1 J' V.',iL I 01 unio ana xowa, aim, wxiue lie juub that each State excels in certain points, he advises farmers who are doing fairly well in Ohio to stay there. Ho assures them they are specially favored in . re gard to home markets. On this point he says: . . During the campaign you have heard much of home markets. None too much, I can assure you. Ohio is a great manu facturing State. It stands first -in the United States in the manufacture of agri cultural implements, and, next to Minne sota, stands about first iu milling interests and water-power for grinding. The value of all this ti the farmers of Ohio can hard ly be overestimated. It gives cheap imple ments, market for timber, market for wheat at mills,vkeeps the mill-feed at homo, and, best of all, makes an amazing market for flour, potatoes, truck crops, frnit, ; meats, butter, eggs, poultry, all the finer farm, and truck, aud horticultural .'.products right at home. Ohio joins manufactures and commerce; to agriculture, the ideal condition for prosperity. Ohio feeds her own busy hive of workers, saves freight both ways, and leaves all the profits of ag riculture, manufactures and commerce to he diffused within her own borders. Iowa shins her agricultural products to Chicago and the East, imports her manufactured products largely, pays freight both waj's, and helps build up Chicago and the East by a constant drain on herself. Whatever we may think of the tariff, tho Republican orators and papers have not overstated the immense benehts farmers derive from home markets, home manufactures and. home commerce. And the benefit is mutual. The mills, and shops, and cities get their markets, their food supply and their raw material close by, greatly to their advaut age. Professor Chamberlain is not in pol itics, and we do not know whether he is a Republican or a Democrat. Being a thoroughly welt-informed man and in terested in the development of Amer ican agriculture, wo suspect he is a Re publican. His letter, however, appears in the Ohio Farmer, an agricultural non partisan. paper, and is the unprejudiced expression of a man who places agricult ural interests above partisan politics.' He is, therefore, a good witness as to the benefits of protection, and we think: readers of tho Journal will agree that they have seldom been better stated.' What is true of Ohio is true in nearly tho same degree of Indiana. While ag riculture will always be the leading in-; dustry of this State, our manufacturing, interests are also gr owing rapidly. The' farmers of those counties where manu facturing. centers and homo markets are growing up do not need to bo instructed as to the benefits of a policy which cre ates and maintains these markets. Senator Voouiieks's tariff preamble, is not sufficiently specific. He would) have duties levied upon the luxuries and' the necessities brought iu free, but the same difficulty in discriminating that in terferes with the "free raw material-' business appears here alro. Where does necessity end and luxury begin? Take an ordinary rope, for instance, used to unfurl the family washing to the breeze; it is distinctly a necessity; but used to hang Caruegies and things, it is just as distinctly a luxury. Where will the Senator draw the line not the lino ho wants to draw over a lamp-post, but. the metaphorical liue that divides tho realms of luxury and necessity? An Eastern paper makes the announce ment that no skill is required to grow wool, as the breeders of hhoep devote themselves to the dillicult task of fur- nishing the varieties of sheep which will afford the wool which the manu facturers need for special fabrics. As a matter of fact the largest wool-growers are the most successful sheep1 growers, and there is no industry in whicbniore skill and patience is required than the breeding of &hep which will give the wools required for the fabrics in use at different periods. The free-trader, draws upon his imagination for most of his stock of what proves to be misinfor We thought it was about tirao for Grover to break out again.- The follow ing letter shows ho is of the same opinion: New York. Nov. SO. 1S80. Cnaiiman of Committee on Tariff Reform of the Re form Club: - Pkah Sir I hare been much interested in an examination of .the practical work done by your committee, and I am thor oughly convinced that the further prosecu tion of this work within the lines which have been laid down is of the utmost im portance. There is no doubt that now is the titno for efforts and activity in this direction. The coming winter months, when those you look to reach with economic truths are at leisure, and free from the dis turbing intlueuce of political heat, are of infinitely more valno in your labor than double the time at another period, when leisuro and calm judgments are wanting. I inclose a small contribution in aid of the immediate continuation of the good work. I wish I felt able to send you a much larger subscription. Gkoveu Cleveland. .The gooilwork referred to is, of course, the dissemination of free-trade liter ature with incidental references to Grover Cleveland as the embodiment of economic wisdom and Democratic statesmanship Unfortunately he was' only able to inclose "a small contribu tion." He should have added: "The continuance of the robber tariff, which is making tho rich richer and the poor poorer, makes it extremely difficult for an honest lawyer to make a living1 '.The first-page editor of the News in forms its nVaders that "the strong arm of the federal law that reached out and' grasped Coy and 'Bernhamer, and other election offenders, when public senti ment said they must be prosecuted is, apparently, paralyzed when there is an opportunity for it to lay hands upon William Wade Dudley." It might be well enough to remember that in one case the strong arm reached out with an indictment, while in tho other the mat ter, had been thoroughly investigated, and no indictment found. It Is related that, a year, or two ago, Jeffer son Davis declined to accede to the request of a New York magazine to write an article on Abraham Lincoln, on the ground that Lincoln had been dead too short a time for accurate and dispassionate judgment to be passed on his political career. During his interview with khe magazine agent, Davis ' took occasion to say that it was curious that he had never met Mr. Lincoln, and had no recollection of ever seeing him. "I re signed from the House to go to Mexico in 1 W said Davis, "and 3Ir. Lincoln did not take his seat in that body until . later. 'When I returned to Washington in 1847 as SenatoT from Mississippi, although fre quently in the House, I do not remember to have seen Mr. Lincoln, whose term expired in 1840, Douglas, more than once after his opponent had become prominent, tried to 1 recall him to my memory, but he never could succeed in doing so." This effort to Ahowv that Mr. Lincoln's personality was not suf ficiently strong to be impressed upon a fel low-Congressman's memory would have 4 b?en better omittedt It will bo notcd the 'idol of Southern hearts" did not go so far as to say that tho later career of the war President had left no impression upon him. The man whom Davis could not remember after a simultaneous service in at least one session of Congress finally succeeded in be coming a very distinct personality, that no rebel could forget if he tried. he- account of the suspension of 'the st National Bank of Abilene, Kan., dis close the fact that the misfortnnf is large ly due to the loaningjof money upon real estate' mortgages dating a boom period. National banks are forbidden to make such investments. It is a well-known fact that this prohibition has been evaded by some banks iu new localities, which" loan money to some of their directors to invest iu real estate mortgages. Trie death of Jefferson Davis has brought to tho front, among other gush, long essays on the "chivalrous honor" and "high mor ale of the conspicuous rebel leaders. We know them well, these gentlemen of "chivalrous honor." Their "high morale" is strikingly illustrated by Beauregard and Early, who have for years been assisting in robbing millions of poor men with the Louisiana lottery swindle. ' A New York paper is printing some jokes of a deceased funny man under the title "Posthumous Humor." Under' ordinary circumstances the jokes might possibly be highly amusing, but the label, "post humous," has a tendency to smooth out the n'miles. Because the New York funny papers killed the writer is no reason why they should deliberately kill his wit. The murderous attack made by the fe male convicts in the Kansas penitentiary upon the matron of their department is an unusual development of ferocity, even among the criminal classes. If the "equal rights" that Kansas women enjoy have this hardening effect upon them, the matter -ought to be investigated before the priv ileges are extended. The majority of Indiana Democrats are firm in the belief that the tornado which cavorted about through Wayne and Put nam couutics was nothing more nor less than an instrument of Divine wrath, sent to accomplish the destruction of the wicked and awful Colonel Dudley, but which, like the Indianapolis Democrats, somehow got lost in the shuffle. Free-traders claim that the poverty of Mexico is due to its high tariff, and the gold cranks blame it all on tho exclusive silver standard. Ordinary people of com mon sense know that the explanation lies in the remarkable laziness, ignorance and general shiftlessnessof the Mexican people. Ir is small wonder that Leon Abbett had; euch a handsome' majority as Governor of New Jersey. In one ballot-box in Jersey City were found fifty Democratic tissue ballots.

It is not strange, therefore, that he passes him by in opining "thatamid the crowds of able men, of gallant soldiers, and of clever statesmen whom the epoch of tho Ameri can civil war produced, the two men.

That is the problem to be settled, and. perhaps, the only way to hettlo it is for some one or 6ome few persons to begin a series of ex periments. Boston Herald. Ctvll-Srrrlce Reform.

The truth is. although the opponents of civil-service reform are never weary of ringing tho changes on the fact that the power of "dismissal is unimpaired, and that clerks hold ollice now by the same uncer tain tenure that they did in the old days, the eutire condition and sentiment of thinen is improved. A wteding-out pro cess has been going on for the last four years, but in that time it is th inefficient clerks who have gone; tho good ones stay on. No man now loses his place through his political atliliatious. If he makes a high average of work, he can vote any ticket ho pleases. He cannot, it is true, harry and bully his subordinates into giv ing money for political purposes, and he is not allowed to turn his division into polit ical headquarters, or make himself obnox ious to others by his politics; but he can vote and be a man if ho wants to.
