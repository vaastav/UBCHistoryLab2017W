Hog cholera seems to be still playing smash with farmers. One in Allen county, Kansas, has recently lost 1'54 head, worth $1,400, and attributes the disease to a carload of stock hogs shipped from the Kansas City stock yards to that county. If 3Ir. Sparks statement that his ex perience in the land office cost him $10,000 more than his salary of ?4,000 a year be true, it must be admitted that he is an uncommon sort of a Democrat, inasmuch as the line of policy pursued by him while in office was not calculated to augment the perquisites thereof. A number of farmers around Hills boro, Ills., acting on the advice of the State entomologist, are burning oft" their fields and wood pastures for the purpose destroying the myriads of chinch bugs that ruined the corn crop of last season. An effort is being made to make the burning general. The effects will be watched with interest next season. The questions that will be urged upon the attention of congress at the present k ssion, will be a demand for laws To pre vent food adulteration and for the suppres sion of the polygamy evil. There will be war upon adulteration and adultery. Troy Chief. On the contrary, from the bold, delib erate attempt of the president to ravish the country in the matter of revolution ising the tariff system, it woj".d se-'-m that such questions will be given little consideration. Now thai the -Republican National r nnmittee has named Chicago as the place for holding the national conven tion next year, the Eaoli: predicts that the Democrats will follow suite, but that the linal result following will be alto gether different from thai ensuing the like meetings at that place three and one-half years ago. Mark the predic tions. Mr. Cleveland is finding serious oppo sition to his tariff reform schemes from an unexpected quarter. The North Caro lina and "Virginia legislatures stoutly dc niaiid the repeal of the internal tax on tobacco and fruil brandy, two of the four articles the president suggested in his message should bear a large share of the burden of taxation. The reformers are evidently getting opinions as well as figures mixed. In order to put a stop to the unseem ly wrangle in the congregation of Ply mouth church, Brooklyn. X. Y., over the payment by the managers of the Bcecher monument undertaking of seven hun dred dollars to Doctor Parker as a return compliment for the delivery of the Beecher eulogiuin, the kind-hearted doc tor has presented to the said managers his check for the amount he received. This will settle (he controversy, but it w ill not alter the jKipuIar estimate of the penurious crowd. In his annual report the commissioner of agriculture recommends substantially the alxililion of the seed division of the department and the transfer of its duties to state eerimental stations. That was as-boldand daring an act as was the president's message on the tariff ques tion. But the commissioner may have some new scheme to suggest whereby the average lepresentutive in congress may keep himself solid Avith his constitu ents. If lie hasn't lie had best keep his head well uivW cover. Th London Time.-, lvjwrts the 'oegin nmg of an interesting experiment in "sumptuary legislation" on the inter national scale. The six powers lwrder ingon Ihf North Sea Great Britain. France. Belgium, Holland, Germany ruid Denmark have entered into an agree ment to attempt by concurrent IcgiHia tion and police-action to protect the poor North Sea fishermen against their great est enemy. Each for itself engages to forbid its fishermen to buy spirits or to barter their fis.h. nets, or other .gear for tin in: to forbid tho sale of spirits to any fl hernieu: to keep spirits off its North S-' trading craft by a system of strict licensure and inspection-, and to appro, priately punish offenders.

SKIN NEIGHBORS. t has been stated that the Cherokee nation of Lidians are the wealthiest com munity on the continent, and in view of their being made near neighbors to us by the extension of railroad lines into and through their country, the following data concerning their numbers, sources of wealth, relative to the general govern ment, local regulations, etc., which was obtained by a correspondent of the St. Louis Republican who recently made a visit to the Cherokee country, will be of especial interest to the readers of the Eagle. The correspondent says: The government of the United States owes the Cherokee nation $2,700,000, and the government pays it 5 per cent annual interest. Besides this the Cherokee Nation leases G,000.000 acres of hind to a cattle syndicate, tor wincii it receives $100,000 a year. In another year it Avill receive from this source not less than $2.30.000 yearly. Every person working in this nation not a citizen pays fifty cents a month for the privilege, and the man who employs tlie "foreigner' with out a p"nnit will be fined AfjO. This is a tariff that the more progressive and in telligent Cherokees are now kicking against, but it is maintained as a pro tection against invasion from abroad not so much to protect the home laborer as the liome government. From the in terest received from the United States, the rental of the Cherokee strip, the fines and license fees, the expenses of the Cherokee government is made up. The people's money is not stored up in the vaults of the treasury. Whenever there is a surplus, which is frequently, it is paid out per capita to the inhabitants. Cherokee citizenship at the present time is estimated lo be worth $7,000. The Cherokees own 11,000,000 acres of land in common, patented to the cor poration called the Government of the Cherokee Nation by the United States. This land is about the finest within the limits of the United States. Add to this the $2,700,000 in trust with the govern ment at " per cent, per annum interest, and you have an idea of the Cherokee estate. The population of the na tion is between 24.000 and 25,000. If the system of holding land in common should be abolished and an allotment of land and other property should ensue, it cail be seen that each Cherokee would be an heir for a hand some dividend. But they have no idea of alloting their lands. 'They can now own all the improvements they make, and every citizen can fence in and till as much lanu as he reels disposed to. J le cannot fence in land, however, unless he cultivate it. Jf he ceases cultivating for two years he must tear the fence down, or it will be torn down for him at his expense. There are 5.000.000 acres reserved to the population and G.000.000 acres leased. A 

HARMLESS SENSATION. Cincinnati Commercial Giinelt?. Two hundred years ago in China there was just such a craze about natural gas as we have in this country today. Gas wells were sunk with as much vim and vigor as the celestials were capable of. but owing to a gas explosion that killed several millions of people, and tore up anil destroyed a large district of country, leaving a large inland sea, known on the maps as Lake Eoo Chang, the boring of any more gas wells was then and there prohibited 03- law. It seems, according to Chinese history, that many large high pressure gas wells were sunk quite near to each other. Gas was lighted as soon as struck, as is done in this country. It is stated that one well with its usual pressure, by induction or back draught pulled down into earth the burning gas of a smaller well, result ing 111 a tirendim explosion of a large dis trict, destroying the inhabitants thereof. Lake Foo Chang rets on this disliict. The same catastrophe is imminent in this country unless the laws restrict further developement in boring so many wclis. Should a similar explosion occur there will be such an upheaval as will dwarf the mot terrible earthquake ever known. The country along the gas belt from Toledo through Oluc, Indiana, and Kentuckv will be ripped no to the depth of 1.200 to l.oUOfeet, and' flopped over like a pancake. leaving a chasm through which Lake Erie will come how ling down, filling the Mississippi valleys, and bloUing them out forever. The catastrophes alleged to have oc curred in the Orient are too far removed, both by distance and time to have the effect of deterring boring operations in this country. American enterprise is not of the sort to be hinder ed in its researches and efforts at mater ial development by such Munchausen narratives as i he Gazette's. The people of this country have discovered that sources of great wealth lie buried beneath us, ;ttid while there is a liberal degree of superstition posscy bd by all ihey are always willing to take their chances m provoking a catastrophe. The movement inaugurated some time ago to erect a monument to (lie memory of Gen. U. S. Grant has been sadly lag ging for quite a while, and it was thought bv some that the defeat of Col. Fred Grant at the recent election would not liavc the effect to revive interest in the movement: but it has received fresh impetus from an unexpected quarter. The announcement is made that a small boy in that city proposes that out of liis own earnings he will pay the sum of ten cents a week to the monument fund. The city papers are not only commend ing this example to other boys but point ing a moral for older heads, which it is hoped will icsult in securing the requis ite amount to complete the undertaking. The name of the little patriot mentioned is Morris P. Joachim. - It is stated as a fact that Minister Phelps last summer was on the very point of obtaining from the British cabi net such concessions with regard to the interpretation of the treaty of 181S as would have put a stop to the Canadian harrying of our fishermen, when an ultra-amiable dispatch from Secretary Bayard arrived and spoiled everything. A responsible newspaper has "quoted a member of congress just back from England as making assertions to that effect. Tojeka Journal: With the senator of great uusiness eye to tiie lit interests of !

Kausa luis ever fortcnxl, and concerning . one which is uoav attracting attention j not only in Kansas, but over the whole country. j A GOVERNMENT TELEGRAPH. The question of the general govern ment assuming control of the telegraph service of the country, or at least of es tablishing a telegraph system in connec tion with the postal service seems to be attracting the attention of the news papers of the country and is being dis cussed quite extensively, very many fa voring the proposition upon the theory that it would give the people generally I cheaper rates for their private business and the press better facilities for obtain ing news and at less cost to publishers. "We have heretofore briefly referred lo the matter and expressed disapproval of the scheme because we think it imprac ticable for the accomplishment of the ends claimed for it. A correspondent of the Chicago Times discusses the question in extenso in that paper and very clearly points out main' of the more objection able features, a part of which we submit herewith: Tiie low rates so glibly claimed in con nection with this scheme are not low rates in reality, for wherever govern ment telegraphs have been tried a large annual deficit is shown and the people pay it in taxes. In other words, the boards of trade, stock exchanges and speculators generally pay a part of the cost of each telegram they .send, the re mainder being collected (in taxation) from the farmer, tradesman, and others who rarely have occasion to use the tele graph at all. England has tried .this experiment for seventeen years, and the last official re port of its postmaster general shows an increasing annual deficit for seven 3-ears. which last year reached 2,349.200. He adds: "Notwithstanding the rapid satisfactory- growth of the telegraph business the expenses of the service far exceed the receipts.-' It appears, then, that whatever other advantages a government telegraph might bring, economy is not one of them. The following comparisons are taken from the last official reports of the post master general of Gieat Britain and the Western Union Telegraph company alone, not including its late purchase of the Baltimore & Ohio Teleirraph com pany: Great Britain, 20.S!. miles of poles; Western Union, 1 "1G.S14 miles of poles: Great Britain, 17o,.j3'J miles of wires; Western Union, .12-i.GU mile3 of wires: Great Britain, 0,514 offices to sup port, including railway stations: West ern Union, 15,058 offices to support, in cluding railway stations. The dense population, immense com merce, -and strict laws of Great Britain forbidding trespassing upon railway grounds (along which nearly all tele graph lines are constructed) all favor not only a large telegraph traffic, but much cheaper maintenance than is the case in this country, and if, with all these advan tag 's. and their telegraph plant so much less extensive than oura, their annual deficit is ii"arly two and a half million dollars, what would ours, witli its long lines of communication to be kept up througli comparatively thinly-populated regions. Le.J Bearing in mind that the annual deficit in our postofiice depart ment proper is already over s?5.,000,000, can we afford to increase it as much as this government telegraph scheme would require? It ma be asked, if the Western Union can handle the telegraph business of this country without loss, why the govern ment can not. Many other reasons could be given, but private enterprises are always watched closer and conducted with more econo my than ere those, of governments. The telegraph itself was a success in England under control of private corporations, but certainly can not be so considered now financially, nor as to its service, if the statements of the majority of American business men who ' have used the telegraph there are correct. Take our present mail service. Each railroad h;is a different contract for its haul. Each transfer point has another contractor to transfer it from depot to depot, ami it finally reaches the post ofiice in a contractor's wagon. If our mail service today was in t lie hands of private corporations, does anyone doubt that it would be vastly improved? If the telegraph service of this country is ever monopolized by the government, it will be handled by contractors: not simply for the benefit of their health, but to make all the money out of it they can, and the taxpayers, who use the tel egraph least, will fool the bills. Our government has donated lands and even money in some instances to aid in the development of new country, but the brains to plan and energy "to carry through all of our great enter prises have invariabh- been furnish ed by private corporations, with perhaps rhe single exception of our great navy. Probably an equal expenditure upon a government tele graph might make it an equal success. The cry of "monopoly" raised against the Western Union is false, because it is not a monopoly according to the diction aries: and 'foolish, because each would-be rival that it gobbles adds to its facilities for handling dispatches, and the dreaded increase in rates has never yet material ized. On the contrary, its rales are con stantly lx?ing decreased, as a careful and thorough investigation at any office in the country will show. Government telegraph- would bring with it increased taxation of the farmer, mechanic, tradesmen and people gt ner aily who use it but little or not at all. for the almost exclusive benefit of specula tors who use it most, and who now are obliged to pay their own telegraph bills. There are several such in Chicago alone, whose telegraphing costs them from 10.000 to $00,000 per annum. Knowing its uncertainties, the best operators would leave the service as op portunities offered, their places being tilled by those with jnore experience in politics than in telegraphy. The temptation to government em ployes of calting attention to those over them to dispatches' pertaining to plans bi rival political parties would be too great, and uch betrayals being at least ! not discouraged would tend to lessen the inviolability of even com-, mercial telegrams. In this connec- j tion it should he remembered that ' foreign countries having government ' telegraphs are kingdoms, the appointing i ixnvers of which are unchanged through ! fire, therefore the temptation to divulge tle contents of political telegrams for the jmrpose of securing or retaining government situations does not exist. Our government is supposed to foster, j and protect the legitimate industries of J it-citizens. For it to go into the lvM-' ness of telegraphy i must do one of j three things : Purchase existing tele-1 graph lines at a fair price, which would I call for an investment of about ltX),- j 000.001): enter into an unfair competition. ; with the avowed and legalized purpose j ot rumuig the present tetezrnnh orce the public to ac- :-teui bv which the pres- telegraph comjiaaies (no tempatation for further competition! would coatiime j 10 periorra uie same service ineA- ao, i but -without liabilitv for errors, and with- j out simulant or Wesrarv to further j quicken and imorove the service. , The cnuntrv umot afford the mouev for first: still lei can it afford th dflibnor j of the second; and the third avouW ad-j A-ance tho service backward more rapid-! lv than it ever improved. ' "You pav$ A-our mouev and vou taJ;J j vour cboice.'!" Don Carlos, the noted Spanish bour bon, is said to have laid claim, to the (throne of France. Don's calculations were made a little too previous. Ho took it for granted that a change of rulers would involve a cliange of form J of government, just as a great many other people believed, but the principles of are publican form of government proved to be too deeply rooted in the people to ad mit of such cliange, and the succession to the presidency of the French republic was accomplished amid the acclaims of the multitudes of "vive la republique.'" At present the chances for preferment to a station of royalty cannot be said to be very flattering. Even liis own coun try only wants a convenient opportunity to follow the example of their neighbors north of the Pyrennes in the matter of changing their form of government. In commenting upon the Eagle's ar ticle of a few days ago on "Oklahoma and Wichita," which it transfers to its columns, the Caldwell Journal says: "The Eagle points lo many advantages that that city will derive from the open ing up of that country to settlement, and Wichita will derive all the benefits if the citizens along the border quietly fold their hands and wait for something to turn up' that will benefit them."' The Journal further sa3s: "Kansas will be the place where every bushel of corn, oats, flour and provisions of all kinds must come from for "two or three years, at least, to supply the people of that country until they "are self-supporting.'' The paper also improves the occasion to point a business moral for the benefit of its own town. THE 

GRAIN STATUS. K. C. Live Stock Indicator. The condition of the market for the cereals has been a vexed question for months with those who are interested therein, and the feeling of despondency has not been greater among cattle raisers than grain producers. The small crops of wheat and corn, the past two years, in Kansas, have not had the influence upon the markets of the world that those who imagine, or appear to iniagme, that all of the supplies come from their con tiguous counties or states, expected. This is a much bigger country than many apparently realize and it is only the cos mopolitan in business matters who can grasp the situation. But be that as it may there is at the present time, to all appearances, an up Avard tendency in the values of the cereals as there is in those of cattle. Whether they have'eome to stay is an other question and one which time alone can answer. The rapid advance recently in atJucs not so much from day to day but so grad ually as to gain a foothold, has not been unexpected bA- mam' and with the sur- 1 roundings there are grounds for hope that a retrograde movement, if one should take place. Avould not be permanent. Those Avho read carefully, week after week, the report of grain in sight at the principal points of accumulation, at lake and sea board ports, and in transit by rail and Avater. cannot but be im pressed AA-ith the difference in the supply of Avheat and corn on hand this year, and the corresponding time last, as Avill be observed from the folloAving reports on NoA-ember 19 and 28, 1887, and same tune last year: Wheat. ..')S,S71,!t."G .. 511,551 ,:ri ..40,215,021 . .00,142,541' Corn. a,570,sS-l 12,2S0,40S 7,053,132 12,074,140 November If), 'ST. 20.

If there is anything in the Liaa- of sup ply and demand, unless -the demand Ironi certain quaiters is likely to be cur tailed in proportion to the supply, then most assuredly must prices keep up. until they get to a point Avhere con sumption may be reduced. There is one fact, of Avhich there can be no doubt, and it is. thai good, healthy markets are practically assured. The strong market for corn means better prices for'hogs and cattle and the shrewd feeders are economizing Avith their corn and utilizing it to the best advantage. YvTe can. however, only deal with facts as Are find them, for there are so many contingencies which may arise to change the condition o! markets, that with values, as Avith other things in life, no one knows Avhat a day may bring forth. The New York Produce Exchange Re porter, of last Saturday, referring to the Avheat market, says: This has been a Aveek of great excite ment in this cereal all OA-er the country: the speciilatiA-e fever has at times reached a great height: the great 'booin" in corn contributing to the ac tivity and 'buoyancA'. The fall ing off in farmers" deliveries and the great fall in temperature, have been elements of strength that made buyers confident, and they, as a rule, have man heated a determination to stand by their convictions, and it is very plain that the operators this weel: are not easily f'right eued. Corn at Chicago for MaA- at 55c calls for $1.00 to $1.0:3 for No. 2 wheat and tin's is a good common sense a-Jcav of the situation. The dealings in May have rarely been exceeded since Ave com menced operating in futures. The atl vance in thai month has been ' l-2c, Avhile the earlier months have advanced only 'jC. Private, mail and cable advices from Liverpool are of interest, stocks there are redueed and for the month thoy are C50.000 bushels off, and promise to fail much lower this month. Tiie quantity of wheat now on passage for Europe is verv small, but at some ad- A-.mce in prices the output from this coast Avould be fair. A
