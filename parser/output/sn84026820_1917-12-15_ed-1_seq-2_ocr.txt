_ IMA, .TB Rj*ft 308?' I German Govern ment Impossible League of Honor in no ,9( - ff : * •* t > in Dec. 4.—President Wil spMrashington, •08 delivered to Congress an address, eaasidered so important in its rela tions to International affairs, that it has been transmitted in advance to the Government to. practically every ether capitol in the world. Immediate declaration of war against Austria-Hungary was recommended'by President Wilson. The President did not, however, recommend a declaration of war affainst Turkey and Bulgaria at this P< \ m - 18 Tfhe President spoke, as follows; lernen of the Congress: 1 Eight months have elapsed since I last the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of immense and grave sig nificance for us. I shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize those it it ,to 1 > events. , The practical particulars of the' part we have played in them will be laid be fore you in the reports of the executive departments. 1 shall discuss only our présent outlook upon those vast af fairs, our present duties and the im mediate means of accomplishing the • abjects we shall hold always In view. "Our Object Is To Win the War." I shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our ob-' jectives and the measures by which'we mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here in this place is action and our action must move ■traight toward definite aims. Our object is, of course, to win the war and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question, When shall we consider the war won? From one point of view it is not * necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do npt doubt that the Ameri-. ean people-know what the tvar is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their pur in It As ^ nation we are united b spirit and intention. Ip Let Dissenters Strut Their Uneasy I Hours." Ii pay little heed to those who tell K otherwise. I hear the voices of ^went; who does not? I hear the IHiclsm and the clamor of the noisy, ^B^htless and troublesome. I also men here and there fling them Ks in impotent disloyalty against in calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way w? may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. But from another point of view I believe that it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the set tlement of its searching issues. W T e are the spokesmen of the American people and they have a right to know whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of •vil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and render it impossible and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what action we pro pose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of com promise — deeply and indignantly im patient—but they will be equally im patient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are planning for in seek ing to make conquest of peace by arms. I »ose "This Intolerable Thing—Must Be Crushed." » I believe that I speak for them, when 1 say two things: First, that this intolerable thing of which the mas ters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of combined in trigue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a thing without conscience or honor or capac ity for covenanted peace must be crushed and, if it be not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly Intercourse of the nations; and second, that when this thing and its power are indeed defeat ed and the time comes that we can discuss peace—when the German peo ple have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be 

SENT ALL OVER THE WORLD All Known Means Of Communication To Spread The Message. New York.—President Wilson's ad dress to Congress was heralded throughout the world by the United Btates Government. The achievement is regarded as probably the greatest publicity fèat ever undertaken. Dis tribution of the message abroad was personally directed from this city by George Creel, chairman of the Com ■Uttoe on Public Inf carnation. »V.

BdTfljie fact that a wrong use has been inside of a just idea is no reason why a right use should not be made of it It ovight to be brought under the patronage of Its real friends. Let it be said ajgaln that autocracy must first be showin the utter futility of its claims ,power or to leadership in the modern World It is Impossible to ap ply any standard of justice so long as such torces are unchecked and unde feated as the present masters of Ger many command. Not until that has been done can right be set up as arbiter and peace maker among the nations. But when that has been dune—as, God, willing, it assuredly will be—we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing and this is the time to avow onr pur pose to do it. We shall be free to base pefece on generosity and justice, ,to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the vic tors. A be af im the us ob-' is the is not tell of the the the I for the and I say of and set T e of the runs pro who com im im it are by Our Task Is To Win the War. Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is to win the war, and nothing shall tarn us aside from it until it Is accom plished. Every power and resource we possess, (whether of men, of money dr of materials, is being devoted and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until it is achieved. Those who desire to bring peace about before that purpose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice else where. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a set tlement based upon justice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They hale done a wrong to Belgium ft be repaired. They have which mu established a power over other lands and peoples than their own—over the great Empire of Austria-Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan States, over Tur key and within Asia—which must be relinquished. Teuton Ailles Must Be Liberated. Germany's success by skill, by in 1 dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and in fluence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and tlje initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to estab lish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoj /s of Bel gium and No'thern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peo ples of the Balkans and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia, from the impudent and alien domina tion of the Prussian military and com mercial autocracy. Does Not Wish To Meddle In Austria. We owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange the Austro Hungarian Em;.ire. It is no affair of ours what they do with their owii life, either industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands in all matters, great or small. \ÿe shall hope to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish Em pire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own fortunes secure against oppression or injustice and from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. this mas the in so thing be out the this can peo we the be X, Nearly every known means of com munication—express train, telephone, telegram, wireless and submarine cable—was utilized in transmitting the address. While an operator In New York was clicking off its text on a trans-corftinental wire direct to San Francisco, where it was imme diately relayed to the Orient,.another at his side was sending a Spanish translation to Colon, Panama Canal Zone, from where it radiated through-1 out Central and Southern American ad Dis was by Com capitals. . It Is estimated approximately 16, saci a any am V'v'-■Pwbom they now per BHJPIws and to act aa their Butera that they are fighting for the Very !fTe and existence of their em pire, a war àt desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Noth ing could be more grossly nr wantonly false, and we must seek to the utmost openness and candor As to oûr real alms to convince them of its false to of ness. ; V- - ' * : We are, in fact, denting fe* their emancipation from fear, along with our own, from the fear aa well as from the fact of nnjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world em pire. No one is threatening the exist ence or the independence of the peace ful enterprise of the German Empire. The worst that can happen to the detriment of the German people Is this, that if they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace of the world, men or, classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could hot trust, it might be impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations, which must henceforth guar antee the world's peace. "Must Be Partnership Of All Peoples.!* That partnership must be a partner ship of peoples, not a mere partner ship of Governments. It might be im possible, also, In such untoward cir cumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic intercourse, which must inevitably spring, out of the other part nerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that, and such a situation, inevitable because of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner «r later cure Itself by processes which would assuredly set in. | I ' of it Wrongs Must Be Righted. The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be righted. That, of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. The world will not permit the commission of simi lar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. Statesmen must by this time have learned that the opin ion of the world is everywhere wide awake and fully comprehends the is sues' involved. No representative of any self-governed nation will dare dis regard it by attempting any such cov enants of selfishness and compromise as were entered into at the Congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is the air pll Governments must henceforth breathe if they would live, No Opinions Of Their Own. It is in the full disclosing light or that thought that all policies must be conceived and executed in this mid day hour of the world's life. German rulers have been able to upset the peace of the world only be cause the fered undeF their tutelage to share the comradeship of the other peoples of the world, either in thought or pur pose. They were allowed to have no opin ion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exercised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the hearts and con sciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run with those tides. All these things have been true from the very beginning of this stupendous war; and I cannot help thinking that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and en thusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the Allies, suspicion and dis trust swept away and a real and last ing union of purpose effected. Russian People Poisoned By Lies. Had they believed these things from the very moment of their revolution, and had they been confirmed in that belief since, the sad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable governmènt of free men might have been avoided. The Russian peo ple have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison has been administered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly, nor too often. From every point of view, therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the Sen ate in January. Our entrance into the war has not altered our attitude to ward the settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in Jan uary that the nations of the world L were entitled not only to free path ways upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to those path ways, I was thinking, and I am think ing now, not of the smaller gnd weaker nations alone, which need our counten ance and support, but also of the great and powerful nations, and of our pres ent enemies as well as our present as sociates in the war. ■rman people were not suf 1 of of to to of to to or for a j 000 miles of telegraph and cable wires were called into use in transmitting the message. In to as a precaution against contents of the message becoming public pre maturely. Upon receiving word from Was Chairman Creel received a copy of the address in this city by special courier from Washington. A corps of typists was put at work in a locked room to make duplicate copies. M&an : while, in an adjoining room, it was being translated into French and Spanish.

Ohe very -embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at " with Germany, but not writh her 1 r I therefore very earnestly mend that the Congress imme diately declare the- United States ip/ a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does it seem strange to yon that this i ii : Is of W4ir allies. should be the conclusion ment I have just addra It is not. It is, inf act^ logic of what I havj^ Hungary is for the own mistress, but simply the vassal of the German Government We must faca the-touts as they are and act upon theea without Sentiment in this stern business. The Government of Aus tria-Hungary is not acting upon its own initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its own peoples, but as the instrument of another nation. "Turkey and Bulgaria Also Germany's Tools. We must meet its force with our own i-nd regard the Central Powers as but one. The war can be successfully conducted in no other way. The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They also are the tools of Germany. Bui they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our neces | sary action. I We shall go wherever t the neces ' sities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where immedfate and practical considerations lead us, and not heed any others. The financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest themselves as the war and its under takings develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seems to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy. It will be necessary to extend In cer tain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies : and also necessary, I believe, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and depar ture of all persons into and from the United States. To Restrain Female As Well'As Male Enemies. Legislation should be enacted defin ing as a criminal offense every wilful violation of the Presidential proclama tion relating toalien enemies promul gated under SWtion 4067 of the Re vised Statutes and providing appro priate punishment; and woiben as well as men should be included under the terms of the acts plachg restraints upon alien enemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be wiping to be fed and housed at the expense of the Government in the detention camps and it would be the _ purpose of the legislation I have sug gested to confine offenders among them in penitentiaries and other similar in stitutions where they could be made to work as other criminals do.
