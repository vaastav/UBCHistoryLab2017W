IIOOGS MONDAY I Congress i Opens Today 9 have been discussing this matter Since long before the election, though since the election there has been a growing belief that fewer matters will receive consideration than was generally expected in the weeks just before the election. Among the subjects of which mere is less hope now than there was a while ago is tariff revision. According to a leading and well-informed paper, which in this expresses what other well-informed papers believe: "Republican talk of revision is coming to be classed among the hardy annuals of political topics. Some persons of buoyant temper ament profess to believe that the party in power will take some heed of the lessons of the recent election and allow tariff revision to be ' talked on the floor of Congress tliis winter without inflicting- any dis cipline on the members who are bold enough to proclaim their belief ibat the existing schedules should be lowered. "The -most that can be hopeu for now is that the President will get the consent of the party; leauers to proclaim himself in his mes sage in favor of a modification oi the Dingley duties. Mr. Roosevelt puce put such a paragraph in a message,and then struck it out at .the earnest solicitation of'Speaker Cannon and other "standpatters." "Last November there was more talk of tariff revision in Wash ington than there is now, and the way seemed prepared for legislation, but nothing came of the talk, aow representative Republicans anu v party organs are expressing the oelief that the time has "nearly ar rived" when something must be clone to readjust existing inequalities under the Dingley law. They reason that the coming short session ,wj1I not have .time enough, and that the eve of a presidential election jjj not the proper time for going into such a matter. , "The regular long session ot the Sixtieth Congress, they say, will not be the time, because it might interfere with the congressional elec tions of 1908. This is the same policy of delay that has been in opera tion since the spread of the tantf revision sentiment throughout the country. The real leaders of the Republican party are no more in clined now to make changes than they were two years ago. There is nothing to show that the Republican party will lower or readjust the existing tariff duties until it sees defeat staring it in the face. The session b.cgmning in 1909 is the earliest probable date for tariff re form.' Opinions' 'differ as to what subjects will be taken up by Congress at this session. Some maintain that only the necessary appropriation uij, U1a wm passeu, anu mat tnc bmoot case will be used to give members a chance to talk. Others hold that Congress will not be content with this program, but will endeavor to work through a mass of important legislation in the three months of the session. One man's guess is as good as another's. There seems however to be a general consensus of opinion that President Roosevelt is expected in his message to recommend more drastic immigration laws than are embodied in the measure now be fore Congress. The bill has in it an educational provision, inserted by the Senate, which provides that all adult immigrants must be able to read and write. If the President should urge that the reading and writing clause be retained, the conferees on the part of the House may agree to leave the Senate's educational clause as it stands. Organized labor was in favor of the education test, and so were citizens who have been looking with apprehension upon the hordes of illiterates that for years in rapidly increasing numbers have been com ing from southern Europe. The opposition to the educational section ot the bill came largely from representatives of the great transporta tion lines, who saw a loss of immigration, and from men who feared that the Russian Jews, flying from persecution and massacre, might hnd the gates of safety closed. This immigration matter is formidable. (Many sections of the North are anxious to get rid of the undesirable foreigners. They can not get rid of them, but they can, if aided, prevent their further in crease. The South wants white immigration of only one kind, that from the British Isles and from northern Europe. With the Presi dent's backing, many Representatives will vote for the educational' test. Next to tariff revision, which is unlikely to be touched, and immi gration, which may go through, comes currency reform. The best opinion is that nothing will be done in this direction this winter, not withstanding the substantial agreement of business and financial todies and Treasury officials on a plan of relief. &0O&xy2QOOCQ0QGQOQQQ-?

In a new community, in the bubble and mushroom settle ments of new countries, whether the lure thither be gold or grazing, utility is the sole consideration in thc early construction. It is not so because there is entire lack either of sentiment or taste. -But it is largely so because the sense of permanence is wanting in thc first set tlers of a community, with rare exceptions. In most cases there is the thought of speedily securing a competence and returning to the old home, or to the Fatherland. The Britons of Australia, of even the third and fourth generation, speak of England as "home." And colonists the world over have the same feeling. It probably disap pears much more quickly where the colonist is amalgamated iiito a population speaking a language different from the mother tongue. The sense of transitoriness continues in thc newly arriving indi v'thial long after it has given place to that of permanence in the com munity. There is a feeling that the "old home" is the permanent home. But this wears off with thc individual as with the community, and the evidence of it in the community is the growing desire for those symbols of permanence which architecture, rightly so called, and monuments, furnish. The enlargement of St. Andrew's 'Cathedral is an expression of the sense of permanence as well as an evidence of growth. More distinctly is the proposal of the family of thc late Theophilus H. Davies to erect a parish house as a memorial to him, an evidence of this sense of per manence. The suggestion of a tower for the cathedral as a memorial to the late Mrs. Mackintosh, which has undoubtedly taken a strong
