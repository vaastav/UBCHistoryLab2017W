Winter’s outlook promises cheap coal and plenty of it. A large force is at work grading the Texas and Pacific from Fort Worth to Weatherford. Hon. John S. Potter, the American consul at Wurtemburg, makes a report to the state department by which it ap pears that 30,000 Americans go to Eu rope annually. A rumor recently circulated to the effect that Senator Christiancy, of Mich igan was rapidly failing, both physically and mentally, is authoritatively pro nounced sensational and untrue. Mexico has four presidential candi dates, and not one of them a general. Three are lawyers, and one a coffee planter. The election takes place in 1880. Thirty or forty brigadiers may pop up before election day. It was Gen. Josiah Harlan, a native of Philadelphia, who once commanded the army of Dost Mahomed, ameer of Cabul. He returned to this country after twenty-five years’ absence, and published a book concerning the politi cal state of India and Afghanistan. During our civil war he served as colo nel of the Eleventh Pennsylvania cav alry, until the ills caused by advanced age compelled his resignation. He died at San Francisco in 1871, at the age of seventy-six. The Toronto Globe does not believe that disaster will befall the British troops in Khyber pass, but says: “If a heavy disaster should befall the British troops, it would be far more likely to occur during the march in the difficult passes beyond Jellalabad. It was in these passes that the fearful massacre of 1842 w*as perpetrated. If the Brhisb should be defeated in an assault upon Cabul, and then should find the passes through which they would have to re treat on Jellalabad occupied in forc6, the Cabul massacre might be repeated. There are several close contests for the legislature in Missouri. In Adair county the successful candidate has a majority of only 6; in Hickory county the majority is 7, in Lewis count}' 5, in Phelps county 9, in Shannon county 1; in fifteen other counties the majority is less that 50, and in seventeen others less than 100. There are 27 democrats, 5 republicans, and 2 greenback democrats in the senate, and 101. democrats, 13 re publicans, 5 greenback democrats, 6 greenback republicans, 9 independent democrats, 2 independent republicans, and 7 greenbackers in the house. The will of Thomas H. Powers, the fever and ague millionaire of Philadel phia, contains public bequests as fol lows: An annuity of $3,000 to the How ard Hospital and Infirmary for Incura bles fos ten years; an annuity of $4,000 to the sustenation fund of the Reform ed Episcopal church for twenty years; a twelfth interest in his residuary e-tate to the American Sunday-school union; a twelfth to the Howard hospital, and two-twelfths to the sustenation fund of the Reformed Episcopal church, these last three bequests being payable only on the failure of lineal descendants. Suleiman Pasha, who persisted in making a hopeless fight against the Rus sians at Schipka Pass, and who managed the retreat from Sophia, and was driven into the mountains by General Gourkho, has been degraded and sen tenced to imprisonment. His old co laborer and rival, Mehemet Ah, was killed by insurgents a few week ago. Moukhtar Pasha has been sent to Thessaly; and Osman Pasha, the de fender of Plevna, is supposed to exert considerable influence at Constanti nople. While Suleiman’s stubbornness crippled the then Commander-in-chief, Mehemet Ali, it made Osman the com ing man. The Princess Thyra, daughter of the king of Denmark, whose betrothal to the duke of Cumberland has been an nounced, is not so fortunate in a worldly sense, as her elder sisters. The foot of one,The princess of Wales, is ready to mount the throne of England. The other is but waiting the death of the czar to become the wife of the autocrat of all the Russias. Cumberland is a poor, propertyless fellow, “the disin herited heir to a kingdom that has dis appeared,” and while his relationship to the royal house of England assures him simple social recognition, it doesn’t lay in a winter stock of potatoes and things. Still, between England and Denmark, the Hanoverian will be able to make out a living. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. The following is a i.ill text of the president’s message read to the two houses of congress in joint session, Dec. 2nd; INTRODUCTORY. Fellow-citizen* of the Senate and House of Hepre eentative*: Ouf heartfelt gratitude is one to the Supreme r.elng who holds iu his hands the destinies of na tions. for the continued bestowal during 1 ast year of countless blessings upon our country. We are at peace with all other nations, our public credit has greatly improved and is perhaps now stronger than ever before; abundant harvests have reward ed the labors of those who till the soil; our man ufacturing industries are reviving and it is be lieved that the general prosperity which has been so long and anxiously looked for is at last wit hin our reach. YELLOW FEVER. The enjoyment of head h by our people generally has, however, been interrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions of the southern states, creating an emergency which called for prompt ami extraordinary measures of relief. The disease appeared as au epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the lower Mississippi soon after mid-summer, it was rapidly spread by fugi tives from the infected cities and towns and aid not disappear until early in November. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have suf fered severely. About one hundred thousand cases are believed to have occurred, of which about 20,- 000, according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible to estimate, with any ap proach to accuracy, the loss to the country occa sioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by hundreds of millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepest sympathy in all parts or the union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to the as sistance of the afflicted communities. Contribu tions of money and supplies In every needed form were speedily and generously furnished. The gov ernment w as* able to respond in some measure to the call for help bv providing tents, medicines and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite direc tions for the purpose being given iu the confident expectation that this action oi the executive would receive the sanction of congress. About eighteen hundred tents and rations of the value of about 35,000 dollars were sent to cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be fur nished to congress by the proper department. The fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general public sentiment in favor of a nation al sanitary commission w hich shall not only control quarantine, but have sanitary supervision of inter national commerce in times of epidemic, and hold an advisory relation to state and municipal health authorities, with power to ileal with whatever en dangers the public health and which the muni cipal and state authorities are unable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April‘29th 1878 which was passed too late in last session of congress to provide the means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season.is a step in the direction here indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures by quar antine and otherwise for the'protectlon of our sea ports and the country generally from this and other epidemics it is recommended that congress give to the whoie subject early and careful consid eration. THE SOUTHERX QUESTION. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens in every civil and political right, continues tojbe of paramount interest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction is welcomed with public ap proval and every interruption of steady and uni form progress to the desired consummation awakens general uneasiness and wide-spread con demnation. The recent congressional elections have furnished a direct and ti list worthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical establish ment of the right of suffrage, secured by the con stitution to the liberated race in the south ern states. All disturbing influences real or imaginary had been removed from all of these states. The constitutional amendments, which con ferred freedom and equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the bouth, were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizen who maintained the authority of na tional government and the integrity and perpetuity of the union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the just results of the war. The people of the former slave-holding states accepted these results and g ive in every practicable form assurance that the 13th, 14th and loth amendments and laws passed in pur suance thereof should, in good faith, be enforced rig idly and .impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the’ humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, should, under them, receive full and eqtu 1 protection in person and property and in po litical rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments the southern section of the union ob tained a large increase of political power in congress and in the electoral college, and the country justly ex pected that elections would proceed as to the en franchised race upon the conditions of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which obtained in all the other states of the union. The friends of law and order looked forward to the conduct of these elections as offering to the general judgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the de gree in which the right of suffrage cc-nld be exercised by the colored people and would be respected by their fellow citizens; but a more general enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by colored people and a more just and generous protection of that freedom by the communities of which they form apart were general ly anticipated than the record of the elections dis closes;. In some of these states in which the colored people have been unable to make their opinions felt in elections,the result is mainly due to influences not easily measured remedied by legal protection, but tn the states of Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular congressional districts outside of those states, the records of the elections seem to compel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden and their parti cipation in the elections not permitted to be either general or free. It will be for the congress for which these elections were had to make such examinations into their conduct as may be appropn de to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. Mean while it becomes the duty of the executive and judicial departments of tne government, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have oc curred. I can but repeat what I said in this con neclion in my last message; that whatever au thority rests with me to this end 1 shall not hesi tate to pul forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the conns, the executive authorities, and the people of the states where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance towards bringing to jus tice the offenders, and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a lull and fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty. It is to be observed that the principal appropri ation made for the department of justice at the last session contained the following clause: “and for defraying the expense which may be incurred in the enforcement of tho act approved February 28, 1871, entitled an act to amend an act approved May 30th, 1870, entitled an act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several slates of the union, and for other pur poses, or any acts amendatory thereof or supple mentary thereto.” It is the opinion of the attorney general that the expenses of these pro ceedings will largely exceed the amount which w as thus provided and I rely confidently upon con gress to make adequate appropriations to enable rhe executive department to enforce the laws. I respectfully urge upon your attention that the con gressional elections in every district is in a very im portant sense are justly a matter of political in terest and concern t .irous'hout the whole country. Each state and every political party is entitled to a share of the pov er which is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every citizen possessing tiie qualifications pre scribed by law r to cast one unintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as w ell as formally submission to the results of suffrage will he accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the de partments of government will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. Notemporarv or administrative interests of government, how ever urgent or weightv, will ever displace the zeal of our people in the defense of the primary i ights of cit zensnip; they understand that the protec tion of liberty" requires the nifintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of free speech, free press and free suffrage, and will sustain the full authority of the government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights. The material progress and welfare of the States depend on the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace Avithout such protection, no prosperity Avithout peace, and the whole country is deeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts. While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and reciprocal confidence be tvreen the communities so lately and so seriously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and Avith in creasing force the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices and ail sectional or state attachments in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of a cith.en of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations Avith other countries continue peaceful; our neutrality in the contests between foreign powers has been maintained and re spected. THE PARIS EXPOSITION. Tho universal exposition held at Paris during the past summer, has been attended by large num bers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the appointment and arrangement of contri butions of our citizens to this great exposition was well employed in energetic and judicious ef forts to overcome ibis disadvantage. These ef forts, led and directed by the commissioner-gen eral, were remarkably successful, and the exhi bition of the products of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the U, IS. commissioners, giving its results in delail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international competi tion tor the favor and the trade of the world may be expected to produce useful and important re sults m promoting intercourse, friendship and commerce with other nations. THE INTERNATIONAL SILVER CONFERENCE. In accordance with the provisions of the act of congress of Feb. 28, 1878, three commissioners were appointed to an international conference on the subject ot adopting a common rate between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing, internationally, the use of bimetallic money and securing fixity of relative value between these metals. Invitations were ad dressed to the various governments which had ex pressed a willingness to participate in its delibera tions. The conference had its meeting in Earls in August last. The i eport of the commissioners here with submitted will show its results. No common rates between gold and silver could lie agreed upon by t lie conference. The general conclusion was readied that it is necessary to.niaiutaiii In the world Hie monetary functions of silver as well as of gold. leaving the selection of the use of one or the other cf these two metals or of both to be made by eacli state. THAT LITTLE $5,500,000. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 to pay the award of the joint commission at Halifax; its after correspondence with the British government.on the subject of the conformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submitted to the commission, the president shaft deem It his duty to make the payment. Com munications upon these points were addressed to the British government through the legation of theU. S. at London failing to obtain the concur rence of the British government in the views of this government respecting the award. 1 have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named with in the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds of the payment and a pro test against any other construction of the same. The correspondence upon this subject will belaid before you. END OF TUB CUBAN REBELLION. The Spanish government hasofficialiy announced the termination of the insurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that island. Confi dent expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity, which it is hoped may prove well founded. Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of property have been among the incidents of Hie long continued hos tilities. Some of these claims are iu process of ad justment by Spain and the others are promised early and careful consideration. TIIR TREATY WITH ITALY. The treaty made with Italy in regard io reciprocal consular privileges has been duly ratified and pro claimed. OTHER POWERS. No questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the European powers. THE JAPS. The Japanese government has been desirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and, it is understood, has addressed to each ol Hie treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view. The U. S. gov ernment has been inclined to regard the matter fa vorably. Whatever restrictions upon trade with Ja pan are found injurious to that people cannot but affect injuriously nations holding commercial inter course with them. Japan, uflet a long period of se clusion, lias, within the past few years, made rapid strides in the patli of enlightenment and progress, and not unreasonably is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilate I to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end lias been made which will bo submitted for the con sideration of tiie senate. THE CHINESE. After ;m interval of several years, the Chinese gov ernment lias again sent envoys to the United States. They have been received and a permanent legation is now established here by that government Jtis not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendly relations and re moving causes of difference. SAMOAN ISLANDS. The treaty with the Samoan Islands has been duly ratified and accepted on the part of both gov ernments and is now in operation and a survey and soundings of the harbor of Sego Pago have been made by a naval vessel of tho United States, with a view of the United States occupation as a naval sta tion, if found desirable to the Service. MEXICO. Since the resumption of diplomatic relal lons with Mexico, correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two governments, n non the various questions which at one time see*'* and to en danger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on tho border much has been done to repress and diminish t hem. The effective force bf United states troops on the Riot? ramie by a strict and faithful compliance with Instructions has done much to remove the source of dispute, ami it is now Ulid ustood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also maklngan energetic movement against marauding Indian tribes. This government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength in the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or pun ish incursions upon our territory. Reluctant to as sume any action or attitude for the control of these incursions by military movements acrosst he border not imperatively demanded for protection of lives and property of Our Own Citizens, 1 shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with the proper discharge of this plain duty, to recognize theabil ityof the Mexican government to restrain effect ively violations of our territory, it is proposed f o hold next year an internatlonafexhlldtion m Mex ico, and it is believed that t lie display of the agri cultural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend to a better understanding and in creased commercial intercourse between their people. SOUTH AMEJMUAN STATUS. With Brazil and the republics of Central and South America, some steps have been taken toward the.development of closer commercial intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Co lumbia and with Bol’via. A boundary question between the Argentine Republic and Paraguay, has been submitted by those govern ments for arbitration to the president of the United States, and I have, after careful examina tion, given a decision upon it. A naval expedi tion up the Amazon and Madeira rivers nas brought back information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. Alike expe dition is about visiting the coast of Alrica and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to the development of our foreign commerce have not only furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, but have stimulated to practical exertion the en terprise of our people. THE TREASURER’S REPORT. The report of the secretary of the treasury fur nished a detached statement of the operations of that department of the government and of the condition of the public finance. The ordinary rev enues from all sources for the fiscal year end ed June 30th, 1878, were $257,703,878.70. The or dinary expenditures for same period were $236,- 964,326 ; 50, leaving a surplus revenue for the year off 20,899,551.90. The receipts for the present fis cal year ending June 30, 1879, actual and esti mated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the Ist quarter commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389,743.43; estimated receipts for the remaining three-quar ters of the year, 8191,110,250.57. Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual acid estimated, $204,500,000. The expenditures for the same peri od will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual ex penditures, $73,344,573.27, and for the re maining three-quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $166,755,420.73, making a total expenditure of $210,100,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the jear ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated according to existing laws, will be $264,500,000, and the estimated or dinary expenditures for the same period will be $236,320,412 63, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of ex penditures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided lor by the act approved February 25, 1862, which provides that one per cent, of the entire debt of the Unit ed States shall be purchased or paid with each fiscal year to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compli ance with the conditions of the law. Jsy its terms, the public debt should have been reduced, be tween 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year, $518,361,806.28. The actual reduction of the as certained debt in that period has been $720,644 - 739.61, being in excess of the reduction require’d by the sinking fund act $202,282,933.33. The amount of the public debt, less cash in the treas ury Nov. 1, 1878, was $2,024,200,083.18, a reduc tion since the same date last year of $23,150,617.- 39. The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at lower rates of inter est is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent, bonds sold duiing the present year, prior to Nov. 23. 1878, is $100,270,900, and 6 per cent, bends, commonly known as 5 20s, to an equal amount have been, or will be, redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the department to place the 4 per cent, bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings, whether small or great, in these securities. The secretary of the treasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, and that through the postofflccs or other agents of the government, the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such invest ments. The best mode suggested is that the de partment be authorized to issue certificates of de posit of the denomination of $lO, hearing interest at the rate of 3 65 per cent, per annum, and con vertible at any time within one year after their issue into the 4 percent, bonds authorized oy the refunding act, and to be issued only in ex change for U. S. notes sent to the treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law, sup ported by suitable regulations, would enable any person, readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into an interest-bearing security of the United States, and the money so received could be applied to the rede nption of the 6 per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold dur ing the last fiscal year was $52,798,980; the coin age of silver dollars under the act passed Feu. 28, 1878, amounted to including one-third of Nov. 1878, $18,961,455, of which amount $4,984,947 are in circulation, and the balance $14,820,603 is still in the possession of the government. With re gard to the act under which the coinage of silver proceeds, it has been the purpose of the secretary to faithfully execute the law and to afford a fair trial to the measure. In the present financial condition of the country, I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will be best promoted by ab staining from all attempts to make radical changes in existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws ufl'ect ing it. and we may confidently expect that the re sumption of specie payments, which will take place at the, appointed time, will he successfully and easily maintained, and that it will lie follow ed by a healthful and enduring rivival of business prosperity, (live the inherent energies of our people and the boundless resources of our country a fair opportunity, and relief from the present difficulty will surely follow. THE All SIT. The report of the secretary of war shows that the army has been well and economically sup plied. and that our small force has been actively employed and has laithfully performed all the services required of it. The morals of the army has improved and the number of deserters has materially de creased during the year. The secretary recom mends that a pension lie granted to the widow of the late Lt Henry 11. Henner, 18th infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer Jr. M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of the sufferers iu the south from that disease; the establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of tne heroes of deceased officers as suggested by the paymaster-general: the adoption by congress of a plan for the publication of the records of t he war of the rebellion now being pre pared for that purpose; tiie increase of the extra per diem of soldier teachers employed in the post schools and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings for schools and libraries at the different posts; the repeal or amendment of the act of Juno 18th, 1*78; forbid ding the use of the army as a posse comitatusor otherwise for purpose of executing laws except in such cases and under such circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the constitution or by act of congress; the passage of a joint resolution of congress legalizing the issues of rations tents and medicines which were made for the relief of sufferers from yellow fever; that provisons be made for the erection of a fireproof building for Hie preservation of certain valuable records now constantly exposed to destruction by fire. These commendations are all commended to your favor able consideration.. TUB 

NAVY. The report of the secretary of the navy shows that the navy has improved during the last fiscal year. Work lias been done on 75 vessels ten of which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready for sea. Twoothers are in rapid progreess towards completion. The total expenditures of the year including the amount appropriated for the deficiency of the previous year were $lB 468,392,65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year exclusive of these deficit-sides were $13,306,914,08 or $7,671,991,80 less than those of the previous year and $1.938,977.74 less than the expenses including the deficiencies The estimates for the fiscal year ending .hmc fki, 1880, are $11,582,381.45, exceeding the appropriations of the present year only $33,949.75, which excess is occasioned by the demands of the naval academy and marine corps as explained iu the secretary’s report. 'Fhe appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14.528,131. TV, which, in the opinion of the secretary, will be ample for all the current expenses of tne department during the year. The amount drawn from the treasury from July 1, to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544.1 ), of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expen diture for that period $4,009,663.39, or $520,899,24 less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. THE 

POSTAL DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmaster-general embraces a detailed statement of the operations of the post office department. The expenditures of that de partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $14,165,0*4 48. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money order business and official stamps, were $28,277,516.85. The sum of g29U,43ii90 included in the foregoing statement ol expenditures, is chargeable to preceding years, so that tne actual exuenditures for the fis cal year ending June 30, 1880. are estimated at 836.571,909, and the receipts from all sources S3O 604,023.90, leaving a deficiency to be appro priated out of the treasury ot $5,907,870.10. The report calls attention to the fact that the compen sation of postmasters and of railroads for carry ing Hie mails is regulated by law, and that the failure of congress to appropriate the amount required for these purposes does not relieve the government of the responsibility, but necessari ly increases the deficiency bills which congress will be called upon to pas’s - . In providing for tiie postal service, the following questions are pre sented; Should congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its reve nues? or should such rates of postage be estab lished as will make the department self-sustain ing? or should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way? or should the number of post routes lie diminished? or should some other methods be adopted which will in crease the revenues or diminish the expense oi the postal service. The international postal con gress which met at Paris in May, 1878, and con tinued in session until June 4 of the same year, was composed of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne Oct. 9. 1874, which goes into effect on the Ist of April, 1879, between the coun tries whose delegates have signed it. It was rat ified and approved by and witn the consent of the president Aug. 13, 1878. A synopsis of inis uni versal postal convention will be found in the re port of the postmaster-genera , and the fall text in the appendix thereto. In its origin the postal union comprised 23 countries having a popula tion of 350,000,000 of people. On the first of April next it will comprise 43 countries and colonies, with a population of more than 050 000,000 of people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies, which maintain organized postal services, constitute in fact, as well as iu name, as the new title indi cates, a universal union, regulating, upon a uni form basis of cheap postage rates, the postal in let course between all civilized nations. Some em barrassment kas arisen from a conflict between the custom laws of tills country and the provision of the postal canon in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail. It is hoped that congress will be able to de vise some means of reconciling tiie difficulties which have thus been created so as to do justice to all par ties involved. TUE 

JUDICIARY. The business of the supreme and of the courts in many of the circuits has increased to such an extent during the past years that additional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay ot justice and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus oc casioned. The incumbered condition of these dock ets is presented anew in the report of the attorney general and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for congressional action. The creation of additional circuit judges, as proposed would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense at the present rate of salaries of not more than $6 ',OOO a year. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The annual report of the secretary of the interiorjand of the commissioner of Indian affairs, presents an elaborate account of the present condition of Indian tribes and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct of Indians generally had been orderly and their rela tions with their neighbors fiiendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in their character but remained happily confined to a comparatively small number of In dians. The discontent among the Bannocks which led first to some acts of violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to an outbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on the reserva tion, and* this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations made by congress to the want of the Indians at a time when the Indians were pervented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pnr suit by the troops of the United States, and sev eral engagements, the hostile Indians were re duced to subjection and the larger part of them surrendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to call attention to the rec ommendation made by the secret ary of the inte rior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the dis posal of the executive, to be used with proper ac countability at his discretion, in sudden emer gencies of the Indian service. The other case of oisturbance was that of the abandoned Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through the states of Kansas and Nebraska In the direction of their old hunting grounds, com mitting murders and other crimes on iheir wav. From documents accompanying the report of the secretary of the interior,it appears that a disorder ly band was as fully supplied with'the necessa ries of life as the 4.700 other Indians who remain ed quietly on the reservation, and that the dis turbance was caused by men of a restless and mischievous disposition, among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to the military authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of the Ked Cloud Sioux with whom they had been on friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the council of Sept. 1877, had been comnlied with. Both the sec retary of ’ the interior and secre tary of war unite in the recommendation that provision be made by congress for the organ ization of a corps of mounted Indian auxiliaries, to be under the control ot the army and to be used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reservations and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur In this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the government, would considerably w r eaken the ruthless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number of the young men and giving them con genial employment under the ’government, it being a matter of experience that the Indians in our service, almost without exception, are faith ful in the performance of the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army in the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical strength is sometimes found insufficient. But while the employment of a force lor the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civiliz ing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called the Indian problem. .It may be very diffi cult, and require much patient effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re straints of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not impossible ; many of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and self-sup porting, were once as savage as any that at pres ent roam over the plains or in the mountains of Uie far west, anti were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences, it may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the United states but we should not forget that they are the abori gines of the country and called the soil their own on which our people have grow n rich, powerful and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help them In attaining at least that degree of civil ization which they are able to reach. It is not only our duty, it is also our interests to do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen and leel an interest in property will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and dlsburlng element. It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to lie peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and l am gratified to know from the expres sions of Indians themselves and from many con curring reports, that there is a strongly increasing desire even among Indians belonging to compara tively wild tribes to have their children educated. I invite attention to the reports of the secretary of t lie interior and the commissioner of Indian af fairs touching the experiment recently inaugu rated in taking fifty Indian children, boys and girls, from different tribes to the Hampton normal agricultural Institution in Virginia, where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in agriculture and other useful woik to be returned to their tribes after the completed course as interpreters, instructors and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with the se lection of these children might have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been pos sible to make provision for them. I agree with the* secretary of the interior in saying that “the result of this interesting exper iment, if favorable, may be destined to became an in portant factor in the advancement of civilization among the Indians. The question of whether a change in the control of t ie Indian service should be made, was at the last session of congress referred to a committee for enquiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate that re port. I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so important a question the views ex pressed above may not he lost sight of, and that the decision, vyhatever it may be, will arrest the further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect of the service as well as on the Indians themselves. AX 

OMISSION. In the enrollment of the bill making appropria tions for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of congress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs commissioner was omitted. As the commissioner had com plained of the work of taking testimony on many conflicting claims, suspension of the labors be fore determining the rights of claimants, threat ened for a time to embarrass the interest, not on ly of the government, but also of a large number of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were wait ing for tinul action on their claims before con templated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties which were apprehended, and at the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs, and others interested in the welfare of the town the secretary of the in terior was authorized to request tliMate commis sioners to take charge of the records of their pro ceedings and to perform such work as could prop erly lie done by them under such circumstances to facilitate tiie future adjudication of the claims at an early day, and to preseve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined. Tiie late commissioners’ complied w ith that request and reportthat the testmoney in all cases lias been written <ut. examined carefully and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. it is recommended that requisite authority bo given at as early a day in the session as possible and that a fair compensa tion be allowed tiie late commissioners for the ex pense incurred and labor performed by them since 25th of June last. TIM HER LANDS. I invite the attention of congress to recommen dations made by the secretary of the interior with regard to preservation of timber on the public lands of the United .States. The protection of public property is one of the first duties of the government. Tiie department of tiie interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient appropri ations to enforce the laws in that respect, but this matter appears still more Important as a question ot public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in mountainous dis tricts where the rocky elopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There the injury once done, cannot be repaired. I fully concur with the secretary of the interior in the opinion that for this reason legislation touching the public timber in the mountainous states and territories of the west should be especially well considered, and that existing laws in which the destruction of forests is not sufficiently guarded against, should be speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgent public necessity. AGRICULTURE. From the organization of the government, the importance of encouraging, by all possible means, the increase of our agricultural produc tions, has been acknowledged and urged upon the attention of congress and the people as the surest means of increasing our substantial and enduring prosperity The Words of Washington are as applicable to day as when, in his eighth annual message he said : “It is not to be doubted that with reference, either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary im portance,” In pi ©portion as nations advance in population and other circumstances of ma turity, this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage, institutions for promoting it grow up supported by the public purse, and to what object can It be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have oeen employed to this end none have been attended with greater success that the establish ment of boards composed of nroper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing informa tion and enabled by premiums and small pecuni ary aids to encourage and assist the spirit of dis cover}’, and improvement iu this species of establishing and con tributing doubly to the increase of im provement by stimulating to enterprise and ex periment, and by drawing to a common, centre the lesults everywhere of individual skill and ob servation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefit. The great prepor ance ot agriculture over any other interest en i tics it to all the consideration claimed tor it by Washington. About one half of the population of the United States is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the United States lor the year 1878. is* estimated at $3,009,- 000,000; the exports of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of the bureau of statistics were $524,000,000. The great extent of our country with its diversity of sail and climate, enables us to produce within our own borders and by our own labor not only the necessaries but most of the luxuries that are consumed in civilized coun tries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate and water communication, it appears from the statistical statements in the report of the com missioner of agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars worth of products which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture, which can only be answered by exper iments, often costly and sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for tiie benefit ;of the nation. It is a good policy, es pecially in times of depression and uncertanity of other business pursuits with a vast area of unculti vated and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and Ullage of the soil. Ehe efforts of the department of agriculture to stimulate old and to introduce new industries to improve the quality and in crease the quantity of our products; to determine the value of old or to establish the importance of new methods of culture are worthy of your careful and favorable consideration and assistance, by such approproprlation of money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this Im portant interest. 

ANIMALS IN TRANSIT. The abuse of animals in transit is widely at trading public attention. A national convention of societies specially interested in the subject has recently met at Baltimore, and facts developed, both iu regard to cruelties to animals, and the effect of such cruelties on the public health, that would seem to demand the careful consideration of conarress, and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevent’on of these abuses. EDUCATION. The report of the commissioner of the bureau of education shows very gratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests com mitted to its care. Of this important office the report is especially encouraging, with respect to the extension of the advantages of common school systems in sections of country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet attained. To education more than to any other agency w r e are to look as the resource for the advancement of the people In the requisite knowledge and application of their rights and responsibil ities as citizens, and I desire to repeat the sugges tion contained in my former message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by congress for the purpose of supplementing with national aid local systems of education in the several states. THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY, Adequate accommodations for the great library which is overgrowing the capacity of the rooms now occupied at the capitol, should be provided for without further delay. This invaluable col lection of books, manuscripts and illustrative art, has grown to such proportions in connection with the copyright system of the country as to demand the prompt and careful attention of congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is na tional in its character, and must from the nature of the case increase even more rapidly in the in ture than in the past, it cannot be doubted that the people w ill sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. TUB SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE. The appeal of the regents of the Smithsonian institution for means to organize, exhibit, and make available for public bench! the articles now stored away, belonging to the national mu seum, I heartily recommend to your favorable consideration. LOCAL AFFAIRS. The attention of congress is again invited to the condition of the river front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to the health of residents of the national capital. both temporary and permanent, that the low lands in front of the city, now subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed, in their present condition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city and are a dangerous source of malarial poison. The reclamation will im prove the navigation of the river by restricting and consequently deepening its channel, and is also of importance when considered in connec tion with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the pane west and south of the Washington monument. The report of the board of survey heretofore ordered by a com mittee of congress on the Improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is re spectfully commended to consideration. The re port of the commissioners of the District of Cos lumbia presented a detailed statement of affairs of the District, The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for local purposes is contrasted, showing that expenditures by the peonle of the district greatly exceed those of the ger government. The exhibit is made in con nection wHU estimates for the requisite repair of the defective pavements and sowers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessity and in the same connection a plan is presented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of the district. BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS. The benevolent reformatory and penal institutions of the district are all entitled to tue favorable at tention of congress. The reform school needs ad ditional buildings and teachers and appropriations which will place all of these institutions in a condi tion to become models o? usefullness and heneficience will bo regarded by the country as liberally and wisely bestowed. The commissioners with evident justice request attention to the discrimination made by congress against the district in the donation of land for the support of the public schools and ask that the same liberalty that has been shown to the inhabi tants of the various states and territories of the United States may be extended to the district of Columbia. The commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted on pub lic and private interests by the present location of the depots and switching tracks of the several railroads entering the city, and ask for legislation looking to then removal. The recommendations and suggestions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of congress. Sufficient time has perhaps elapsed since the reorganiza tion of the government of the district under the recent legislation of congress for the expression of a confident opinion as to its successful operation, but the practical results already attained are so satisfac tory that the friends of the new government may well urge upon congress the wisdom of its continuance without essential modification, till by actual experience, its advantages and detects, maybe more fully ascertained. fSigned!
