Washington, Dec. 7. The present's message complete, as read before both branches of congress today, is as follows: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of this government, you' have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free insti tutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have again been made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with leverisn apprehension and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout the land .and determined by the decree, of l.-ee and Independent' suf frage without disturbance of our tranquil ity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceable obedience and manly submission which have succeed' v cd a clash of political opinions we dis cover abundance of determination of the countrymen to abide by every verdict of popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agon cies established at the direction of the affairs of the government; thus the peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be nromnted by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the accomplishment of public duty invites. In obedience to a constitutional require ment, I herein submit to the congress cer tain information concerning national af fairs with trie suggestions of such legis lation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient.

Our efforts iu this direction will not be relaxed, but the deep feeling and sympathy, that have been arouBcd among our people ought not to bo iar Diinu tneir reason and judg' meat as to lead them to demand inmos sible things. The outbreaks, of blind fury which led to the murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenlv and without notice and an attempt on our part to torce sucn a Hostile presence there might be effective for prevention or protection, would not only be resisted by the Ottoman ' gov eminent, but would be regarded as an in terruption of their plunsbv the creat na tions who assert their exclusive rights to intervene in tneir own time and meth od for the security of life and property 111 4 Ul tV J . Several naval forces are stationed i the Mediterranean as a measure of oau tion and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We ave made claims against the Turkish gov ernment for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at Hacnool and Marash during the uprising at those Places. inus tar tne validity of these aemanaa uas not been admitted, though our minister, prior to Buch outrages .and in anticipation of danger demanded pro tection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned and notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruction and rob bery, the facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of tueir ciaim, ana nothing wilt be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. A number of Armenian refuses hava nr- rived at our ports and an order has lately been obtained from the Turkish govern ment permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is noped that hereafter no obstacle will be interposed tq prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils wnion threaten in Turkish dominions. Our recently appointed consul to Er- zroum is at his post and discharging the duties of his office, though for some un accountable reason his formal exequator from the sultan has not been issued. I do not believe that the present situation in Turkey will be long permitted to of fend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlnrhtened civilizn tion that belongs to the close of the nine teenth century, it -seems hardlv possible that the earnest demand of the good peo ple throughout the Christian world for ua uuixuiruve ireuiuieni win rcinuiu un- answered. THE 

CUBAN QUESTION The insurrection iu Cuba still continues with all its perplexity. It is difficult to perceive how any progress has tuns far been made toward the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the con siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the island country. As the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time as is evidenced by her devotion and large ly increased military and naval forces there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of num bers and character, and resources, and were never less inflexible in their re solve not to succumb without practically securing the great objects for which they took up anna. If Spain has not yet re established her authority. neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on. the pretence that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is oble . . . i i it n. to maintain it, uas own iu.il-ui.iuj unnn doned. Snain does keep on foot such a government more or less imperfect in large cities and immediate suburbs, but that exception being made, the entire country is cither given over to anorchy or is subject to the military occupation of one or the other party. It is reported indeed on reliable authority that at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army - the Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its iuncuons, leaving mui government, con fessedly (what there is the best reason the Grand Old MUTUAL EC. 31st, 1805.

Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil Hirue, tne passions ot tne com batants grow more and more inflamed nud on both sides become more frequent nnd deplorable. They are also participated iu by the bauds of marauders who, now in the name of one purty and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occasion, har- raBS tne country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own ad vantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruc tion of property, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as fur as practicable, but while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish govern ment, it has now apparently abandoned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents, namely, that the exieen- eies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use nnd advantage to the ene my. , It is to the same end that in pursuance of general orders Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population is required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the value of the plantations is fast diminishing and that unless there is a soeedv and radical change in oxhistiug conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value consists, very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar, a capacity al ready much reduced b.v the interrun- tion to tillage which has takeu place dur ing the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these interruptions outinue during the current year and practically extend, as it is now threat ened, to the etire sugar producing ter ritory ot the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capitnl can be induced to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fer tile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious atteution of the government and the people of the Unit ed States under any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sen timental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separ ated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in -Mus-second- oaiy- to thnt of the people and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that nt least $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in planta tions and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1880 amount ed to alwut $04,000,000, grew iu 1893 to about $103,000,000, and in 1804, the year before the present insurrection broke out. amounted to nearly $90,000,000. Be sides this large pecuniary stake m the fortunes of Cuba the United States finds itself inextricably involved in the present contest in otner ways, both vex ntious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press and by public meet ings; by the purchase and shipment of arms; by the raising of large funds, and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to lie made the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though Cubans nt heart, and in all their feelings and interests, linve taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this government nnd not unnaturally re garded with much indignation by the country ot their origin. I no insurgents nre undoubtedly encouraged nnd sminnrt- ed by the widespread sympathy of the people ot the country who ulways instant ly reel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which in the ense of the more restlesff elements of our ponu- lntiou leads them in many instances to active aud personal participation in the contest. The result .is that this gov ernment is constantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim dam ges for injuries to person nnd property now estimated at many millions of dol lars, and to ask explanations nnd apolo gies for the acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for the repression .of rebellious sentiments blinds them to the immunities belonging to the non- fTcnding citizens of a friendly pow- It follows lrom the same causes thnt the United States is compelled to actively police a long line of sea coast against un lawful expeditious, the escape of which the utmost vigilunce will not nlways suf fice to prevent. These inevitable entan glements of the United States with the rebellion Iv. Cuba, the large American property interests affected, and considera tions of philanthropy and humanity in general have led to a vehement demand in various quarters for some sort f positive intervention on the part of the United Stntes. NO 

BELLIGERENT RIGHTS. It was first proposed that belligerent ghts should be accorded to the insur gents, a proposition no longer urged be cause untimely and in practical operation lcoriy perilous and injurious to our own nterests. It has since been and now sometimes contended that the indepen dence of the insurgents should bo recog- zed, hut imperfect and restricted ns the Spanish government of the island may be, no other exists there unless the will f the military officer in temporary com- and of a particular district can be dig- ified as a species of government. It is now also suggested- that the United Stntes buy the island, a suggestion possibly orthy of consideration if there were any ideiice of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a pro posal. It is urged, finally that if the ther remedies fail, the existing internecine strife m Cuba should be . terminated hy our interven tion, even- at the cost of war be tween the United Stater and Spain, n ar which its advocates eonhdently prophesy could neither be large in its pro portions nor doubtful in its issue. 1'he correctness of this forecast need be neith- I affirmed nor denied.

" j all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neighbor ing regions, however attractive. That our conduct towards Spain and her domin ions has constituted no execution to this national disposition is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Yarra in 1808. No other great power, it may be safe ly said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same patient en durance. It mny also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba will unquestionably evidence nn silent- po. spect and regard for Spain on the part of iiie-American people, lrioy in truth fin not fget her1 connexion with ih J . eoverj of the Western Hemisphere, nor do trry underestimate the great quali ties of the Spanish people, nor fail to . ... . .- recognize tneir splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national nonor.

And yet neither the government nor the people of the tinted States have shut their eyes to tne course of events in Cuba or nave failed to realize the existence of conceded grievances which have lcl in the present revolution from the authority of Spain, grievances recognized by the queen regent ana by the cortos, voiced by tne most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish statesmen without regard to 11 (L d'mon,rateu reforms proposed &iXV ;,ri i !,..... JS ."M disposition of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances, fortified bv in dications of influential nublic opinion in Spain, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising nnd ef fective means of compromising the pres ent stritc wnn nonor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of the insurrec tion. 

HOME RULE ADVISED. It would seem that if Spain would of fer to Cuba genuine autonomy, assure home rule which, while preserving the sov ereignty of Spnin, would satisfy, all ra tional requirements of her Spanish sub jects there should be no just reaAon why the. pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be iu the trne interest oi all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island and mnkine it woTthh-HS, for which ever nurty mav ultimately prevail. It would keep intact ine nosessions ot Mpnin without touching her honor, which will be .onsulted, rath er than impunged, by the adequate re dress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island nnd thp fortunes of its inhabitants within their own control without severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would vet enable tiiein to test tneir capacity ror self gov ernment under the most favorable cir cumstances. It has been objected to on the one side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms; and on the other side, that promised autonomy, how ever lilieral, is insufficient because with out assurance of the promise being ful filled. The reasonableness of a require inent by Spain of unconditional surren der on the part of-, insurgent bands be fore autonomy is conceded is not alto gether apparent. . It ignores importunt features of the situation, the stability of two years duration ns given to the insur rection, the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the nature of things, and as shown by past experience the utter ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily ended: above all. the rniiK abuses which all parties in Spain, all brunches of the government nnd all her leading public men concede to exist and profess n desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to wiiiiiiuiii Hie prof fer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put themselves at mer cy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of reflecting the gravest of perils and invites suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms. 1 he objection on behalf ot the insurgents that promised reforms un not be relied jipon must of course lie onsidered. 'J hough we have no right to assume and no reason for assuming Hint anything Spain undertakes for the relief of Cuba will not be done acording to both the spirit and the letter of the unilcrtaking, nevertheless, realizing thnt suspicion and precaution on the part of the weaker of the two combatants nre al ways natural and not always unjustiti able, being sincerely desirous in the in terests of both, and on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solv ed with the bust possibly delay, it was intimated by this government to the gov ernment of cspuiu some months ago thnt if a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and ould be accepted by them upon a guar antee of its execution, the United States would endeavor to find a way not objec tionable to Spain of furnishing such guar antee. While no definite response to this intimation has yet been received from the Spanish government, it is believ ed to bo not altogether unwelcome, while ns already suggested, no reason is iierceiv- 1 why it should not tie approved by the nsurgents. Neither party can fail to see the importance of early action and both must realize that to prolong the present nfe of things for even a short period ill add enormously to the time and la bor and expenditure of money necessary to bring, a bout the Industrial recuperation f the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on nil grounds thnt earnest ef- or for healing the breach between flpain nd the insurgent Cubans upon' the lines hove indicated may be at once inaugur ted and pushed to an immediate -and successful issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner hove outlined or in any other way con sistent with our constitution and laws ill always lie at the disposal of cither irty. 

SHOULD NOT ANNEX CUBA. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the isl nnd or an interference with its control by any other power.
