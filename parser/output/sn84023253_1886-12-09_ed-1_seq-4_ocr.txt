St. Johnsbury, VU, Thursday, Dec 9, 1886, A Rare Offer. This May Interest You. We will send the Caledonian and Man chester Mirror and Farmer to any addreaa in Caledonia or Esiez Counties one year for $2.15, and to any post office in the 17. 8. for $2.25 ; payment in advance. This applies to both old and new subscribers who pay a full year in advance. The Mirror and Farmer is a large eight page paper and is especially valuable to Farmers and Grand Army men. Don't pay $2 for an agricultural paper, but subacrioe for the best local paper and get with it a good agricultural ! paper for less than one dollar. Cash must accompa ny orders. C. M. STONE & CO. If Vermont does'nt wake up on the temperance question, she will find her self left out in the cold by her sister states in New England. The New England Farmer regrets that Vermont has decided to do with out a board of agriculture ; but thinks we have taken an .advance step iu re gard to an experiment station. It seems to be generally conceded that Mr. Hlaiue's sileuce is as effective as Dr. Burchard's speech. It looks now as though the corouer's jury can settle the plumed knight's case with a single word suicide. It is the Wash ington Critic that suggests the possi bility that in attending Mr. Arthur's funeral, Mr. Blaine was attending his own. A uew postal card aud a new two cent postage stamp are to be introduc ed the first of the year. The card will be very handsome with a tine medal lion of Jefferson on the middle, instead of on the right hand corner, aud all the printing will be in black ink. The design of the stamp represents an em bossed head of George Washington in profile upon a blue tinted background. Bible students will welcome Rev. Dr. Pelou bet's select notes on the in ternational Sunday-school lessons for 1887. With the new year is begun again the study of the Old Testament, the first six months covering Genesis and Exodus; the last six months be ing in Matthew. The Peloubet notes were never more exhaustive or pre sented iu a more readable manner Every Sunday-school scholar aud Bi ble student should have them. Among the sensible bits of legisla tion at Montpelier was the passage of the bill, raising the age at which a girl may consent to her ruin to 14 years, and punishing violation with consent before that age, or without it after ward, by imprisonment not exceeding 20 years or fine not exceeding $2000, or both. At the same time one is puzzled to know why the age of con sent was not raised to 16 or even 18 years. Henry Stanley attended a meeting in London, called to raise money for a memorial to Gordon. No end of great city merchants were there. Stanley in a speech told them that they would not do anything worth doiug to keep Gordon's memory green. They might name a cravat or a collar after him, but as for putting their hands in their pockets and taking out money, they would never do it; and they didn't. Congressman John W. Stewart tells a Tribune reporter that the return of Senator Edmunds was a foregone con elusion from the beginning; that the position of Vermont on the presidency will not be a leadiug one ; that there are a good many Blaine men in the state ; that the solid republican states will fall iuto line for auy candidate selected; that Edmunds will not be a candidate; and that it was against his (Edmunds') judgment that his name was brought before the convention iu 1884. The Voice says that there are open bars in many cities of the state of Vermont selling as freely and as mis cellaneously as the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker. That liquor is sold in nearly, if not quite, every town iu the state we do not doubt, but we think the Voice iu error in its talk about open bars aud free aud tniscel laueous selling. If the Voice knows whereof it speaks it should follow the example of the Springfield Republican and name the place's. The temper ance people of the state would wel come practical help of this sort. Straining at Gnats. Boston furnishes an excellent illus tration of the absurdity of half execut ed laws. The first Sunday on which the apothecaries shops were closed, in accordance with the recently pro mulgated orders concerning Sunday observance, large gangs of workmen were busy all day repairing horse rail road tracks, and the air was filled with the rattle aud clang of iron tools and the thump of the paving rammer. Aloug Washington street, day and eveniug, the work of layiug electric wires continued as it had throughout the preceding week. This making fish of the small deader and fowl of the large corporations is much like the fa miliar straining at gnats and swallow ing camels. Enforce the Suuday laws by all means bat enforce them impar tially. Revolution In Massachusetts. Seventeen Massachusetts cities held their municipal electious Tuesday, and 13 of the 17 voted no license. The greatest revolution oo the license question has occurred in Fall River, where last year the vote stood 3303 for license and 1443 against, while this year there are 32G6 yea votes aud 3500 no votes. In Springfield and North ampton the temperance people and great enthusiasm prevailed. The scenes about the polling stations were novel and interesting. At Springfield 12o women peddled no -license votes. There was no smoking, loud talking or profanity at the polling places, and there was not an arrest for drunken ness in the city until after the polls closed. Every polling place had its table bountifully spread with sand wiches and doughtnuts, while steam ing pitchers and pails of hot coffee stood about and women served the re freshments cordially and hospitably to all men alike without regard to how they voted. Iu both cities grand jubi lee meetings in honor of the victory were held last evening with pleuty of speakers, good music and lots of good feeling but no rum. Hooray for Mas sachusetts ! THE 

NEXT PRESIDENCY. While our legislature was in session the St. Louis Globe-Democrat caused the members to be asked their prefer ence for the next president. The re sult showed that Senator Edmunds is hardly thought of seriously as a candi date, but that Mr. Blaine is, in the eyes of Vermonters, the coming man; over 70 per cent, of those who were willing to have their preferences known announcing him as their first choice. Senator Bates of St. Johnsbury an swered the question thus: "My first choice is James G. Blaine, the biggest man in America, and the most repre sentative American statesman. My second choice is John A. Logan." Rep resentative T. C. Fletcher said: "I was a delegate to the republican national convention in 1884, and with the others of the delegation I supported Mr. Ed munds. We cheerfully acquiesced then in the nomination of Mr. Blaine. To-day I should not want to express a preference for any candidate, although I wish to say it looks very much as if Mr. Blaine would be nominated." Senator Blake of the Barton Moni tor says: ''My first choice is Gen. Lo gan, the friend of the soldier and the soldier's favorite. My second choice would be Mr. Blaine." Senator Swain of Bellows Falls said: "Blaine is my first choice, and I have no second." Senator William Wells of Burlington said : "I do not favor the nomination of Mr. Blaine, because I do not think it would be a wise one. It is too early yet to express any definite choice. I should, of course, support any good man whom the republicans might nom inate." James F. Hogan formerly of St. Johnsbury, now of Rutland, stands "a Knights of Labor man, and there is no telling what may happen before 1888." The Rutland Herald, discussing the above canvass, pertinently suggests that events move very fast in this country sometimes and men's opinions change with them. While not doubt ing that in the main the Globe-Demo crat correctly sets forth the views of the Vermonters at the time they were obtained, the Herald suggests that "since then the leading candidate has hurt himself in the general estimation of the country by an act of discourtesy, which tends to widen the breach iu the party and therefore makes him less available as a candidate, and if we may judge from the almost unauimous opinions of the republicau press of Vermont and from expressions heard every day among men we meet, the same gentlemen who spoke in his fa vor a month ago would now say they think we had better wait until the time comes and then take the strong est man." A 

STORY WITH A MORAL. Professor Horace B. Gale, of the chair of dynamic engineering in Wash ington University, of St. Louis, is a young man of &i years, who has only recently been graduated from the Poly technic Institute of Boston. Two weeks ago work on the St. Louis elec trie railroad came to a standstill be cause of an unforeseen mechanical ob stacle. The compauy's electriciau, aud all the other electricians in the vicmi tv. were unable to overcome this ob stacle, and it looked as if the electric railroad project would have to be giv en up. Finally, some one suggested the new professor at the university, and he was sent for as a last resort, but when the older electricians saw the beardless j'outh, they smiled. They stopped smiling, however, when the young professor showed them what the scientific difficulty was and remedied it for them, and the grateful directors made him a stockholder in the road Young Gale is from Natick, Mass., aud is probably the most expert electrician of Ins years in this or auy other coun try. N. Y. Commercial. This little story from the Comuier cial points a moral that is worthy the consideration of the boys hereabouts Young Gale is well known to the writer who has watched his advance ment with deep interest. He comes honestly by his abilities inheriting them from both father aud mother, From his youth he has been one of the "studious" fellows, not a goody-goody boy by any means but a faithful, hon est worker. While his companions, some of them doubtless endowed with equally brilliaut natural powers, were carrying out the idea that "boys must be boys" and that youth was a time for play and not work, Gale was coutriv ing a way to combine profit with his pleasure. He knew how to find the game pleasure, greater pleasure in fact, in reading some such paper as the Scientific American, that the other boys found in reading the adventures of Red Handed Dick, or the tragic sto ry of the One Eyed Detective. He had his share of good times and was, not wanting in humor and all that, but he was a worker and now is reaping the reward that honest work is pretty sure to bring, though it rarely comes to one so early in life. We are not advocating that the boys of to-day must become old fogies or young fogies. But the "smart" Amer ican boy gets so many notices that we would speak a good word for the steady, studious fellows, who, some how, manage occasionally to succeed without wasting eight or ten of the choice years of their lives in sowing wild oats. It is, in a sense, true that boys must be boys, but it is well to re member, also, that boys must be men! The President's Message. President Cleveland's second mes sage was read in both houses of con gress Monday. The question that re ceives the most attention in the mes sage is the need of reducing the na tion's income. This income, he says, is now more than than ever in excess of public necessities. The message continues : The application of the surplus to the payment of such portion of the public debt as is now at our option subject to extinguishment, if contin ued at the rate which has lately pro vailed, would retire the class of in- debteduess'within less than one year from this date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue system would booh result in the receipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to meet government expenses with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should then be con fronted with a vast quantity of money the circulating medium of the people. hoarded iu the treasury when it should be in their bauds, or we should be drawn iuto wasteful public extrava gance with all the corrupting national demoralization which follows in its train. After referring to the injustice of ex acting a larger tax from the poorer classes of people that the necessities of the government demand, the presi dent "recommends that, keeping in view all these considerations, the in creasing aud unnecessary surplus of national income anuually accumulat ing be released to the people by an amendment to our revenue laws which shall cheapen the price of the necessa ries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materials as by Ameri can labor may be manufactured into marketable commodities." THE

Prof. French is to have a singing school at Woodsville and is to drill the members of the M. E. Sunday school for a Christmas cantata. NEWS OF THE WEEK. Big Snow Storm. The big snow storms that have been working so much mischief in the west reached New England last week and gave the people in southern Mas sachusetts their first bit of snow. Early this week the heaviest snow fall ever known in that section visited the southern states. In Noith Carolina and Georgia the snow-fall was un precedented. Monday's telegraph says that snow has fallen to the depth of 26 inches, and it is still falling. Traffic and travel of all kinds are suspended. The weight of the snow crushed in the roof of the Asheville tobacco works, and a large stock of smoking tobacco was ruined. Iu Virginia snow fell for 60 hours and was 15 inches deep in places. The same story comes from all parts of the South. On the New England coast a terrible storm has raged since Monday. Many vessels were driven ashore, and many deeds of heroism are reported perform ed by the villagers along shore. In one instance 18 men were saved. All the northern Atlantic coast was dotted with wrecks and wreckage. XJired Fast and Stole $100,000. A defalcation of about $100,000 that causes a sensation in business and so cial circles of Chicago has just come to light. The victim of the affair is Min er T. Ames, a millionaire coal mer chant, and the dishonest man is Theo dore S. Mize, his confidential book keeper and cashier and also secretary of the Chicago and Mihouk coal aud coke company. Mize stood high in se- j ciety and absolutely trusted in his business affairs. He has been in the ' employ of Mr. Ames since 1872 and since that time, so the story goes, has been carrying on a systematic plan of robbery concealed by false entries, etc. When he began to steal, he began to live fast, and the faster he lived the more he stole. Besides the extrava gant manner in which he and his wife lived, it is asserted that Mize at vari ous times supported three other wo men on whom he lavished money with a generons hand. The steamer "Westeruland" reports that when seven days out from Ant werp, a huge cross sea was suddenly encountered that fell with terrific force upon the forward deck of the steam ship. The deck was crushed in, bury ing seamen and passengers beneath a mass of wood and iron debris. Six men were lost and 13 others seriously injured. Some villain obtained entrance to a Lowell, Mass., school house last week and opened the faucet in the exhaust pipe of the boiler, allowing all the water to ruu into the sewer. The jan itor accidentally discovered that the boiler was dry just in time to save an explosion aud the lives of hundreds of school children who were in the build ing. VERMONT NEWS. Tbe Saxton Forger y Case. The Saxton forgery case has been the sensation of the hour at Burlington this week. A statement of the case was given iu these columns last week. Jennie saxton, aged 19, is charged with forging orders for $1300 on the Bur lington savings bank in the name of John L. Mason of Richmond, a direc tor of the Central Vermont railroad, a stockholder in the savings bank con cerned, and one of the most wealthy men in the county. The prisoner claimed that Mason gave her authority to draw the orders. The trial has brought out a vast amount of testimo ny on the part of the defence attempt ing to prove scandalous relations be tween Mr. Mason and the Saxton girl ever since she was 12 years old. Mr Mason denied these charges iu every detail. The prosecution argued that the whole affair was a gigantic black mail scheme on the part of Miss Sax ton, assisted by her friends. This is the opinion of the better part of the people of Chittenden couuty. Later: The preliminary hearing was concluded Tuesday and Miss Saxton has been held in $800 bail, which was not forthcoming at last accounts. Thomas 0'Ronrke of Rock Island, P. Q., was arrested at Newport, last week for smuggling clothing, and was held to bail in $3000 tor Ins appear ance at the February term of the Unit ed States court at Buiiingtou. Brig.-General W. L.

The trustees of the Vermont Sol diers home will take possession of the Park estate at Bennington as soon as the transfer can be made. About $2500 will be spent in repairs and improve ments, when the house will be ready for use. Rev. Father Boylan of Rutland, who died on Suuday, was buried irom St. Peter s church in that place baturday The church and convent were appro priately draped and the village gov ernment in pursuance to the vote at a meeting Monday evening, attended the fuueral in a body. During Father Boylan's pastorate of 30 years he has put up $Io0,000 worth of buildings for the parish. Rev. P. Cunningham of Brattleboro will probably be chosen his successor. THE EDMUNDS-BLAINE AFFAIR. The Senators Attitude Explained by a Friend. A friend of Senator Edmunds said Suuday: "Mr. Edmunds has no per Bonal ill-feeling towards Mr. Blaine If he were to meet him again under similar circumstances he would speak to him as he did at Arthur's house. He bears hi in to-day no personal ill- will, and the incident which occurred iu New York will not have the slight est effect in making Mr. Edmunds feel unkindly towards Mr. Blaine. lie may have said something of this kind, and from this expression of personal indiffereuce have come the stories that he was anxious for a reconciliation If Mr. Blaine should desire to be on good terms with Mr. Edmunds the lat ter would treat him frankly, but he would still remain iu the position he has al way 8 occupied. He thinks Mr Blaine would be preferable as presi dent to a democrat, but if there were to be another campaign and Mr. Blaine were to be the candidate he could not change his views as to the transactions in Mr. Blaine's past upon which he has already expressed au opinion. That is all there is of it. If Mr. Blaine should be willing to make friends with him on those terms he would be glad to meet him. The Life of Trade. Fairfield Journal. We heard a man say the other day that he was so busy he did not have time to write an advertisement. A traveller might as well say he could not stop to feed his horses. Concerning the Third Party. Innkeeper's Journal. There is no use of denying the fact. This so-called third partj is fast be coming a power, which will have ma terial effect in deciding the political, economical and social destinies of the nation if a strong opposition is not at once brought against it. Protect the Home. Springfield Republican, 8th. The women of Springfield are in pol itics to stay. That much was proved on a stormy day. The events of yes terday, too, will spur them ou to reg istration and voting for the school board. This is well. The duty of home government is not for man alone A Dark Ilorae. Philadelphia Inquirer, Rep Does anybody remember Judge Greshain, who was once postmaster general, but whose memory has not been kept alive by any scandal, po litical or otherwise, of late years t Well, there is a movement in New York to nominate him as the republi can candidate for president. He has oor sympathy, for we believe him to be a good man. Women at the Poll. Northampton Herald, 9th. The contest on the license question was a bitter and hard-fought one to the end, and not until the last returns were received would the saloon men admit their defeat. Thej' worked like tigers, but the temperance people stay ed with them to the very close, and proved themselves a foe that could not be shaken off. The work of the wom en of the W. C. T. U. aud Sous of Tem perance, in providing ballots and com fortable lunches, who shall say it was not largely instrumental iu bringing about the result f They did their work modestly, efficiently, effectively. They Would Rejoice Mightily. K. r. Evening Pott. If the real sentiments of the repub lican journals of the country could be ascertained we believe that it would be found that with the exception of five or six papers, all of them are hop ing that some chance or other will re lieve them of the necessity of support ing Mr. Blaine again. We believe the same thing is true of the great majori ty of the leaders of the party. I hey have not the courage to speak out frankly and say that Mr. Blaine ought to take himself out f the way, but they would rejoice mightily to see him do it. A Favored Reporter. Bottom Transcript. Young Blaine, who has started in his journalistic career as local reporter ou a Pittsburg paper, will possess ad vantages and immunities uot enjoyed by his brothers of the craft. It isn't at all likely that the city editor will make him bring the cigars from public din ners to the "city desk," nor boil his fine writing down to the facts, nor say "Don't make more than a stickful of the Blaine demonstration iu Ward 4." Certaiuly until '88, and perhaps even alter, young Blaine will be a favored reporter. The Revolt Against Rum. Springfield Republican, 8th. The cold-water billow rolled right across the commonwealth yesterday, and auy quantity of license landmarks were swept away in the course. Fall River furnishes the most noticeable change, a "yes" majority of 1881 last year being transformed iuto a minorty of 294. Haverhill, New Bedford, Cam bridge, Newton, Maiden, Gloucester, Brockton and Fitchburg also fell into line, and the narrowness of the margin in those cities iudicates the eagerness of the fight. It is not unlikely that the work of the women iu these places, as in our own city, had much to do with the result. In Fitchburg the lines were drawn closely on city officials, anil the no-license party car ried in their candidate for mayor and all but two of the aldermen. Nortl amptom, too, attended to the liquor clubs. They have grown great aud rank enough to demand the attention of the legislature. The friends of a reasonable license policy must now re pair an inefficient law. The Vermont Fostoffices. Ration Record. There are only seven postoffices on the little Vermont list which Hiram Atkins carries around in his vest pock et. There are democrats in all the other presidential places. The term of the Bennington postmaster does not expire until 1888, and no one has yet begun to scheme to get him removed. The Burlington office will have a new manager in a couple of months, but he will, doubtless, be a man satisfactory to Senator Edmunds. It is understood that George W. lleckwith will be nam ed. There is not any indication just now of a settlement of the Montpelier difficulty. The Swantou office be comes vacant on February 5. This will probably fall to ihe lot of Major Charles Reynolds, formerly of the United States army. The St. Johns bury, West Randolph and Fail haven offices aie still a good ways out of reach. The Fishery Troubles. From President Cleveland's Message. The terms and conditions of inter course and commerce between the United States and their neighbors along a frontier of over 3500 miles, the propinquity, community of language and occupation, and similarity of po litical and social institutions indicate the practicability and obvious wisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly relations. Whilst I am uu feignedly desirous that such relations should exist between us and the inhab itants of Canada, yet the action of their officials duriug the past seasons toward our fishermen has been such as to se riously jeopardize their continuance. Although disappointed in auy efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery question, negotiations are still pending with reasonable hope that before the close of the present session of congress announcement may be made that an acceptable conclusion has been reached, as at an early day there ma be laid before congress the correspondence of the department of state in relation to this important sub ject, so that the history of the past fish ing season may be fully disclosed and the action and the attitude of the administration clearly comprehended. A more extended reference is not deemed necessary in this message. SEE
