THURSDAY, - DECEMBER 11, 1905. oini nocr 01 Gi Gin ARIZONA'S DESPERATE OHANOE The moment of greatest danger in the history of Arizona is at hand and if she is not to be sacrificed to.tho rapacity of political knaves in congress immediate action must be taken by every man who values the principles of American liberty in the territory, and can influence one ounco of force for the right Such a protest ,must go up as .to drown all the specious lies and technical quibbles urged by the supporters of the bill, which has for its purpose the disfranchisement of every Arizona voter. For it is a plain proposition that every ballot cast by an Arizonan will be more that offset by the New Mexican crew, who hold the numerical strength to snow us under, if indeed the honest people of the neighboring territory are to be influenced by their corrupt leaders. Since the thunderbolt launched by the president in his message to congress has been fully understood by the people of both Arizona and New Mexico-indignation and disgust have supplanted amazement and only now are the people affected by this proposed iniquity able to comprehend the full force of the shock. For the first time the wielder of the "bitr st ck" has shoWn his- teeth in ferocity instead of the widely advertised and much cartooned smile with which he has been wont to greet all whom he met. "The people of the territory have no rights" and are to be treated as the party in power deems fit without regard to any principle of equity or fairness. The pound of flesh i3 demanded by the Shylocks of the republican party with regard only to the "letter of the law." Is the president power-mad? Docs he intend to reverse an administration which has heretofore favorably impressed even his strongest political opponents? He has ever had strong friends and a host of admirers in the west; he has won over a large number of his bitterest enemies in the southjhe was fast obtaining recognition to his claim to be the "president of all the peoplo"only to dash the idol of his own creation to the ground in sheer wantonness by one foul act for which there is no possible excuse. Is he really the dictator in disguise and only throws off the mask when he has reached the point where he thinks himself unassailable and preeminent? If so he is the worst fooled man in the United States today. He made more democrats out of former republicans in one hour than he ever did or ever will turn democratic votes to his support. It cannot be urged that he is not fully informed of the true condition of affairs in both New Mexico and Arizona. Only a short time ago Congressmen Tawney and Mark Smith had an interview with him in which the true state of public opinion was fully set forth. He ha3 been visited by many prominent citizens of both territories who have laid before him evidence undisputable that a majority of the people in both Arizona and New Mexico are opposed to jointure. A delegation of prominent New Mexicans are today in Washington urging upon his attention evidence that 75 per cent of the people of New Mexico are opposed to jointure, and Frank M. Murphy and other Arizonans have assured him of the well-known fact that over 90 per cent of the people of this territory are bitterly antagonizing any action in the matter unleia congress shall determine that we are entitled to single statehood. The president knows all about it but chooses to ignore our protests and hearken only to the republican slate makers who are figuring on perpetuating that party's control of the U. S, Senate, no matter what in.iustice may be perpetrated on a helpless people. There is nothing futher to bo expected from the president. He is out of our reckoning. Our only hope is to reach a sufficient number of congressmen and senators and by appealing to their manhood, Americanism and sense of justice prevent the proposed holdup. Every man in Arizona who has acquaintance with a member of congress, or is in close touch with men of influence anywhere in the country, owes it to himself, his family and his citizenship to at once write the facts of the case and so direct his appeal that the result will be a snowstorm of protests in Washington that will bury both houses s ress in its drifts. Is nujji rainoj'" will send their delegations and by dint of much noise and unlimited lies create the impression that they represent something or somebody except their own purposes of graft. This must bo counteracted by a great demonstration and the most numerous delegation that ever went to the national capital, composed of men who count in the affairs of the territory, should invade Washington and labor until this crime is prevented. Act as individuals! Act as communities! Act as a territory! But act! And act at once! The Pennsylvania railroad has do away with all forms of free transportation after January 1. This is in retaliation for the noise being made regarding rate legislation. This is not an original act by the "Pensy." Other roads have appealed directly to tho understanding of legislators by shutting off their passes. The Florence Blado says: "In the light of tho testimony given by Senator Piatt and others, one must conclude that the chief mission of the great insurance companies is to collect from tho people, under the guise of insurance premiums, campaign funds for the republican party, both state and national." Mrs. Mary Mabel Rogers was hanged at Windsor, Vermont, state prison, Dece:nber 8, after every possible effort had been made to secure a commutation of sentence. She maintained the demeanor of a stoic from the day of her arrest and did not flinch on the gallows. The record price for copper was made last week when the Calumet and Hecla company contracted a portion of its output for delivery in July 1906 at eighteen and one half cents per pound. This would indicate that we are not to have any material reduction in the price for some months to come. Tom Lawson was not indicted by the grand jury of Suffolk county, Mass., when they looked into Barrow's evidence. Charges must have been on wrong basis. As a common scold, general nuisance and market scarecrow they would certainly have found a true bill. Roosevelt has been presented with a gold heart by Coloradoans for his work in stopping the war in the Orient. Arizona is prepared to present him with the "marble heart" for recommending joint statehood. Congressman Mark Smith has been assigned to the committees on and Postroads and Public lands and Territories, which is very satisfactory to Mark and Arizona. Senator Foraker, of Ohio, has introduced an amendment to the Beveridge bill in the interest of separate statehood for Arizona and New Mexico and proposes to fight the jointure iniquity to a finish. Three cheers for Foraker! Doan Roasts Newspapers In acting upon the motion for a change of venue in the Sauvage murder case and before giving his decision Judge Doan took occasion to flay the newspapers of the county in general and the Bisbee Review in particular for publishing articles which were calculated to inflame the minds of the public, and after granting the motion he stated that certain editors of certain papers were on the verge of the line and that the court would at the first opportunity, if said papers and their editors did not desist in trying cases before they had been presented to the grand jury, he would fine them $1000 and sixty days in the county jail for contempt of court. If they crossed the line, the Judge said they could expect such a result. Douglas Dispatch. The Tucson Election. The city election on Monday, December 11, was hard fought and the contest was close in respect to one democratic councilman, though in the case of the other two elected, one of whom was a democrat and the other a republican, the pluralities were sweeping. There was a total socialistic vote of 140. The result of the election was as follows: For councilman at large: O. C. Parker, republican, 393; Vic Griffith,, democrat, 523; Griffith's plurality 130. For councilman: R. P. Roscnfeld, republican, 319; Mose Drachman, democrat, 341; Drachman's plurality 25. For councilman: M. Monti jo, democratic, 155; R. Hohusen, republican, 259; Hohusen's plurality 104. A Son and Heir Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Hcgardt are re joicing at the birth of a son and heir who first saw the light on Tuesday, Dec, 12, 1905. Mr. Hegardt was overwhelmed with congratulations on Tuesday and smiles, cigars and blushes alternated with great rapidity. G. W. Haziewood, of Ellison P. O., Pleasant Valley, has been in town for a few days in attendance at court. Just previous to starting for Globe he injured one of his hands and has been warding off symptoms of blood poisoning, under the caro of a physician.

Lee Troxel was in from the Okla homa mining company's properties Tuesday and reports work supended on the Jennie Captain shaft on account ol the large flow of water. He reports both drifts in the shaft in ore of a good grade. A shaft has been started on the large ledge of the Australia claim. This ledge carries good values in gold, silver and copper. Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Reppy and Mr. and Mrs. W. Y. Price visited the leach ing plant Tuesday. They found the plant running steadily and turning out a fine grade of copper. This plant is now beyond the experimental stage as it is daily demonstrating that the process in use will successfully and economically treat the large bodies of copper ores of the district, and will be a factor in the rapid develop ment of the mining industry in this section. Since it has been established beyond any doubt that the process will successfully treat the ores, there is little question but that the capacity of the plant will be increased in the near future.
