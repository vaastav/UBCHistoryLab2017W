WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1913 A Remarkable i Presidential Message. S President 'Wilson's message delivered fct the opening of the regular session of ths sixty-third congress yesterday ,ls remarkable in two respects first, for Sta fcrevlty; second, for the direct and JemstltSrfi manner In which, the head of "rtb ropuMl'cT finals with the important krae&tioBS now; &efore the American people'. The president's views on the pending currency Question are courteously ex pressed, but he leaves no doubt as to what he expects the senate to do and hwhen he expects it to be done. It Is jjuiter likely that the senate will not reoulre any further recommendation from the chief executive on this subj 'fleet. The treatment of the Huerta Tegime for, as the president says, Mexico has no government is about as force ful as the English language could make It, and it voices, we have no doubt, i the sentiments and convictions of the ! American people. j Our treaty objects and obligations, ,ta.nd our Philippine policy, are both ad ' mlrably stated. The tribute paid to the state department for its success in Effecting the numerous peace treaties mlreaxly ratified Is a deserved one, and the expressed policy of permitting the Philippines, to work out their own in dependence is in marked contrast to the Imperialistic tendency of the pre Vious administrations. That the trust question the preven tion of private monopoly is to be the paramount question before congress after'the currency bill has been dis posed of, 'the president makes thor oughly clear. And this question of private monopoly is to be handled, not by the. repeal or abrogation of any ex isting law, but by the addition where necessary of enactments that will make the present law more effective. Ob- viously the trusts have nothing to hope for from President "Wilson. The president's demand for an em ployer's liability act is in thorough ac cord with progressive sentiment every where and it ought to be given the at tention it deserves. The proposal that the government tshall build and operate a system of i-railroads in Alaska and control the t ports and terminals of that rich terri tory for the use of all of the people "Will meet violent opposition by the t special Interests, but the president's 1 position In the matter is one of the strongest features of his message. The recommendation of a system of direct primary nominations for the presidency and the abolition of nomi- Hating conventions is another strong " feature of the message, and congress should, enact the proposed legislation s before the session adjourns. This is smother matter that special interest f , politicians will oppose, but with pro : gxessive democracy in the saddle there ! ought to be no difficulty in putting the S recommendation into effect in time for f th nominations of 1916. Altogether, we believe President Wil . con's message, brief though it is, will ro down in history as one, of the greatest state documents ever submit ted. It puts into words the sentiments of a great people and the latter's rep resentatives in congress will do well to heed the advice contained therein. Our language exhibits many verbal I curiosities ; for instance, when a young ; man decides to stop sowing his wild oats and settles down th first thing he does generally is to settle tip his debts.

Yesterday morning The Journal sug gested that the state board of health should proceed to get rid of the fish fertilizer plant nuisance north of the city. We are now advised, however, that the state board has no authority in the premises but that the justice of the peace in whose district the nuisance is located Is the proper official to whom complaints should be made. The fol lowing state law Is cited: All nuisances which tend to annoy the community, or injure the health of the citizens generally, or to corrupt the public morals, shall be indictable and punishable by a fine not exceeding two hundred, dollars at the discretion of the court, and any nuisance which tends to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in -general, or is manifest ly injurious to the public health and. safety or tends to corrupt the manner and morals of the people may be re moved and suppressed by the order of the justice of the peace of the district founded upon the verdict of twelve householders of the same, who shall be summoned, sworn and Impaneled for that purpose, which order shall be directed to, and executed by any sheriff or constable of the county, ana an Indictment shall lie for the same. This all being the case, any 12 citi zens of the district Including Brent, Ferry Pass, and the city of Pensacola may be summoned byv Justice TV. I Johnson, pronounce the verdict and have the nuisance abated. If 12 .citizens who are ready to do this will just send their names to The Journal, this paper will take pleasure in presenting the list to Judge John son, who will no doubt issue the order as authorized by the law. If as many as 12 citizens do not want the nuisance abolished, they can simp ly say nothing and keep on smelling. , .

Mobile has adopted some excellent street regulations and restrictions and the chief of police issues the following notice concerning them: Don't cross down town Intersections diagonally, by cutting the corners. Don t fail to keep to the right when driving an auto or wagon or walking. Don't cut to the left with auto when rounding street intersection. Don't fail to get clear signal from traffic officer before crossing street in tersection. Don't fail to heed these Instructions, or the traffic officer will get you. These rules are good and they should be applied in crowded streets everywhere. , In this time of increasing street traffic and particularly with the increasing number of motor , vehicles, it is important that common sense traffic regulations should be provided and observed. The only wonder is that more accidents do not occur in all cities. . New Jersey woman ICO years old says to God belongs the credit.

Any man who would retain a Repub lican like Lorimer or Joe Lee in office for a holy minute Isn't the right kind of a Democrat to represent Florida in the United States senate. Arcadia Enterprise. Little Premature. The Pensacola News thinks Senator Fletcher was a little premature in sa luting Gov.

EMMETT WOLFE Miami Metropolis, The Metropolis has commented with approval upon the new Florida law, which provides that at their first meeting in January county commissioners counties make up a list of citizens of unquestioned integrity to serve as ju rymen when summoned. So disgusted have we been with the long-standing custom in Dade county of picking up any sort of a fellow for jury duty that we have hailed with hearty praise the coming new law. and here it seems that there has nover been any need of imposing street loaf ers, rum-soaks and gamblers upon the justice-seeking people. Judge Wolfe orders the court offi cers to go out and bring in business men of known respectability for jury service. The officer replies, with sur prise at the seeming impudence, that they won't come that they always of fer excuses, etc. The judge replies that it is the officer's duty to serve the papers for their appearance his. the duty to determine whether excuses for not serving are acceptable. A simple solution, most certainly. And the interesting part of it is that Judge Wolfe is wholly to be relied upon to not accept excuses that are mere duty-dodgers; he is not on the bench to make friends or to curry favor, he is there to do his work as a trusted administrator of the law, ex pediting the usual tedious meander ings of lawyer-tactics and refusing to grant postponements and continuances that are palpably offered as a means of thwarting justice. Judge Wolfe's presiding over Dade's circuit court has been an appreciated experience for everybody who has fol lowed the course of the court's busi ness thus far. With a wit as keen as a rapier's edge and discernment like that of a seer, both coupled with legal ability, of an exceptionally high order, he has given both lawyers and lay men something to think of during his sojourn here.
