' The Baltimore News announces that commencing next Sunday the publics lion of a Sunday evening edition of the News will begin. According to an nouncement it will be strictly a news paper—nqt a feature paper, and the price will be one cent, like the other issues, of the paper. This is a decided departure for the News, as since the foundation of the paper there has Aver been a Sunday issue of it. President Roosevelt apparently re alizing that Congress does not intend to do much more than collect salaries during the present session, has started out to keep the members supplied with reading mat ter, and thereby occupy their attentibn in a measure. Two- special messages have already been sent to them, in addition to the annual message. One of the special messages concerns the dismissal of the negro soldiers, and the other is in relation to the Panama canal scandal. \ At the Rivers and Harbors Congress, in session at Washington last week, sen timent in favor of the issuance of Govern ment bonds for a comprehensive improve ment of the rivers, harbors and canals of the country, to the end that this nation shall have the greatest system of water ways in the world, gained headway. The scheme contemplates the issuance of ssop, 000,000 worth of Federal bonds for internal watercourses, to be distributed over a ten year period, or $50,000,000 annually, and enthusiastic indorsement was given to the proposition. The Delaware State Grange in annual session at Dover last week put itself on record on the temperance question, not being content alone with the passage of a resolution favoring Local Option, and submitting reports showing that crime and arrests have fallen off in Kent and Sussex counties since Local Option has become operative there, and that condi tions have greatly improved, but showed their interest in furthering the cause by adopting resolntions relative to the ship ment of liquor from “wet” into "dry” ' districts, and demanding that the Legis lature pass a law prohibiting this, as well as the printing of liqnor advertisements iu papers in dry districts. Despite the fact they Presidential wrath, and running the risk of being elected to the Ananias Club, some of the members of Congress have had the hardihood to demand an investi gation of the Panama canal scandal, growing out of the charges that the pur chase of the canal from the French com pany was engineered by the President’s Cabinet advisers; that "the money was paid not to the French government, as alleged, but tb J. P. Morgan & Co., and that J 15.000.000 of the $40,000,000 was paid to the stockholders of a New Jersey syndicate, and $5,000,000 more is still lying in the treasury of this New Jersey corporation; and that $10,000,000 more was paid by the United States to foster the revolution that took the strip of land in the canal zone away from Columbia. The charges have had the effect of call ing forth a special message from the President, which fairly bristles with strong language and dismisses the whole matter as a tissue of falsehood. The I President goes after ihe New -York World and its proprietor, laying the blame of starting the whole agitiation there, and declaring Joseph Pulitzer, the proprietor is a libeler and villifier and should be brought to iustice. If the reports of the public press are to be credited the message wss received by Congress more in the nature of a colossal joke than any degree of seriousness. The total popular vote of the Presi dential candidates at the last national election, shows the following votes cast: Taft, Republican; 7,637,676; Bryan, Dem ocrat, 6,393,182; Debs, Socialist, 448,453; Cbafin, Prohibitionist, 241,252; Hisgen, Independence, 83,186; Watson, Populist, 33,871; Gilhaus, Socialist Labor, 15,421. Total for all candidates, 14,852,239 This grand total exceeds by 1,341,531 the total number of votes cast iu the Presidential election of 1904. when the grand total was 13.510,708. Compared with that election, the candi dates of the Repub’ican, Democratic aud Socialist parties increased their vote this 5 ear. The reverse is true of the candi dates of the Prohibition, Populist and Socialist Labor parties. The Indepen- 1 dence party did not figure in jbe contest' of four years ago. The greatest difference in a party vote ' is shown in an increase for Bryan of 1,315,211 over the total vote cast in 1904 for Alton B. Parker, the Democratic candidate. Taft received 14,190 votes more than were polled' for President Roosevelt in 1904, and Debs ran 45,368 ahead of bis predecessor on the Socialist ticket. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. - WitlT both houses of Congress in ses sion and both the President and the President elect in the city, with the ad dition of three numerously attended im portant conventions, discussing water ways, forest conservation and other mat ters of the greatest national importance, there is so much to write aboot that the main difficulty is one of selection. The President and the President-elect, as is well known, are the closest of.friends. The latter bears a relation to the former that is /Closely analogous to that of heir apparent, or crown prince. He is politi cally the well beloved son of the although they are nearly the same age, President Roosevelt being less than a year older than Judge Taft. But so busy has Presidenl Roosevelt been talking and scolding and so much occupied has Judge Taft been dining, breakfasting and lunching with his many friends and dis cussing political questions with Speaker Cannon and the members of the Ways and Cleans Committee, that he and the President have not been able to spend a minute together. In a few days, Judge Taft will go south to Augusta, Ga , where he will be the guest of a prominent and wealthy Southerner and where he will remain a gieater part of the time until the' fourth of March. Then he will, of course, take up a temporary residence, for four years at least, in the White House, while the President will cross the seas and -deserts and plunge into the depths of the Dark Continent, where pol itics and visiting delegations will trouble him no more. V Judge Taft expressed the belief last week that the House of Representatives would make an honest and thorough re vision of the tariff at the extra session which he is pledged to call for tariff re vision, immediately after his inauguration. He bases this statement on an interview which be had with Speaker Cannon about the middle of- the week and with the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee the following day at the residence of the President’s son-in law, Hon. Nicholas Longwortb. Mr. Taft has not yet consulted Republican Senators who will no douDt have some thing to say about the tariff bill after it comes frpm the House, but he gave an intimation that he might even veto a bill ' that had received the imprimatur of both the House and the Senate, if it did not conform with his views as a fulfillment of the pledges made in the Republican plat form at Chicago and by himself, when he said in an address at Milwaukee : "Mr. Bryan says there has been no in dication that the revision may not be up ward rather than downward. In answer I can say that the party is pledged to a genuine revision and as the temporary head of that party and President of the United States, if it be successful in No vember, I expect to use the influence that I have by calling immediately a special session and by recommending to Congress to secure a genuine and honest revision of the tariff in accordance with the prin ciple of protection laid down in the plat form, based upon the examination of appropriate evidence and impartial as be tween consumer and manufacturer.” V There is doubtless some opposition to Speaker Cannon and bis re-election in his own party in Congress This opposition, however, is not as strong and universal as is the feeling in the White House and probably throughout the country. The President, as is well known, believes in the present and the future. He favors young men in the Army and Navy and doubtless thinks there should be more young men in Congress He perhaps would accede to such wisdom as may be in the maxim “Old men for counsel and young men for war.” But statesmanship or counsel according to bis theory, is no longer in diplomacy antf chicanery of the Macchiavellian type, but war and con tention against stationary stand pat and retrogressive tendencies. The Speaker belongs to a past generation and the ways of the fathers aud their grandfathers, the old time religion, is good enough for him. There is no doubt but that the President elect is iu sympathy with the. President, both as to his likes and dislikes, though I his temperment is less explosive and he 1 has more geniality and | tact than President Roosevelt, but it is a I mistake to suppose his suaviter in modo in any way regatives his fortiter iu re. V The special Chinese envoy sent to thank this government for the return of $■1,000,000 Boxer indemnity has sent to the White House as a present to Mrs Roosevelt a tiger skin and many bales of Chinese silk. The annual report of {he Secretary of Agriculture, just made public, shows among other things that may be of inter est to our farmers, that the value of all farm products of 1938 reaches the most extraordinary total in the nation’s history —s7 778,00 b, 000. The gain over is $290,000,000. Greatest of all crops is Indian corn, whose production this year is 2,643,0011,000 bushels, worth $1,615,- 000,000. This crop is worth this year nearly as much as the great crops of cotton, hay and wheat combined. The greatest hay crop in history has been gathered this year, 68,000,000 tons, or 12 per cent above the average of the preceding five years. Its price is $2 per ton less than it was a year ago, but still the farm value of the crop is $621,000,000, or 6 per cent above the five-year average Wheat is per cent above the five year average in production and 23 per ceut above in total value. The 660,000,- 000 bushels of this crop are estimated to be worth $620,000,000 to the farmers, or $66,000,000 more than the most val uable wheat crop heretofore produced. Although the oat crop suffered from drouth, the value is $321,000,000, for 789,000,000 bushels, or 10 per cent above the five-year average value and 9 per ceut below the average product. ‘ Rye remains in the notch that it has occupied in pro duction in recent years, but its value, $22,000,000, is 17 per cent above the average. All cereals aggregate 4,329,000,000 bushels, a total that has been exceeded three times, but the value reaches $2,694,000,000, or more than $300,000,- 000 above that of 19*7, and exceeds still more the totals of former years. Com pared with the preceding five years, the number of bushels is higher by 0.2 per cent and the value higher by 32 per cent. Unfavorable weather made the potato crop only 275,000,000 bushels, or 5 per cent below the five year average, altbongh the value, $190,000,000, is iS per cent above and was never equaled by any former crop. Although the farmer gets hardly 20cts. a pound for his butter, between 3 and 4 cents a quart for his milk, and about 1 cents for each egg, yet the value of the farm products of the dairy cow is getting close to
