City Cemeteries.?The cities of the dead which lie along the banks of Hunting creek *n Fairfax county, on tbo southwestern edge of this city, have spread from two acres in 1808 to some thirty acres, and the last addition, some six acres purchased by the trustees of the M. E. church south, Is now being laid off. The new cemetery will be between Hamilton lane and West street extended, will adjoin Penn's hill and St. Paul's cemeteries, and will add largely to the area of the city cemeteries. Before 1808 four cemetcrles were open near the middle of town. Three of them?the Friends', Christ church, and the First Presbyterian?still remain cemeteries, but unused. The other, old St. Paul's cemetery, was situated on Fairfax street just south of Green's factory; but the dead have long since been removed from there, and dwel ling houses and a ooal yard now occupy the site of the old graveyard and church. The Washington School Grounds.?The workmen are engaged In cutting down the side walk in front of the Washington school build ing. The building will be underpinned, and it seems to be a good Idea to put in au ornamental front, adding to the appearance or North Wash ington street, which is now being Improved and will, If all the sidewalks are laid, be one ol the handsomest thoroughfares in ti<e city. It was the expectation of the Alexander execu tors, when in 1780-'5 they laid out Washington and Franklin streets each loo feet wide, that their junction would form the finest portion of the city. So far the expectation is very far from realization. Police Retort.?The only prisoner at the station-house this morning is James Winters, charged with stealing a razor flrom Wm. Sim mons.

PUZZLED EJTGLI9H POLITICIANS. What ComUm(leas Will Be formed la Order t? Euare a Stable ttorera meat Kot Yet Apparent?Position of the Tories. Special Cable Dispatch to The Evksiso Star. London, Dec. 10.?Much depends in the Im mediate future on the tines which any possible disintegration of the parties may take, and whether there are symptoms of a split in the liberal ranks consequent on the chance of a coalition of moderates. The following history of a radical candidature is the first to throw light on the problem. The candidate, whom I will call Mr. A., expressed to Mr. Chamberlain his desire to represent a radical constituency, a town in north Scotland, which wanted a radi cal to oppose a whig, because in Scotland the wblgs take the plaoe of the tories. So he ap* piled to Chamberlain, who sent Mr. A. He was received with en thus lam and seemed sure of election. Thereupon Mr. Gladstone, Lord | Roseberryand Lord Richard Groevenor, the late liberal whip, telegraphed one after another strongly urging the voters to support A.'s oppo nent. A. was therefore defeated, but received a letter of sympathy from Mr. Chamberlain, who said bis defeat doubtless was entirely due to Mr. Gladstone's opposition. Tbis incident, which can be relied upon, taken in connection with Chamberlain's aud Gladstone's speech at Leicester dircctly afterwards, foreshadows the character of the coming political developments. 1 am Informed on excellent authority that the policy of the tories will bo the construction of legislation to "dish" the whig*, including as large a measure of county government as the liberals. This will be easy now, because the old tory country partv is completely annihilated. When parliament meets no attempt will be made immediately to overthrow Lord Salisbury, who will not act I unconstitutionally in retaining office, because although the tories ran candidates against the Parneilites the latter were elected to oppose the liberals. The conservatives will not introduce any measure of home rule as a bribe, preferring opposition with honor rather than place at a price, and feeiing certain also that any terms by which Gladstone could propitiate Parnell would alienate the bulk of the whIgs. Parnell, too, like O Connell in a similar position, will accept much less than be demands. Tbis reaches me straight from one of the loaders ot the tory party. J9J the elect o is areover exempt six, therefore, I venture to prophecy that the ultimate figures will be?liberals, 334; conservatives, 250; Par neilites, 86. The coalition of the last two will thus form a majority of two. This, compared with the last parliament, will leave ihe liberals weaker by 17 votes, the conservatives stronger by 12, and the Parneilites stronger by 22. Again, the liberals have gained 80 votes in the counties, but lost 91 in the towns. The tories have lost 18 in the counties and gained 33 in the towns. If my estimate of the next six re sults is correct, this concludes the election fig ures. NO AUTOPSY TO BE HELD. The Coroner Satisfied Mr. Yanderbllt Died of Cerebral Apoplexy. New York, Dec. 10.?The undertaker was early at Mr. Vanderbilt's this morning. He had been to New Dorp, Staten Island, and made preparations for the final interment there to-morrow. Two of the sons ol the dead man, William and George, sat up all night as watchers, and Mrs. Vanderbilt passed hours be side the body. The luneral arrangements will not be changed. Private services will be held at the house and afterward the funeral will take place from St. Bartholomew's church.

HEALTH O* FACTORY OPERATIVES?THE QUESTION OF MARITIME QUARANTINE?A COMMISSION TOr STUDY YELLOW FEVER PRO POSED. When the American Public Health associa tion reassembled at Willard hall this morning a series of resolutions from the Philadelphia board ot health was read. These resolution* declared that no rags from foreign ports shall be permit ted to land at the port of Philadelphia until they shall have been disinfected, and urged upon the A. P. H. A. the necessity or passing judgment upon the matter of the im portation of rags, and requested the association to recommend the thorough disinfection of Im ported rags In every part of the United States before they are destributed for manufacturing purposes. The resolution was referred to a special committee for consideration and recom mendation. THE FOLLOWING NEW MEMRERS were elected: Dr. Andrew W. Imrie, Detroit; Dr. Jno. W.Jones, of Tarborough, N. C.; Dr. J. Howard Taylor, Philadelphia; Dr. Chas. Far quhar, Olney, Md.; & J. Hanuan, Washington, D. C.; Dr. Carl H. Horsch, Dover, N. H.; Dwight A. Richardson, Osceola, Ark.; Drs. Thos. Taylor, Jas. T. Young, Z. T. Sowers and D. P. Morgan, of this city. An auditing committee, consisting of Drs. O. W. Wight.of Detroit; L.W. Bailey, ot Louisville, and P. F. Wood, of Wilmington, N. C., was ap pointed. MANUFACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The executive committee presented a new draft of the resolution offered by Mr. Lomb yes terday, as follows: "That the A. P. H. A. re spectfully recommends to the commissioner of statistics and labor the appointment of one or more commissioners ot experts, whose duty it shall be to visit the principal factories and workshops in this country, to examine them oarelully with reference to the provisions made lu them to insure the health of the employes, and to report on the same with recommenda tions." This resolution was adopted. AGAINST A NATIONAL SANITARY EXHIRITION. The executive committee* reported that in their judgment the proposition made In a reso lution offered by Dr. Chancellor, secretary of the Maryland state board of health, to appoint a committee of nine to consider the practicability of holding a national sanitary exhibition In this city in 1887 was inexpedient. Dr. John H. Raucli, secretary of the state board of health of Illinois, read a paper on "Maritime (Quarantine from the Mouth of the St. Lawrence to the Rio Grande." Dr. Rauch's paper contained a most ex haustive account ol the quarantine precautions taken in every part of the Union with s tricturcs and suggestions. He was followed by Dr. Joseph Holt, president of the state board ot health ot Louisiana, with a paper on "San itary Protection ot New Orleans, Municipal and Maritime." 

YELLOW FEVER. Dr. Holt offered a series ot resolutions. Which was referred to the executive committee, ask* ing Congress to provide for the appointment ol a commission of three members?one of known ability and special attainment in biological re search, and particularly in the department of microscopic Investigation, the other two medi cal men of recognized ability and experience to visit Rio Janeiro, Mexico, and, If necessary, Panama, Colon and Havana, to investigate the methods pursued In those places to protect the unacclimated against yellow fever lntection. The resolutions proposed that #30,000 be ap propriated to pay the salaries and expenses of the commission, and that each member of the commission should receive as a recompense 95,000. The last paper of the morning was on "Mari time Sanitation," and was read by Dr. 8. T. Armstrong, of the marine hospital service. The association adjourned a little alter 1 o'clock. NEW ARRIVALS.

SENATOR SHARPLY CRITICISES THE SECRE TARY OF WAR. In the Senate to-day Mr. Dolph introduced a bill to amend the act of the last Congress to allow to officers and soldiers compensation for personal property tost at their quarters while they are absent on duty. The Secretary of War in his report called attention to this act and advised that it be modified and restricted, as It was ehtlrely too broad in its terms. Mr. Dolph lu his remarks agreed substanti ally with the Secretary, saying the act as it stood practically allowed compensation for personal property lost by officers and soldiers under any circumstances. In some remarks upon the bill Mr. Logan criticised the Secretary of War for what he had said in his report on the subject of this bill. He said the Secretary had made some blunders, and intimated that while he may be an able jurist he Is incompetent as Secretary. Mr. Logan said a boy 01 sixteen ought to under stand the statute, and made other flings at the Secretary. The bill was finally referred to the military committee. ??? Disallowed and Reduced. MORE %AR DEPARTMENT VOUCHERS STOPPED BY CONTROLLER MAYNARD. Second Controller Maynard has disallowed a voucher of $1,550 and reduced another from fl,000 to $64 In the aocounts of Paymaster Wm. Smith, of the army, being the amounts paid to Wm. E. Hogan and Daniel T. Ames In May, 1881, for services as expert witnesses in handwriting in the case of Cadet Johnson C. Whittaker, tried by general court martial in 1880. The compensation was at the rate of flOO per day for Hagan and over f60 per day in the case of Ames. The vouchers were certified as correct and just by Asa 1J. Gardner, judge advocate, but are not approved by the Secretary of War. nor is any authority shown for the employment of expert witnesses. The second controller re views the statutes in relation to the pay ol witnesses before courts-martial in his opiuiou, and says that so tar as he can learn the pay of civilian witnesses before such courts is re stricted to #4 per day. He holds that neither in the statutes nor elsewhere is there iany recognition of the right of expert witnesses to an increased compensation. *?? Where den. Bailer Agma with the President. Gen. B. F. Butler was at the Capitol to-day. A Star reporter met him in the clerk's room ol the Supreme Court. "W hat do you think of the President's mes sage?" asked the reporter. "I have not read It all," replied the general, extending his hand. "I have read some ol it, however, and several points struck me as very good. One In particular I remember. The President refers to .the Judge advo cate general of the army's report, and says he sees by it that about half the army had been court-martialed daring the year. He had read some of these oourftmartial pro ceedings himself, and was of the opinion "?Vt there ought to be some better means than court martial of guarding the honor and dignity of the army. I agree with the PTesiOent ln this." HOW 

THEY ST A WD IS UrtMXCt TO THE PEND? nro piorarriOM *ot M riu*8?. The committees of the Home cannot be ap pointed until after the rale* are adopted, as the importance of several of the committees will probably be affected by the laws of tha Boose decided upon. Tbe impression Is pretty fede ral that Mr. MorrtaodV plan, or something similar to It, will he repdtied by theeommlttee. and If that plan is adopted by the House at least one man having some knowledge of ap propriations will have to be placed on each ot the oommittees among which the apprupria Uonsare distributed. Proro the make ?p ot the committee it is Judged thai they will recom mend the distribution af the Mtpropriatious bills, and practically everything else contained in the Morrison rdsolaUpii, '' It is understood that Mr. Carlisle approved of the resolution before it was introduced. Mr. Reid and Mr.Morrlsonare prstty close together, and though the former has a plan of his own. It is said that he looks ntqRably upon that of toe gentleman from Illinois. A member who has talked with Mr. Htooook Informs a Stab re porter that he will not oppose Mr. Morrison's plan. . ^ ? From this It appear* thai tin Hand all win be tbe only one to oppose the noMRntion ife the committee. It will probably stand fofcr to one for a change of the rales, and Mr. Randall will be likely to bring In a minority report. The sentiment la the House seems to be favorable to a Change ot the rules, but quite a strong and poaslMjr suc cessful opposition to the dlstn button of the ap propriation bills is llhaly tdoprinfc ap. Many of the conservative mem beta approve of Mr M >rrison's resolution In every particular, bu 1 tuink it would be better to let all the appropri* ations remain In one oommlttee, whose author ity, however, ?rlll be restricted to the routine matter of appropriation merely, and who will be obliged to report within a speciled time. The general opposition to tbt old rules may, however, lead to tbe most radical changes. Many republicans say they would vote tor most anything, and ask for nothing, except the assurance that the old rules will be eradicated. The trouble attending the change of rules heretofore has been that the old members generally opposed any change, and awed the new men, who got lost In the parlia mentary labyrinths. Now the old members arc divided on the question, and the majority are clamoring for a change. Capital Topic*. TBE NOMINATIONS REFERRED. The Senate, in executive session, this after noon referred to appropriate oommittees the nominations sent In to-day. SENATOR LOGAN TO BE RESTORED TO THE HEAD OF THE XILITABY COMMITTEE. The republican caucus committee has de cldod to restore Gen. Logan to his old position as chairman of the Senate military committee. Senator Sewell, the present chairman, is to take tbe chairmanship of tbe library commit tee, to be made vacant by the election of Mr. Sherman, the present chairman, as President pro tempore. ? Executor*' Bonds. In the Senate to-day Mr. Gall introduced the bill, which failed in the last Congress, provi ding that when a testator requests in his last will that no bond shall be required of bis executor or executors, then they shall be required to give only such surety as will cover the debts of tbe deceased and any taxes that may be due on the property. Referred to the Judiciary committee. Crop Keporta.
