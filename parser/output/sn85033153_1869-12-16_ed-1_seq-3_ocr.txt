Hacb.^ — I The race which was to come off last Saturday was postponed notil next Saturday afternoon, when a lively contest is to vorae off.o pen for all horses whose time exceeds 2:17 1 Broke His Neck.—On Saturday last, as a valuable horse belonging to Mr. A. D. Jones was drawing a load of edgings up the hill near that gentleman’s mill, he slipped and broke his neck, killing him almost instantly. Personal. —W. W. Waldo, Esq., our County Judge elect, returned from an extended visit to friends in the east on Monday, looking hale and hearty as usual. —Our friend Tom Cole, one of the m dispe nsibles of the Beckman House, in Sheboygan, showed bis handsome phiz in our sanctum this morning. Wanted. —There are three marriage able young ladies in Manitowoc to one yonng man. A “healthy immigration” of the latter would be relished by the fair ones. Improvement. —That wide-awake pa per, the Appleton Pott , now prints its own outsides, which is a decided im provement on the ‘ ‘patent arrangement. That shows energy, too, and a good sup port. Margin. —Thera will be no additional charge lor the extra margin on our paper this week. The irregularity of the boats, and our inability to get our paper from Milwaukee on time is what s the mat ter.

There is nothing so cheap and entertaining as reading, and a choice list is offered to select from. Died. —The death of the estimable wife of Sam. Ryan, Jr., editor of the Appleton Crescent , occurred in that city •on the Ist inst, after a long and painful illness. Bro. Ryan has the heartfelt sympathies,of a host of friends through out the State in his great affliction. ■ m • ■ Railroad Meeting at Mishicott.— The people of this lively little town held a meeting last week on the railroad ques tion, and showed themselves strongly in •favor of a Lake Shore Road—promising to take stock in th same and pay either in cash or ties. Such a universal com motion means business, we think, and epeaks well for that little town. Don’t Do It.— We hava frequently noticed that many of the boys,—and in acme cases “old boys”—are in the habit of creating an unpleasant commotion in the post office while awaiting the distri bution of the mail. This is a great an noyanco to our post-master and as the practice is rudj and ungentlemanly we hope it will be stopped. Two Rivers. —We learn irom our correspondent “0.” at Two Hirers that a cooper shop was destroyed by fire in that village on Thursday last, causing a savers loss to the owner, us he had a ■considerable amount of provisions stowed in it; also that the railroad excitement has not abated any, and that all are in favor of a railroad somewhere. We sin ■oerely hope they will have it soon. Provoking. —There should, in our opinion, be some measures taken to avoid the delay caused every time it is neces sary to open our bridge, Eor some rea son it usually takes from fifteen minutes to half an hour to open and close it, and all that time a long string of teams and a crowd of pedestrians are gathered at both ends anxious to cross. Either put the bridge is such a condition that it will tarn easily or else build anew one at Main Street, Marine. —Below will be found a list of vessels and steamers that have gone into winter quarters at this port, with the tonnage of each.

The boiler of the Comet has been transferred to her hold. Harbor Appropriations. —We learn from a Washington Dispatch that Gen. Humphreys recommends among other appropriations for the next fliscal year, on western harbors and rivers, the fol lowing on Lake Michigan.

On, Dont! —The Sheboygan Times has the unblushing impudence to say that the water in that little creek is deep er and affords better advantages than ours. Were it not an utter impossibility for a craft larger than a good sized fish ing boat to got into the river through the promiscuously placed lot of timber hon ored with the title of harbor , we would be willing to acknowledge that there was a “showing” for preference ; but just now there isn’t. When Sheboygan river float* the steamer Manitowoc we guaran tee to charter the G eat Eastern to give an excursion to the Rapids. Again Stricken. —Last week we made mention of the sad experiences of Mr. Weinschenk—he having lost three children in one week by scarlet fever— who has again been afflicted, his oldest son —the last one, expiring on Friday last, a victim of the same ravaging dis ease. Surely such an overwhelming succession of losses seems almost too much to bear, and we are sure that all our citizens sympathize with the bereav ed parents in their great sorrow. The deceased being a member of the band, his funeral was attended by both, as also a large processien of sympathizing friends. 42r> Congress. —List oj Wisconsin Members. —The following is a list of the Members of the United States Sen ate, and of the Members of the House of Representatives —all Republicans ex cepting Chas.

CARD. Thanks ! thanks ! many thanks for the kind response of a generous public. The First Presbyterian Society of Manitowoc, a few weeks since, asked for two thousand dollars to he used in preliminary winter work on their proposed new church. — That sum has been fully subscribed, and nearly ail paid. Our arrangements for contracting the whole work have been made. We look forward with the ex pectation that our beautiful structure will be complete within one year from to-day. Besides our available resources, and pledges made by responsible parties, we need, during the coming year, from the citizens of this village and county, four thousand dollars to carry out our contract. Lumber in all forms for building, shingles, lime, iron, nails and materials for paint ing, and team work during the winter, all could be made to count with us as casln if volunteered soon, and help along our work. Can we not confidently appeal to a public proved already to be so gener ous, with an assurance that an object so complimentary 7 to village and county taste and pride, they will not suffer to fail, when now within such easy roach ? In behalf of the Ist Presbyterian Society of Manitowoc. C. B. Stevens, Pastor. Lewis Sherman. R. 11. Hoes, E. K. Rand, Building Committee. Manitowoc Wis. Dec. 9th 1869. "Wasted. —A Skating rink. Why don't someone “go in,” as it would be a well-paying business.

He says : “A newspaper having a known office of publication, notwithstanding one side of the same is printed in another county or State, is entitled to the same privileg es as though both sides were printed .at the said office of publication. —For an interesting letter frem Mishi oott, sea second page. Communicated. THE TOTE. A vote w'as taken December Bth on the two thousand dollar railroad proposition, and the proposition was defeated by a large majority. What does this vote mean? It means simply business; it means that Manitowoc understands its railroad affairs, and knows both who are its friends, and its enemies. The vote does not mean that the Western road should not be built, and built speedily, but it means that Manitowoc cannot build two roads at once, hence must build on% of the two proposed roads first. One great difficulty has been, that the village has been divided between doing two things, constructing a Weetern road and a Lake Shore road. There have been two strong parties contending against each other, instead of joining hands, and go ing forth as one man to the work of bring ing a railroad into this large and already antique village. “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” As long as one party is for one road, and the other party for another, it will be all oscilation of power and no application of power ; the nearest approximation to business will bs windy debate. There have been two objects inviting attention and hence consequental delay as to which one to attend to. This mo dus operand! emphatically won’t do. It should be all of Manitowoc with one pur pose ; for we have great obstacles to over come, in short, too much to do to be do ing against each other. In unity there is strength, and in singleness of purpose, there is promptness and energy of action. The vote has decided that the Lake Shore road ought to be built first. On* reason is, that it is the smallest of the two things to be done. It is a longer road, but we can get more help. The small towns on the Lake Shore can throw in their mitj, but it is the rich railroad companies that taka the contract* and furnish the capital for building rail roads. Those companies are of Mil waukee. They can under bid any eastern company, for one reason, among others, that they are nearer home. Milwaukee is going to he our great help in construct ing the Lake Shore road, for that road will be for its interests. But if we com mence the building of a Western road now, Milwaukee will look on wdth a jeal ous eye, and cripple ■ the entei prise if possible; while the country along the Ce darburg and Chilton route will be no bet ter off than before. But propose to build the Lake Shore road, and the Chilton route would be glad of the compromise, and Milwaukee would rejoice atone more iron grasp on the wealth of the North west. The people of the Chilton route are greatly in earnest, they are powerful ly supported on both ends of the line, and to swerve them from their purpose of baying a road through their midst at the earliest opportunity, will require the immediate application of all the mon ey and energy the Lake Shore towns can command. Does any one think that the Chilton route is going to wait two or three years for the Western road, when the construction of that road would greally damage the interests of its own route ? There would not bo any such waiting done, and Manitowoc, at the end of that time, would wake up from its stultified lethargy, to find itself in the centre of a triangl* of highways and the wheat of its very suburbs leaving it alone to starve to death. This matter will go before the legislature at its coming session, and the Chiiton route and the Lake Shore route will bid against each other; then will be the time when the fate of this village will bo decided, and let every man of it, who has a railroad dollar, or a railroad idea, be at the auction. The president of the western road desires the construction of that road tirst. Why is he so obstinate about it ? Why does bo not cheerfully and patriotically succumb to the wishes of a large majority of the people of Manitowoc? The argument is against him, and he can see that as well as any body else. The reason of his persistent opposition is this; that every sensible man has always some deep underlying motive , which is the soul and prompter of his acts. The motive in this case is that he has an interest in a large tract of wood ed land, whose value the building of a Western road would increase ten-fold, and which be has been holding up to the eyes of numerous railroad companies, East and West, for some years past, and saying “bow much will you bid.' 1 He has looked over the heads of the masses of the people, and been dallying with them these many years,and procrastinating the construction of any railroad at all, just for the purpose of getting a higher bid than he has yet been offered ; and when that maximum hid is given, then as to himself, welcome fortune and good bye railroads. The Western road to be sure is neces sary, but not as necessary now as it will be after the Lake Shore road is built. The one road will be the iudespensable complement to the other; either will pay much better after the other is com pleted; for passengers will, come here from the West with a view ot being able to go South, and from the South with the view of being able to go immediately West. And natures great harbor here would at tract avast freight both from the far east and the far west. Vanderbilt has got his eye on a long natural line of transpor tation, sweeping a vast range of country from western Minnesota to Manitowoc, and from thence east. The factories of the Fox are growling, the dense forests of the north are moaning, and the iron knuckles of Superior are peremptorilly rapping for admission, at the Golden Gate ot Lake Michigan. They shall be admitted. But if we would do what is easiest, first, and what pays best, soonest, and what is naturally fundamental and antecedent to another duty, and what, if it is not done now, can’t be done at all, we must go one and every bod., for the Lake Shore Road, —Don’t fail to attend the Lecture at the Methodist Church next Monday etc., Letter List.
