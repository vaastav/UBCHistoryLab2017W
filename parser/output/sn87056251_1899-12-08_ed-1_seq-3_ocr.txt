PRFX nFNT 3 fl 1L,CS & Condensed Report of Address to Washington Special: Frefident Mc Kinleys message to the LVIth con gress was one of the lengthiest ever submitted to the senate and house of representatives of the United States. The death of Vice-President Hobart, who passed from thi.s life on the room ing of Xov. 21 last, i-s mentioned as n event congres-s is railed to mourn at the threshold of its deliberations. The president pronouiuvs a high eneonium upon a private life whh h was yure and elevated and a puldic career distin guished by large capacity, stainless in tegrity and exalted motives. In beginning his review of national and international relations and ques tions the president calls attention t: the present conditions of unusual pros perity, of univor.vci! good will among the reopte at horee and the relations of peace and friendship that exist with every government of the world. As an ele-.nent of this unu.-ml prospeiity our foreign commerce, it Ls f-tated, has si own great increase in volume and value, th coml)ined imports and ex ports for the twelvemonth being the greatest ever recorded in a single year of our history. It is mentioned as a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the prodiu-ts our manufactories sold abroad exceeded there bought abroad were and Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June CO, 1899, aggregated $510.fS2.001.3; expendi tures were $70 0 t.01 leaving a de ficit of SSO 111,.V.?.;7. The estimated receipts fov th? current year aggregat ed $40.958,112; estimated expendi tures, $G0o,33$,li2. leaving a surplus of j iy?ooo,t'00. The strength of the treasury is grati fying. On luv. I. 1VJ3. the available e?sh balance was ?278,004,S"7.72, of which ?23t.714.f.!0.-..:M was in gold coin and bullion. Customs receipts are now almost entirely paid in gold. Owing to this favorable condition of the treasury v. ith respect to the cash on hand compliance with the provisions of the sinking fand, disregarded for eight years on accruut of deficiencies In the revenues, was resumed, the treasury department purchasing dur ing November SlS.4uS,".yo of the 5 kr cent loan of 1901, thus making a net saving of about $2.$s."i,000 in interest. The government will continue to pur chase bonds to the extent of $23,000,000 in all provided these are offered and purchased up to and including Dec. 23. Increased activity in industry and agriculture and consequent larger em ployment of labor at higher wages adds to the capacity of the people to absorb the circulating medium. These changed and changing conditions have impaired the national banking act as To making the needful addition to the circulation. The attention of congress is therefore invited to this subject with a view to making this act more re sponsive to the people's needs. The president again urges, therefore, that national banks be authorized to organ ize with a capital of ?r,,io. He also recommends that the secretary of the treasury be given additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to maintain the parity in valce of the two metals. goM and feil ver, nd the equal power of every dol lar at all times in the market and In the payment of debts. Gold now seeks the treasury, but adequate provision should be made to insure the continu ance of the gold standard and of pub lic confidence in the ability of the gov ernment to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized world reeognizes as the best. In this con nection the president repeats his form er recommendation that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a tr;st fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except in gold. Relating to American merchant ma rine it is recommended that legisla tion should be enacted which will give to the country maritime strength com mensurate with its industrial achieve ments and its rank among the nations of the earth. Only in this way ran we MTiire our share in the valuable car rying trade of the world. The present situation in this respect, the president, sajs. is regarded with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad. On the subject of trusts the presi dent declares they are justly provoking public discussion and should claim the attention ef congress. The indus trial commission, created by act of eongress June 18. 1898. has not yet completed its investigations of this subject. Whatever power congress has in the way of controlling or check ing these monopolies should be promptly ascertained and asserted. At tn :on is called to the recommenda tions of President Harrison in his an nual message of Dec. 3, 1889, and to that of President Cleveland In his an nual message of Dee. 7, 1896. a- well as to the act of July, 1890, bearing upon this subject. It is noted that the stato legislation to which President Cleveland looked for relief from the ?vil of trusts has failed fully to accom plish that object, owing principally to the fa t that different states take dif ferent views as to the proper way to discriminate between evil and injuri ous combinations and thos.e associa tions which are beneficial and neces sary to the business prosperity of the country. The president adds that uni formity in state legislation on this subject is much to bo desired and ex presses the hope that means may be found for congress within the limita tions of constitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete sys tem of laws and compel a general ob servance of the salutary rules to which he refers. In his view of our relations to for eign states the president notes the set tlement of the long-pending boundary- LI 1 8 His Third Annual Congress, dispute between 'h? Argentine repub lic and Chile, Jn -vhich the United Siatej- minister at Huenos Ayres served as innj'iie. A convention of extradi tion between Argentina and the United States awaits some slight changes in the text before exchange. Reference is made to the claim of the Austro-llungarian government for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian subjects at I-ittimer, Pa., Sept. 10, 1S97. As the sheriff and his deputies tried for their murder were acquitted by the courts this govern ment, after due consideration, declined to indemnify the sufferers. Note is made of various minor diffi culties and insurrections in certain South American and Central American republics and the changes resulting. The RlucfleMs controversy is still un settled. The events of the past year looking to an isthmian canal are recapitulated and reasons for early action in the matter are urged. Kvents In China as far as concerns American interests are recounted and the extension of the area opened to foreign settlement is referred to. The significant statement is made on this subject that our commercial rights in China under existing treaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year, as they will be in the future. A commission to study the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese empire is recommended. No time should be lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for American trade and enter prise. The Paris exposition and the prepar ations of this country to take part in it are related at length, and the Im portance of a representative display is urged. The United States government building, now approaching completion, will be worthy in beauty of architec tural plan and in completeness of dis play to represent this nation. There will be over 7,00 exhibitors for every state of our country, not including ex hibits from Cuba, Porto Rico and Ha waii, for which arrangements have been made. Our relations with (lermany con tinue to be most cordial and the state ment is made that in all the promises closer relations of intercourse and commerce and a better understanding between two races having so many traits in common, Germany can be as sured of the most cordial co-operation of this government and people. Vari ous matters pertaining to certain re strictions fif trade between the two countries and also the satisfactory set tlement of most of them and a recom mendation for a joint commission of experts and practical men of affairs for the investigation of production and exportation in both countries is urged. As to affairs with Great Britain the work of the joint high commission is recapitulated and the arrival at a har monious modus vivuidi in the Alaskan boundary dispute gives hope of a per manent satisfactory settlement. In other matters the relations between the United States and Canada and Gieat liritain remain most friendl. In the unfortunate contest between the Boer states of Africa and Great liritain this government has maintain ed an attitude of neutrality. In the exercise of customary good offices of a neutral for the care of IJritish inter ests opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of this govern ment toward both combatants. As to the deplorable events at Tallu- lah, Ja., when five Italians were taken from jail and hanged, the president states that a satisfactory solution of the dispute between the two govern ments in regard to the matter will doubtless be reached. The recurrence of such events leads the president to recommend the conferring upon the federal courts jurisdiction in this class of cases. Mention is made in speaking of our relations with Japan of the treaty of commerce and navigation between the Unitesl States and Japan on Nov. 22, 1894, which became operative in July last. It is also stated that Japan is taking a lively interest in the propo sition of the Pacific cable company to add to its projected cable lines to Ha waii, Guam and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan, whereby the latter would be brought into direct communication with this country. Without repeating his previous recommendations on this subject the president respectfully calls the attention of congress to them and recommends that the postmaster-general be authorized to invito competi tive bids for the establishment of such cable. A review of our relations with Mex ico shows a gratifying record of mu tual good will, one of the latest In stances being the acceptance of Presi dent Diaz of an invitation to visit Chi cago last October, but the illness of a member of his family prevented his attendance. Claims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering sea by Russia have been under discussion for several years with the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decision or a single" arbitrator. The Important events leading to the dissolution of the tripartite agreement as regards the Samoa u islands are recounted and also the satisfactory partition of the islands between Ger many and the United .States, Great Britain being given by Germany an equivalent elsewhere. A convention has been made by the three powers to which the attention of the senate will be Invited. Concerning event3 and conditions growing out of the recent war with Spain the message treats very fully. As to Cuba, held by us In trust for the inhabitants with the intent of realiz ing tue Ugh purpose proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by the con gress on the 19th of April, 1898, the president states that the pledge con tained in this resolution is of the high est honorable obligation and must bs kept. All the administration measures adopted heretofore in Cuba by this government have aimed to tit it for a regenerated existence and for self-government within its own sphere. Free Cuba, however, must be a reality, not a name. A loosely-framed common wealth is not to be turned adrift to face the icissitudes of weaker states, but wise preparation must be made for eveutual self-government of re sponsible character. In the Turkish empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory and claims of many years' standing have not yet been collected, though our government is hopeful in this re gard. Attention is called to the arrange ments made for collecting official and economic data under the international union of American republics and alco to the commercial museum of Phila delphia in furtherance of this idea and the Pan-American exposition of 1901 on the Niagara frontier. The president gives a resume of the Hague conference and its results In the amelioration of the laws and cus toms of war and says that the historic position of the United States as to en tanglements with foreign nations was duly observed. In regard to the army, especially in the Philippines, the message gives fig ures and facts showing the actual number returned, .ie. Mr. McKinley recommends a special medal of honor for volunteers, regulars, sailors and marines on duty in the Philippines who remained in service after their terms of enlistment expired. The total number of troops now in the Philip pines and those on the way comprise 2.0Ö1 officers and C3,4S:i men. The de velopment of the postal system in Porto Rico ami the Philippines Is stat ed to have been rapid and successful and to be growing with extraordinary popularity in ihe domestic, service or in the United States proper. As to the navy high praise s given it for its efficiency and recommendations are made for necessary legislation and aid in the matter of naval construction as suggested by the secretary of the navy. The statements of the message as to the future of the Philippines are clear and unequivocal. The rebellion must be put down and civil government re stored. Free public schools must be established and the burden of gov ernment equally distributed. Already hundreds of school are open and filled with children. Religious free dom is sacredly assured and enjoyed. The courts are dispensing justice and business is beginning to circulate in its accustomed channels. The future government of the islands rests with the congress of the United States, and the president adds that a few graver lesponsibilties have ever been confided to us. if we accept them in a spirit worthy our race and traditions a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under our Hag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. Thej' cannot b abandoned, if we de sert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. No specific or final form of goveruraent for the islands is recommended. When peace is restored it wi'd be the duty of congress to construct a p'au of gov ernment which shall establish free dom and order in the Philippines. Un til congress makes known the final ex pression of its will the president must use the authority vested in him to up hold the sovereignly of the United States in the islands. When the in surrection ends it will be the hour of peace and clemency. The text of the message, referring to the Philippines, is in i.ill: On leo. 10. l.W. the treaty of peace be tween the United States and Spain was signed. It provided, umong otln-r things, that Spain should ee.lo to the United States the'archlpelago known as the Phil ippine islands, that the United States should pay to Spain tho sum of J20. Ouc.ooo. and that the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories thus coiled to the United States should le determined fcy the congress. Tho treaty was ratified by the senate on the 6th of February, and ly the vrovernment of Spain on March If) following. The ratifications were exchanged on April 11, and the treaty publicly proclaimed. On March 2 the congress voted the sum contemplated by the treaty and the amount was paid over to the Spanish government on May 1st. In thi? manner the Philippines came to the t'nited States. The island were red ed by the government of Spain, which had been in undisputed possesion of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely l.y our authorized commissioners in Paris, under the direction of the ex ecutive, but by the constitutional and well-considered action of the representa tives of the people of the United States in both houses of congress. I had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was in ac cordance with the wishes and the aspir ations of the great mass of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment no oppor tunity was lost of assuring the people of the islands of our anient desire for their welfare and of the Intention of this government to do everything possible to advance their Interests. In my order of the 19th of May. is.s, the commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was Instructed to declare that we came not to make war upon the people of that country, "nor upon any party or faction among them, but to pro tect them In their homes. In their em ployments and In their personal and re ligious lights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority there, on the 17th of August it was di rected that "there must be no Joint oc cupation with the insurgents;" that the United States must preserve the peace and protect persons and property within the territory occupied by their military arid naval forces; that the Insurgents and all others must recognize the mili tary occupation and authority of the United States. As early us December 4. heron, the cession, and in anticipation of that event, the commander In Manila was urged to restore peace und tranquil litv and to undertake the establishment of n beneficent government, which should afford the fullest security for life and property. On the 21st of December, after tho treaty was fdgned. the commander of the forces of occupation was instructed "to announce and proclaim Ir. the most pub lic manner that we come not as invad ers and conquerors but as friends to pro tect the natives In their homes. In their employments and In the pen onal and re ligious rights." On the sanr e day, while ordering Gen. Otis to see that the peace should b preserved in Hollo, he was ad monished that: "It Is most Important that there should be no conflict with tho Insurgents." On tho llrst .lay of Jan uary, 1KW. urgent orders were rciter&ied that the kindly Intentions of this govern ment should be in every possible way communicated to the Insurgents. On the 21st of January I announced my Intention of dispatching to Manila a commission composed of three gentlemen of the highest ri;irae' r ,nd distinction, thoroughly ncijua 3 with the orient, who, in association w.'th Admiral Dewey and Major-Gei'eral .:-. tre instructs 1 to fnedita te ilie rrvr hi.mare and ef fective exten?1-.--! o: c.iuh'irity throughout the is''.ui.l.- anl t. secure with tho least I.o--sii.i" !'-iay Iii. lvr'!its of a wis" and generous prot etil h of life and property to the inhabitants." The sc j, ;iifl :ii"n were Ir. Jacob CJould Sehurman. ':! tit of t.'onu-ll univer sity; the Hon. Uharles lVnby. for many yeat-. minister to 'hia. and Prof. IK-an (". Worccsti-r of the University of Mich igan, who had made a mcst cartful study of lif- in the Philippines. Hut before their arrival at Manila the si! ister am bition of a few leaders of the Filipinos had created n situation full of embar rassments for us and moit grievous in its consequent es to themselves. The clear and Imr;;rtial preliminary report of the commisxiom-rs give.-j f lucid and romprch-uu'ive a history of the present insurrectionary movement that the story need not be here repeated. It is enough to say that th claim of .'he rbel leader that he was promi-d independence by any ofiietr of the United Slates in return for his ass!:-tanee has no foundation in fact and i.- categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent loader hop ed for when he came buck to Manila was the lib. rati n of the Islands from th.3 Spanish control, which they hail been laboring for years without suet ess to throw off. The prompt accomplishment f this work by the American army and navy gave him either ideas and ambitions and ir.ridious suggestions from arious quar ters perveitod t tie purposes and inten tions with which In had taken up arms. No sooner h;el our army captured Manila than the Filipino tofees ! gan to as sume an attitude of suspieion ami hos tility, which thi? utmost efforts ef our otlicers and troops were unable to disarm or modify. Their kindness and forbear ance were taken a a preot ef coward ice. The aggressions ed" the Uilipino continually increased unt'l tinally. just before the tiim set by tho senate of the United States for a vote Uj.on the treaty, an attack, t-videutlv irepaied in ad ance, was made all along tl.e American lines, which resulted in a terribly de structive and sanguinary repulse oT the insurgents. Ten days later an order of insur gent government -svas issue.' to Its ad herents who had remained in Manila, of which tJen. Otis jnsMy observes that "for barbarous intent it i unequAled In mod ern tinu-s." It liireet-; that at 8 o'e le k on the night of the l.rth of February the territorial militia shall e-ome together in i he streets of S; n Pedro, armed with their boios, with guns and ammunition where conve-nb-nt; that Filipino families e.nly shall be respejt.d; but that all other individuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be e-. terminated without any corr.passion. alter th'j extermination of thi army of occupation, and adds: "llrothors, we must avenge ourselves on the American- and exterminate tnm, that me may take out iWi n-,. for tho infamies anil t re-tchej j s which they have commi! ted upon. us. Have no compas sion upon them; attack viih vior." A copy ef this fell iy k 1 fortune into the hands of ty.iv ottictts and they were ;.-bIe to take measures to coütrcl the ris ing, which was actually attempted on the t ight ol IVh. '11, a we. k later than was originally co:ite-in plated. Considerable numbers of aene-d insurgents entere-d the city by waterways and swamps and in eoiieert with confederate's insiele attempt eel to destroy .Manila by ;ire. They were kept in check during the night and the next day driven out of the city with heavy loss. This was the unhappy conditio'! of af fairs which confront eel our commission ers on their arrival in Manila. They had come with the hope and intention ef co oj crating with Admiral Dewey and Majer-tJen. Otis in establishing peace and order in the archipelago and the Lägest measure of self-government com patible with the true welfare f the peo ple. What, they actually found i a i best be set forth in their own woids: "Deplorable as war is. the one in which v.e a-e now engaged was unavoidable by os. Ve were attaeked ly a bold, adven n rtis aoeJ enthuiastie army. No alterna tive was left to us, except igiieuninousi retreat. "It is lud to be corn-rived of that any Ata r jean would have sanctioned the sur-iiTi'l-r of Manila to the insurgents. Our (d)ig:itiou4 to other nation;-, and to ihe friendly Filipinos and to our selves and J our Hag demanded that fo;-,.t. sho.ikl be met by force. Whatever .lie future of the Philippines may be. Hi. re is no course; epeii to us now e.pt the prose--cution of the war until the' insurgents are reduced to submission. The commis sion is of the opinion that there has bee-n no time since the dest ru-t ioii of the Span bill squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was possihle ! wilhdri-w our forces from the islands, either with hoe.,)!- to ourselves or wi'a safety tj the inhabit ants." The eourse thus cleaily hidieateel has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel lion must be put bwn. Civil govern ment e-annoi. be t horetiighly t-stablished until order is restored. With a d?vetion and gallantry worthy ef its most bril liant hlste.ry. the- army, ably anel loyally assisteel by tie navy, has carrie-d on this unwelcome, hut most righteous cam paign with richly leserved suce-ess. The neible self-sacrifice with which our sol diers anel sailors whose terms of servh-e had expired refused to avail themselves of their right to ret irn he.me as long as they were necdeil at the front forms one of the brightest pages in our annals. Al though the-ir op-ratloiis have be-n sotne v.hat interrupted and checked by a rainy i eason ef unusual vied to e anel duration, they have gaineel grounel steadily in every direction and now leek forward e-eint'uiently to a speedy completion of their task. As to lrto Rico the message states the time is ripe for the adoption of a temporary form of government for the island. Many of the suggestions made with reference to Alaska, it Is stated, are applicable also to Porto Rico. Changes in the latter, however, should not be made abruptly and racial pe culiarities must be given due wreight. The message closes with some perti nent suggestions as to lynchings in the south, the proposed memorial bridge over tho Potomaei and a statement of the purposes of the executive order re lating to civil service of May 6. 1896, and a reference to the coming 14th of December, the 100th anniversary of the death of Washington, and the patriotic reflections naturally arising theefrom and concludes with these words: "Never has this nation had more abundant cause than during tho past year for thankfulness to God for mani fold blessings and mercies, for which we make reverent acknowledgment." A Fnt' IMilloMophy. When a Persian is born a poet, his experience of life usually makes him v philosopher as well. Hadi, whose wiso sayings are often quoted, being asked where he learnel his philosophy, re plied: "From the blind, because they never advance a dep until they have tried the ground." Again, Sadi said: "I never complained of my condition but on a single occasion, when my feet were bare and I had not money to buy shoes; but I saw a man without feet, and became instantly contented with my lot." The Difference. 'Wherein does the man differ from the lower animals?" asked the profes sor. And the youth answered without hesitation: "He can ride a bicycle." Washington Star. 

NOTABLE SILVER ANNIVERSARY With the close of the present year Mr. Dav'.d C. Cook, of Chicago, will cel ebrate his first quarter-centennial a3 editor and publisher of Sunday-school literature. Starting twenty-five years ago, without reputation or assurance of support, he has become one of the most widely and favorably known publish ers in this line. Beginning in 1S75 with two small publications, his periodicals have grown in number and favor until there are few schools In this country that do not fina it to their Interest to use some of his pure and helpful publi cations, while many In distant lands pay tribute to their merits. The past quarter of a century has witnessed many changes among Sunday-school publishers, and much less time than this has sufficed for some to outlive their usefulness. On the contrary, Mr. Cook is preparing to celebrate the be ginning of another quarter-century with additional improvements and new publications. Among these may be mentioned The New Century Sunday School Teacher's Monthly, a large and thoroughly up-to-date magazine for su perintendents and teachers, the first is sue of which will appear In December. Among the most remarkable of his publications is the Young People's Weekly, which has attained a circu lation of nearly a quarter of a million, being a successful attempt to furnish a high grade of religious story reading for boys and girls. To avoid the "goody-goody" story of the Sunday school, such as we remember in our childhood days, and furnish something natural, interesting and ennobling, has been Its aim, and we are not at all sur prised at its popularity. The restraining influence of the Christian home and the Sunday school on our growing community of young peopl some of us may not appreciate as we should perhaps because these sometimes fail to restrain. This paper should be a most welcome accessory In this work, and one which all should appreciate. Boys and girls will read, and the story book and paper are their first choice. There seems a plentiful supply of religious papers for older people, but this is the first successful attempt to furnish a non-sectarian re ligious story paper for young people. The paper is profusely illustrated, beautifully printed, and contains as much or more reading matter than the most expensive of secular young peo ple's story papers. The price, 75 cent3 per year, should bring it within the reach of every home. Mr. Cook is now making a special effort to give tho paper a wider circulation, and all who send 75 cents for a year's subscription before Jan. 1 will receive a beautiful premium picture entitled "The Soul's Awakening." It is exactly the same size (loxlS inches) and style as those on sale at art stores for ?1. Order should be addressed to David C. Cook Publishing company, 36 Washington street, Chicago. Probably no man living has done so much to Improve and cheapen Sunday Echooi literature as has Mr. David C. Cook. Through his aid thousands of schools have been encouraged, Im proved and made self-sustaining. Mr. Cook is yet a comparatively young man, and it dots not appear at all im probable that his field of usefulness may extend over yet another quarter century. Ills Opinion of Shakenpr are. From the Washington Post: There is a story going about town just now concerning a famous man of letters who visited Washington recently. He appeared at but one dinner party. There he sat next the young daughter of a noted naval oflicer. Her vocabu lary is of a kind peculiar to very young girls, but she rattled away at the fam ous man without a moment's respite. It was during a pause in the general conversation that she said to him: "I'm awfully struck on Shakespeare. Don't you think he's terribly interesting?" Everybody listened to hear the great man's brilliant reply, for as a Shakes pearian , scholar he has few peers. "Yes," he said, solemnly, "I do think h-i is Interesting. I think he Is more than that. I think Shakespeare is just simply too cute for anything." Winter In the South.
