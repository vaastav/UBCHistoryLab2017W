Doom of the "Comics" It begins to look as if the death knell of the time-honored feature of American journalism the comic sup plements of the Sunday newspapers had struck. A tide of protest is rising all over the land, and the very exist ence of "Foxy Grandpa," the "Katzen jammer Kids," "Happy Hooligan," and "Buster Brown" those darlings of the heart of childhood is menaced, says Current Literature. Mothers meetings have declaimed and educational' con ferences have resolved against them. One lady speaker before the recent American Playgrounds congress in New York registered her conviction that the comic supplement is "debas ing the morals of the children" by em phasizing and apparently condoning "deceit, cunning and disrespect for gray hairs." And now a leading New England newspaper, the Boston Herald, an nounces its abandonment of this feature. Eggs are selling at 80 cents a dozen in Boston. Boston should keepyolked to beans. John W. Gates will know what to do with his circus. He has been in the ring before. Mr. Taft's Santa Claus should not fail to put something nice in Mr. Roose velt's stocking. The shoe manufacturers declare it is the sole duty of congress to put hides on the free list. Again, it isn't buying your Christ mas presents early to buy them late in the afternoon. Mrs. Elinor Glyn's latest novel is called "The Perfect Man." Of course he died in infancy. Emperor Pu Yi will know how it is himself if his ministers put a curfew law up to him to sign. Near beer, according to a Cincinnati man, "looks like beer, tastes like beer, but doesn't feel like beer." Not so many men are deserting from the army as did formerly. This proves that it pays to make the muf fins light. Rockford Star: Mr. Cannon says he will let congress revise the rules. What cigars doth Unci Joe smoke that he hath grown so weak? Indianapolis News: Nothing now seems to stand in the way of the deep waterways project, unless by the way, what docs Uncle Joe Cannon think about it? Airships and War. In addressing the American Society of Mechanical Engineers several army officers have just given their views re garding the value of aeroplanes and dirigible balloons as adjuncts of war fare. That their belief in the utility of these devices for campaign pur poses after they shall have been more fully developed is shared by their superiors at Washington, is asked from congress for the perfecting of war ma chines that can navigate the air. Yet a good many people who are not to ne ranked with tne peace at any price advocates will be apt to regret the apparent assumption that the first if not the chief use, to which these fly ing fabrics are apparently to be de voted is connected with warfare in the minds of those who are most zeal ous in urging governmental tests for them. bucn a policy might seem more rational among officials of Europe, where nationalities are closely packed together, with the ever present dread of invasion which causes ships and forts and armies always to be kept ready for immediate action. But three thousand miles of ocean separates this country from England and the conti nent. No person in his senses looks for a descent of foreign troops on the United States and even the most op timistic inventor probably would hesi tate to predict the creation of an air ship that can cross the Atlantic. If the secret of successful navigation can be mastered for purposes of commerce or of pleasure over the wide expanse of this republic, it will constitute notable step in human progress. But the possibility of such an achievement surely deserves consideration apart from the added facilities for slaughter and destruction which it might imply How to buy $18 worth of presents with a small but perfectly good $2 bill is the problem that is bothering some of our loveliest people much more than the question of tariff reform. In the Field of Literature Dr. G. Stanley Hall thinks that moral suasion applied with a club has a more lasting effect on the mind of the youth than an admonition to refrain from being naughty lest good boys will not like you. If all the plainly stated reforms in corporated in President Roosevelt's last message to congress could be cn acted into law, what a wonderful con gress the one attempting them would turn out to be. Holding Democracy Together. Louisville Courier-Journal: Clean politics, honest politics, wise politics the good of the country would seem to demand that the democratic party, much discouraged and depressed, and thoroughly beaten, should still hold together, seeking to preserve its mor ale, gnd, as the saying hath it, keeping its powder dry. If it should go to pieces, nothing would remain between our institutional system and the del uge except a body of able and self- confident opportunists, calling them selves the republican party, and quite equal to the commercial exigencies of the times, and that vast master, the mob, tame enough when fed and clothed, but very destructive when turned loose hungry upon whatsoever it may. devour. - ...
