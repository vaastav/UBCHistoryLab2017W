k K.w M S. B. HOW, EDITOR AXI PROPRIETOR. CLEARFIELD, PA.. DEC. 12, 1860. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. fl; ? We print in onr paper to-day the most Im portant parts or President Buchanan's last an nual message. True to the slave power, the Old Public Functionaiyi tries to throw the blame of the present agitated condition of the country upon the North.. In this connection, lio asserts that "the long-continued and intern pcrate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States, has at length produced its natnral effects." Who does not know that this is false 7 If there had been any 'intemperate interference,', during the last eight years, at least, it would only prove that Mr. Buchanan nnd his Demo cratic predecessor were ctoo weak to perform their sworn duty. ' The secession movement, however, is not the result of such "interfe rence" as the President refers to it is the di rect offspring of the treasonable dogmas that, tor the last quarter of a century, have been propagated by Southern Disunionists, and fed and encouraged by doughfaces at the' North. There are other glaring misrepresentations in she oiessago, which the intelligent reader will discern as readily as this one. Whilst tho President holds that no State has a right to secede, he says the Constitution confers upoii Congress no power to coerce her Into submis sion if she does withdraw from the Union ; by which ho probably means that South Carolina lis no right to secede, but if she does, he has no right to prevent her. Gen. Jackson took altogether a different view of the matter, and soon put a stop to the Disunion movement in ftis-day. The President says it would be easy to settle the slavery question forever, by siru 4ly letting the Slave States alone and permit ting them to manage their domestic institu tions in their own way ; and yet, In the face of this, he proposes certain "explanatory amend ments" to the Constitution, which would make it just what the South wants, a slavery expand ing instrument, and would also go far towards justifying the President's part in the Lccomp ton iniquity. That seems to be Mr. Buchan an's idea of "letting the Slave States alone." A portion of his views on the Tariff, and the god word he says for the famishing people to Kansas, are redeeming features in the mes sage. But, as a whole, It is unsatisfactory to all parties, unless the Secessionists can draw ncouragoment from it. This even, it would seem, depends upon a, contingency, fur Wig 111, oi ioxhs, says the more he reads the uesage the less he comprehends it. Joiixsox, of the Mansion House, did a good thing one day last week. Having purchased a couple flue turkeys and given directions to :have thrm served up for dinner, he called at our office and invited us to assist at eating !.im a branch of domestic science in which we are proficient. At tha appointed hour we were on hand, and found present, besides the lever fellows who board there," several gentle nien from abroad ; and it can readily bo irn sgined that the turkeys well failed and roast- ed in the most perfect and savoury manner disappcaied la "a little less than no time.' So well pleased were all with the dinner that we shouldn't wonder if Johnson would repeat it on Christmas, and perhaps on New Year's day. However, under any state of circumstances, we iiope "bis shadow may never grow less." ...... ... .. . ..

The editor of the Char- "liav :Ane CQUOr 01 iner tor- field Republican seems to be one of this class ; and hence it is not surprising to find' him, in his last issue, censuring, indiscriminately, all the clergymen who on Thanksgiving Day said anght againstTfegro' Slavery fn this boasted "free" country of ours. ; According tohisar tide, these preachers must be a dreadful set of " the livery of heaven to serve the Devil more " fully than they otherwise could." They are , u r .i j t a generation of v.pers," ho further declares, " who come fully up to the standard of their " predecessor we mean, Judas Iscariot, for men.

Not is that the worst of it. It seems they are actuated . by selfish motives. They do it for gain for pelf for " money," ejaculates our immaculate neighbor, with well- affected: astonishment ; and then, very charita bly, ho ' hopes, or " expects" to hear of them closing their lives in the same manner" in which the unfortunate Mister J. Iscariot wound up his earthly career. In the meantime, as Thanksgiving Day is an "opportunity" which is "always embraced" by these preachers "to spread themselves in their pulpits" on the sla very question, our neighbor very philanthropi cally proposes to prevent tho recurrence of such improper conduct by doing away with this annual custom. "For our part," says he, "we hope the-day as such may be abolished" wiped out, entirely obliterated. That is the sovereign remedy or, rather, the great pre ventive, which khc intends applying to stop these "vipers" and "hypocrites" from talking so much upon "a subject not found within the "lids of, the Bible negroes and American Slavery." It may be that the Bible does not contain anything on this "subject" wo will m'l at present assume to say that It does t but I if it does not. where will these irentl.men fin.i authority to make it a "Divine institu- tiuu i JAt una, nowever. du as it mar. w I : it t it.. i i think our neighbor has bit upon an expedient I which is well calculated to brlnv ahnnt th r..

Or, per haps, in order to reduce the matter to a cer italnty. hc intends adopting, in conjunction with his own plan, Joe Lane's orthographic mode of punishment, and scare them into good behavior, by swelling out, as he does in the article before us, the f Devil" with the biggest sort of a "D," whilst he reduces "heaven" to as small dimensions as possible. But, serious ly speaking, aro not affairs coming to a pretty pass when Christian Ministers cannot exerciso the Constitutional prerogative of Free Speech, without being denounced as loathsome crea tures and, compared to tho most abominable men, and, in one Instance at least that we could mention, threatened with a withdrawal of sup port, because, forsooth, they say that liumaa Slavery is an evil and at variance with the teachings of the Bible 1 We might expect to hear of sucCi things being done in the South, whero Preachers ate banged for avowing auti- slavery sentiments, and where other individu- als are mobbed, tarred and feathered, or lashed in the moat brutal manner, not for anything . , ' . uiijiuiug they may have uttered, but because tbey are u specUd of entertaining opinions adverse to I the "Divine institution ;" but that this species of desnotiMn was Winning to it. c a 6V head In the free and enlightened North, is more than we -could believe did we not our-' selves know it to be true.

Efforts, we are told, are being made by interested parties to create a panic in the business here, on the strength of the secession excitement, with what prospects of success we cannot say. Our adviee 'to all would be, not to make any un necessary sacrifices, bat to calmly await the development of events, learn the condition of financial affairs, and then act as prndence may dictate or circumstances demand.

AASU Dec. 4th. In the Senate the President' Mcss.iiio wai received and read." Mr. Clings. man, immediately after the reading, arose and delivered himself of a violent sectional speech', in the course or which ho denounced the Pres ident elect as a totaHy seetiwnal mam who had promoted the principles- of Ibo- "IrreDressibln conflict." He proposed that Congress should pay the National debt, and then divide the public property as equally as possible between wio two sections ot the Union.' lie was repli ed to l,y Mr' Crittenden, who hoped that the frtfinj, nf tha ITninr, ' , . tK A agree upon some plan for its preservation. In the House, Mr. Sherman moved the reference of the President's message to the committee of the whole on the state of the Union. This was opposed by Mr. Bolder of Virginia, who offered an mendment referrine that document to a special committee of one from each State, with leave to report any time. This amend- Hampshire, opened the debate with a motion 1? reconsider the vote to print the President's Message. lie thought tho contest between the Statea must be 8eat,e(1 at th(J ballot.box or by war, and whilst hoping for a peaceable set- tlement, urged that the danger should be look- ed all further allegiance, andthat they intend go out of the Union before tho fourth of Mar?h.

Mr. Green of Missouri, gave notice of a resolution inquiring into the propriety or providing lor the establishment of an armed border police to, prevent the in vasion of States, uud aid in executing the t ngiti ve Slave law. In the House, the Home stead bill was called up by Mr. Grow of Penn sylvania, and passed ayes 132, nays 76. The bill requires a payment often dollars from actual settlers for one hundred and sixty acres of land.

It is still upon trial. The case of Mrs. Beardsley, in New York city, the daughter of a clergyman, developer the curious charge of having married a second husband, living within three miles of tho other, ana succeeded in concealing the fact from both through a period of several years. To the fact ol the marriage, and identity of per son, and long continued intercourse, the sec ond husband swore most positively, though the jury did not find her guilty upon that point in the indictment. The English case is one of creat merit. A M iss Sheadeu, born in New York, is now, after the lapse ot sixty years, trying to prove that her mother was properly married. Her coun sel, for some cause not explained during the penaency or tho case in the jfrooate Court of London, abandoned ber case. According to the latest European advices, she has been suc cessfully competing with a cute and learned counsel, both in the preliminary statement of the caso and in tho examination of witnesses. during the first two days of the trial, evincing the possession of great mental tovers and high accomplishments.

Kabthacs, Dec. 6, 1860. S. B. Row : Sir : In the Republican of last week 1 see a communication, beaded "That Strange ASair," which is intended to refute what I bad inserted. The affair is not very strange to those who are acquainted with the (.ircnnistanirpa. Tn onn wnv if mav hn ttmnira or considered as such. The actions of the man ... - J were strange, and led to all tho suppositions which I stated, and which I think and believe to be correct, from the fact of his asking, when be saw strangers coming to the house, if j they were going to arrest him. His horse was sick, as I before stated, bad the blind staggers. Men who profess to be judges, and whom I know to be such, looked at the horse and pro nounced it the blind staggers. The informant of the Republican says the horse got down in the stall to roll. 1 wish him to understand that there was no stall or any other obstruction in the way by which he could hurt himself. Then the writer in the Republican says, "They say," he s offered ' some very advantageous trades. I wish to know who says so. ylf the gentleman of Salt-LiclAan inform me, I wish lie would do so. The gentleman then goes on to speak of the value of the horse being $200; but judges, that perhaps are better and more competent, say from $75 to $100. The buggy and harness he puts down at $125 ; they may be worth $00, but no more. It has been a good rig onee, bqt has been run down.
