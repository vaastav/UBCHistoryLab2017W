PRINCE HENRY FIGHTS DUEL. Queen Wllhelmlna'a 11 unhand and Der Aide de i'aiup Croxa Sworda. In spite of ollicial denials investiga tions show there is substantial founda tion for the story of a duel having been fought between Prince Heury of the Netherlands, husbaud of Queen Wil- helmina, and Major Van TeU, the queen's aide de camp. It appears that t a dinner at liet-Koo, her majesty was hurt by some Inattention on the part of the prince and spoke to him harply. Prince Henry retorted se verely, whereupon Major Van Teta made a remark regarding the impro- riety of the prince consorfs conduct. A quarrel followed between the aide de camp and the prince, who had been drinking freely, and a duel with words was fought after dinner. Van Tets was wounded.

The Bulgarian govern ment declines all responsibility." In Vienna this answer is considered most impudent, and the hope is ex pressed that the United States will hold Bulgaria responsible for Miss Stone's safety.
