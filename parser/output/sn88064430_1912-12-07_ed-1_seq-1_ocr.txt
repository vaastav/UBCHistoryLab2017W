PATRICK GIVEN PARDON Long Fight for Freedom Finally Won 1 by Sentenced Man. AlbanS, N. ý.ý1liýeyST . Pitricrk 1 who is serving a life sentence in Sing Sing prison for the murder of William I Marsh Rice, an aged millionaire, in g New York City on Sptember 3, 1900, was pardoned last week by Governor f Dix. Patrick, who was saved from the electric chair by the late Governor Higgins in December, 1906, has made a remarkable fight for freedom. A lawyer.by profession, he protested c when Governor Higgins commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment, declaring that the governor had no s legal right to cancel the original sen tence and impose a punishment of life imprisonment. "There has always been an air of mystery in this important case," Gov ernor Dix said. "Quoting from the minority opinion of the Court of Ap peals, 'the atmosphere that surrounded the defendant showed that a fair and impartial trial was scarcely possible.' i "I trust that Mr. Patrick will de vote his energies to a complete vindi- c cation of his declared innocence. "During the past year I have given much consideration to this case and am convinced that the defendant is en titled to have a full pardon." Governor Dix said Superintendent of State Prisons Scott and scores of prominent citizens appealed to him in Patrick's behalf. Perfume Leads to Arrest. Chicago.-Perfume was used by de tectives in solving the disappearance of small sums of money from the Uni versity of Chicago Press building and led to the arrest of a youth, who said he was taking the money to buy an aeroplane.

A young shipping clerk passed close to the "workmen" at the close of the day's business. Scenting the perfume, the officers stopped him and demanded "the money he had just taken."

CONFESSES TO MURDERS Victims of John F. Hickey Were Most ly Boys Whom He Assaulted. WVestern iewV;eper,l ~'pTc Vews Service. Buffal6, N. 1.-The killing of a man in Lowell, Mass., 20 years ago was given by John F. Hickey, the so-called "post card" murderer, in a signed con fessiou, as the starting point of a career of debauchery and crime dur ing which he' murdered two boys and assaulted many others. Hickey's two victims, according to his confession, were Edward Morey, of Lowell, Mass., poisoned with lauda num more than 20 years ago; Michael Kruck, 12 years old, a New York news boy, strangled in Central Park in 1902, and Joseph Josephs, the 7-year-old son of J. Josephs, a merchant of Lackawanna, killed in a similar man ner October 12, 1911. "The details of Hickey's two last crimes are too revolting to make pub lic," said District Attorney Dudley. Hickey is apparently a man with a dual personality. He is intelligent. He is now overcome with remorse and says again and again that he can't comprehend what possessed him to commit the crimes. He assersts that he became a maniac only when filled with whiskey. Hickey's full confession came after a series of admissions mnade to Dis trict Attorney Dudley and Police Chief Gilson of Lackawanna when the two officials left New York for Buffalo with their prisoner, Hickey agreed to sign a confession., and was taken to the district attorney's office through the tunnel connecting the county jail and the city hall, used for the first time since Czolgoss was taken through it after being sentenced to death for the assassination of President Mc Kinley.

Washlngton.-The expiring Sixty second congress assembled at noon i Monday for its final work of legisla tion. In the brief period remaining before constitutional limitations bring it to an end and turn many of its members back into private life, 15 ap propriation bills, aggregrating more than $1,000,000,000 for the support of the government must be passed; the impeachment of Judge Archbald of F the Commerce Court must be tried in f the senate: many investigating com- t mittees must conclude inquiries and make their reports, and scores of legia lative matters must be disposed of. Throughout the session will run the preparatory work for the extra ses sion to be called soon after President elect Wilson takes office, March 4. Committees will thresh out questions of tariff currency and anti-trust legis. lation, aiming to have Democratic po licies shaped and Democratic plans made. before the new administration comes into power. It is assured, say the legislative lead ers, that there will be no tariff legis lation this winter. Neither is it ex pected that the currency or anti-trust problems will receela much attention in the house or senate, the principal work of the session being confined to preparation for the Democratic admin istration and the enactment of some of the more important bills pending. on the calendars of the two houses. Important bills to receive attention include the bill for a Department of Labor, the Sheppard-Kenyon bill pre venting shipments of liquor into "dry" states; the Page bill, to give federal aid to vocational and agricultural schools, and a resolution for a consti tutional amendment limpiting a presi dent to a sidgle tugi of six years.

The impeachment trial of Judge Archbald will engross the senate from the begining of the session. Several flew inquiries are in pros. pect in the house for the short session. The judiciary committee will begin an inquiry into anti-trust problems about 1 Christmas time, with the hope that some amendments to the anti-trust law can be recommended before con gross adjourns. The "money trust" investigation is to continue, and an effort will be made to obtain at least a partial report be fore the session ends. Many other investigations, including that into the so-called shipping trust, and into the awarding of contracts for army and 1 navy shoes, must be concluded before March 4.

IMMENSE SUM TO RUN GOVERNMENT $823.415,455.14 Is Estimated Cost Submitted by Depart ment Heads. BIG INCREASE IN PENSIONS War Department Plans Three New Battleships-Only One Allowed by Democrats Last Year. West.'rn NewSpa't,rr U'nion N',; Service. Washington.-It will cost $823,415, 455.14 to construct the affairs of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1914, according to the esti mates of the various department heads. submitted to the speaker of the hetuse by the secretary of the treasury. This amount, not including provision for the postal service, which is ex pected to bI. scif-sulpporting, is an in crease of $72.7?.S,24s over the appro priations made for the present year by the last session of congress. Of this increase $2N.:t12,220 appears in estimates of the secretary of the navy, and $20,,97,.297 represents the increase asked by the navy depart ient in the aplpropriations for build ing and equipping new vessels. The estimates would provide for three new battleships to be laid down during the year. This would make up for the lapse of one ship front the two-battle ships a year program, caused by the action of the Democratic house in pro viding for but a single ship at the last session. Another $20,000,000 or more of the total increase is shown in the esti mates for the payment of pensions. The amount asked for this year is $185,.220,00.
