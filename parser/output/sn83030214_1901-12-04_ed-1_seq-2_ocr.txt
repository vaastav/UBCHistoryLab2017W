REIGN TIE WS OF MESS A GE. COMMENT IX LONDON FAVORABLE DOUBT AS TO OUTCOME OF PRO POSED REFORMS. London. Dec 4.— Th» London daily papers this morning, looking at President Roosevelt's Message from the point of view of its literary rower and the wealth of weighty matters dis cufsed. regard it as on" of the most character istic and remarkable messages ever sent to the «• :pr->s<= At the same time the papers recog nize its conservative and businesslike modera tion, and that no attempt has been made, as -The Morning Post" remarks, "to strike an attitude or carry his listeners away." On the hole, however, the newspapers are sceptical of any great outcome from the Presi dent's efforts in the direction of reform of the trusts, anti-anarchism or reciprocity, the idea being that the Senate will effectually step in and prevent any great changes in the existing system. Most of the papers remark upon the tone of « xultation adopted by President Roosevelt in ilealing with the canal question, but they do ii- >t show the slightest disposition to cavil th'-reat. "The Daily Telegraph" says it would have t.een an inconceivably disastrous blunder to have opposed America's wishes in this matter, and thus driven her to build a still greater fleet than she. already contemplates, which, it is safe to predict, will twenty years hence make the United States the second sea power in the world. "The Telegraph" thinks that President Boose ■velt's polity :s calculated rather to diminish than to increase Europe's exaggerated dread of 'the American danger." "The Standard" is similarly of the opinion that r," thing in tin- Message need in the smallest de t-;ee excite anxiety or apprehension abroad. This paper comments upon the President's un ooaaawsaatatac assertion of the Monroe Doctrine as somewhat unnecessary, insomuch as there is lit tie desire on the part at any foreign power to extend its area of militarism to the New World. "Tr.e Honing Post" is disappointed that tlv Message contains no echo of th<_' late President McKinley's pronouncement. "The period of ex clusion is over," and comments mainly upon 1 "resident Roosevelt's unexpected moderation. "The Post" says there is not a line of the an ticipated challenge to the political machine, bat rather a strong flaposttftoa to conciliate the Re publican majority. "The Daily Chronicle" hopes that, although President Ki»>se\ ( .;t draws great tenderness for protectionist susceptibilities, his proposed policy is a stev in the direction of free trade. The partr considers his cautious and tentative proposals concerning trusts to show that the office of President has a sol>ering effect even on the most buoyant of natures. Regarding President Roosevelt's spirited enun ciation of Mttnroetaa. "The Chronicle*" says: "Whether the European nations are likely to respect this American prohibition much longer, when the desirable <ol"n:zins grounds of the •world are betas snapped up in a headlong race, must depend ultimately upon the ability of the United States to enforce their prohibition. "The Daily News" in an editorial says: "It shows a bold man struggling with the ftevel fish of party intrigue, and is in refreshing contrast to th^ spreadeagleism of the earlier period of American jingoism. President Roose velt has set himself a very high ideal of conduct in public life, and we have no doubt he will rise to it ' Most of the afternoon newspapers prefer to await the publication of the text of President Roosevelt's Message, rather than comment on the abridgment mad" public here. "The Pall Mall Gazette," however, think? t!:-- Message will "win the praises af all eavcept the Fenian ciulis to which Mr. Redmond is spouting sedition." It says that the ;<}eas contained in it are those of "a wise head firmly set on its shoulders." "The Pall Mali Gazette," highly approving of the President's suggestions relative to repressive measures to prevent, as the paper pu'.s it. "America from becoming the dumping ground af the blockheads and BtaiwUngs ot Europe," remarks that there is a contrast between this advocacy of strengthen!!^- restrictive measures and the tailous indifference of the British ;• de lators to flooding the Kast End of London with indigent aliens. "The "Westminster Gazette" considers that the reference to trusts "spells a good deal of un certainty for the American market." and adds: "The high tariff of the United States has created an artificial position, under which the trusts have prospered. Therefore their business must be regulated artificially. " "The St. James's Gazette" says: "It is gratify ing to find that the statesmen of a country like the Dotted States are not afraid to make pro posals, en the subject of anarchism which on the surface are open to the criticism that they are subversive of personal liberty. There is no surer sign of true statesmanship than the in sight which realizes when a good theory be comes mischievous in practice." "President Roosevelt's first Message to Con gress." said Lord Rothschild to a representative of The Associated Press, "certainly seems statesmanlike, ami should produce a good effect In England and the rest of Europe, whero its careful, friendly references to th^ other powers •will be much appreciated. But his declaration that reciprocity must be treated as the hand maiden of protection will raise a howl here, in Engiand. for protective duties. If reciprocity is only to be a handmaiden, it will not do England much good This enunciation will set on foot an unprecedented agitation for the restoration of at least partial protection hen-." "Do you think it at ail likely to succeed?" Lord Rothschild was asked. "Yes." he replied, "in spite of the historic fe tich of free trade, 1 would not be at all surprised to see protection return to England. What can we do? We have got little we can now supply to the Vnited States. She mak»s pivtty near everything for herself, and is daily sending us more Of her surplus products. If we do not go in for some form of protection we are likely to lose what little trade we still have here espe cially in view of President Roosevelt's concep tion of reciprocity." The references in the Message to not hamper ing the captains of industry met with Lord Gold Seal

UTTERANCES ABOUT TRUSTS. AND IMMI GRATION' CLOSELY SCANNED. X Berlin. Dec. X— The Message .of President Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in Germany. On the Boerse, where it was eagerly awaited, the Message was received with uncommon interest, and th.- market generally was slightly stimu lated upon the posting of a bulletin containing President Roosevelt's utterances about trusts. The shares of the steamship companies fell one or two points on account of the immigration Inspection paragraph, and the proposed develop ment of the mci chant marine. Several financial Journals aver there is no reason why the United States should not en courage shipbuilding. They say that if the United States becomes possessed of a commer cial fleet she will have to build it. inasmucn as the attempts to buy German lines of steam ers have been defeated. . . President Roosevelt's words concerning me. restriction of immigration contain an unpleasant suggestion in the present time of depression, when, as the "Berliner Yolks Zeitung " says, the hard times make an overflow of ■lanor ing population of Europe necessary. The me trade and liberal newspapers velcome the reci procity commendations, but regret that 1 resi dent Roosevelt did not recommend a sp.cinc tariff reduction. . The first impression of the President b Mes sage In German official circles is that the re pression of anarchists by International ' agree ment is much more likely to be earned through upon the initiative of the United Statesman by that of any other power. An anti-anarch.st proposition from Germany, along the same lines as that of President Roosevelt. is probal»l> al read) on its way to the State Department at Zeitung" ,ays the P-slderg M- usage indicates that the feet of the I nited States are well in the imperialistic path and that ventures abroad seem to agree *i«i *em.

GOVERNMENT COTTON REPORT. I'KICS SOARS ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WASHINGTON FIGURES. Washington, Dec. 3.— The statistician of the Department of Agriculture reports 9.675.000 bale* as the probable cotton production of the United States in 1931-'O2- The area picked or to be picked Is estimated at 26.80 acres, a redaction of. 730,216 acres, or 2.6 per cent from the acreage planted. The total produc tion of lint cotton Is estimated at 1,529.954.000 pounds, an average of 16& pounds an acre, picked or to be picked In addition to the department's ordinary crop re porting agencies, fifteen thousand ginners and five thousand bankers and merchants have furnished valuable information concerning acreage and pro duction. Th' ginners have i.so reported th-> amount of cotton ginned between August 15 and November 20 this -.ear and last year, with the average gross weight a bal<* and the average weight of bagging and ti.-t=. This has enabled the statistician to ascertain the average net weight of bales for each separate State and for the entire cotton belt, and rhese weights have been used 'n determining- th»; total number of bales produced. Th« average net weight for the entire cotton belt is 4>>.2 pounds, which is believed to be the lowest average in about t.-n fears. Th« iarce number of lißht bales being rr.arketed and also, seme re duction in the proportion of lint to seed cotton are subjects of frequent comment by correspondents of all classes. The announcement of 9,674.000 baJ as th« gov ernment estimate of the cotton crop of 1901-'O2 caused a sensational advance In prices yesterday on the local Cotton Kxchange. I>atham. Alex ander &■ Co. last week gave out an estimate of 9,733.000 bales -is the crop, and other conservative authorities had made estimates approximating these Ggures: but the general sentiment has been thai the crop would be very much larger, and as a result there has I en a very !;irt;. short interest in the market. The publication of the government fieures. with the significant note that the average net weight of the bales would be probably the low est for ten years, caused an Instant rush to cover. December cotton, which closed on Monday at 7.59 cent* a pound, opened yesterday at 7.67. When the Washington report was read at noon, the price soared In a twinkling to eight cents, an ad vance of about forty points, or IS a bale over Monday's close. The January option, which sold at 7.58 at the close on Monday, rose also to eifrht cents. Then heavy profit taking set in. and for the rest of the day the fluctuations were rapid and wide. Both the December and the January closed at 73S cents, and the other active futures made correspondingly large advances. ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE CONVENTION. Washington. Dec. ?..— About one hundred advo cates of total abstinence attended the first session to-day of the sixth annual convention of the Amer ican Anti-Saloon League. The meetings will con tinue until Thursday night, and will provide a pro gramme for co-operation of temperance advocates throughout the United States in the coming year. The convention, after organising, considered reports of State superintendents and field workers. The Rev. Dr. H. W. Russell, general superintendent of the league, made a report in Which he pointed out the connection of saloons with anarchistic move ments. "The anarchists of Chicago'," he said "hatched their conspiracy of 1888 in the Ealoona. President McKinley's assassin learned his first let tons in anarchism in a saloon, and was toasted and praised for his act by anarchist* in saloons at Pat eraon and Newark." He recommended a complete unification of all agencies devoted to the temper ance cause. The afternoon session was occupied with me morial services for Hiram Price, formerly ■ Rep resentative in' Congress and the last president of the league.

WEDJSJ^Si^i. i^r* CONSIDER MAIXE CLAIMS SETTLED COUNSEL FOR THE GOVERNMENT URGE THAT THEY BC DISMISSED. Washington I)f,-. 2.— Counsel for the government have presented to the Spanish Treaty Claims Com mission a brief in support of the motion to dismiss the claims growing out of the loss of the battleship Maine. It is contended that it was the. intention of he treaty of peace not to provide for, but to relinquish and leave in oblivion as settled in the tribunal Of war, the grievance referred to in the joint r solution of April 86. IM, as "the detraction ,f , United Stalea battleship, with 266 of its officer? and crew, while on a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana. ■ The r rief says that the destruction of Spanish lives and the loss of Spanish possession? atoned tot and settled any supposed responsibility of Spain for the destruction of the Maine. On Karen 30, 18M. Congreas passed an act for the relief of the Maine sufferers, and this action, it Is I ded, proved that the Rovernment of the United Stales, after the report of a commission had made it dear that evidence could not be found to prove the authorship of the destruction of the Maine, decided not to adopt and present claims foi money indemnity on behalf of Its citizens based upon such destruction, and also that it decided to recognize, instead of a olaiin of that kind against Spain, a claim against itself on account of the same destruction, which latter claim it proceeded to settle in full. Continuing, the brief says: Spain had offered to submit to an '^partial «n- . vestigation by some third power, and tad berseU mad< an investigation, with the same ,. in . dt '' in't - l^ suit, it seems, as that made by the t ni ed State* To suppose that this commission, after all that naa l.een referred to and with the means and appliances which Uave been furnished to it. suitable only ftt the ordinary purposes of a claims commission, was Intended to" open up and undo and do over again this inquiry into the responsibility of the bpamsh Government, with the result ot disgracing Spain on the one hand and on the other ofdiserediting -he government cf the United States, is entirely un reasonable. Charles Henry Butler counsel for the claimants, takes the position thru as indemnity claims amount in*: to 1Z5.M0 were paid in the case of the United Btatea marines killed and wounded in Valparaiso, Chill, in 1891, claims should be allowed In the Spanish war cases, particularly as Article VII of the Treaty of Paris says that "the I nited States will adjudicate and settle all claims of Us citizens against Spain." , . In the case of the marines killed and wounded in Chili Mr Blalne took the position ihat the rnlted States could not allow her sailors when in the na tional uniform to be killed with impunity In the harbor of ; i friendly power in the time of peace. Mr Butler thinks the sane applies in the case of the Maine. The argument on tin motions to dismiss the claims will be heard on December U at Washington. NEW

I>-,\ :i <>n the resumption of 'h<* tar iff debate In the Reichstag to-day Count yon Posadowsky-Wehner, Secretary of the Interior, took UP the cudgela In defence of the bill. The members of the Left frequently interrupted him. taking strong exceptions to \v.s remark-, and the members nt the Right responded with ' heei b. The Secretary contended -that Germany was largely dependent on her export trade, which must therefore be protected The United States had Introduced protective rates not only against Germany bui against the world In the Inter ests of American finance and American indus try. It was impossible to maintain a free trade basis in the midst of protectionist countries, and, unfortunately, Germany could not follow the advice that she should take the lead In low ering duties, is she had already had such a disagreeable experience with sugar bounties. In regard t<> the suggestion that the govern ment Introduce a radical free trade measure, the Secretary said it would entail enormous taxa tion. The new tariff was necessary to build up agriculture, In which Germany was vitally in terested. He doubted If Germany was able to produce sufficient grain for her own consumption, but the authorities wished, in any case, to keep out all grain which was not needed. Germany could supply the domestic demands for meat, but It was not true thai the cattle disease laws had been enforced in order to raise the price. The German landowners wore not like the wealthy English landowners. They could not stand a decline In agriculture and the abolition of the corn laws. Since the conclusion of the commercial treaties other States bad repeated ly raised their duties. Germany had ■ similar right, and the man who did not look upon the matter from this point of view lacked sense and national i>ridf. The Imperial Chancellor, Count yon Billow, replying to the criticisms of the members .if the Lift, said h«> wished that there should be no mistake regarding the government's attitude toward the commercial treaties. They consid ered the renewal of the treaties of long duration to be most desirable, but Germany purposed arranging them on a basis satisfactory to her self. The interests .if other nations would be met In a spirit <>' reciprocity and fair dealing but Germany was in a position to give effect to her wishes with the s;»mo emphasis as other countries. She need show no more diffidence than they. As for the utterances of the foreign press, the government would not ho driven a hair's breadth from the path marked out nor suffer dictation touching German rights and in terests. MORE FIGBTINQ /V PHILIPPINES. SHARP BRUSH WITH INSURGENTS IN SIPA MOUNTAINS -FILIPINOS afUSrr GO TO INTERIOR. Manila. Dec. .'{.—Colonel Wints column has had a sharp brush with forty insurgents in the Sipa Mountains, killing several of them and burning fourteen cuartels. Advices from Catbalogan, capital of th« Island of Samar. report that the insurgent Gen eral Lukban has offered to negotiate terms of surrender with General Smith. To this offer the American commander replied that the time for negotiations had passed. Lieutenant Commander James M. Helm, com manding th. United States gunboat Frolic In November destroyed \i~ bouts engaged in smug gling supplies; to the insurgents. Genera] Smith has ordered all malt* Filipinos to leave the coast towns for the interior. In order to be allowed to return they must bring guns, prisoners or information of where insur tectionists are. Five hundred natives of Catbalogan have vol unteered to fight the insurgents in order to bring peace to Samar. Of these one hundred have been accepted. They are armed with bolos and spears, and are doing scouting duty under com mand of Lieutenant Compton. At daylight yesterday Lieutenant Baines, of the 9th Infantry, attacked and destroyed a rebel fort, inflicting heavy loss, and captured the officers' breakfast, which included canned goods He found at the fort an arsenal with appliances for making and reloading cartridges.

TRYING TO FREE ~ FREXCHYr GOVERNOR OpEL.ii HEARS ARGUMENTS FOR PARDON OF MAN CONVICTED OF "OLD SHAKESPEARE'S" MURDER. Albany. Dec. 8 (Special) —Governor Od*il Rave a bearing of much public interest to-day to lawyers who are seeking Clemency for the Arab Amer Den AH. known also a* "Frenchy." who was convicted in I*9l of the murder of a woman sometimes called Carrie Brown but usually "Old Shakespeare." Amer Ben All was convicted of murder in the sec ond degree, and Is now in Clinton Prison. The ap plication for his release was mad« by Paul Fuller. of th.- law firm of Coudert Brothers, New- York. and by Ovlde Koblllard, a French attorney. Amer Ben AH was an Algerian Arab, and thus the French Consul at New- York. K>imoiui Bruwacrt.-. has become Interested lii his case. Mr. Fuller said that he appeared in Albany to do a charitable act; he was not to be paid for his work. He believed "Frenchy" was an innocent man. wrongfully convicted of the crime of murder. The crime was a horrible one. and it followed the murders of "Jack the Ripper* in London. Amer Ben Alt was arrested as a suspect at first, and it was shown that the murdered woman went to the hotel in which ahe was afterward found murdered with another man. Thai unknown man was the last one seen alive with her. "Fr.enchy" was also in the same hotel, but he arrived there two hours later. The room in which the woman's body was found bad its door locked and the key was missing. Mr. Fuller then made the statement that recently. ten years after the murder, George Damon, of Cranford, N. J.. who was in business in New-York City at the time, had come forward with the state ment that ten y.ars ago his hired girl had found a hotel key in the room at Cranforn occupied by a man In his employ, who had left the day after the murder and that this k< y was of a similar type to other keys used in that hotel, and had a tab marked "31." the number of the missing key. Mr. Fuller presented an affidavit signed by Mr. Damon, mak ing oath to this statement, that of an employe of Mr Damon, who accompanied him to the hotel to compare th» keys, mid that of a friend of his. a Mr. Lee, with whom he consulted about the case. A knife was shown at the trial which was said to be similar to on- which the accused man had while in the Queens County Jail. Mr. Fuller said the two knives were different. "Frenchy's" knife was merely a common dinner knife; that found in "Shakespeare's." room was a sailor's knife, and it was with a man that looked like a sailor that she was last seen alive. "Frenchy" was a vender of fruit, not a sailor. Then "Frenchy" unfortunately could not apeak either French or English well, and the Algerian interpreter, according to the testimony of Albert J. Leon, a professor ol Arabic in a col lege. iiid not accurately state what "Frenchy" said in giving his testimony. it also had been stated at "Freni'hy'n" trial that* blood marks had been found upon the door Of the room he occupied in the hotel that night. Jacob A. Riis asd his assistant, who vis ited the notel as reporters for an evening news paper, made affidavit that there were no marks of blood upon the door of "Frenchy's" room when they visited th* hot* l the morning after the murder. Mr. Fuller ended his address by saying: "Gov ernor, you have a holy duty to perform in regard to this application for clemency for this mo3t unfort unate man. and one just as responsible as that of saving money for taxpayers." Governor Udell reserved his decision. BAPTIST SOCIETIES MEET.
