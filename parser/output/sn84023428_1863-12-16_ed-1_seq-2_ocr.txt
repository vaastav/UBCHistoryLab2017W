No inconsiderable embarrassments, delay and public injury .have -been expeiiencetl from the want f such governmental establish " cienf The necessity of such a navy yard so furnished, at some suitable place opon tho At lantic seabornd, has on several occasion been brought to the attention of Congress by the . savy department, and it is again presented in the report of the secretary of the navy, 1 which accompanies this communication. I think . it nr.y duty to invite your special attention to this anhject. and also to that ef establi.-hing a yard and depot for naval purposes npon one of the western rivers. A naval force has been crea ted 6a those intorior waters and under many dis- . advantages, within a little niore than two years, exceeding lu numbers the .whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration. (Satisfactory .ami important as have been the performances of the heroic men of ihe navy at this interesting period, they are tcarcaty niotOi wonderful th.au, the success of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has created a new form of naval ! power. Our country has advantages superior i to any, othor nation, in our resources of iron and timber', with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all availa ble und in close proximity to navipablo waters. Even, without the advuut:iee of public works, the resources. of- the nation have boon developed and ' lis power displayed in the construction of a na vy of such magnitude, which has, at the very pe Jlod nt iu creation, rendered signal service to the Union.,, The iuorose of the nnimer of sea-; men in the public service, from T,5U0 men in the ' apriog of to about !U,0U at the present time, has been accomplished without special leg islation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase. It has been proved, however, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for nrmy recruits, is poing ;,o flccf injutioly the naval service, and will, if net col lected, be likely to impair its efficiency by dftfichiug seamen from their proper vocation and Imluriae them ' to enter the army. 1 therefore respectfully anggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval service by a definite provison oa this aubjeet, which would, at the same time, be equitable to the communities tnoie especially interested. t.l.Lf i

' The quantity of hnj deposed of during the last year and tbo lirst quarter of the preient fiscal years was 8,811,249 acres, of Which (01.9L L acres were sold for cash, 1, 406,514 acres were taken up under the homestead law. and the residuoispits. d of uuder laws granting lands for military bounties, for railroad and other purposes, it also appears that the sale of the public lands is large ly ou the iiicreasa. It has long lieen a cherished upiuioa of some of our wisest statosmen that the peopiuof tho United states had a higher and hum enduring iuterest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lauds than iu tho amount of direct revenue to be de lvd from the sale of them.-, This opinion has lmd, controlling influence in shaping legislation iipou the subject of our national domuin., .1 may cite as evidence) f this, the liberal measurea (tdopted in reference to actual settlers, the grant to the states of the lauds overflowed, within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and ren dered fit for cultivation, and the grants to rail way companies of alternate sections of land up on thu contemplated lines of their roads,: which when completed wilt so largely multiply the lacilitiua for leaching our distant possessions. , . t This policy has received its most signal and be titficfut. illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers, ritnee the 1st day of January last, the bolore mentioned quantity of 1,4")6,514 acres of land have lieen ta ken up under its provisions. .This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of in flreasing settlement upon'lmhlic lands.

AGRICULTURE. ' T transmit th? second arlnnal report of the com missioner of tie department of agriculture, ask ineyour attention to the developments in that vital interest, of the nation. rRfltiBESS IN THE WAR. VVheu Congress assembled a year ago, the war had alieady lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea with varying remits. The rebel lion had bern pressed back into reduced limit-. Yet the ton-) of , public feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory. With other signs! the popular elections then just past indicated un easiness among ontselves, while amid much that was cold alid menaojng. the kindest words coming from Europe were title; ed in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few arm ed vessels, built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such addi tions from the Same quarter as would sweep our trade from tho sea and raise our blockade, We had failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful npon this subject. EMACtPATlON AND NEGRO SOLDIERS. The preliminary emancipation proclamation is sued in September was running its assigned pe riod to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the annouueement that colored men of suitable con dition would be received into tho war service. The policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope and fear ahd doubt contended in uncertain conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration the general government had no lawful power to eflect emancipation in any state, and for a long tune it had been hoped that the rebellion could be sup pressed without resorting to it as a military meas ure. . It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, uud that if it should, the ci isis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are per mitted to take another review. , The re 11 bor ders are pressed still further back. and by the com plete openingof the Mississippi the country dom inated by the rebellion is divided into two distinct parts with no practical communication between them. Tennessee and A i kansas have been tub stau lially cleared of insurgents, and iufluentlal citizens in each, owners of slaves and advocates of. slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respect ive states. Of those states. not included in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Mis souri, neither of which, three years ago. would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slav ery into the territories, only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it withiu their own limits. Of those who wore slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full one hundred thousand are now in the United. .States military service, about one-half of which number actually liear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking .so much labor from the insurgent cause and supply ing the places which otherwise might be filled by so many white men So far as tested it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measure of emancipation among the blacks. , These -measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and contempory with such dis cussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same measure have been fully discussed, supported, criticised and denouo cd, and the annual elections following are high ly encouraging to those whose official duty it is tnbcaiMhe country through thi great trial. Thus we have the new reckoning: the crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.. ' PLAN FOR RECONSTRUCTION. Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of tho national anthority within tho states wherein that authori ty has been euspended, 1 have thought tit to issue a proclamation, a copy ol which is herewith trans, nutted. . In examination of this proclamation, it will appear, as is believed, that nothing is at tempted beyond what is simply .justified by the constitution. True the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it, - Ihe man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntaiily takes the oath. '1 he constitution authorizes the executive to grantor withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully establi-bed by judicial and other authorities. It is also prof fered that, if in any of the states named, a slate government shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be recognized and parauteed by the United Willi's, and that under it the state shall, on the constitutional conditions be protected against invasions and domestic vio lence. The constitutional obligation of the Uni ted States to guarantee to every state in the Un ion a republican form of government, and to pro tect the state in the coses stated, is explicit and ull. Hut why tender the benefits of this provision only to a state government set up in this particu lar way? This section of the constitution con templates a case wherein the element within state favorable to republican government in the Union may be too feeble for an oppo-ite and hos tile element, external to or even within the state; and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived state government.1 constructed in the whole or in preponderating part, from the very clement against whose hutilty and violence it is to be protected, Is absnrd, There must lie a test by which toenarate the opposing element so as tb build only form those that are sound, and that test Is a sufficiently liberal one which ac cepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recan tation of his former unsoundness. Hut if it be proper to require as a test of admission to 'the political body an oath of allegiance to the constitution of the United States, and to the Un ion under it, why not also to the laws and proc lamation in regard to slavery ? ' Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put f:;rth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the re bellion. To give them their fullest effect, there hail to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my Judgement, they have aided and will further aid tne cause ror wnich they were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and as tounding breach of faith, I may add. at thii rnfnt. that while I remain in my present position shall not attempt to retract or modify theeman cliiatlon proclamation . norshall I return to slav ery any person who Is free by the terms of that proclamation or ly any of tho acts of Congrevs. Per ttierie and other reasons, it is thought best that support of those nieaure shall lie included ia tneeath. and it is lielieacd the executive may lawfttliv claim it in return for pardon and the res toration of forfeited rights which he has clear icenstitutional power to withhold altogether, or graftt npon the terms be shall deem wisest for the peblie iuterest. It should be observed, also, that this part ol the oath is subject to the modifying aad abrogating power ol legislation and supreme judicial decision. The proposed acquiescence of the national executive in any reasonable tempo rary atate government for the freed people is made with the view of possibly ' modifying the confusion and destitution, which must at best at tend all classes, by a total revolution ot labor throughout the whole of these states. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if, to this extent, this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the national executive, to prevent an abuse, is abiidged by the proposition. The sup position in proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the states, pn what is cal led reconstruction, is made in the hope that it may do good without any. danger of harm. It will save labor and avoid g.-eat confusion. But why any proclamation now upon this subject? t This question is beset with the conflicting views ' that the step might be delayed too long or be ta . kou too soon, i In some states the elements fur resumption seem ready for action, but remain in active, apparently for the want of a rallying point or a plan of action, for why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A ? and if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan ? By the proclamation, a plan is presented which may lie accepted by thein as a rallying point and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected hee. This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The object ions to a premature pre-entation of a plan by the national executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to future developments. .Care has been taken i to so shape the document as to avoid embarras ! ment from this source. Saying that.' on certain terms, certain classes will be pardoned, with rights restored, it is not said that other classes or otherterms will never be included; and saying al I so that reconstruction will be accepted if presen ! ted in a specified way. it is not said it will never I be accepted in any other way. The movements ! by state action for emancipation in several of the states, not included in the emancipation proclam 1 ation, are matters of profound gratulation, nnd, while I do not repeut in detail what I have here , fofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my fenernl views and feelings remain unchanged. and trust Congress will omit no fair opportunity of I aidln? these important Btcps.to tho great con- i summation. , 

IMPORTANCE OP THE WAR TOWER. - In the midst of other cares however important, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance, und to that pow er alone can we look yet for a time, to give confi. dence to the peoplo in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that, confidence shall be established, little can be done anywhere for what is called recon struction. Hence ohr chiefest care must still be directed to the army aud navy, who have thus far borne their harder parts so nobly nnd well. And it may be esteemed fortunate 1 liar, in giving Ihe greatest efficiency to these Indispensable arms, we do also honorably recognize the gallant men. from commander to sentinel, who .compose them, and to whom, more than toothers, the world mnst stand indebted for the home of free dom, disenthralled,1 rejuvenated, enlarged and perpetuated. .

Meetings were held, and the passage money of parties to make the seizure was paid - through to New York. They were promised $00 each on the t-t-araer's being safely taken into VVil. mington. It was also arranged that at 'a certain store1 in: New York each of the parties was to cull at different times for a p .reel containing a revolver, ammunition and a pair of handcuffs. It is believed that the cargo was shipped by Confederate agents was valuable to the South, and that it was arranged that she should be seized on this particular trip. The manager of the plot represented that the Chempeuh had beeu taken 'while attempting to run tbo blockade, and this was a harmless ef fort to get back Southern property. We : have the names of five of the parties en gaged in the seizure.' They belong to this city, and left here with Ctipt. Brainc. 'Ihey are of the worst species of humani ty denominated " roughs."
