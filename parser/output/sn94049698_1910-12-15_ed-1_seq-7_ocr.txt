STEAMER Of! OCKS Alaska Liner Goes Ashore During 5 5 - f:1 1 1 g Gale. Wireless Calls for Help, Then All Is Silent Stores is Raging Along Coast. Cordova Alaska, Dec. 13. The Alaska Steamship company's steamer Olympia, with 106 persons aboard, Is ashore on Bligh island. Prince William sound. A furious storm is raging. No word has been received from the wireless operator on the Olympia since . this morning, and grave fears are en tertained for the safety of those on the wrecked vessel. There are 52 passengers aboard the Olympia. Most of them boarded the vessel here last night. Among those who sailed from here for Valdez and Seward are United States District Judge Cushman, Mrs. Cushman and members of the Third District court, who are on their way to Valdez, where court convenes tomorrow. The crew of the Olympia consists of '54 officers and men, Captain J. Daniels being in command. The Olympia sailed from Cordova at o'clock last night, having arrived from Seattle earlier in the day. Al though the night was clear and a full moon shed a bright light, navigation was made dangerous by a 50-mile gale which was blowing from the north. Between 12 and 1 o'clock this morning the operator on duty at the navy wire less station picked up the distress sig nal of the Olympia. He answered at once. Operator Hayes, on the Olym pia, then sent an urgent appeal for help, saying that the Olympia had struck on Bligh island and was in an exposed position. Heavy seas were breaking over her, making the position of those on board all the more perilous. The message from the Olympia was received with difficulty. ;The men in charge of the naval wireless station express the opinion that the grounding of the vessel had in some way caused a short circuit which interfered with the sending of the wireless messages from the steamer. Fpr several hours this morning the naval operator was unable to get any response to his calls to the Olympia and it was feared that the vessel had gone down with all on board. The operator continued his efforts and at 10 o'clock was rewarded by again re ceiving a faint call from Operator Hayes on the helpless vessel. Hays said that the storm was continuing with unabated fury. The Olympia was being tossed about by the pounding waves, grinding her sides against the rocks that held her prisoner. This constant pounding of the steamer made it almost impossible to operate . the wireless. The operator said the passengers and crew are still hopeful that help will come before the ship goes to pieces. Huge waves continue to break over her and the situation of the passengers, is extremely serious. UNCLE SAM SECOND. Great Britain Still Leads Naval Powers. World's Washington The United States closes another year in second place among the world's naval powers. The great navy building race between Ger many and Great Britain has not brought the former country up to the, United States in the number of battle ships afloat, but in Bhips projected and in the total number of war vessels of ail kinds, Germany will crowd the United States to third place.' ' These facts are shown in the new navy year book perpared by PiKtman Pulsifer, clerk to the senate committee on naval affairs, and soon to be issued by the government printing office. Stolen Gold Is Captured. San Francisco Six men and a wo man are in the city prison here on or ders of the United States secret ser vice bureau and the local police that they are responsible for the theft of $59,000 in bullion from the shipment f gold 'aboard the steamer Humboldt on September 11. Gold bars valued at approximately $7,000 have been re covered by the authorities. Papers found among the effects of two of the prisonrs show that $3,100 worth of gold has been sold. Those under arrest include E. C. Smith and his wife. t China Plans New Coinage. Peking, China If the latest imper ial decree is carried out as expected, China will have a vastly improved coinage system, with coins comparing with the American dollar, half dollar, quarter, dime, nickel and cent, and ad ditional coins worth, approximately, two cents, five mills and one mill. The standard will be silver, and the unit of the national currency will be the "yuan," which corresponds to the American "dollar, its value being $1,008. Sledding Bad for Peary. Washington Representative Ma con, of Arkansas, threatens trouble for Captain R. E. Peary, Arctic explorer, When the question of making him rear admiral comes up in the house. Macon is a memk't of the naval affairs com mittee. He contends there is no more proof that Peary discovered the pole than Dr. Cook had to prove his asser tions. He threatens to fight the bill to the last ditch. ENGINEERS VOTE TO STRIKE. If Demands Are Refused, Clash May Be Greatest in History. Chicago Warren S. Stone, grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomo tivengmeers, and four of his assist ants spent Saturday canvassing the re cent strike vote taken by the men on the Western railroads. Mr. Stone estimated that 96 per cent of the enginemen favored a strike The next move, according to Mr Stone, is with the railroads. Ihe railroads affected in the present controversy are those extending west from Chicago, and if the engineers strike the Eastern roads will not be drawn into the controvresy. There is always a chance, however, of a sym pathetic strike, and in that event. the Eastern engineers would join the strik ers. Switching Bervice in the Chicago yards, would be brought to a standstill, Sixty-one railroads will be affected if the engineers vote to strike and their terms are not accepetd by the managers. The number of enginemen employed on these roads is 33.700. The lines represent 136,000 miles of road, or 63 per cent of the total mileage of the country. This vote is the first that has ever been ordered by the Brotherhood of Engineers on a general scale and it is the first of any kind to be taken since the strike on the Burlington in 1888. "Our brotherhood is known through out the country for its conservatism," said Grand Chief Stone, "and when we take a strike vote it means some thing. The managers tried to take ad vantage! of us because we have not been inclined to strike in the past We have done our best to maintain harmony, and have even made conces sions that our men would not be wil ling to- accept. If it comes to a strike, which now seems likely, We will tie up every road west of Chi cago." After months of negotiations the demands of the engineers now are some 7 per cent higher than the rail road managers are willing to grant. If the demands are not acceded to a strike that will close the throttle of every railroad locomotive west, south and north of Chicago may be called within five hours, it was intimated. Conditions on Coast. O. R. & N. Co., $4.40 to $5.20 for a run of 100 miles or less, to be com- pleted in 10 hours or less. Southern Pacific, $3.75 to $5.17 for a run or 1UU miles or less, to be com pleted in 8 hours or less. Overtime, pro rata. General increase requested 15 per cent. Number of engineers affected 425. 

HOME RULE FOR IRELAND. Liberals Win i Dream Is n England, Realized. Irish Liverpool, Eng. Premier Asquith has pronounced home rule for Ireland the leading issue in the present cam paign. This momentous pronounce ment was made in a small schoolhouse of a remote village in Scotland but al ready it has stirred the whole British Islands and eclipsed all other issues in the fight. The pronouncement was made in answer to a "heckler" as the typical disturber of British political meetings is called. "Is it the truth," asked this heckler, "that, if the Liberal government is re turned to power in this election, it will give Ireland a measure of home rule?" I "My reply," said Asquith, "is, 'it is.'. " - Though Redmond was well aware .that it was Asquith's intentionl to give Irish, home rule an immediate chance, the carpers and factionists in Ireland have been insisting that Asquith was a trickster and that Redmond was his dupe. But even the Dublin Independ ent, chief supporter of the Healy fac tion, confesses that Asquith'B confes sion leaves no more to be said, and is entirely satisfactory. Hance Gave Bed to Grant. Seattle, Wash. Celebrating his ninetieth birthday anniversary, Byron S. Hance, assistant attorney general of the United'States during the admin istration of General U. S. Grant, and personal friend of Sheridan, Sherman and other great generals, received con gratulations from a host of friends.

Tornado Twirls Things.' Silverton, Or. A tornado, small in area, which passed about two miles southeast of this city struck the house occupied by Arthur Buell and family, hurled it from its foundations and turned it partially around. Aside from breaking nearly all the dishes in the house and slightly injuring some of the furniture, no damage was done. A barn belonging to A.

DOINGS OF OUR NATIONAL CONGRESS MEETS. Republicans are Gloomy; Democrats and Insurgents Rejoice, Washington, Dec. 5. "O, wondrous change" was the sentiment felt today by many Republicans and expressed by the Democrats when the closing session of the 61st congress was opened. In the senate the first rap of the gavel sounded the knell of Senator Beveridge, who will be replaced by Kern. It was as dismal for Aldrich and Hale, whose reign of dictatorship ends with this assembly. For Carter, of Montana, Dick, of Ohio, and Kean, of New Jersey, the session is just as foreboding, this congress marking their last term as national lawmakers. While joy prevailed on the Demo cratic side, goom overhung many a Re publican head. Among the leaders for whom this session writes a death war rant are Burkett, of Nebraska, Bur rows, of Michigan, Depew, of New York, Dick, of Ohio, Flint, of Califor nia, Frazier, of Tennessee, Hale, of Maine, Piles, of Washington, Scott, of West Virginia, and Warner, of Mis souri. While gloom pervaded the senate. the house appeared grief-stricken, the havoc to be wrought in the upper body not equaling the downfall that awaits the representative chamber. Speaker Cannon today began his last period of rule over the lower house and for many of his colleagues this session is 'a fare- well before enforced retirement. Among those is Tawney, of Minnesota, chairman of the appropriation commit tee. Tuesday, December 6. Washington, Dec. 6. Congress con vened at noon today and shortly after ward the annual message of President Taft was sent in and its reading begun in both bouses. The members, who had been provided with printed copies of the document in advance, paid close attention as the reading clerks droned out the message. The various recommendations of the president for the enactment of laws be deemed desirable were received with out any demonstration, but it was evi dent from the attention, that was paid to the reading that they were being carefully followed by the lawmakers. Greatest interest was displayed in the president's recommendations re garding the tariff. The president's statement that the tariff board would not be ready to report during the pres ent session, but that it would report probably before the opening of the next regular session caused a buzz of comment. The reference to criticisms of the tariff bill, some of which he called justifiable, some unfounded and some misrepresentations, was received with careful attention. .The recommenda tion for a revision of the tariff, sched ule by schedule, and that it be treated more as a business question, the rates based on the actual difference in for eign and home cost of production, was also closely followed. Wednesday, December 7. Washington The Ballinger-Pinchot investigating committee, after 11 months' work, made its final report to congress today. T'.l " 11? in me opinion oi seven itepuDiican' members, a majority of the committee, Secretary Ballinger "honestly and faithfully performed the duties of his high office with an eye single to the public interest." In the opinion of the four Demo crats, Mr. Ballinger "has not been true to the trust reposed in him as sec retary of the interior and should be requested by the proper authorities to resign." The Democratic members, led by Senator Fletcher, of Florida, agreed to this mehod of getting the reports be fore congress. Senator Fletcher first raised the point of order trtot the com mittee had already approved the report that was made public at Minneapolis. This point was overruled by Chairman Nelson. A motion then was made to substi tute the Democratic report for the re port agreed upon by the seven Repub licans. This w$s voted down, 7 to 5. It was agreed after the majority report had been adopted that all three should be presented at once in each house and printed together. Under this arrange ment the dissenting reports have equal standing with the majority report be fore the two houses. An order for 30, 000 copies of the report was made by the senate. Thursday, December 8. Washington Currency reform, ex tension of the scope of the national banking laws, in the event of no im mediate general changes in the mone tary system; civil service require ments, a customs service free from "practical" politics; businesslike methods in the daily transactions of the government and a general abolition of red tape wherever it dogs the wheels of the government's business, are amoig the recommendations con tained in the annual report of Franklin MacVeagh, secretary of the treasury, Arkansas Shows Growth. Washington Population statistics of the thirteenth census, issued by the census bureau, include figures for the following states: Arkansas, 1,574, 449, an increase of 262.8S5, or 20 per cent over 1,311,564 in 1900. The in crease from 1890 to 1900 was 183,385, or 16.3 per cent. South Carolina. ' 1, 515,400, an increase of 175,084, or 13.1 per cent over 1,340,316 in 1900. The increase from 1890 to 1900 was 189,167, or 16.4 per cent. presented to congress today." ine expenses or the government in the fiscal year 1912, for which this ses sion of congress is asked to appro priate, are estimated at $630,494,013 12. The estimated expenditures of the Panama canal are given as $56, 920,847.69, making a total of $687, 414,860.81. The estimates, if carried out, represent a net savings of about $13,000,000 in the executive depart ments, as compared with the appro priations for the current fiscal year. Receipts for 1912, Secretary Mac Veagh estimates, will be $680,000,000, which would leave an ordinary surplus of around $50,000,000. If the treas ury should continue to pay for the Pan ama canal out of the cash drawer, as at present, such a surplus would be turned to a deficit of $7,414,860.81. Secretary MacVeagh expresses the hope that the monetary question will come into congress detached from sec tional or political considerations. "Our system can fairly be called a panic-breeding system," he says, "whereas every other great national banking and currency system is pan ic-preventing. As long as we continue under our present system, we are liable to panics, and the vast depreda tions of panics reach Republicans and Democrats and all parts of the conutry alike, fames are no longer necessary and no longer respectable. It is for the government to say whether we shall have panics in the future or not. It is a mere matter of choice." Friday, December 9. Washington, Dec. 9. The house committee on agriculture was request ed today to modify the law giving Western states 25 per cent of the re ceipts from forest reserves within their boundaries by conferring upon tb,e (sec retary of agriculture authority to go into the various states and ascertain whether this money, when so paid to the states by the general government, is being expended as provided by law for schools and roads, or is being used otherwise, and in case he is of the opinion that the money is not being used for these specific purposes, to take it from the states and turn it over to the forest service for their own use. Representative Hawley and other Western members of the committee are decidedly opposed to this proposal, regarding it as a move to deprive the states of that share of the forestry fund to which they are legally entitled. They fear that such a provision, if in serted in the bill, would result in di verting this entire fund into the coffers of the forest service. Charges of irregularity in regard to the allotment of certain Indian lands in Oklahoma were made in the house of representatives today by Chairman Burke, of the Indian affairs commit tee. ' He Baid that misrepresentations had led to the passage of an act for the allotment of 100 acres to James S. Rowell, a white man from Connecticut, who had married an Indian woman and received an allotment near Lawton, Okla., which a United States inspector declared to be worth $75,000 to $100,- 000. It was decided to let the ques tion of Rowell's citizenship go to the courts. The Indian appropriation bill, as finally passed, carried appropriations of $8,277,985, or $97,000 more than recommended. Saturday,' December 10. Washington, Dec. 10. The house this afternoon passed the rivers and harbors appropriation bill, carrying approximately $31,000,000. Debate on the measure was very brief and only one amendment was adopted. The house then adjourned to Monday. Following are the principal appro priations for the Pacific Coast: Los Angeles harbor, $270,000; Oak land harbor, $150,000; San Joaquin river, $25,000; bacramento and Feather rivers, $225,000; Coos Bay, Or., $40,000; Columbia river, Celilo falls to Snake river, $25,000; Dalles river to Celilo falls. $600,000; lower Willamette, river, $105,000; mouth 'of Columbia river, $950,000; Willamette above Portland, $20,000; Grays Har bor, $30,000; Puget Sound $20,000; Snohomish river $75,000. The Indian appropriation bill, carry ing approximately $8,000,000, passed also. The senate was'not in'seession today. Governor Harmon of Ohio, Henry Watterson of Kentucky, " and former Representative Hay of Illinois, went before the house committee on indus trial arts and expositions and explain ed the memorial project planned for Put in-Bay and Lake Erie, the scene of Commodore Peary's naval victories. They asked that the government con tribute $250,000. The committee will act upon this subject during this ses sion of congress and it is beleived will report a bill carrying the necessary ap propriation. Although refusing to comment on the proposed constitution of Arizona until printed copies of the document have been received, it can be authori tatively stated that there is a general impression among congressmen that congress will reject the constitution unless the provision for the recall of judges is removed. Secretary Ballinger Reports. Washington Secretary Ballinger, in his annual report strongly urges the enactment by congress of legislation which will permit proper use and de velopment of the natural resources of the West and permit that section of the country once more to progress. His report is a strong plea for practi cal conservation as distinguished from Pinchotism. ' It is an appeal for the present generation as well as for the rights of generations yet to come. 91

Rome The Tribuna prints an inter view with a Portugese personage whose name is not mentioned, but who is said to be a leading Royalist, con cerning Manuel II, exiled king of Port ugal. Manuel, he says, is poverty-stricken and unable to choose a place of resi dence. Owing to lack of money the dethroned king has been compelled to accept the hospitality of the Duke of Orleans at Wood Norton, Eversham, England. For three months, he has not had means with which to pay his servants. Manuel, according to the interview, hopes that he will be restored to pow er, insisting mat a repuDiic in rortu gal cannot exist. His friend predicts that a congress of the powers will set tle the Portuguese affair, but he says that otherwise the Royalists are ready to fight for the restoration of the mon archy. AVIATOR UP 10,499 FEET. World's Record for Height' Broken by Frenchman in Monoplane. Pau, France Ascending from the aviation field here, M. Legagneux broke the world's altitude record, ris ing to a height of 10,499 feet. The Frenchman landed half frozen after a remarkable plane downward. He used a Bleriot monoplane. The previous official height record was made by Ralph Johnstone, who in the. rceent meet at Belmont Park, soared 9,714 feet. At- Philadelphia, November 23, J. Armstrong Drexel made a remarkably high flight and claimed the world's record. When this was disputed, Drexel requested the officials of the Weather bureau to examine his baro graph. They did so and cerdited him with an altitude of 9,897 feet. These figures, however, have not been offi cially aocepted by the Aero club of America. 20 Rescued from Wreck. Oswego, N. Y. The steamship John Sharpies, of Chicago, grounded on the shore of Galloup island, while going from Chicago to Ogdensburg. A snow storm was raging and waves rolled over her, flooding the boiler room and putting out the fires. Not until next day was the stranded vessel sighted by the steamship Hinckley and by that time, driven from the vessel by intense cold, Mrs." George Russell, wife of the first mate, and half of the crew, had reached one of the islands. The Hinck ley took all hands aboard. Oil Men Criticise Idea. Los Angeles Secretary Ballinger's recommendation that the state regulate the price of crude oil is being criti cised and declared impossible by some of the oil men. "We might just as well have a committee to regulate the price of wheat, beans and other com modities," said S. C Graham. "If we cAn procure a proper disposition of the oil lands and of the petroleum produced from these lands, we can safely permit competition to determine the price." Propose Auto Battalion. Berlin In the reiohstag General Von Heeringen, Prussian minister of war, describing the government's plans of enlarging the army, declared: "The organization of an auton obile battalion is required. The progress of aerial navigation demands the organization of three aeronautical battalions of two companies each."

Guerrero, the larg est city in the state of Chihuahua, with a population of 12,000, is now in the hands of the rebels, according to information which has been received here. Following a combined attack, which took place after the departure of a train bearing the peace officials, the Federal troops are reported to have surrendered.

Following the resignation of Gover nor Sanchez, of Chihuahua, Secretary of State Guillermo Pallas has also re signed in favor of Rafael Alvarez and other important changes in the state government have already taken place. Reports that Sanchez was deposed are incorrect. The citizen soldiers serving at Agua Prieta have returned to their homes at Boccoachi and Fronteras, which is tak en as indication of confidence that the government will maintain peace on the border of the state of Sonora. El Paso, Tex. T. J. Warner, an employe of ' the Pearson Lumber mills at Madera, brought news here that a Mexico-Northwestern passenger train on which he was a passenger was held up at Pedernales by insurrectos and searched for arms' and ' ammunition.

Chicago Striking garment workers to the number of between 20,000 and 25,000 paraded the West Side streets, held many' mass meetings, including the windup at the , National League park, where President Murphy provid ed 75,000 sandwiches and coffee for all. The line of march was closely guarded by police, and extra details were on call, but there was no out break. MiBS Hanna O'Neill, a nonunion garment worker, was severely beaten by a picket, who slipped up behind her and felled her with a blackjack. He was beating and kicking her in the body and face when bystanders drove i - - TT" l : il J OA uiui away, earner in me uay su non union workmen, coming from Eastern cities, were mobbed at the LaSalle street railway station and badly beat en.

Although red flags had been forbidden by the police, the wo men wore red hats and the men flam ing red ties. Bands played the Mar seillaise, and the long lines of march ers sang it in many tongues all ex cept' English. The banners were chiefly in Yiddish,' Polish and Bohem ian, and every language was heard ex cept English. Mrs. Shonts' Gems Seized. New York Jewelry said to be worth $20,000, the property of Mrs. Theodore P. Shonts, of New York, wife of the president of the Interborough Rapid Transit company, was retained by cus toms officials when she returned from Europe on the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.
