\TURDAY, December 18, 1909. ADVERTISING IOWA. Instead of making an appeal to the railroads to cease presenting in Iowa alluring. advertisements of lands and opportunities in other parts of the country, which is said to be one of the.plans of the Greater Des Moines committee, the Davenport Tim&s be lieves it would be more practical to propose to the railroads that they change their advertising so as to give greater publicity to Iowa, to its agri cultural and manufacturing opportuni ties. If, says the Times, the north west Btates prove attractive to so •many Iowans as a result of the rail way advertising that is distributed, why is It not fair to assume that if the railways will in a similar way ad vertise Iowa in the states farther east of here, Iowa may be built up more rapidly? The Times asks why, for in stance, should not the people of Penn sylvania and New York be told of 1he productiveness of Iowa soil, of the op portunities for factories, of the numer ous water power sites, the cheap coal and the transportation facilities in Iowa. WHY NOT KEEP CLARKSON? The Philadelphia Inquirer asks this qaeetion in an editorial comment on tfce announcement recently made that James S. Clarkson, the former Iowan, had been asked to remain at his post until the expiration of his full term liext April, after a former announce ment had been given out that he was to retire at once. The Philadelphia paper points out that crime and CASTOR IA For Infanta snd Children.

CLUB. The Booster committee of the Com mercial association has completed plans for a whirlwind one-day cam paign by which It is expected to bring the membership of that organization up to 500. Tomorrow the committees wil] make their final effort. They are ready for the campaign and all they ask. of the prospective members is to be ready for them. By adding about 250 new members to the Commercial association the Boosters have done a great work. But they will not feel that their work is completed until the association has 500 enthusiastic members, organized to gether to further Ottumwa's interests. The other cities in the state have been watching 'Ottumwa. They have applauded the spirit of prpgressive ness made manifest by the success of the Commercial association member ship campaign. They will watch the result of this closing day's campaign, to see whether the 500 goal is reached, and Ottumwa must make good. The 500 mark must be reached to morrow. Then those 500 members must be made 500 workers. President Taft states that his view of the good roads question is that it is chiefly a State function, and that the states ought to unite in an effort to promote good: roads. The federal government, however, could render great assistance in the work. In arguing for the promotion of a national department of health in his message, President Taft pointed to the great work done by the department of agri culture, although its functions were practically the same in a national way as the state agricultural boards were to the state. The government could render-the same aid to the state road builders as the department of agri culture renders to the state agri Cultural organizations. Aakyour Qrooar for Botdmn Shmmt Floor V*. E.
