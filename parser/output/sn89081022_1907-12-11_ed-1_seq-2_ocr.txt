RIOTS IMMINENT IN MINING CAMP, AND 1,000 TROOPS ARE UNDER ARMS. FUNSTON PREPARES TO HANDLE STRIKERS Dispatch from Scene of Trouble Indi cates That Serious Developments May Arise Roosevelt Sanctions Putting Soldiers in Readiness. San Francisco, Dec. 6.—One thou sand United States soldiers were placed under arms by Gen. Frederick Funston Thursday on receipt of new advices showing riots are imminent in the strike at Goldfield, Nev. Trains are ready, and as soon as Gen. Funston gives the word the troops will be rushed to the scene where the Western Federation of Miners, whose secretary, W. D. Haywood, was re cently tried for the assassination of Former Gov. Steunenberg, is making a fight for existence. Gen. Funston's latest reports from Goldfield are alarming. The town is an armed camp, with strikers arrayed on one side and the rest of the citi zens, protecting nonunion minework ers, on the other. A bloody clash ap pears unavoidable, but before sending the troops Gen. Funston is making a last effort to learn if a truce cannot be arranged. Secret Order from Washington. "The troops were got ready under secret orders from Washington. Gen. Funston was commanded to lose not a minute's time, but outside of that fact the contents of the Washington order cannot be learned. "If the military are sent to Gold field," Funston said, "the Twentieth and Twenty-second infantry will be called out The Twentieth Is now at Monterey and the Twenty-second at Angel island and the Presidio. I am not sure of the exact figures, but I be lieve that altogether they muster fully 1,000 men. If the orders to start should be received we could move with hardly an instant's delay. Everything is in readiness." Fear Bloodshed Is Unavoidable. Goldfield, Nev., Dec. 6.—Conditions Thursday indicated that bloodshed is probable in the miners' strike. The townspeople's request for soldiers to protect them from half-starved strikers, who are committing hold-ups in their struggle for food after a long period of idleness, has only inflamed the strikers. The executive committee of the mine owners has received word from Gov. Sparks that President Roosevelt will furnish federal troops if they are needed. The nearest body of soldiers is at the Presidio, 18 hours away by special train, and much could trans pire before the soldiers could reach here. Mining camps in other sections of the state are in accord with the op erators here. This fact may either provoke or prevent violence by the miners at Goldfield, who know that at many other places in the state hun dreds of idle men are walking the streets hungry and cold. President McKennon of the miners' union has repeated his instructions to the miners to avoid lawlessness, but the element in the union dominated by the Western Federation of Miners, it is believed, is bent on a resort to violence. 

TAFT OFF FOR BERLIN. Makes Departure from St. Petersburg —Russian Officials Relieved. St. Petersburg, Dec. 6.—William H.

He has asked Char lemagne Tower, the American ambas sador at Berlin, to omit any formal en tertainment on account of the serious illness of his mother at Millbury, Mass. The Russian authorities are relieved that the secretary's visit has passed off without any untoward inci dent. The request of a group of stu dents of the university to be permit ted to send a deputation to welcome Secretary Taft upon his arrival was denied by the authorities. Select Ourrency Committee. Washington, Dec. 6.—Chairman Fow« ler of the house committee on banking and currency Thursday announced the subcommittee of five which will frame and submit to the main committee a currency bill. The subcommittee is as follows: Fowler, New Jersey Prince, Illinois Calderhead, Kansas Lewis, Georgia, and Gillespie, Texas. Decision Is Reserved. Buffalo, N. Y., Dec. 6.—Judge Hazel in the United States court Thursday reserved decision upon a motion to make permanent the temporary in junction granted by him restraining the switchmen of the Delaware, Lacka wanna & Western Railroad company from striking. Lou by Fire, $100,000. New York, Dec. 6.—A six-story fac tory building occupied by Ault & Wlborg, manufacturers of printing inks, was destroyed by fire at an early hour Thursday morning. The loss will reach $100,000. Warming Over the Rolls. I think that my method of warming over the rolls will find favor with all who like hot bread. If I^desire to re- a is .^- them up in wet paper, lay them in a pan and let them remain in a hot oven until the paper actually scorches. Heated in this way they will invari ably be mistaken for freshly baked rolls. In fact, have often been com plimented upon my delicious hot bread when had" simply warmed over some good rolls frpm the baker's.—From the Delineator. f* V" "y A* Railroad Earnings. Minneapolis.—The gross earnings of the railroads during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 1907, on business credited to Minnesota show an in crease of more than $7,000,000 over the same figures for the preceding fiscal year, according to the railroad reports to the railroad and warehouse commission. The gross earnings for last year were $88,666,374.56, as com pared with $81,584,237.05 for 1903 a gain of $7,082,137.51 in spite of the fact that the reduced merchandise rates were in effect for the greater part of last year and the 2-cent pass enger fare rate was in effect for two months of that period. The gross earnings of the railroads operating in Minnesota on the busi ness of the entire lines also shows a large increase over the preceding year.

Two Harbors.—Tales of strange animals roaming through the woods, as re.ated by returning hunters and woodsmen, have excited the natives from time to time, but the mystery has been solved at last. These ani mals are nothing but common house cats that have become wild by wan dering in the tall and uncut timber. A landii looker who frequents the wooded districts in the gooseberry tract in the town of Silver Creek estimates that fully 1,000 cats are roaming about in that neighborhood. They seem to thrive after being turn ed loose, and are said to be increasing in numbers rapidly. Almost every logging camp has one or more cats and when the camps are deserted the feline members are generally left be hind to live as best they can. Killed by His Wagon. Red Wing.—Herman Prigge was killed on his farm, four miles from Mazeppa, Goodhue county, as a re sult of his wagon being upset. Her man, Richard Gerken and Charles Severs had been in Mazeppa on busi ness, and had all started home to gether. When well on their way some pump pipes which Severs had on his load got pushed ahead and Gerken gave his team to Prigge to lead behind the rig, while he helped Severs push the pipes back. Mr. Prigge drove on ahead, and as near as can be determined, while going down a hill Gerken's team pushed and upturned Prigge's wagon. The edge of the wagon box struck the man above the left ear, breaking his neck. Suicide. Brainerd.—Jerome Werdin, mana ger of the Monarch elevator at this place, was found in the elevator office with two bullets from a 32-caliber revolver in his brain. The revolver, with two empty chambers, two empty shells and one unexploded cartridge, was found by his side. He died in about fifteen minutes without regain ing consciousness. Mr. Werdin's parents reside in Eden Valley and he came here from Glen wood, Minn., about six weeks ago to take charge of the elevator. Coroner Gibson took the remains in charge and is making an investigation through there seems little reason to doubt that it was a case of suicide. Victory for Langum. Washington.—Representative Taw ney and his colleagues of the Minne sota delegation won an easy and complete victory in the Republican caucus of the house of representa tives in securing the nomination of Samuel A. Langum of Preston to be postmaster of the house by unani mous Vote, which will result in his election on Monday.

Faribault.—A disastrous fire oc tiured yesterday when the dwelling house owned by Mrs. Barron was completely destroyed. The loss is estimated at $10,000, partially cover ed by insurance. St. Paul.—Lottie Leroy, an actress from the Star theater, died at St. Joseph's hospital. C. F. Lund, a Dane who was once director of the orchestra of the im perial opera at St. Petersburg, died a few days ago in Copenhagen. He was buried in the poorhouse graveyard at public expense. He was to receive a pension from the Russian govern ment after his withdrawal from pub lic service on account of a shock caused by the explosion of a shell on Rojestvensky's squadron, but the money never came to him Bjornson, the Norwegian poet, in a lecture before the Danish students' society, insinuated that the Danish ambassadors in the different coun tries had secretly worked for the sep aration of Sweden and Norway. Only a short time ago the Swedish news papers were finally compelled to ad mit that Denmark had remained strict ly neutral, and the poet's remarks may arouse fresh anti-Danish hostil ity in Sweden. A leading politician says that Denmark will not tolerate Bjornson's interference in the rela tion to friendly powers. Bjornson is strongly criticized by the Copenhagen press. The announcement that the govern ments of Sweden and Prussia have agreed to start a line of car ferries directly between those two countries has set the managers of the Danish railways to thinking. The head of the railway department spoke very freely about the matter to a reporter. The new ferry line, he said, would not only deprive Denmark of much transit trade between Germany and Sweden, but it might even get some of the traffic between Hamburg and Norway. Denmark, he said, simply has no choice, she must improve the Gedser and Warvemunde line as well as the railway connected with it. One of the improvements which he looks upon as imperative in this con nection is a railroad bridge across Masnedsund at a cost of $2,000,000. SWEDEN. Civil weddings are Quite frequent in the larger cities of Sweden. The Social Democrats of Eskilstuna are contemplating the establishment of a bank of their own. The failure of some large business concerns revealed the fact that many of the small country banks had loaned money to them. Paul Nordstrom, a seven-year-old boy, fell through the ice at Trangvik, near Ostersund. His brother, Olof, ran out to help him, but he also fell into the water. Finally their father and two other men started to save the boys, and the final result wajs that all five were drowned. As an outcome of the dissension in the cabinet arising from Sweden's failure to become a signatory to the treaty assuring the integrity of Nor way, Foreign Minister E. B. Trolle, War Minister Col. L. H. Tingsten and Minister of the Interior Juhlin are expected to tender their resignations. Monte Carlo—An immense crowd clamored, but without success, to gain admission to the superior court of Monaco to hear the commencement of the trial of Vere St. Leger Goold and his wife, Marie, for the murder at Monte Carlo last summer of Emma Levin. Death by the guillotine will be the penalty if the Goolds are con victed. Prof. Montelius, the greatest living authority on the earliest history of Northern Europe, and especially of Scandinavia, has been asked by the Lowell Institute of Boston to come to America and give eight lectures on that subject, the pay offered being $150 per lecture. If he comes to America he is expected to see his countrymen in the West. Mr. Gunther, the Swedish ambassa dor to Norway, made a trip to Stock holm shortly after the signing of the Norwegian treaty of integrity. He is criticized by the Swedish press be cause he did not know enough about the preliminary history of tnat treaty, and also because he was so awfully sweet when Michelsen resigned as premier of Norway. One paper thinks that a "cold" or some other indisposi tion would have been just the thing on that occasion. Experiments for producing zinc ac cording to Laval's method have been going on for about ten years at Troll hattan, and a company was organized three years ago for applying this method in different parts of the world. Foreigners held a majority of the stock, but in the course of time Swedes have bought so many shares that they control the business. The invention is claimed to be worth un told millions. The headquarters of the company will be in Stockholm. The sugar beets were all dug by the twentieth of November. A few days before that date the weather looked threatening and the rates per day digging were raised so that extra help was secured to rush the work. The city council of Ystad has rent ed out a parcel of ground for 30 years to a company which is to put up a system of kerosene tanks on the ground. Prince Gustaf Adolf took part in a foot race and ran 10 kilometers (about six English miles) in 48 min utes and 5 seconds. A leading Social Democrat writes that it is not advisable to induce Swedes in foreign countries to return to Sweden because such a policy may compel Swedish laborers at home to emigrate. A Stockholm merchant has offered to pay $4,000 for plans and specifi cations for cheap residences, provided the government will provide for hav ing them distributed as prizes in the public schools. The new barracks at Ystad are to cost $152,560, and will be com pleted In about two yaars.

The ferries will be made for carrying passenger and sleeping-cars as well as freight cars This is a most agree able bit of news to the business men ot Southern Sweden who for jyears have been clamoring for direct car ferry connections with Germany. Stockholm, Nov 30—After four hours' discussion today the Royal Swedish Yacht club decided to let the challenge for the America's cup drop. William Olsson and G. N. Kyhlberger, who had offered to subscribe a large amount of money for the purpose of building a challenger, presented at the beginning of the meeting a writ ten statement that they were unable to raise the money at present owing to the financial stringency which had been severely felt in Sweden. The discussion which followed indicated that the club would reconsider the matter of a challenger as soon as the money became available. Mr. Olsson later made the statement that he had not abandoned the enterprise, and that as the New York Yacht club had not declined the challenge for seventy-footers, Sweden certainly would challenge, notwithstanding the crisis
