Bartholdl's Statue of Washing­ ton and Lafayette Unveiled in the French City. Thrf Gift of Joseph Pulitzer In Honor to France For Revo­ lutionary Help. Another Bond Cementing the Traditional Friendship of the Two Nations. PARIS, Deo. 2.—Bright weather shone upon the ceremony of unveiling the group of statuary of Washington and Lafayette, modeled by the well known sculptor, Frederick Auguste Bartholdi, and presented to the city of Paris by Joseph Pulitzer, editor of the New York World. Mr. Ballard Smith, London corre­ spondent of the New York World, first made a short speech as Mr. Pulitzer's representative, presenting the group of statuary, which was frequently ap­ plauded. Mr. Smith alluded to the fact that it was Mr. Pulitzer's good fortune as editor and proprietor of the New York World to inaugurate the popular subscription which gave a worthy ped­ estal to M. Bartholdi's statue of Liberty enlightening the world in New York harbor, and, in conclusion, in Mr. Pulitzer's name, he presented the group to the city of Paris. The military band was present and thereupon played the Marsellaise. M. Bombard, vice president of ti*e Paris municipal council, in accepting the gift for the city, briefly reviewed the history of the two men thus repro­ duced in bronze and said that The Union of the Fltp uncler whioh Washington and Lafayette stood hand in hand, represented really the tinion of the hearts of the two re­ publics. The band played the American anthem and Mr. Samuel Morse, United States consul general, then followed in an eloquent speech. He briefly touched upon the events which had enshrined them in the hearts of Americans till the two names were alike household words in every village. "Even the children," Mr. MorB9 con­ tinued, "can tell how Lafayette brought light and hope and help to the strug­ gling colonists. Republics are some­ times ungrateful but not always." The speaker dwelt upon Lafayette's long and finally triumphant battle for liberty in France and then concluded: "On behalf of Mr. Pulitzer and of the American people, I thank Paris for her gracious welcome to the offering, whose purpose is to testify in a lasting form to the homage in which Americans hold Lafayette and to illustrate again the grateful affection with which we regard the peopie of our sister republic."

RAILROAD WRECK. Train on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Runs Into and Open Switch. SYRACUSE, N., Y., Dec. 2.—Passenger train No. 8, on the Delaware, Lacka wana and Western, which left Syracuse at 10:10 p. m., ran into an open switch at Preble and telescoped three freight cars. The engine of the passenger train was completely wrecked and the baggage and mail cars and two coaches caught fire from the blaze under the wrecked boiler and were consumed. The engineer was instantly killed and the fireman was taken from the debris by the passengers in a dying condition. The sleeping car was the only one saved. Nobody else was seriously hurt. The freight station at Preble caught fire from the wreck and was burned. The engineer who was killed was Richard Young,'unmarried, of this city. The fireman's name was Roof. BISHOP OF SIOUX FALLS. Father O'Gorman to Be Elevated to That Position. SIOUY FALLS, S. D., Dec. 2.—Rev. Father O'Gorman, formerly of St. Paul, but now professor of church history in the Washington, D. C., university, will in all probability be the next Catholic bishop of the Sioux Falls diocese. Re­ cently while in St. Louis Archbishop Ireland remarked that "the next bishop of. Sioux Falls will sign his name Thomas." As th&t is the first name of Father O'Gorman, and as he has been prominently mentioned as the probable successor of Bishop Marty, now at St, Clotid, Minn, it is thought certainfchat Father O'Gorman will be named. The public announcement will be made soon if there is not another postpone­ ment of the consistory. Sllverites Have Hlftk Hopes.

WEBSTER CITY, la., Dec. 2.—The dis­ covery of natural'gas on-the firn of James G. Green, near Irvington, 'nortji of this place, is causing much excite­ ment. An artesian well was sunk and had reached a depth of 203 feet, 25 be­ ing through solid rock. The flame came out of the iron pipes as soon as they were lighted, extending a distance of nearly three feet, and the blaze was hot enough to cook food. This is the first discovery of natural gas in this section of the state, but it thought enough will be found to prove profitable for use in manufacturing industries. New Church in Ashes. GRAND FORKS, N. D., Dec. 2.—Sacred Heart Catholic church, East Grand Forks, costing $10,000, dedicated two weeks ago, entirely free from debt, burned to the ground this morning.

A search of his cabin revealed over 100 pounds of ore the value of which will run into thou­ sands of dollars. The owners of the Doctor mine believe they have lost as much as $25,000 through stealing in the past few weeks. Other arrests are likely to be made. The Strike Will He Settled. NEW YORK, Dec. 2.—All indications point to the fact that the trouble be­ tween the United Housemiths and Bridgemen's unions against the firms of J. B. & J. H. Cornell and Milliken Bros, will be settled by Tuesday at the latest. The strikers profess to be anx­ ious to end the strike and are willing to retract, for_ the sake of peace, from their original demtu)ds.

Burleigh county receives $1,467. WEEKLY TBANSUKiPT, LITTL.* /AliLb, AfLNtf The Sultan Known to Believe the Powers Are Not Act Ing in Concert. This Wil. Account for His Re? cently Refusing to Grant the Firmans. Fear of Rousing Fanaticism of the Turks Against the Foreigners. CONSTANTINOPLE, via Sofia, Bulgaria, Dec. 2.—It has not yet been conclusively developed here what is to be the effect on the disordered state of the empire of the relinquishment temporarily, at least, of the purpose of the powers to in­ troduce additional guardships into the Dardanelles for the protection of for­ eigners in the domains of the sultan. The ordering back to Salonica bay of the British gunboat Dryad, which had been ordered up the Dardanelles at the request of the British ambassador, Sir Philip Currie, in anticipation of the promised granting of the firmans by the sultan for warships to pass through, is. officially explained on the ground that the proposed action would do more harm than good by inflaming the fanaticism of the Turks against for­ eigners on account of the supposed affront to the sultan by what would, in affect, have amounted to a naval dem­ onstration against Constantinople. The effect of the abandonment of its pur­ pose by Great Britain on the situation in Turkey is awaited with anxiety and great interest. The question of guard ships seems At a Standstill For the Present, though the threat of Sir Phillip Currie to renew his purpose unless foreigners should be exempt from outrage is still open. Undoubtedly one effect of the order­ ing back of the Dryad to Salonica is that the belief in the often alleged con­ cert in the powers in their attitude to­ wards Turkey is waning. The sultan is known to havo been skeptical as to this concert for some time past, and, it is said, has based his long continued op­ position to Great Britain's demands upon a belief that no such concert ex­ isted or that it could not endure for any length of time. This belief cannot but have been in part confirmed by Great Britain's withdrawal of her demand after it had been so strenuously pressed to the very verge of a crisis. Whether Great Britain is influenced by the alleged danger to foreigners from fanatical Turks which would en­ sue upon the proposed demonstration, or whether she has learned to doubt the approval of her action which might be' accorded by the other powers, is there­ fore a question that is asked on all Bides. LIABLE TO LOSE MECCA. The Holy Cltjr In Danger of Capture by Rebe s. LONDON, Dec. 2.—A letter from Aden, Arabia, dated Nov. 20, gives details of the Arabian revolt against the sultan in Yemen, the coffee growing district of Southwestern Arabia. The importance of the outbreak lies in its proximity to Mecca. The loss to the sultan of the Mussulman Holy City would probably mean his deposition. Hence the strenu­ ous ^official denials which have been made of the existence of the rebellion. Train Wrecker Caught. ST. LOUIS, Dec. —A special to The Republic from Waster City, la., says: The man who wrecked the Northwest­ ern passenger train between Ames and Storey City two weeks ago has been captured.

DEiJ. /VOULD LIKE JTO GET OUT. Klklns, the Yoathful Iowa Murderer, Wants a Pardon. MASON CITY, la., Dec. 2.—-John B. Elkins, one of the most youthful as well as the most depraved criminals in the state, has an application on file for his pardon. At the age of 11 years he committed one of the most brutal crimes in the category. In 1889, while living on a farm in Clayton county, because his parents refused to let him go to a dance, he entered their room when they were sound asleep, and with a shotgun, blew his father's head off, and then completed his work by splitting his mother's head open "with an axe. After the deed was committed he took- his younger brother, and on horseback, rode to the nearest neighbor, and John told them the story that his father and mother had been murdered. Confessed to the Murder. The story was at first believed, but when John was closely questioned he broke down and confessed the :rime. He was sent up for life, and since he has been in the penitentiary has twice threatened and attempted murder, and is still considered a very dangerous character with murder born in him. If the desire of the people of Clayton county is taken into considera­ tion he will fall far short of getting the pardon. WILL BE A FAVORITE. West Creek, Colo., May Eclipse Cripple Creek. DENVER, Dec. 2.—The splendid career of Cripple Creek may be repeated and possibly eclipsed by West Creek, which is within 50 miles of Denver, and al­ most in sight of the dome of the capitol. The greatest activity prevails among the miners and prospectors and town site boomers. There are now several hundred assessments worked and the surveying of claims .has just begun. There will probably be several thousand claims surveyed and recorded before spring. The miners claim the mineral is richer than that at Cripple Creek on the surface. It is lodged in clearly de­ fined veins and can be easily traced. While the entire country is covered with a thick growth of magnificent timber, the drift is shallow and does not operate as a barrier to the discovery of leads as in many other camps. The accessibility of the camp is certain to make of it a favorite. PROCLAMATION ISSUED. The Insurgent Leader Promulgates Some everfe Orders. TAMPA. Fla., Dec. 2.—Spanish papers arriving here say that General Gomez has issued the following proclamation: First—After Dec. 1 small detach­ ments of our army will proceed to de­ rail all trains by dynamite. Second—Country people whose resi­ dences are located on main roads will move their houses back some 20 yards. Third—Any one advising the Span­ iards of our whereabouts will be dealt With as an enemy. Fourth—All wire fences inust be raised by the owners, otherwise they will be cut, Fifth—Any one endeavoring to sell the products of his plantation in any city or town will be hung. Pickpockets at a Dedication. WINONA, Minn., Dec. 2 —At the dedication of the new Polish church on Thanksgiving day, a number of women in the large crowd wore relieved of their purses and contents. A woman from La Crosse lost $150, and one from Pine Creek, Wis., had $100 in her purse, which was stolen. Several women from this city who were in the crowd lost various sums from 50 cents to several dollars. One of the women felt some one at her pocket, and looking around saw a fellow sneak off, but he was lost in the crowd and could not be caught. In a State of Indignation. LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 2.—The citizens of Ws- verly are in a state indignation over the recent elopement of Dr. G. A. McCandless and Druggist E. R. Vining, with two young ladies of Waverly, Misses Alice Miller and Nannie Ward. The citizens hired a hall for the pur­ pose of expressing their disapproval of the conduct of the men. Two commit­ tees, one of women and another of men, were appointed and drafted resolutions expressing their indignation. For Bradley's Inagnratlon. FRANKFORT, Ky., Dec. 2.—The most tialorate iit.aumoments are being made for the iiiiufruiation on Dec. 1Q of Gov­ ernor-elect W. O. Bradley. The citi­ zens, irrespective of party, are taking part in the preparations and both par­ ties are represented on the committee. The occasion will attract a larger crowd than usual because Bradley is the first Republican to be inaugurated as chief executive of the commonwealth. Belong to the State. Sioux CITY, la., Dec. 2.—Attorney General Remley of this state, in an un­ official opinion contained in a letter to a Sioux City attorney, gives it as his judgment that the drained lake beds in the state, concerning the title to which there has been so much discussion of late, belong neither to the counties in which they are located, to the general government nor to the abutting prop­ erty owners, but to the state. Disagree as to Stewart. GRAND FORKS, N. D., Dec. 2.—-The trial of Dan S. Stewart, formerly cashier for the Great Northern here, on the charge of embezzling funds of the company, ended in a disagreement of the jury. The state', it is understood, will press the other charge now pending against Stewart—that of forgery. Socialists Saspend Operations. BERLIN, Did. 2.—A committee of the Socialist-Democrat party announces that owing to polioe persecution it has been decided to temporarily suspend operations by the party, the leadership of whioh until further notice will te vested in the Socialist members of the reicbstag. 0- I81i The Man From Maine Elected to His Old Position in the Popular Branch. The First Day's Business Con­ fined to the Election and Drawing Seats. But Little Business Will Be Done in Either House Till Next Week. WASHINGTON. DPO. 2.—The first week of the Fifty-fourth congress promises nothing at either end of the Capitol in the way of actual legislation. The timo before the Christmas holidays is usually devoted to preliminary matters and the work of the session does not begin until after the recess. The new congress w.ll probably not be an exception to this rule. The senate proceedings may be enlivened by an attempt at reorganiza­ tion but in the house nothing can be done until the committees are appointed. Speaker Reed says that the committees will not be announced this week with, perhaps, a single exception—the com­ mittee on rules. This committee for­ mulates the rules which are to govern the house during its session and. it is customary for the speaker to name it during the first week in order that it can immediately begin its labors. While it is believed that the rules of the Fifty-first congress over which Mr. Reed presided will be reported for the guidance of the present house, it is un­ derstood that a few changes will be made as a result of the experience which are to still further Improve the House Machinery and the facilitation of publio business. Mr. Kerr, clerk of the last house, called the house to order. After the roll call the election of the officers nominated by the Republican caucus occurred, and as soon as Mr. Reed was formally installed as speaker the drawing of seats, which is known as the congressional "raffle," followed. This was a somewhat tedi­ ous but amusing affair and occupied the remainder of the afternoon. The read­ ing of the president's message will con­ sume Tuesday, and at its conclusion the house will probably adjourn until Thursday, and on convening Thursday adjourn immediately until Monday. These adjournments will continue prob­ ably until the committees are an­ nounced. This is the programme, but the unexpected might occur, as it so often does in the house, if some aspir­ ing member should introduce a sensa­ tional resolution and ask for its imme­ diate consideration. Programme In the Senate. It is not probable that the first woek of congress will witness much serious effort at legislative work in the senate. Tho message will be read on Tuesday and tho brief sessions of Wednesday and Thursday will be devoted largely to the introduction of bills of which there will bo several hundred. Following precedents, the senate will on Thursday until the following Monday. One or two brief executive sessions for the ref­ erence of nominations are also among the probabilities for the week. If the the Republicans decide upon an effort to reorganize as is now generally conceded the Democrats will follow a conference at which they probably will decide upon a course of action. It now appears probable that all three parties will place candidates for president pro tern in the field and in that event the week will be enlivened somewhat by a triangular contest for this and the other offices of the senate. 

NAMED BY ACCLAMATION. Thomas B. Reed Has No Opposition in His It ace For the Speakership. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—The Repub­ licans of the house of, representatives met in caucus and unanimously nomi­ nated ex-Speaker Thomas B. Reed of Maine for speaker of the Fifty-fourth congress. Hon. Galusna Grow, speaker of tho house in I860, nominated Mr. Reed in the caucus. He simply pre­ sented Mr. Reed's name, and the nomi­ nation was made by a rising vote and amidst cheers. Mr. Grow, Mr. Cannon and Mr. Payne escorted Mr. Reed to the hall, 'and 'when the cheering which greeted his appearance had subsided he made a brief speech of acceptance. In order, the following officers were then selected by the caucus: Clerk, Alexander McDowell, Pennsylvania sergeant-at-arms. Benjamin F. Russell, Missouri doorkeeper, William J. Glenn, New York postmaster, .Josoph C. McElroy, Ohio. Democrats Nominate Crisp. At the Democratic caucus ex-Speaker Crisp and the other officers of the Fifty third congress were selected as the Democratic slate without opposition. UNUSUAL SPECTACLE. A Regularly Certified Congressman Will Resign His Seat. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—Representa­ tive Lawrenee McGann of Chicago, who held a seat in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third congresses and was chair­ man of the committee on labor in the last congress, will furnish to the house the unusual spectacle of a member mak­ ing a voluntary relinquishment of the seat to which he holds the certificate. As soon as he is able to secure the rec­ ognition from* the speaker Mr. McGann will make a statement to ^he house to the the effect that he thinks his Repub­ lican opponent, Mr. Hugh R. Belknap, is entitled to the seat and that he (McGann) waives all claims thereto. This step Mill make is possible for the committee on elections, as soon as it is organized, to report in favor of seating Mr. Belknap and will relieve that gen­ tleman of the necessity of making a contest before the committee. 3 NEITHER IN GOOD SHAPE. The Principals of the Wilkes-HeVsrlgU i.nel in Bad Plight. CHICAGO, NOV. 80.—The wounds of Paul Tupper Wilkes, received in the sensational Wilkes McVeigh uuel, fousrht Nov. 12 at Fort Lee, on the Hudson, were hastily dressed by a sur­ geon in the office of the Auditorium, theatre. Mr. Wilkes shortly after left the city for Kentucky. He arrived in town on Thanksgiving day, but his stopping place was kept secret by his friends, destination in Kentucky is unknown, but he will be the guest of friends at some country p'.ace until the complications resulting from the duel have subsided. Wounds Have Not Healed Well.. Mr. Wilkes' wound has not healed rapidly, and tho surgeon called was compelled to lance the arm. Owing to the fact that the wounds of the other principal in the duel have taken a dan­ gerous turn and blood poisoning is feared, Mr. Wilkes was entertained dur­ ing h:s stay in this city, where he is well known, with great privacy. The famous affair, fought out to a bloody end in a little grove near Fort Lee 17 days ago, was the result of a quarrel at the Astor House cafe on the evening of Nov. 12. THE INTERSTATE PARK.

Congressman Heatwole will probably be asked to introduce thn bill, which will be helped along by a lengthy petition signed by residents of Minne­ sota and Wisconsin. Mr. Hazzard said he had no doubt the importance of the measure in its bearings to the two states would induce congress to pass the bill. New York's Wool Exchange. NEW 

YORK, Deo. 2.—The Herald says: The opening of the Wool Ex­ change, whose handsome new building at Beach street and West Broadway, is almost completed, is expected to make New York the wool market of the coun­ try. It is asserted by those who are back of the schemo that its effect will be to drive the wool trade of Boston to this city in a body. Wool will be sold here at auction, as it in in London. Minneapolis to Frisco by Wheel. SAN FHANCISCO, Deo. 2.—Tlieodoro and Eddie Kraguess, Minneapolis wheelmen, arrived in this city Wednes­ day on their wheels, having made tho run from Minneapolis via the Union and Southern Pacific routes in 88 days actual travel. They had a hard trip but fortunately met with no accidents and arrived here strong and well. Oitliain Vory Dry.
