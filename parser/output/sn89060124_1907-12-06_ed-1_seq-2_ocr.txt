Although Congress will give its attention to a number of measures, those that are paramount in the pub lic mind are currency regulation and ship subsidies. The first meas ure is more or less adventitious in its nature. There occurred anything fundamental to altar tbe conditions under which the coun try’s finances have been operated. There has not been any movements in tbe metals to cause an unbalanc ing of the equipose between gold and silver so as to revive the Bryan cry for a fictitious parity of values. There is such widespread prosperity, the craps being abundant, that no occasion has been created for finan cial tinkering in order to adjust the circulation to industrial depression. One is led to wonder at the urgency of the demand for financial legisla tion in view of these circumstances. There has been more than a flurry in securities, but the phenomenon was not symptomatic as far as in dustry is concerned. The sensitive ness of capital when once startled leads to contraction, and this has been a strongly marked egect of re cent conditions. But as many ailments require remedies rather than cures, there being nothing chronic in them, so tbe financial situation is one for remedy rather than a cpurse of her '©io treatment. President Roosevelt in his last general message to Con gress was chary in recommending finnancial legislation, although giv ing perfunctory approval to tbe cur rency plaus of Secretary Shaw. 1 is not believed that he is enthusias tic for an overhauling of the subject now, although, like many other per sons, be has been appalled at* tbe grave danger into which the coun try was brought by recent happen ings. But as the circumstances that brought about tbe stringency are not likely to recur in similar form, and as it is impossible to properly gnage all future conditions that might bring about a lack of confi dence upon tbe part of tbe public, it would seem as though an attempt to prescribe for the t financial ills of the country upon a general plan would be prescribing upon hypothetical grounds. That the country has not a perfect financial system goes with out saying. That Congress should proceed very slowly in making changes and not act upon too broad an assumption from the late acute conditions is just as true. Indeed, the very agitation of the subject at ' this time may have tbe unfortunate effect of causing the people to be lieve that the ills are more deep rooted than is in reality the case. The matter might very well be giv en over to au expert commission and allowed to rest in such hands for fu ture recommendations to Congress. This action would have the best possible effect io allaying present perturbation. The subject of ship subsidies is a pressing one. Considered either from tbe point of view of the need for a class of vessels readily convert ible into cruisers and tiansports or from the point of view of tbe coun try’s commercial necessities, the de sirability of having tbe government encourage the opening of new lines of commerce to South America, Pa cific islands and Eastern points finds strong support. The failure of Con. gress at its last session to take ac tion leaves the work for the present one. Tbe plea that this is class leg islation is answered by the fact that it is only proposed that the govern ment shall compensate the American shipowner for the disadvantage he is under by reason of the higher cost of ships and labor as compared with bis foreign competitor. This is merely extending protection to tbe shipping industry until it is able to keep the vast amount of freight money at home. It has been con. tended that a feature of a successful operation of the ship subsidy law would be the removal by Congress of all duties upon shipbuilding ma terials or the reduction of duties to the point at which the builders would be materially aided in meet ing the competition of the foreign shipyards. It is likely that the arguments for a ship subsidy law of moderate reach, such as was supported by the administration in the last Congress, will find favor in the present body. Tbe canvassing of the subject has had educational effect.—Baltimore American. In the retirement of Messrs. John Miller and R.

We believe they have at ed always for the best Interests of the county, and they certainly de serve tbe highest coamebdation. OUR WASHINGTON LETTER Washington, D. C. Nov. B®, 1907- Mr. Editor: —The great enthusiasm for Bryan engendered during the visit of that luminary to Washington last week and culminating io his unanimous and vociferous acclamation as toohelca of the Democratic party for Ihslr stan dard bearer, at tbe dinner given in his honor, is still at a high pilch. Bryan is more popular than Avar and hit views on political questions are gain lag friends among all classes, irrespective of party. Ollie M. James, Representa tive from Kentucky, Is in Washington and is of the opinion that Hearst would not object to Bryan’s nomination. On the contrary,” he says, “I fully believe he would give him his support. The people have had an opportunity to find that Bryan is sincere in his views. Even President Roosevelt has adopted some of them and put them into practi cal execution.” Senator James P. Clark of Arkansas, in speaking of the political outlook, declared It Io bo his personal opinion that Bryaa would be the nominee of the Democratic party for the Presidency, that, of course, It was difficult to toll what individuals might do, but that the mass of the vot ers in Arkansas will bo for him. The advance sheets are out from the office of the Director of Census con cerning the “blue book,” whleh con tains the names of all tho government employes. According to these sheets there are 28,145 government workers in tho District of Columbia, and of this number B,MI are accredited to the Dis trict. New York is second on the list with 3,323 residents of that State hold ing places in Washington; Maryland Is third, with 9,199, while Arizona is last, with but 19. To all these sasptoyos in Washington there is disbursed saneslly the ssm of $51,M1,985 in salaries, mak ing the average $1,989. Public confidence cannot bo rostered until tho State and Federal authorities send the men who have looted corpora tions to jail is the opinion ef Stnyvo saat Fish, and politicians note with in terest the similarity of this big finan cier’s proposed remedies auJthe policy adopted by President Roosevelt- Mr. Fish maintain* that the present finan cial crisis is dm* to utter lack of confi dence in corporate management as con trolled and directed from Wall Street, and that such lack of confidence is world wide. To re establish senfideneo abroad we most first rs-sstablish it at homo, aad particularly In tho agricul tural communities of tbs WsM aad South, where tho real wealth of this country is annually taken out of tho soil in the shape of crops, lumber, coal and other minerals. It has been said that there wore two ways of avoiding this panic. First, by corporations purging themselves—cleaning their own houses; second, by the strong arm of tho government putting soma of tho rascals in Jail. Neither the corporation nor the government, State or Federal, has v*t acted efficiently; hence we are confronted with a period of depression in general business which Is real and widespread and must of necessity last until confidence is restored. This, again, can bo expedited by vigorous ac tion on tho part of the corporations or government, or dolayed indefinitely through inaction. As a result of the fact thW Washing ton has cabled Beoretary Taft, request ing him to hasten his return to the United States, the Secretary who is coming byway of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, and is due at Moscow next Saturday, has sent a telegram to Mont gomers Schuyler, Jr.,, th tt American charged affaires, asking him, if possi ble, to arrange tbe audience with Em peror Nicholas so as to eaable him to leave St. Petersburg the afternoon of December 4. His departure on the night of December ith, was originally provided for in the schedulf. Th# most absurd stories regarding Secretary Taft’s mission to Russia art ip general circulation over there, according to ad vices received in Washington, ’and Mr. Schuyler is kept busy denying those ridiculous tales, being obliged even to resort to the Russian press to deny Ihs possibility of any trouble with Japan. Secretary Cortalyon announced oa Thursday night, that further subscrip tions to tho one-year Treasury certifi cates would not be received,. and the announcement is regarded in Washing ton as indicating that the Secretary considers tbe eritle in the meney mar ket to be practically over?;- While no ’ official figures have as yet heoa given > out et the Treasury of the amount of . certificates allotted, the amount la said . to be about $85,000,000 aad this Is thought to be the limit unless strong reasons are presented from banks which have already made subscriptions, ' why allotments should net bo made to them. It is anticipated that nearly the whole of tbe $86,000,000 allotted will , be used to secure now issues cf hank notes, and it is claimed that they can not constitute a permanent inflation of the bank note circulation as these issues 1 will be retired within less than a year. Much discussion and speculation are , going on among politicians of an alleg ed plan ef certain Southern Democrats influential in Oengreae, to ask William Jennings Bryan te stand for election on a platform whleh will repudiate three of the chief things for which he has declared himself—the government ownership of railroads, tho luiViativc and referendum, and free eliver. This would, of course, include e declaration in favor of a single gold standard, and whether or not the Nebraskan will con sent to accept tbe uominatien on the platform that is being framed for him is being exhaustively discussed by both friends and enemies. “As things stand,’ said one of tbe foremost Southerners in Congress the other day, “I see no way to prevent the nomination of Mr. Bry an. He is by far the strongest man with tbe great masses. But tbe day when he can be bigger than his party has passed. We are going to make the platform this timo, and be must cither stand an it or get out of the way for somebody who will.” OAMTOSkZA. fleers tbe ad Yl fIW AIWJt THE 

"CURRENCY FAMINE” ENDING. Signs multiply that the “currency famine” draws near its and. If not al ready over, it will be before tbe week is past and gone. Every credit stringency brings with it a dearth of currency. When some banks tail, more suspend and all take precautions for their own safety there Is always aud everywhere a sudden lacking up of currency. Credit has been deatroyed wholesale. Currency is required to take ite piece. This need lasts from four to six weeks. It is met by the movement of gold, by tho drawing out of its hiding place throuhga premium of lawful meney be fore hoarded and by tbe shifting of Government deposits. To this has now been added on a large scale checks issued for currency. In four to six weeks in the past these agencies have always done their work and currency again has become plenti ful, ready for every demand. This task is now nearly over. As instantaneous ly as currency disappeared, it will now reappear. MARYLANDERS IN THEIR SEATS. All the Senator! and members from were in their seats when tbe Sixtieth Maryland Oongress met. Senator Ray ner and Whyte met in the Senate cham ber a few minutes before the body was convened, exchanged greetings and settled down to the work of tbe session like old-timets. Mr. Rayner came to Washington Sun day, but Mr. Wbvte waited and came over Monday morning, in company with Representative Gill. Neither of the Maryland Senators took part in tbe short proceedings in tbe Senate. Aside from Mr. Wolf, to whom the experience! of the day were all new, there was little in tbe doings ot tbe of tho Maryland representatives of in terest, except for tbe perpetration by Mr. Gill of a little pleasantry in con nection with the “Baby Congressman.” Mr. GUI was introducing Mr. Wolf to tha doorkeepers, and to one he said: "This is a Wolf yon will never be able to keep from the door.” Mr. Gill has measures of considerable importance which he will introduce in the House. One is designed to give the State of Maryland concurrent juris diction with authority for the city of Baltimore to use Fort McHenry for a public park. Another bill will be fer range lights for tho channel between tbe Lazarette aad Fort McHenry, This measure will carry approximately SIOO,OOO. Mr. Wolf will introduce e bill for the ap propriation of an additional $60,000 for tha addition of the Postoffice at Balti more. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars has already been approved aud le found to be iasnfficient. Mr. Mudd will urge an appropriation for tha Bolomon’a Island dry dock scheme, in which he has interested himself for the last few years. The other Maryland members, apparently have ao special matters of local impor tance they are to push at this session. Sheriff elect Frank P. Hurd took the oath of office on Saturday before tbe Clerk of the Circuit Court. He has appointed Mr. Thomas H. Garrison, of Hyattaville, deputy; Mr. H. W. Gore, Warden of tbe Jail, and Mr. Samuel E. Sweeney, keeper of the Jail. Mr. Oli ver King is acting as substitute for Mr. Sweeney. Order of Ratification.
