TEUTONS BEGIN NEW OFFENSIVE IN ITALY A8ingo Plateau Scene of the Attack, Where Hill Posi tions Are Gained. VICENZA THE OBJECTIVE Ten Divisions Held Bendy and Many Blfr Guns Have Been . Brought Up. TENDON Dee. 5. Apparently the Aus tro-Germans have launched their threat ened grand offensive in an effort to break the Italian lines. The blow seems Impending further north than had been anticipated, the main assaults appar ently belnv directed at the Aslago pla teau, Instead of the Plave. Tho concentration of men and guns Is tremendous, but there seems no reason to believe that the Italians are either surprised or shaken. According to one report most of the troops being used by the enemy are Austrlans. Thero are said J to be ten enemy divisions all told. Guns of htavy calibre are reenforclng the field batteries. It Is from the Trcntlno, northwest of Aslago, tint the drive Is launched, On the Seltl Commmil plateau the Italians have lost some hill positions, according to Berlin. Rome admits these losses, but says they have not Impaired the Italian defensive line. From some of these mountain lines the Italians withdrew voluntarily In an effort to rectify their front. The Austrian field Marshal Con rad von Hoetzcndorf commands the Teu tons. Bombardment la Heavy. The bombardment of the Italian posi tions around Aslago was exceptionally heavy Monday night and Tuesday, ac cording to an Associated Presi corre enondent at the front. The first violent eruption lgan early Monday night. Thero was a lull toward midnight and then it was resumed with added Intensity at 3 o'clock Tuesday morning, lasting until 9. Heavy shells were rained on the wholo rnngo of Italian positions and were concentrated particularly on tho locations supposed to shield Italian batteries. The vlolenco of the artillery action left little doubt that It was a prelude to Infantry nd vances In force whereby Field Marshal 1 von Hoetzendorf hopes to realize his project of pressing down the Astlco Val - J ley leading to Vlcenra and the open piain. me latest reports snow mat me Intense bombardment continues. Among the troops and units Hint hae arrived In Italy with tho British and French armies Is a large group of aviators, who are waiting Impatiently tJ get Into action. The British have sent a large contingent of filers, half of whom nre young Canadians and Americans, who havo been doing scout work In Flanders and northern France. Exchange Situation Improves, One effect of the arrival of the French and British In Italy has been the rapid drpp back to normal of Franco-Italian oxchange, which went up when tin Austro-German offensive was In full I flush of Its success. At that time 100 francs bought 160 Italian lire, but with the arrival of the troops tho same num ber of francs now buy 13S llro and ex change dally Is approaching par.

The Cardinal adds thnt long before the Issuance of tho papal peace note, which Is said to have been among the chief causes of the army's lowered morale, the I :'.er,;y generally and the armv Vhan-1 inrns parcicuir-.ri:; were laboring against ino nestrucuve propaganda vrtilc!:- .had . been begun and was reported to be giving unrest lo the civil authorities. Ofllclnl Report of Attack. To-day's official report from Rome gives the following details of the fight ing: On the Aslago plateau the enemy, after having gathered a formidable array of artillery and renewed and In creased his forces, which had severely suffered In previous combats, has be gun an attack on our positions. The first assault, launched yesterday, was firmly held up by us and the only ad vantage obtained by tho Austro-Oer-mans at the price of heavy losses was the gain of some positions, which has not weakened the firmness of our re sistance. Preceded by a destructive bombard ment, continued most violently for several hours and accompanied by heavy bursts of barrage fire, the en emy made a double attack on the strong point of Melette. Ilnnd to llnnd Flshtlns;. The first attack, from tho northwest, afier several attempts to advance, was arrested by our barrage and finally broken up In the afternoon on a sec tion of Monte Klsemol and the south western slopes of Melette ill Galllo, where In violent hand to hand fighting tho enemy was decisively repulsed with heavy losses and left us also some hundred prisoners. The second attack, from the north east, was brought forward with larger forces and greater tenacity between Monte Tondarecar and Monte Baden ecche. Here, after exceedingly fierce fighting lasting until early this morn ing, the occupation of some trenches which the enemy was able to effect counselled us to withdraw some of tho more advanced portions of our line. At Zetison, on the Plave, as n greater movement had been noted, one of our storming parties', well supported by artillery which destroyed five small bridges thrown acrosB the river at thU point by the enemy, attacked the enemy at the bend of the river, In flicting losses on him and bringing back prisoners and machine guns.

Von der Marwltx's great offensive has been abandoned and the presence of further fresh infantry divisions In the Cambral area shows that the enemy has not yet lost hope of Inflicting a sharp defeat on the British. The British line la now very strongly held and can withstand any sledgeham mer pressure, and the anxltty tho nat ural effect of the first two days on- of cheerfulness a,i romnlet confidence The number of British batteries has been greatly increased and their ac curate counter shelling of the enemy's strong artillery groups east of tho Scheldt has effectively reduced their ac tivity.

The Germans to-day were still holding hands along most of the new battle front. Fighting was In progress around a forti fied farm north of Havrlircourt after an enemy nttack In the morning, but no other offensive developed against the British line up to noon. There Is an Interesting report that a few British cavalry actually entered the town of Cambral at the beginning of Gen. Byng's offensive. They were In small numbers, however, and were with drawn Immediately, as they were far In advance of the main body. Tho enemy has brought In two fresh divisions to the Marcoing area.

F. H M.iurlce. Thief of Military Operations, - wbo admitted frankly that the British R the Cambral salient are In a somewhat awkward position and that It may be necessary to make slight withdrawals toward the south. The statement makes It clear that the British have exacted a heavier toll than In any other recent fighting on that front and that tho effect of Gen. Byng's of fensive tins been staggering to the enemy. To this fact Is ascribed the great effort of the Germans to eject the attackers from their recently won po sitions. Took First Gnns In Thirty Months. Gen. Maurice states another Interest ing point that the Germans have cap tured British mren, the first they have taken In moro than thirty months, while the several armies operating under Field Mart-hal Hair have captured hundreds of Teuton cannon, most of them this year. Two minor attacks attempted by the enemy this morning In the neighbor hood of Gonnelleu wcro successfully re- pulsed. Local fighting also took place this morning to the British advantage In the neighborhood of La Vacquerle. Kr.rly In the afternoon a more serious attack was delivered by tho Germans In this area in considerable force. It was repulsed after severe fighting. Hostile Infantry advancing to attack In the neighborhood of Bourlon wood and Moeuvres was engaged and repulsed by Gen. Byng's artillery. On the Ypres front hostile Infantry was active this afternoon north of tho Menln road. Alorg the section of the front held by the French there has been a series of violent artillery bombardments, and nt nlaces snlrlted raids have taken nlscc apparently without effecting any radical change In conditions.

Man rice, "that the latest German ytacks In the Cambral sector have been pVinpetl and superintended by Oen. von Ludeti dorfT himself. Von LudendortTs plan wss a thoroughly good one, as most of the German plans are. It was an nttack on both flanks of our salient, followed by an attack in force on the centre. "His attacks on our north and centre failed completely, but on his left the enemy succeeded In breaking through a part of our front. He attacked not only o-jr r.ew front but on a rart tf the line as It existed before, to the south. He succeeded In effecting a sur prise nnd broke through to a depth of nearly 0,000 yards clear through our gun positions. But wo had ample re serves available and promptly drove him back two-thirds of tho distance covered. "One cannot say the Germans have not made substantial gains as a result of this effort. When you are In a nar row salient even a small Inroad on one's flanks Increases gTeatly tho dif ficulty of holding tho salient and sup plying the men In It. The supply tn the men on certain portions of our front has now become u matter of consid erable difficulty." British User flRO German Gnns. After alluding to tho readjustment of the line that might be necessary to some extent In this area, Gen. Maurice continued : "For the first time In many a dny the enemy captured some British guns. Tho last British guns he captured were four from a territorial ba'tery behind the French lines In the battle of Ypres In May, 1MB. during the first gas at tack. Since then we had not lost n single gun on the western front and have captured B50 of the enemy's, of which 510 were captured in 1917, The number of guns we captured at iCambral h 138, The Germans claim 100 of ours, and I am not yet ablo to tell exactly how far this claim is true, as complete returns from the bat teries are not yet In, but the prompti tude of the announcement and the round number used lends to suspicion.

SEAPLANE IN FIGHT SINKS A SUBMARINE Battles With Four Submarines and Three Escorting Ger man Destroyers. 1 Special Cable Despatch to Tns Sen. London, Dec. 8. A dramatic story of j the fight of a seaplane with four German submarines and three Oerman destroy ers Is contained In an official statement Just published. In the morning mist the seaplano sighted a submarine on tho surface Before the submerrlble could dlvo the aircraft succeeded In dropping n bomb on her tail. The bomb made a targe hole In her deck. Then the pilot of the seaplane saw three more submarines In lino abreast and followed by three destroyers. All six vessels opened fire wlh their guns, but German planes were unable to at tack . owing to the barrage from the naval guns. The British seaplano turned and dropped another bomb upon the wounded submarine and saw It sink In a pool of oil, with fragments of wreckage all around. Afterward the British craft re tired from the unequal combat, sending a wireless message giving the position of the enemy destroyers. The cooperation of seaplanes with the naval patrol Is a great factor In the effectiveness of the anti-submarine cam paign. Without the aid of tho seaplanes the people of Britain and her allies would havo been faced with shorter ra tions. Figures In regard to the naval aircraft work In September show that the distance covered In patrols was more than 1 70,000 miles. Of this distance 90.000 miles was cov ered by seaplanes and 80,000 miles by airships. On seven occasions ships at tacked by submarines sent SOS signals which brought seaplanes to their aid In time to save them. Hundreds of ships ore convoyed everv month bv aircraft. There Is no Instance, in which a subma-1 rlno has attacked a ohlp while It was being convoyed by an aircraft The great speed of the seaplanes gives thm a decided advantage. The. plane when It slahts a, destroyer five miles away goes full speed to the attack. The submarine which the destroyer Is escort ing gets ten minutes to dive beyond the reach of the plane's depth charge. Pome timed It has not even that much time, as the seaplane often comes on at tho rate of eighty miles an hour. It is not to be assumcd'that destroyers aic to be superseded by seaplanes In sub marine fighting. On tho contrary. It Is when the two work In cooperation that disaster usually comes to the pirate j craft. Seaplanes also have ben of great assistance In picking up shipwrecked crews. In, sighting mines and In aiding mine sweepers In their work The wastage of machines Is very consider able, but without this work the struggle of the snbmarlnea would bi prolonged, food become dearer, the lives of sailors needlessly endangered anil the ryes of the navy would become dim.

NEW BOND ISSUE SOON Opposes More Revenue Taxes Till Country Has Had Time to Adapt Jtsclf. Stitlal DespsteH Is Tar Sc. Washington, Dec. C An appeal to every American citizen to forego need less expenditures, that the saved wealth of the nation may be Increased for war purposes, Is made by Secretary McAdoo In his annual report for the year ended In June. He also suggests legislation which ho belfeves essential to the win ning of the war. Among the more strik ing points made In the report are: "Business an usual" cannot be adopted as the guiding principle of the times In time of war. It Is n wholly wrong theory and should find no advocacy or accept ance by tho sensible and patriotic peoplo of America. The man who subscribes for a Gov ernment bond, and H advertised as a patriot for doing so, Is not a patriot If he Immediately sells that bond on the market when he docs not Imperatively need the money. The Government must, If necessary, absorb the supply of new capital avail able for Investment In the United States during the period of the war. Some form of regulation of new capital expendi tures should be provided, and sugges tions for Congress nre being formulated. The second Liberty Loan was a phe nomenal success, the results being even more gratifying than the frrst Liberty Loan. May ot Raise Interest Rnte. Hope Is expressed that additional bonds can be sold on terms similar to those of tho first two issues, as Mr. McAdoo holds that an Increase In the rate of lnterct on bonds would be unwise and hurtful, since tho higher the rate on Government bonds the greater the cost to the Ameri can people of carrying on the war and the greater the depreciation In all other forms of Investment securities. Arrangements maybe concluded short ly with various countries by which a rubstltute medium will stablllz" ex changes between the United Rtatea and nertal countries without necessitating laipe exports of gold. As a tesult of the operations of the farm loan hmks to date Mr. McAdoo Is convinced- that the limit of $10,000 Im posed by law upon loans to any Indi vidual should be Increased to $25,000. Congres.s may be uked to establish a medium by which the bonds of the farm loan banks can be quickly sohl. The report shows that at the close of June the balance In the Treasury was Jt.0tfi.9S3.3tl. Kstlmates of the ex expenses confronting the Government up to June 30 of next year indicate a deficit In the general fund at that time of $5, 12.:03,T3. 'To cover this deficit and provide a $300,000,000 working balance It Is mtlmated that at least $5,640,000, 000 mut be provided, presumably from bond Issues, since Mr. McAdoo does not favor new r-venuc raising laws until the country has had an opportunity to adjust Itself to those now In force. j Will pd Total of f 0,(100,000,000. This figure, together with the $3,666, 000,000 of authorized but unissued Liberty bonds, and $663,000,000 es timated receipts from war savings, make the $9,969 000.000 which Mr McAdoo believes Americans must loan the Gov- ! ernment between now and June 30, 191S, Total estimated receipts for the cur rent fiscal year are $12,580,732,800, which, with a balance lit tho treasury List June 30 of $1,066, 9S3 361, makes a total of $1.1.617,716,161 Most of the re ceipts, or $8,66,000,000, aro from the sile cf bonds nnd war savings certificates ; ordinary receipts are $3,86.O00,O00, largely from war taxes, and the Panama Canal Income la $7,000 000. Ordinary disbursements are estimated nt $12,316.29.1.2:3. loans to allies In the year at $6,115,000,000. public deb', dis bursements at $321 000.000 nnd Panama Canal expenses, $29,593,000 ; making total estimated disbursements, $18,775, 919.955. For the next fiscal year, ending Juno 30, 1919 the Secretary estimated receipts at $.".176 000,000 and disbursements at $12,801,034,440, exclusive of allied loans. This makes a $7 627,000.000 excess of disbursements. If the present rate nf loans to nllles Is continued In the 1918-19 fiscal year, $6,000,000,000 additional would be required. Estimated Interest on bonds to be Issued that year Is $385, 000,000, and estimated expense of float ing the bond issue. $28,000,000. , Thus If tho deficit is to be met by nortJ.? 114,040,000,000 worth must be floated between iS". v 1!:8, and June 30, 1919, In addition to receipts from war savings. "While these figured represent the situation as It appears to-day," tho Sec retary says, '"It should ho borne In mind that the exigencies of the. future may cause changes, particularly with regard to the estimates for the War and Navy departments." The estimates on which the Secretary bases his figures aro made by tho various Government departments. i:stlmntc of Wnr's Cost. The outstanding fact apparent from these stupendous figures Is that tho cost of the war to the American people, In cluding allied loans, for tho two years ending June 30, 1919, will be ut least $36,000,000,000. To tho great task facing tho country.

In urging tha citizens to buy and re tnln Government securities Secretary McAuoo says: n is inrr tmu- Br-t-ltitfnn tn it bnnrl that helns the (luv- crnment.

If a situation should develop where tho Government could not sell convertible and partly tax exempt bonds upon a 4 per cent basis It woutd, I believe, be come necessary to seriously consider fur ther revenue legislation. "In my judgment an Increase In the rate of Interest on such bonds would be extremely unwise and hurtful. The higher the rate on Government bonds tho greater the cost to the American people of carrying on the war and the greater will be the depreciation In all other forms of Investment securities. We cannot regard without concern serious declines In the general value of fixed In vestments. It should be tho earnest endeavor of every one to prevent this, and I earnestly hope that the processes of education and of unselfish considera tion of the problem from the standpoint of, tho general Interest will provide the necessary remedy. "The Government must If necessary absorb the supply of new capital avail able for Investment In the United States during the period of the war. This In turn makes It essential that unnecessary capltat expenditures should be avoided in public and private enterprises. Some form of regulation of new capital ex penditures should be provided.

Figures showing the opera tion of the bureau since the day of Its creation, September 2, 1914, to October 31 of this year, show that the amount Insured totalled $856,270,337. Tho Gov, ernment collected $33,393,476 In pre miums and paid out only $20,008,505 for losses, the expense of running the department being $94,296. These poli cies also Included protection for 20,757 men In the sum of $34,988,067. The vigorous protests of the farmers against being forced to bear the expense of establishing a clear title to their land when they obtain a Government loan upon It leads to the suggestion that Congres.s may be asked to provide for this expense.

BRITISH LIKE MESSAGE. "Parlfjtng Breese' One London tTpnper Calls It. Special Cable Despatch to Tax So. London, Dec 6 President Wilson's message to the American Congress ap parently has struck a deeply responsive chord In England, Judging from com ments by the press. Nearly all the news papers are loud In praise of Its states manlike vigor and high purposes. The Vatly Mail says : "For all the Allies President Wilson's address makes very satisfactory reading. His ringing sen tences, not less than the measures pro posed to give effect to them, will do something In Europe, ns well as In America, to clear the air of the fumes of pacificism. They set things, as Lans downe's letter did not, In their proper light and proper order." Referring to President Wilson's per sonal position the .Moll fays : "No auto crat In history ever enjoyed the power and authority freely yielded to President Wilson by the American pecfile. His voice Is their vole?, his thoughts their thoughts to a deer ie that no comparison with any European country can quite parallel. Whenever he speaks It Is as though America, with Its hundred mill Ion people, blew a blast on a single trumpet. To rod his latest address to Congress Is to know Immediately what are the ideals and purposes of the entire nation." ".VrIU Colors to the Mast.' Tho Daily Chronicle says nothing could be bolder or more emphatic than President Wilson's reassertlon of the need for absolute victory over Prussian, nutocracy, "He nails his colors to the mast," con tinues the Ci'irosfrlc, "and says unless Germany changes her rulers she cannot be admitted to the family of nations Yet he Insists the reason he Is desirous of full victory Is to uvold the need of such exclusion. He wants to bring Ger many back Into the family of peoples without penalties, but this Is possible only If the rulers are uttetiv overthrown ! by tho Allies or repudiated by their subjects." The Dally Express says: "With a reasonable. Interpretation President Wilson accepts the policy of no annexation and no Indemnities and declare tho war must be followed by no vindictive action. He rays to insure impartial Justice to nil peoples Is the only way to free the world from 'he fear of another wnr. He would free Germany, Austria and Turkey from the Hohtnzollcrns. Neither the United States nor tho Allies purpose to dictate to tho Germans, who havo been deluded and betrayed, Just as Russia was, nnd have fallen Into the same trap." The Dally Telegraph says: "It has been left to President Wilson to give tho lead In showing that a frank and unlmpassloned statement of wnr alms does not In the least degree con lllct with the Indexible purpose to carry on tho war." This newspaper refers to President Wil son's adjuration to convince the Germans of the falseness of their leaders' ex pressed reasons for flghtlnr, and reverts to Its own advocacy1 of thu Marquis of I.iinaclowne's plea for a declaration of war aims.
