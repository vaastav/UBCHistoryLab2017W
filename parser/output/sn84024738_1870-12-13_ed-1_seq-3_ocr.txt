For some tim* pn?t (he Custom-house authorities hnvft hern nwflrc that large quantities of silks anil Lyons velvets were being smuggled across the channel from France to Ireland, maiulv to Belfast and the northern port', 't he goods were there safelv stored until emigrants could he tound bv whom to send the cloth to rsew Yol k. The mode of operation was av fol lows : A large trunk manufacturer, whose i name is suld to he Downs, furnished boxes t\ u* emigrants at reduced priors. Thes<' boxes or chest* were of the most substantial j manufacture, and contained fal?e bottom*. , | Between the false and r^nl bottoms tl?o : silks and > el vet* were bidden anil smug ; pled into New York. The emigrants were recommended to go to certain hoarding ; houses on West street, and when they ar j rived there with their boxes if was a simple matter to remove the smuggled goods and i replace the false bottom*. The goods were then removed to two wholesale houses on j Broadway, who were thus enabled to sell j tine silk^ and velvets at a low figure, very much under the market prices. So common had this mode of evading the Custom author ities become that it Is probable that hardlv a vessel left the northern parts of Ireland without some of the inceniouslv constructed chests aboard. Tt. is estimated that the loss to the United State* Government by this fraudulent evasion of custom* will nggrepate nearly $".150,000 In gold. By some means the secret leaked out and came to the ears of tbe authorities, who immediately Insti tuted a vigorous examination of emigrants' boxes on all voxels arriving at Castle Oar den. The search ha? been successful. This morning three of the attaches of the Cus tom-house found a chest containing silks and velvets, valued at $(>.000, at a boarding house on West street. So neatly had trie box been constructed that it passed the. ollicers at Castle Garden without suspicion as to its contents. Many hoxe? "Imilfir to I he one seized have been cent to Baltimore by the smuggler*, and the custom-house authorities in th:it city have been notified of the fact bv the New York officials. The *iiks and velvets ?seized in West street have hem removed to the seizure department. ? -AVtc York Commercial. TnE Railroad War in Nett Jersey ? Arrest of Superintendents ?

BAYONET OK A JUDGE.? TPittft inrjton , Doc. 11. ? A document growing Rome of the phawea of military reconstruct tton in Georgia is about to be presented to Congrcpo by Hon. lienry S. Wetmore, who states that ho was elected bv tho Republi can* .hidire of the Court of Ordinary, and on the 10th of April. 1870, released' a man on habeas corpus, because of informality 1n < the warrant. On the 20th of the same ? month General Terrv Issued an order re-! moving him from office, hut assigning- no j o? use. 'I his order the judpe refused to I obey, and was put off the bench at the j point of the bayonet. The reason for! i " tlii< exhibition of brute force, and the 1 spectacle of a civic judge driven from his ? bench bv soldiery, was because General , Terrv differed in opinion on the law govern- I ing the habeas corpus case." Ah proof of' 'this, he cites the fact that. General Terry i wrote to Gen. Sherman tdving that as the reason. lie cites the acts of Congress to show that Gen. Terry's action was Illegal, ' and adds that he is confirmed In that opin ion by Representatives Bingham, Logan, j and Farn?worth, and yet he declares that he is still deprived of his office, which is tilled by a military appointee, who was a prisoner held by the United States Govern ment in Fort Lafayette as the President of a block>de-runniug company. He con ! eludes his statement as follows : " I re 'spectfully ask Congress to investicate this 1 matter, and if substantiated, to request that the Secretary of War order General Terry before a court-martial to answer for his despotic and illegal conduct, as a disgrace to the uniform he wears, an insult to the judiciary of the country, an invasion of the rights and property of a citizen, and a re proach to our republican form of govern ment."

The work reached the staire where certicisms were prepared lor several journals, and the whole thing win ready to appear when Butler, for some reason, changed his purpose, adroitly muu aged to get the reviews already written back into his hands again, and from that j time to this the book has disappeared from j sight. There is now said to be danger that 1 one of these reviews, prepared under But ler's own eye and directions, has passed beyond his control, and is likely to he pub lic' property before long.
