President Cleveland's m¶essage to the second session of the Fifty-third con grems is a comprehensive review of the condition of foreign and domestic af fairs, but not a startling document in its discusslon of public questions or In its recommendations of legislation. The most interesting allusion to our rela tions with other countries is that touching Japan. a nation for whose re markable progress the president ex preses great admiration. The hearty good will existing between the United States and Japan Is alsm commented upon. For the most part the preesident's references to the various departments of our own government are little more than summaries of the annual reports of the heads of those departments. We notice that he recommends the revival of the grade of Iteutdhant general in order that that rank may be conferred upon General Schofleld Just before his retirement, an honor that the country would gladly see accorded to that dis tinguished omcer. The president suggests that an addi tional circuit Judge be added to each circuit of the United States courts. This will be heartily supported by all who have business with those courts. The necessity for such Increase has long been apparent, and congress should re spond to the demand promptly by en actlng the necessary legislation. Becretary Herbert's recommendation that three more battle ships be added to the navy, receives the president's In dorsement, as does also the suggestion of the secrtary of the Interior, that a comprehenive forestry system be es tablished. The message recommends abandonment of the present policy of permitting the public timber lands to be stripped of their forests with very little compensation to the public treas ury. The establishment of a national health office, in order to secure prompt and universal aotion against the spread of epidemic and contagious diseases, has lung been urged by leading medical authorities, and the president gives his sanction to such legislation. The message has little to say about the report of the federal strike commis sion except to commend the members of the commis.lon f,r their thorough work and to call the attcntlon of con greas to the imlportance of thlir r.post Coming down tro the tariff, Mlr. Cleve land has less to arty than in former mes eages, but he says important amend ments should hre mad" to the existing law anrd th;at he is decidedly it favor of pliatting coal and iron on the free list. As to .ilgiiR he says: "I would be glad ulnder . xisting sggracltions to see very paIrticle of dlift', r'ential duty in l\'or ,of reifu,.J .suiar s:tr! kn out of our tariff I:ls.

LIII il fl. I III 'h,- :L li sA '. dlays ago, OIwIi Illdt41.ienlt fiavol's what I. known as "thi' )Jaltd flu plae 3 citv tcnll discuaefli ut the Uankers' cuanvpzitiuza in that city. Our great need. the preN Ident ays, and in that opinion the coun try will generally agree with him, is an elastic olurentd He would repeal all laws requiring national banks to de posit United States bonds to secure coirulation, and would permit the banks to lssue their notes up to the limit of seventy-live per cent of their pald up and unimpaired capital, upon deposit. Ing legal tender notes, including the treasury notes of IW0, to the amount of thirty per cent of the notes they de sired to issue. Whenever a bank de sired to retire any part of its circula tion the government should return to it a proportionate amount of its suaran tee funds. In order to aid the banks in quickly Increasing their clrculation the treasury department should keep blank national bank notes on hand to bI, supplied to the banks as required. The proposed law would contain a pro vision that the indebtedness on account of the notes outntandlig should be a first lien on the assets of a bank. In addition to this a small tax should be assessed on the circulation of the banks to create a safety fund for the Imme. diate redemption of the notes of failed banks. Should this fund prove Insuf ficient, all the banks should be assessed pro rata to provide for any deficiency. The issue of bank notes of less denomi nation than ten dollars is not contem plated by this measure. It is also pro posed to exempt state banks from tax ation whenever they show upon exam Ination the same proportion of circula tion to unimpaired assets as the na tional bankS. This suggested change in the banking laws is very clearly attI torcibly dis cussed by Secrctary (' rlisle In his re port. This will be the one feature of the president's message which will create the greatest discussion and most oppo sition in congress. Honest John Burns, the famous Eng lish labor leaderins one of the great men of the time and wherever he goes on his tour In the United States he will meet a royal weloome. A London correspond ent writes of him: "Burns is an honest may, which is not invariably said of labor agitators in office, but he is something much more than that. He has come to be, by the force of his virile common sense and enormous, tireless energy and genuine eloquence, one of the most influential figures in modern London, and in all my yenrs of knowing and watching him there has been no case In which this influence was not thrown on the side of good government, clean politics and public progress. It would be worth New York's while to make the oppor tunity of hearing him, and to try to find out the trick of breeding such men." An Mr. Burns is to be In Denver soon, it is probable he may visit Montana be fore he returns and speak at one or more points in this state. Hon. Charles S. Hartman, of Mon tana, introduced a free silver bill on the opening day of congress. Good! Let him press it to speedy passage while the democrats control congress, Next year he will stand no show with Reed in the speakers chair and a goldbug majority on the floor. MEN' AND 

WOMEN. Alfonso XIII.. the eight-year-old king of Spair. is not the only ruler who is younger than Russia's new 26-year-old czar. The little queen of the Netherlands is It. King Alexander of Servia IR, the khedive .o, and the emperor of China 23. The sul tan of Morocco is also a youth, but his exact age is a matter of speculation. Mrs. Ilradley-Martin's return home will be awaited with all the more Impatience, says the New York Recorder, since it Is known that she has bought the diamond crown of the unfortunate MarIe Antoin ette. This Is no evidence that Mirs. Bradl ery-Martin has lost her heal, because the tiara Industry had really become too com mnon. Almost -very other woman In a grand tier box at the Metropolitan opera house hua been wearing a tlara-boom-de a.y, asthose costly headpleces are irrev erently called. * S Paris correspondents announce the datlh raused by a fall from his horse, of M.

MAY 

COUNT 'EM. Agitation to Change Senate Rules So Susi ness May Be Done. Washington. Dec. 3.-There was more or lees talk on the democratic side of the chamber during the day about the importance of a change In the rules of the senate, which culminated late In the afternoon by the introduction of a res olution by Benator George looking to that end. The reuolutlon directs the committee on rules to report at the earllest practicable moment such amendments as will enable the senate to reasonably discharge the legislative functions Imposed upon it. The resolu tion specifically provides that the sen ate shall have power to come to a vote on any pending question after giving such reasonable opportunity for amend ment and debate as the senate may de okde to be proper to compel the atten dance of a quorum; that for the pur pose of making a quorum, all senators present may be counted whether an swering to their names or not; that a sonat.r present Who falls to answer to the call of his name shall be punished for disorderly behavior. Hartman's Free Coinage Bll, Washington, Dec. 3.-A bill providlag for the free coinage of silver was ilitro luced in the house to-day by Representa tive IHartman, of Montana.

The contract was awarded yesterday for public printing. The bids were opened Saturday, but as some of them called for almost the name amounts, considerable figuring had to be done.
