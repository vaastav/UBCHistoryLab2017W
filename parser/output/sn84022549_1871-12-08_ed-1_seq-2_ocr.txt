BELLOWS FALLS, DEC. 8, 1871. The decrease of the public debt dur ing last mouth, was nearly three and a ha f millions. The republicans carried Springfield, Mass., last Mmdar, by over 1200 major. Hy, which was unexpectedly largo. The first gun from New Hampshire Is decidedly promising for next spring. At the Portsmouth city election last week, the republicans carried the city by 328 majority, a republican gain of 203 over last spring. The republicans of Lawrence, Mass., are very jubilant over their victory there this week, having carried the city elec tion by 100 majority over the democrats and 57 over all. Only last month the democrats carried the city by nearly 300 plurality for govenor, and tlected their entire ticket to the legislature. The President's Message, of which we give the main points in another place, is received with very general favor, except of course those who would fin 1 fault in any event. Even those republican pa pers who are anxious to sbow their " in dependence," and make a point against the President's re-nomination, acknowl edge its excellence and general common sense. The financial exhibit is very fa vorable, and there has not been a month since the present administration came in to power that the public debt has not been reduced. Congress met on Monday. Both Hous es were promptly in working order. Sen. ator Edmunds of this State introduced bill for civil service reform. Some of the democrats in the House, manifested that their corns had been trod upon, in the en forcment of the Ku-Klux law in South Carolina, and wanted to know by what authority the president was suppressing that tender organization, and then subsi ded. As this delicate society are owning up, much to the chagrin of their north ern friends, there are to-day hosts of good democrats who hope their party are not now to be required to act as wet nurse to the Ku-Klux Klan. Post Office Department. From the Postmaster General's report we make the following extracts: During the year there have been is sued 498,126,175adhesive postage stamps 49,954,625 plain stamped envelopes, 48, 111,650 " request" envelopes, and 6,609, 000 newspaper wrappers, to the aggre gate money value of 817,629,551 ; an increase from the previous fiscal year of $1,172,769. While the increase in the issue of stamps is only 4.67 percent, that in the issue of stamped envelopes is 10 43 per cent ; of ' request" envelopes, 32 27 ; and of wrappers, 34 05. But $258 worth of stampsand $52 worth of stamp ed envelopes have been lost in the mails; a much better showing than has been made in any recent year. 

DEAD LETTERS. . The number of letters received at the dead letter office during the fiscal year was 4,184,748, of which 221 673 were foreign, 301,472 had not been prepaid, bo 616 were misdirected, aud 3518 had bo address whatever ; 18,577 letters con tained money to the aggregate amount of $78,813: 19,193 contained bank checks, drafts, deeds, etc., to the nomi nal value of $3,075,869; and 6498 con tained jewelry, books or other property By far the greater number of these let tan were returned to the writers. The number of letters without inclosnres re-' mailed to the writers was 1,628,803 ; of these, 294 500 were returned to the office and have been destroyed. MONEY ORDER BUSINESS. The whole number of money-order of fices is now 2452. Number of orders is sued during the year, 2,151,794; aggre gate value, $42,164,118 ; orders paid, 2, 121,664; value, $41,705,667; repaid to purchasers, 8321,669 ; excess of issues overpayments, $136 782; fees of post masters, $295,286. That is, there is an increase since 1870 in the amount of or ders ;esued of $8,109,923, in the amount paid of $8,099,412, and in fees of $60, 050. The excess of receipts over expen ditures is $101,182. The average amount of the money order is $19 59. It has not fallen below $19 for five years, and has only once passed $20. The number of remittances claimed to have been lost during the year was 42 ; aggregate value $11,054 ; claims outstanding July 30, $3439. The profits accruing since the money-order system was adopted (No ember 1, 1864,)foot up $337,420. Since September 1, 1869, the orders issued in this country for payment in Switzerland aggregated $60,679; amount paid here on Swiss orders, $32,454. The money order convention with Great Britain went into operation October 2. In the following four weeks orders to tLe amount of $63 061 were remitted to Great Brit ain, while the orders received aeeresat ed $14,684. 6 8 Cold Weather. Reports from the Western States quite generally record extremely cold weather. At Chicago on Tuesday it was 8 to 12 degrees below ze ro, and work was almost entirely sus pended in the bornt district The Pacif ic railroad is blocked op with snow, and severe weather is reported throughout that section. The President's Message. The annual message of the President was sent to Congress on Monday. The opening paragraph speaks of a year of prosperityjust passed, attended however, with an unusual chastisement in the lois of life and property. These disasters, he says, have served to call forth the best elements of human nature, which has done so much to alleviate the distress oc casioned by the calamities. He then turns to the Washington treaty and foreign aflairs, which are all friendly, congratulates the country on their condition, and expresses the hope that the example may lead to the settle ment of disputes between all nations with out resort to the sword. 

FINANCES. The National debt has been reduced to the extent ot $860,571,26.80 during the year, aud by negotiation of Nation al bonds at a lower rate of interest. The interest on the public debt has been so far diminished, that now the sum to be raised, for interest account, is nearly sev enteen millions less than on the 1st of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit oi the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dol lar of liability, without bankrupting tbem. But in view of the accomplish ment of these desirable ends, of the rap id development of the resources of this country, its increasing ability to meet large demands and the amount annually paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rap id payment. 

REDUCTION Or TAXES. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from inter nal source be abolished except those col lected from Bpiritous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various form?, from stamps. In readjusting the tariff, I sug gest that a careful estimate be made of the surplus revenue, collected under the recent laws after providing for the cur rent expenses of the government, the in- terest account aud siuking fund, aud that this surplus be reduced in such a man ner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many arti cles not produced at home, such as med icines compounded, etc., etc., from which very little revenue is derived, out which enter into general use; all such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should further reduction prove ad visable, I would then recommed it to be made upon articles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing the wageB of American labor. THE POSTAL SERVICE. The enlarged receipts of the Post Of fice Department, as shown by the accom panying report of the Postmaster Gener al, exhibits a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the growth and education, and of the propriety of the people tried el ements, highly conducive to the vigor and ability of a republic. The president also commends the proposed postal tele graph system, and that it be united with the post office. THE 

KU-KLUX. The president makes a plain statement of the affairs relative to the Ku-Klux, especially in South Carolina. Great caution was exercised in making arrests, and notwithstanding the large number arrested, it is believed no innocent per son is now in custody. Nor has there been any doubt as to the need of the strong arm of the military to suppress this treasonable organization. . 

MORMON TROUBLES. In Utah, there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to civilization, to decency and the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, however, have been found, who are willing to per form their duty in a spirit of equity, and with a due sense of sustaining the uiajes- ty of law. Neither polygamy, nor any other violation of existing statutes, will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is not with the relic ion of the self-styled saints that we are now dealing, but their practices. They will be protected in the worship of God, according to the dictates of their con sciences, but they will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It may be advisable for Con gress to consider what, in the executions of laws against polygamy, is to be the status in regard to plurality of wives and their offspring. The propriety of Con gress, passing an enabling act, author izing the territorial legislature of Utah to legitimise all children born prior to a time fixed in the act, might be justified by its humanity to these innocent chil dren. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation. INDIAN AFFAIRS. The president recommends a territori- government for the Iudians, with a view of improving their condition. AMNESTY. More than six years having elapstd since the last hostile gun was fired be tween the armies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpetuation, the other for the destruction of the Union it may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities impos ed by the fifteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not ex clude the ballot, but only imposes the disability to hold office upon certain class es. When the purity of the ballot is se cured, the majority are sure to elect offi cers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see tb advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely be cause they were before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to position requiring them to take an oath to support the constitution, and admitting to eligibility those enter taining the same views, butof less stand ing in the communities. It may be said that the former violated an oath which the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath itcanuot be doubted tbey would have broken it, as did the former class. If there are any great criminals, distinguishrd above all others, for the part they took in opposition to the Government, they might in the judg ment of Congress be excluded from such amnesty. This subject is submitted for your careful consideration. 

CONDITION OF THE SOUTH. The condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all true patri otic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism, for opinions sake, personal vi olence or threats towards persons enter taining political views opposed to those cultivated by the majoiity of the old cit izens, prevent immigration and the flow of much needed capital into the States lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country, when the old citizens of these States will take an in terest in public affairs, and with honest ly eutertaiued convictions vote for men representing their views, and extend the same freedom of expression and ballot ti those entertaining different politcal convictions. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. It has been the aim of the administra tion to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public offices. Every public servant who has violated the trust placed in him, has been proceeded against with all the rigor cf the law. If bad men have se cured places it has been the fault of the system, established by law andcustom for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for government positions, persons not sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give letters endorsing the characters of office seekers, without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them. A civil service reform, which can cor rect this abuse, is much desired. In mer- j cantile pursuits, the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend, to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally responsible for his friend's integrity, and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would enforce this priucipal against all endeavors of per sons for public place, would insure great caution in makine recommeudatious. A solitary lesson has been taught the careless and dishonest public Bervant, in the great number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven recreant to the trusts confided to them, and in elevating to pub lic office none but those who possess the confidence of the honest and virtuous, who it will always be found comprises the majority of the community in which they live. . CONCLUSION. I have thus hastily summed up the op erations of the Government during the last year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your con sideration. I submit them with confi dence that your combined action will be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best in terests of the whole country. U. S. Grant, President.

A Strange Presentment. The Ban gor Whig says that a musician named Charles Berry, of Augusta, played at a ball at Kendall's Mills last Monday eve ning, and after the ball retired to rest as usual, but was restless and unable to sleep, and a sen?atiou of dread of some thing wrong took hold of his mind. He tried to shake it off and courted sleep in vain, bo strong did this uneasiness be come, that he at length arose and took the first train for Augusta and imme diately went to bis home, where he found his wife and little son of four years of age both nearly suffocated from C"al gas. It was a long time before they could be revived. Hadheoeen absent an hour longer they would doubtless have both been dead.

Mr. Editor : There has lately been going the rounds of the New England newspapers statements similar to the fol lowing : "A Case of Slander. Rev. E. S. Fos ter, of Chester, recently prosecuted G. P. Spaulding ot'thal town, torau alleged libel published in the Woodstock Age. Quite recently Foster was arrested on a similar complaint, aud only escaped incarcera tion in jail by being released on bail, fur nished after he reached Woodstock, by the Hon. Julius Converse," &o. &a. The writer of that article was igno rant of the facts, or willfully perverted them. There seems to be a studied at tempt by correspondents to mislead the public in this sad controversy and man ufacture capital for Spaulding. I con sider it therefore, due your Universalis! readers, as well as those at large, to give a brief history of the case which is ex citing considerable interest hereabouts. Some two years or more ago, G. P. Spaul ding, then a self-constituted, prominent member of the Restoration society, (now defunct) took offence at the Rev. E. S. Foster, for some imaginary wrong or un intentional slight. He doubtless saw with jealous eye, that his influence in that society was waning aud accordingly resolved that if he could not rule he would ruin. He saw the seeds of death sown in the old society, and he knew very well that he could never belong to the new one, for a man who disbelieves in the inspiration of the Bible aud in a fu ture lite, has no title to membership in the Universalist church. Spaulding nursed his wrongs from a mole bill to a mountain by imagination. How be could crush Mr. Foster aud drive bim from the ministerial service, was his theme by day and his dream by night. Slanderous reports were circula ted, and no stne left unturned to poison the public mind against the victim. Mr. Spaulding has for the past year, been ev idently a man of one idea and has seem ed by the close observer a fit subject for tiie care of Dr. Rockwell of Brattleboro. The spirits might not administer to bim in that retreat so ardently as here at Chester, but his excited brain would not be the looser thereby. Efforts have been repeatedly made by the committee of the society, in presence of the parties to set tle thematterand still the troubled waters. Mr. Foster also repeatedly offered to leave the entire settlement ot this difficulty to three good business men, or three accredit ed clergymen, or to one reliable clergy man of any denomination in the State, said Spaulding selecting all such referees, on the condition that he would abide the is sue of their judgment, aud Mr. Foster offeied to give bonds to also abide their decision. But all was fruitless. Spaul ding seemingly rolled revenge as a sweet morsel under his tongue. About a year ago Mr. Foster left Chester and went to Michigan, to negotiate a compromise with the Universalist parish which had made all efforts to cecure his services as pastor, and even nere this enemy followed him After gaining an honorable release, Mr. Foster contemplated locating in Connect icut, where he had a call. The foul breath of slander had preceeded him there. The discipline of the Universal ist church is such that he was obliged to return to Chester to vindicate his char acter, where he is best known and where the charges originated. After enduring the burden of these slanders lor over two years and finding that no honorable set tlement could be made, Mr. Foster felt forced to require Mr. Spaulding to prove hisassertions. Consequently last August Mr. i osier sued Spaulding for slander and libel and attached all his visible property, both real and personal. It now presents the singular spectacle of being under three attachments, to satisfy the claims of as many different parties. Mr. Foster was duly summoned by Luther Adams, counsel for Spaulding, to appear before Hugh Henry, master in chancery, and give in his deposition in favor of the man who was prosecuted for libel and slander, to bolster up, if possible, his damnable cause and unheard of proceed ing. After being subjected three days to the most insulting questions that a learned and nervous attorney could de vice, Mr. Foster consulted Chas. N. Dav enport of Brattleboro, during an adjourn ment, who advised him to answer no more questions, he pronouncing it an il legal affair. "Let them commit you if they dare," he said. Mr. Foster was committed ! Judge Barrett being at home, he immediately released him, and a hearing thereon will be had at the De cember term of court. Thus I have endeavored to give you the facts and outlines of the case, which is deeply regretted by Universilists at large, and especially by that penplt in Chester. Mr. Foster's parishioners be lieve hun innocent, until proved guilty, and a numerous parish and a healthy aud growiug church raised up under his pastoral care the past year, will sustain him until they learn he is wrong, aud give him their sympalhy until they fird their confidence has been misplaced, and no longer. One of the Parish. At a wedding wh:ch took place re cently in Gotham the bridal party, evi dently thinking more of themselves than the sensation they were creating, walked out of church before the minister had pronounced the blessing over them, leav-, ing him with outstretched hands, and an astonished look on his face as they hur ried down the aisle. Tlio Unlink Corpus Citsu. Cambridoeport, Vt., Doe. 4, 1871. Mr. Epitoh r After a lapse of three weeks we are again attacked, and this time by the hero himself, or it may be by the whole firm of Barry, MacNulty, Harry's Boy & Co. Who will try us next 7 We are earnestly requested by the Editor of this paper not to make any new attacks upon Mr. Barry in this mat ter, and to make this article as brief as possible. And as we are quite sure that any statements that we might make con cerning him or his actions, he would be just as sure to deny and pronounee them " falsehoods ;" we will try therefore to comply with the publisher's request. First, then, in regard to his statement in the matter of Mr. O. D. Gray, in which he says ho paid the debt Iwice, a man that has uo inclination to pay an honest debt ouce, would hardly do it twice we think. His wife tells Mr. Gray that he (Barry) knew he had not paid it, aud had spoken to her about it within a year, but as he could not find a receipt, it was rather of a critical condition for this poor man. And again, in which he says he never told Mr. Gray that there bad been a writ served upon him. As your read ers know Mr. Gray and also Mr. Barry, they can judge which to believe. In reply to the inquiry we made in our last as follows : "Why did he tell S. M. Dimond of this place that he had left 1 $200 for his wife's support ?" I am pre pared not only to make the inquiry but the statement, and can back it up by at least three responsible persons, as to whether he (Barry) did tell Mr. S. M Dimond. I offer the affidavit of his era- employer at the close of this article and leave you Mr. Editor, and your readers to judge whether I was justified or not in making the inquiry I did. Now he speaks of the Ku Klux leader and its thirty-two members. We were not aware Mr. Editor, that our town could boast of such an organization within its borders. We suppose that he has become quite fa miliar with the use of that term in the lat itude where he resides, and could not wade through such an epistle as appeared in your last without applying the epithet to respectable citizens of your town, but of course it will not do to deny its exist ence after being vouched for by so truth ful and virtuous a man as puts his name to the close of that article. It has been stated to us by some of the oldest inhabitants of this place, that the hounds Barry refers to have ceased to be heard since he left the hills they so often frequented some five years since. Why is this ? perhaps he will explain We should suppose that Mr. Barry how ever much he may have been abused in this affair would not thus speak of his native place, and whose inhabitants know him and have from childhood, and if he is the man he claims to be, he cer tainly ought to leave a better impression in their minds. Will J. W. Barry deny that he has very recently deeded his-property in V lrgima to his father, W. S. Barry, we presume he will, yet such a deed appear ed for record in the clerk's office, of the county of Culpeper, Va., previous to Nov. 23, 1871. Why all this? With reference to MacNulty, we say. we hope that if a generous public do think it best to place us in an asylum, for treatment of softening of the brain, it will notbe the one which his warm friend has so often patronized, we should how ever, think that this man's brains had already softened, and beyond the possi bility of a cure. But we close feeling that we have al ready occupied too much of your valua ble space. Very respectfully yours, L. II. Eastman. lhis certifies that I am an employer or b. M. Diraond.and was last Oct. 12th, and I also certify that I heard Mr. J. W. Barry tell Mr. S. M. Dimond in his blacksmith shop, in Cambridgeport, that he bad left $200 for his wife's present expenses.

Dr. Orville Dewey has introduced into the village of Sheffield, Mass., a feasible and delightful plan for promoting pleasant and profitable inter course among the people. She had form ed a Friendly Union, which holds three meetings a week, one devoted to reading and an occasional talk or lecture, anotn ertoan evening, school with volunteer teachers, and a third to games and con versation. Some other villages may find therein a hint toward the improvement of the coming term of winter evenings. A clergyman in a western city re cently prefaced his sermon as follows : " Morning service commences in this house at half past ten.

If you can't come rarly, I wish you would wear your old boots. A Demoralized Cow. Siuce Mrs. O'Lcary's cow got her name iu the pa pers, the whole envious bovine family are cutting up didoes to secure an equal notoriety, Tne latest exploits are by a cow belonging to a Mrs. Lambert of Bay city, Mich. Exploring bis back yard ou a recent eveuing she put her head in to a barrel, which she couldn't get off, aud becoming very much frightened at her conditiou, she blindly forced her way into the wood-shed, thence into the itch- en, and thence into t ie dining-room of the house, becoming all the while more furious. From this room she made ber way into the parlor, throwing down aud trampling under foot everything that came in her way. Mrs. Lambert arous ed her husband, who arose, but finding he could do nothing, weut for help. The cow next rushed into the bedroom where Mrs. Lambert, with a little baby and one child occupied a bed, and another little child a crib in front of it. The enraged animal mounted the bed, but help arriv ed, aud not an instant too soon. The window was raised from the outside, and a ueighbor attempted to euter. when the barrel gave him a blow which knocked him back against the fence. The child ren were at last secured and passed through the window, and Mrs. Lambert soon followed. The door of the bedroom was then closed aud the cow left to her self. She finally became soothed, and walked out after demolishing all the nice furniture in the lower part of the house. Peterson's Magazine for December is a splendid number.

The publishers of "Arthur" claim for it the high distinction of being "The tueen of the Ladies' Magazines;" and taking the December number now before us as a specimen, we will not dispute their claim. Ihe special charm of the Home Magazine lies in the excellent quality of its reading matter. Speaking of this, the editors say : " While we claim for our serial stories a poner and interest unii valled by any of our cotemporaries, we bold our magazine to be in advance of them all in the moral purpose underly ing its conduct. The thousands in whose homes it has been for so many years a visitor, can testify to its unswerving loy alty to all things pure and true and no ble in human conduct." This claim of the publishers' the press has long since conceded ; and it is gratifying to know that (he people themselves recognize the claim and give the "Home" a wide and cordial welcome.
