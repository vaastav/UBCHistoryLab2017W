The experience in Washington on j? ?ursday last of the delegation claim? ing to represent the Virginia and North Carolina |>eanut dealers before the ways and means committie tariff hearing should commend Its dlatln guished?'hough conglomerate? mem? bership to the tender sympathies of all persons. Comprising a compact amalgamation Of distinguished representatives of both .political parties, it was expect? ed that the assault of this formidable force would overawe, If it did not com pletely rout the Democratic membera of the ways and means committee. I Doubtless the delegation confidently j expected to be patted on the bac'i and feted by the Republicans serving onl the tariff revision committee.-. ? The presence of Alvah H. Martin cf Norfolk county, whose uame appears' la the list of Mr. Taft's cabinet posi bilities, might reasonably have been1 i depended upon to reft rain Irreverence, on the part of the Republican mem-j hers of the committee. The united prestige of Representa-1 tire* Maynard of the Second and Las-1 etter of the Fourth Virginia congres-| sional districts, reinforced by such lay j Democrats as J. P. Holland, of South-1 ampLetn ?ad Colonel C. Fen ton Day, of' lain of Wight ought to have curbed' navy Inclination of die minority mem- j bars of the ways and means committee-: \ %? submit embarreseing questions, orj to indulge in merry-making at he ex-1 sense of the Virginia delegation, one member of which is the dlt-tlnguiah fc ed father-in law or a very uistinguish e *i Virginia Democratic statesman. [ Bat h appears that the inordinate CjMat of the Virginia peanut men prov E ?* to be their nemesis. The dealers k a? the delecatable ground nut who ap ^. Jpssued at Washington in- support ot H| 300 per cent increase in the taitfT S- 4stie* upon their product, marshaled ? ?taue forces from two states?Virginia I"'-Baal North Carolina?while claiming P, tJhat Six oUier Southern Stat.-s are Tttally interested. Elaborating the details of the hear tag carried by the Associated Pre*, printed in yesterday morning's tf the Daily Press, the Richmond Dispatch has the tollowlng from j*; Ba War hing'on correspondent 'la addition to the three set argn for a tariff on peanuts.

In other words lie sail, he thought the iwanut grower-; ??ntit led to wliat others were getting, and his appeal was to the Re.mhlt ea::s fur a square deal. When asked If he would vote for the tariff bill now being framed he declined to answer. "The witnesses, as a rule, did not make a g. od Impression, for the rea? son thai they were rattled on ihe stand by the cress examinations con ducted by trained lawyers. Instead of being i dlgti'tled bearing, 'he affair was mote of a spectacle, and some ol those on the \isiting delegation were very mad when it ?a;t over." Realizing that It was to laugh, the representatives of both political pur ties on the ways and up ins commit? tee gave vent to their merriment af the discomfiture of st least one Vir? ginia congressman anj a wonderfully aud weirdly personnel* d petitioning delegation Who could blame them? NO AGREEMENT UPON PASSEN GER RATE. Owing to the reticence on the pa." j ??f both aides io the conference at Richmond between the railroad attor? neys cn the one hand, and the Virgl? nia Corporation Commkvion and the attorney general of the State on the other, i: Is impossible yet to gang1' the significance of the dissolution of this conference on Thursday last with? out an> conclusion h.ivtng been reach? ed. If further litikraiton concerning th<' 2 cent passenger rate in Virginia i-si to be averted, i: must be by an arnica-1 ble agreement between the Corpora tion Commission and the repreeenta-l tives of the railroad lines doing busi-i ness In the State. Comnetenl autfa rittes disagree asj to how far -he State Corporation Com? mission was upheld, or to what <x;< nt ihe contentions of the transportation llnes were vindicated in the recent decision by the I'nited Sta'es Su preme Court. The announcement, b. sever, that the railway attorneys submitted no definite proposition to the Stale off! clals would seem to Indicate that th> railroads believe that it will ultimate? ly transpire that they have b*-eii au-j tborized to reinstate the original rates, ranging from 3 cents a mile upward. Basing the conclusion upon an ana? lysis of the meagre infv.rm.aMon so far given out. it seems altogether proba? ble that the transportation companies purpose defying the state authorities and will fix their passenger rates si b out regard to the order of the Virgi? nia Corporation Commissi?-.?. Per? haps 11.? Immediately, but as a on as the corporations realize that the State Commission is irrevocably determined not to make a practically unconditional surrentier. If tile late decision of the I'nited States Supreme Court be competent to defeat the decree of the Virginia Corporation Comaahwion. naturally it may be depended upon to etera the wrath of the nevt Virginia legisla? ture. IS IT SIGNIFICANT? It may or may not be significant that the House of Representatives; in calling upon the President for evi? dence upon which he based hi" charge* that eongrefsmen did not wish to be sines-teati d by secret service men. stipulate,! that the President's reply should treat only of the Sixtieth Congress. [ The two representatives, one from the Senate and one from the House, who received penitentiary sentences I for robbing the I'nited States govern? ment, wen- members of a Congress which preceded the Sixtieth.

GAME OF CHANCE.
