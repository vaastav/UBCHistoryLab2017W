SHORTAGE OF RAILWAY CARS 13 TERRY M GOVERN "NUTTY"! Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's discussion of the San Fran cisco school situation in his message was received with great dissatisfac tion by the California delegation in the bouse. The members of the dele gation from that state are unanimous in their declaration that no treaty rights have been violated in exclud ing Japanese from public schols at tended by whites-. Representative Hayes: said that if any treaty of the United States prevents California from running its schools as it sees fit the treaty is clearly unconstitutional, and should not stand. A meeting of the California delegation will soon be held to discussr the San Francisco situation. The suggestion In President Roose velt's message that naturalization bo extended to Japanese is extremely dis tasteful to the California delegation. Itayner Raises the Main Issue. Rayner introduced In the senate the following resolution cn the Japanese question: "Resolved, that in the opin ion of the senate this government has no right to enter into any controversy with any foreign government relating to the public school system of any of the states in the Union; that it is the opinion of the senate that there is no provision in the treaty between the Urited States and the government of Japan that relates in any manner to tnis subject, or in any way interfere with the right of the state of Cali fornia to conduct and administer its system of pi'.Mie schools in accord ance with its own legislation, and that it is the duty of the president of tho United States to notify the government of Japan and to notify any foreign government with which the question may arise that the public educational institutions of the state are not with in the jurisdiction of the United States, and that the United States has no pow er to control their administration." Courts Mny Decide the Matter. It is expected by the officials hero that a judicial determination of tho rights of the Japanese in California to only school privileges will be secured through the institution of another suit in San Francisco before the federal court. This will be brought by an in dividual, and will probably take the form of an application for an injunc tion directed to the school board en joining them from denying Japanese children from entrance to the public schools so long as those privileges are conceded to children of other nationali ties. Interstate Board lias No Power to Act in the Matter. Washington. Dec. The Intentions and attitude of the interstate com merce commission respecting the car shortage in the northwest are made clear in a letter addressed to Senator Hansbrough by Chairman Knapp, in which he says: "The Inability of ship pers to secure cars for the movement of their traffic is reported from vari ous parts of the country, and amounts in some sections, as you observe, to al most a calamity. This matter has giv en the commission special concern, al though we appear to be without any adequate authority to deal with such a situation,"' except in cases of discrim ination, lie then says: "We have, however, ordered an in vestigation of this matter of car short age and will prosecute It with the ut most dispatch. Already one or more agents have lxen sent to the northwest, and it is expected that hearings will take place in that region within the next two weeks. This appears to bo the most effective course the commis sion can take." He Acts So Queerly That His Rela tives Have Him Put in a Hospital. New York, Dec. C. Terence McGov em, who is matched to light "Young" Corbett in Baltimore late in January, was taken to the observation ward of the King's county hospital in Bnoklyn for examination as to his sanity. Ae comanied by his wife and stepfather, Joseph Kenny, McGovern arrived from Washington and went t his home in Brooklyn. According to the police he acted in so peculiar a manner at home that Mrs. McGovern was frightened. He then left the house and probed with a stick into the ash barrels along the curb. When the wagons came to remove the ashes McGovern is said to have pursued the drivers with a stick, but said he was doing it playfully. A policeman stopped him and took him to tho station, where McGovern was examined by Dr. Howell, of Seney hos pital, who said the tighter appeared to be insane. McGovern went to the his pital without protest. 4 iiis Modern Home

HAMMOND REALTY CO. Hammond BIdg. Artistic Commercial PrintingTimes Office Texan Who Would Shut the Door of Military Opportunity. Washington, Dee. 5. Representa tire Slayden, of Texas, has introduced a bill which provides that "on or be fore the 30th day of June, 1007, all en listed men of the army who are ne groes, or of negro descent, shall be discharged from the service of the United States, and thereafter no negro, or person cf negro descent, shall be enlisted or appointed In the army of the United States." In explaining his bill Slayden said: "The bill speaks for itself. It was not introduced for buncombe. My purpose N to give the congress of the United States an opportunity to purge the army of an admittedly dangerous el mem. id say tnat tne negroes are brave is not an argument against this measure. Manv men have been brave: in fact, most men are in the matter of fighting. The Commafiche and Sioux Indians were as brave as men as can be. Rut no one would serioiisly sug gest that we ultimately recruit regi ments from them, put guns in their hands and station them near compa nies of white troops toward whom they entertain Inherent race hostility. The Twenty-fifth Infantry Is manifestly imbued with the same race hostility, and events have shown it to be quite as dangerous as the Sioux or Com manche would be." Apropos to this question of negro soldiers the president has expressed himself to the effect that he is more than willing to send to congress all the papers in connection with the dis charge of the negro battalions of the Twenty-fifth, and hopes the senate will adopt one of the resolutions asking for the papers introduced Monday.

Jefferson City, Mo., Dec. 5. Division No. 2 of the supreme court has re versed and remanded for new trial the convict murder case against Yaughau. Raymond and Ryan, who broke out of the penitentiary a year ago after kill ing a guard. Judge Gantt wrote the opinion of the court He says that the trial court erred in not giving instruc tions that the jury could convict any one of the defendants or not, as seemed right. The defendants were tried Jointly, and attorneys for the defendants asked instructions for the conviction of any one separately, but Judge Martin held that they had committed a joint crime, and all were guilty or all were inno cent, and refused instructions. The supreme court says this was a reversi ble error. When Saddles Were Unknown. Early Greeks and Romans rode horse3 bareback. They regarded it as effeminate to ride in a saddle. Tho modern saddle, with pommel, crupper and stirrups, was unknown to tho an cients. Nero gave out fancy cover ings to his cavalry and the bareback riders cf the German forests used to laugh at them. Saddles with tree3 came into use in the fourth century; stirrups three centuries later. Women Exact Heavy Interest. An English woman says that women make much better bankers than men.
