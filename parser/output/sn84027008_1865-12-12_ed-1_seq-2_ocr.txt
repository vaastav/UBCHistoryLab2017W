COLUMBIA. Tuesday Morning-, Dec. 12. 1865. The M?a?agr-Stair of th? Country. Wc have carefully read tho message of President Johnson, as wc presume have most of our renders. They are all in a position to pass judgment on its merits ns a State paper at this important juncture of public affairs throughout tho country. For ourselves, we regard it as tho production of a statesman -of a patriotic chiet magis? trate, who is most anxious to allay sec? tional passions and prejudices, and to restore peace and harmony, strength and Tinily among the whole people of the coun iry. How different is it in tone and temper, from thc doings of the few first days, in tho body to whom this calm and well-consiiiered paper was addressed! The action of the dominant party m Congress appears to he based upon thc mistaken notion, to call it hy a very gentle name, that thc Southern States have not been sufficiently punished, and that 'heir pro? fessed return to their fealty to . j Govern? ment is not sineore; while the .iguagc of the President is that of a calm and dis? passionate statesman, w'visc resolute pa triotis n rises far above thc fanaticism which would foster and continue sectional strife and prejudices. His message, in his adherence to his avowed policj* of re? construction, makes a square and hold issue with the party, of which Stevens and Sumner are the high priests. Thc President has very clearly and satis? factorily set forth the principles that havo guided his course thus far, in the great work of again bringing peace, harmony and good fueling among the people of all sections of the country. His views as to the rights of States, and of thc mutual re? lations between them and the Government, arc somewhat different from those hereto? fore entertained by us; nevertheless, tho late struggle has proved his to bc those of tho people of the United States, and has Axed it as the principle and policy of the Government, that no State has of itself the right to leave the Federal Union. So must it remain horoafter. His emphatic condemnation of military rule, or of establishing military Govern? ments, and thc cogent arguments he brings forward to sustain his views on that point, will not only give confidence to the people of tho South as to his future conduct to? wards them, but in his position ns chief magistrate of thc Union, and commander in-chief of it3 forces, is an earnest aud guarantee of protection to them against ! the machinations of those who would seek ; to keep iu their present condition, or to i deprive them of their political rights. Congress, or rather the dominant faction I now in that body, may keep its doors shut against their representatives for some time, but with a President determined to do right, exercising the proper and conser? vative power of the veto, they will he pow? erless for any further injury to us. The frank exposition of the President's views as to the speedy restoration of the States lately in revolt, must have a beneficial in? fluence and effect noon even the turbulent passions of radicalism. After all opposition to the Government had been crushed, the President went to work to reconstruct. He tells Congress that he "lias sought to restore thc right? ful energy of the General Government and of thc States. To that end, provisional Governors have been appointed for tho States, convent ions called, Governors elected. Legislatures assembled, and Sena? tors and Representatives chosen to thc j Congress of the United States. At the same time the courts of the United States, as far as could be done, have been re? opened, so that tho laws of thu United States may be enforced through their j agency. Thc blockade has been removed and the custom-houses re-established in ports of entry, so that the revonuo of the United Stati s may be collected. Thc post ' office department renews its ceaseless activity, and the General Government is thereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers and agents." After some other measures of concilia? tion towards the Southern States, his next step was "an invitation to them to participate in the high office of amen.ling the Constitution." But this ??invitation"' has been accepted hy a sufficient number of the Southern States; the amendment is nowa part of the Constitution, and that which President Johnson stated condition? ally in the following paragraph now bi? cornes an operative fact: "The amendment to tho Constitution being adopted, it would remain for the States, whose powers have been so long in abeyance, to resume their places in tin two branches of the National Legislature, and thereby complete the work of resto? ration." In bisview, then, tho work of restoration is completed, and it only remains for Con? gress to permit the representatives from thc Southern States to take thoir seats, as they hare a right to do, to finish up thc work of reconstruction. Thc other topics of general interest, thc financial exhibits, the state of our foreign relations, the resuscitation of postal ar? rangements, &c., prcsentod in the mes? sage, need no special comment, as all will road for themselves. Wc only will add, in the language of a coteniporary, in relation to thc views enunciated in that portion of tho message to which wc have alluded, and which are of the. greatest importance to us, that "we rise, from the perusal of this message, almost overcome with emo? tions of thankfulness to God, that between our defeated section and the howling pas? sions of a radical Congress, there is inter? posed the granite will of Andrew Johnson." One D?y Later from Europe. The Hibcrinn, with Liverpool dates to thc 21th ult., has arrived at Portland, Maine. Among other items of nows, it will he seen that the reputed Head Centre of the Fenian Brotherhood in Ireland, James Stevens, has been found mysterious? ly missing from bis cell in prison. The commercial news by this arrival will bo found under thc proper head. 

VIOLENT C.AT.ES ON TUE ENGLISH COAST. A violent gale prevailed around thc English coast on the 22d ult. The steam? ship Queen, which should have left Liver? pool for New York, on that day, was detained until the next day. Thc ship Calhoun was driven in collision with thc steamship City of Boston, iu the river Mersey, and wont aground, where she remained until the next tide, when she floated into her dock without damage. Much damage had been sustained on the Welsh coast by thc gale. More vessels had been driven ashore there thau for many years past. An emigrant vassal for I Australia was among the number, with nearly 500 people on board. N<* lives wcro lost. Much damage had also been done on tho land, as well as upon the noa, by the gale. THE COTTON SUPPLT. A letter is published from Consul Dudley in the Liverpool papers, regarding tho cot? ton supply from America. Mr. Dudley appends a letter addressed to him on the 27th of October by Secretary Mcculloch, who says that from the best information he could obtain, he estimated tho old cot? ton in the Southern States, fit for markst at tho time of the capture of Savannah, did not exceed one nullion of bales. This year's crop, ho adds, will probablv not exceed three hundred thousand bales. Mr. Dudley says th*t when recently in America, he made most anxious inquiries on the subject, and he estimates the present amount of cotton on hand at little over Beven hundred thousand bales, in? cluding the new crop. THE 

REFORM MOVEMENT. A crowded reform meeting had boen held at Bradford. Tho Mayor presided. W. E. Foster, M. P., and other influential men took part in the proceedings. Resolu? tions in favor of reform were adopted unanimously, and confidence that reform i would be part of thc new ministerial pro I gramme was expressed by all the speakers. The substance of the resolutions will be embodied in a memorial and presented to Karl Bussed. THE 

CATTLE UISF.ASE. A fresh report of the cattle disease shows that it is on the increase in England, chiefly in Yorkshire, and on the decrease in Scot? land. The Times says that specimens of virgin gold have been discovered in Tinstream, in Cornwall. THE JAMAICA INSURRECTION. Thc controversy in thc London papers as to putting down the negro insurrection in Jamaica is waxing warmer. THE CONTINENT. The continental news is meagre and un? important. FRANCE, The Paris Bourse was timi at GSf. 62c. on the 2:ld ult. The merchants of Paris had held a meet? ing in regard to the Spanish-Chilian artair, and adopted a petition to tho Emperor, praying him to use his influence for a set? tlement of the dispute by arbitration. The merchants of Havre had also held a meeting on th' same subject, and adopted a similar petition. PRUSSIA. The semi-official journal says that Prussia will not hesitate to follow the (.sample of France, if the latter should make a re*l and material reduction in her army. ROME. Numerous encounters arc reported be? tween the pontifical gendarmes and the brigands, thc former displaying great energy. LATEST VIA GREENCASTLE. LONDON, November 24.-Janies Stevens, the reported Head Centro of tho Fenian I Brotherhood in Ireland, was missed from his cell in prison this morning. No parti? culars are yet known tis to the time or manner of his escape. The constabulary in all parts of Ireland have ?leen warned and informed of hin escape. Thc Court of Queen's Bench for Ireland j luis refused the application to have the . Fenian cases tried in some other place than Dublin. The Court held that a fair .cd impartial trial could bu had in Dublin. A fresh report of the cattle disease showt that it is on tin: increase in England, chiefly in Yorkshire and on the decrease in 1 Scotland. - NEW 'loin; CHARTER ELECTION. -At tin election in New York, on Tuesday, Mr. Ri? chard O'Gorman, Democrat, was electee Corporation Counsel by 1,71)0 majority The vote for .Mayor stands: Hoffman, Tam. many Democrat, 32,955; Roberts, Republi can, 31,421; Hocker, Citizens' Associatioi and Mozart Democrat, 10,400; Gunther McKeon Democrat, 6,?SO*.

EX-SECRETARY SEDDON.-The Richmont 117//;/, of Saturday, says that Mr. Seddon late rebel Secretary of War, arrived in tba ; city on Friday evening. His health ha j not been seriously impahvd by hi-" lon; ; imprisonment. - ; PARDONS.- During the month of Novem ber, the President g -anted about 500par ! dons nndcr the thirteenth, or $20,00 , clause. - ?NEW Ese.LAM>. New England propose to take the whole Government in charge ! if we- are to judge by the composition o j the Senate committees. Notice tho follow i ing list of the chairmen of thc importan committees: Manufactures -Spragne, of Rhode Island Military Affairs Wilson, of Mass. Foreign Affairs -Sumner, of Mass. Finance-Fessenden, id Maine. Post Oftice-Dixon, of Connecticut. Claims-Clark, of New Hampshire. District of Columbia -Dixon, of Conn. The Newa from Europe-Engr?an Trouhlc? nt Home and Abroad. Earl Russell's reconstructed Cabi? net appear by the latest European advices to be having anything but an easy time of it. The Fenians at home and complications abroad are leading them a somewhat uncom? fortable life. Notwithstanding the fact that Fenianism in Ireland has been repeatedly reported as com? pletely crushed, this hydra-headed brotherhood persists in cropping up in all directions, and the latest pre? cautions taken by the British Go ! vernment in the garrisoning of P.0eon House Fort, Dublin, show that serious trouble is still anticipated. Pigeon House Fort commands the city and bay of Dublin, and it has historical associations which will give thc action of the Government great significance in the eyes of the Irish nation. In 1^4?, the guns were double shotted, and the garrison kept under arms all night, just as in the present instance. Thon, as now, it was against the Irish people them? selves that these pr?cautions were directed. Daniel O'Connell ami his repealers vero the dreaded foo in liS48; President O'.Mahony and his Fenians in 1865. The mere ap? pearance of three large steamers in the oiling of Dublin Bay sufficed to convince thc commander of Fort Pigeon House that the long expected Fenian privateers had arrived at last. So, in bot haste, he posted off to the Lord Lieutenant and declared that unless reinforcements were sent to him, he would not be answerable for the safety of the city. Accordingly, the garrison was increased, the guns loaded, and every preparation made for an immediate engagement with the enemy. How far this ne > scare of the Dublin Government is justified by facts, the Feniau Congress in secret session could probably tell us. But it is at least clear that the ghost of the Alabama is haunting the British Government, and their trepidation will probably not be diminished when they receive President Johnson's Message. To add still further to their anxiety, comes the escape of Stephens, the mysterious Head Centre, from the dungeon in which the authorities fondly hoped they had securely bound him. It is scarcely possible that the prisoner could have effected his release without the con? nivance of his jailors, and if Fenian? ism has spread into tho ranks of the very minions of the law, no further fact is required to show that the rami? fications of the brotherhood in Ire? land are both extensive and mys? terious. The action of the Spanish Govern? ment in Chili is another source of I embarrassment to the Government. In the abstract, John Bull cares little .who is right and who is wrong in this dispute. It is from no romantic; intention of protecting the weak against the strong that the merchants of Liverpooljj are clamoring for English intervention against Spain. But their pockets have been touched severely by the blockade of the Chilian ports, and consequently their indignation is loud against Spanish aggression. Earl Bussell has prompt? ly replied to their entreaties by despatching one of his characteristic menacing despatches to the Spanish Government, and apparently has placed himself in such a position that either he must submit to a snub from the Spanish Government, or enter upon an inconvenient and inglorious war. Under ordinary circumstances, perhaps, Lord Russell would take the snubbing and sueak out of the dis? cussion, as he did with Russia over the Polish insurrection aud from Prussia in the Danish war. But he has the reputation of his Government to make; he aspires to wear Lord Palmerston's mantle, and must, there? fore, show a bold front. He will be the better able to do this as his ad? versary i.s very small, and a powerful ally in the person of the Emperor Napoleon is ready to assist him. [Sew York Herald, bili. -. A second part of Capt. Hall's re? port on his search for fuller informa? tion about Sir John Franklin's Arctic Expedition lias been received.

ACCIDENTAL DEATH. -On Saturday after? noon last, a colored lad, while carelessly handling a gun, accideutly shot and killed his younger brother. Thc affair occurred at thc residence of Jos.

Mon:; ROUUERIES.- Hen-roosts have suf? fered terribly during thc last few days, (or nights;) but on Sunday, the robbers aimed at higher game, ami succeeded in lifting about SSOfl fron; the store of Messrs.

These robberies arc getting to bo of such frequent occur? rence that our citizens will have to keep a supply of ammunition on hand. A SCGGESTION.-Tho attention of our readers is called to thc subjoined commu? nication. The matter suggested is well worthy of conside. tuon, and appeals to the benevolence of all: MESSRS. EDITORS: The destruction of 1,300 houses in our city, by General Sher? man's army, is known throughout the State. It may be also known to all, that this great calamity has left many houseless and destitute of thc actual necessaries of lifo. It is true, that tho devastations of war aro Mt in all parts of thc State, but in some portions not to the same extent as in others. It is, however, in the city of Columbia that the foot-marks of the de? stroyer aro ne.m in all their horrors and desolation. Wintor is on us. There is no poor house ready for the reception of the poor. It is not to be expected that the people of Columbia, in their present condition, can do much in support of their moro needy fellow-citizens, out there aro many in different portions of the State that would aid us, if an organization could be formed hero and superintended hy men of known character ?nd integrity. If our people will moot and take counsel together, such an organization can be effected. Wo respectfully suggest, therefore; that our citizens meet at the store of the Hon. Mayor, J. G. Gibbes, on Thursday next, the 14th inst., at 12 o'clock m., to take into consideration such a course of action as may, to some extent, alleviate the con? dition of the poor of our citv. A

Tennessee, a thoroughly loyal man ? ?ind ti strong personal friend of the j President. It is understood that Mr. ; Johnson has declared that he will not j confer the offices at his disposal upon : those who oppose bis policy of recon? struction, nor will lie appoint the i friends of those opposing him in this policy. Tin* Republican leaders are, there : fore, comforted wit li the loss of nil Executive patronage, and it staggers ; them prodigiously, us there is scarce i ly a member who luis not some favor to ask for his political friends. Al? ready many of the members begin to manifest a change of front, and I desire to be considered in any other attitude than that of hostility* to the I President. It is to be hoped that this timely hint from the President may yet , result in a coalition of the conserva? ? tive Republicans and Democrats, sufficiently powerful to check tho malignant spirit of the Radicals. !
