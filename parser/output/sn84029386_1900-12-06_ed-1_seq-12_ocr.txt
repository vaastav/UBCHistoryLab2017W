The Proceedings In th Huase ' Washington, Deo. 4, The opening of the session In the house yesterday was brilliant, but not exciting, There were the usual throngs in the galleries and the usual display of floral pieces on the floor, but the proceedings were purely formal, consisting of the rapping to order by the speaker, prayer by the chaplain, the roll call of members, the appointment of the formal committees to wait on the president and the reception and read ing of the president's- message, De spite the fact that a great presiden tial cnnipuign had roncludcd within a month the best of feeling seemed to prevail between victors una van quished. The reading of the message, which naturally was tho feature of the day, occupied over two hours, it was listened to with respectful inter est by both sides. When Speaker Henderson called the house to order at noon the desks' of half the members were freighted with flowers from admiring friends of constituents. Then the bliud chaplain delivered a prayer. In his Invocation the chaplain referred feel ing to the deaths of the late Repre sentatives Daly, of New Jersey, and Hoffecker, of Delaware, which oc curred during the recess. The speaker then directed the clerk to call the roll. A4 soon as the clerk began the conversation on the floor and In the galleries was resumed. The confusion became so great that the clerk could not hear the responses and the Scnker was obliged severnl times to call for order. The speaker announced that 275 members had responded to their names, quorum, and tho house wus trendy for business, New members then took the oath of allegiance. Messrs.

The Secretary of War Makes His Annual Report. iW THE ARM HAS BEES DOING WHAT BALLOTS DID Pluralities by Kama Counties ou President and Governor. Other fcohj-els Treated Are the Philippine liitnrri.ctlii, th C'hinaon Campaign mid the Developments hi tub -Hi d Porta Kirjn. Washington, Dec. 4. The annual report of Secretary Root is of more than usual interest owing to its wide scope and the fact that it treats of subjects of such Importance aa the I'liilipplne insurrection, the Chinese campaign, the developments in Cuba and I'orto Ilico end finally, with the subject of army reorganization. Koine Idea of what the army has been doing in the field and at home is conveyed by the secretary's statement that its operations include the prosecution of the war for the suppression of the I'liilipplne insurrection and the estab lishment of a government in the Phil ippines, the rescue of the foreign ministers In Tekin; the preservation anil tlio relief of distress in Alaskn mid the construction of ronds and telegraphs there; the conduct of the government of I'orto Rico until May 1 last; the conduct of the govern ment of Culm; prosecution of river and harbor -works; the construction of seacoast fortifications; the garri soiling and maintaining of military posts and fortifications; the discharge f about one-third of the army and the re-enlistment of soldiers to tnke their place, and the distribution of supplies to the scattered forces. The chapter of the report treating of military .operations in the Fhil- Imiines is 11 recital of the features of the campaigns that were con. dueled in the islands during the past year, It Is said that the purpose was to pursue the small bands of Filipinos scattered throughout the Islands. The effort was successful and re sulted in the further and practically complete disintegration of the insur rectionary bands; in the rescue of nearly all the American and Spanish prisoners; in the capture of many of the leading insurgents and the de struction of large quantities of arms and supplies. Secretary Root says that with the executfbn of the mili tary plans there, nil formal and open resistance to American authority in the Philippines terminated, leuving only an exceedingly vexatious and an- noying guerrilla warfare, of a charac ter closely approaching brigandage, which will require time, patience and good judgment to finally suppress, Touching Cuba the report Buys that the conduct of affairs' there during the year has been a continuance of tho process of aiding the Cuban peo pie in the development of the Cuban government lu such a way that, when fully organized, it shall be stable and efficient, This has been done by guiding the Cubans In the first steps of systematic self-government, and by ntroiliiciiig, mainly through Cuban officers, such reforms In administra tion ns shall serve to pat. the busi ness of government in fairly good con dition when a complete Cuban ad ministration finally assumes control of the government of the Island. The report describes the taking of the census and the beginning of munici pal elections. It explains that in cw of flip fact tttMkOO per cent. ould not rend and write it was not deemed advisable that absolutely un restricted suffrage should be estab lished. The report sketches the va rious steps in the creation of the government down to the gathering of Ihe constitutional convention, which s now in session. In I'orto llico, wher the army con trolled up to, the first of May, Its principal function was the Improve ment of the civil administration, ac- ustoming the people to the exercise of the powers of government and con tinuing the wore of relief made neces- sury by the deplorable condition in which the Island had been left by the great hurricane. , The secretary ac cepts as his own (Sen. Davis' state ment, os to the creditable way in which the army, discharged the trust oinmltted to it in I'orto Hico. and -in on ovnrpsHtnn nf o-rntetul ap preciation of the devotion, judgment, good temper and nbility exhibited by Gen. Davis. The report treats Alaskan condi tions briefly, the main point of in terest in that connection being the recommendation that a moderate ap propriation be made for the relief of the native Esquimaux who are af flicted by a series of fatal epidemics and are in danger of extermination. it is snm mat several hundred white miners, unsuccessful and Impover ished, who might have perished dur ing the arctic winter, were brought home on government transports. Hut the principle is a, bad one and notice Is given that the war dennrtment nes not Intend again to furnish such transportation.
