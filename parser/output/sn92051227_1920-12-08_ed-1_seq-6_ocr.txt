WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1920 THE PRESIDENT'S LAST MESSAGE THOSE WHO expected the dom inant note of the President's annual message to Congress to be a war-ory urging on the fight for the League have been disappointed. Neither have those who looked for a document filled with biting sarcasm for the opponents who thwarted his efforts been gratified, for there Is In it no call to battle, no song of victory, nor no denunciation. . A great figure movng off the stage, who has upheld a great cause, and been stricken while so doing, pauses for an Instant to point out to his countrymen what he considers the vital principle by which, and by which alone, the affairs of not only this nation, but of the world, can be ordered aright. The tone Is one of retroprospect. Of or3 who is consciously through With a great task and looks far into the future, and like an undertone can be detected the sadness of fare well. In the President's own expres sive phrase it is a "confession of faith." At this supreme moment his "mind turns to that other srea American President with whom in the years to come his name will be so often link ed and In that sentence of Lincols's "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that fath let us dare to do our duty as we understand it," a sentence which he calls immortal, be finds his text. This he says is the "essential faith of the nation, the faitu in which it was conceived, and the faith in wltich it has grown to glory and power," and points out that upon this faith rests the hope of the world for a "new order in which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and lorcc." Then follow a few concrete sug gestions calling the attention of Con gress to some of the obvious needs of the moment among the more salient points of which were: Revision and simplification of the tax laws. A fiscal programme to retire the floating debt of $2,500,000,000, and to pay at maturity in 1923 part of the Victory loan and war savings certificates of $5,000,000,000. A workable budget system, in the hands of a single body. Medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for war victims, Federal licenses for corporations engaged in interstate commerce, With provision for labelling with cost tags all goods sent to cold storage. A loan to Armenia such as was made to the Allies during the war. I Grant the people of the Philip pines the independence "they so honorably covet." Quite enough to keep an efficient Congress busy during the three months of the present session; more man enougn ior many montns gauged by the past performance of the sixty- aixth Congress. Then in clothing the President's mind turns again to the reasons for tha.faith whicn is in him and he says "I have not so much laid be fore you a series of recommenda tions as sought to utter a confes sion of faith, of the faith to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether in America or elsewhere." It is a worthy summons to higher things in national life and aspiration. Woodrow Wilson's fellow citizens can well afford to give it more than perfunctory attention. that China was building them for the United States. These two ships, which are ' now nearing completion. constitute half an order placed In China by the United States Shipping Board, two other ships of identical size being still on the ways. China now has four shipbuilding yards capable of turning out a mod ern ocean carrier complete. These yards are located at Shanghai, Foo chow, Canton and Taku, just outside Tientsin. These yards are capable of turning out these great boats complete in all particulars. Not only this but they are equipped with the most modern appliances. Great ten and twenty-ton electric cranes, the best of lathes, drill presses, and punches. electric and gas welders, air riveters and the like are all looked upon as a matter of course in these plants. The readiness with which the Chinese mechanic "takes" to foreign tools Is said to be remarkable. No mechanism, whether operated' by hand, steam or electricity, seems too complicated for them to grasp and grasp quickly. As a result the ship yards in China have been able to show production charts which com pare favorably with those of Amer ican and European yards. China is lacking in both wagon roads and railroads, the bulk of do mestic transportation being carried by water. For this reason the de velopment of the shipbuilding indus try is of immense importance to the nation and also to outside nations which trade with her. It will now be possible for China to supply herself with the great fleets of small shal low boats of high power needed to navigate the upper reaches of the great rivers and In which the pro ducts of the interior can be carried to the seaports for trans-shipment to all parts of the world. Progressive Chinese are now realizing that the old junks are not equal to the trans portation needs of the country and they propose to displace man power with steam power and there Is little if any, doubt that the results will be the same in China as In every other country where similar progress has been made.' countries. This leaves only Argen- tina, Australia and the United States 1 to furnish the world with its wheat and the supply is short. , "For that reason it Is improbable that there will . be any permanent drop of any "account In the price of wheat and as a result in the price of bread this year. "Bakers have to buy their supplies of flour at least three months in ad vance. There is . not a baker in Bridgeport who has not at least 90 days' supply on hand and some of them much more. It is a physical impossibility to make good bread out of flour that' has not had an oppor tunity to ripen. That can not be done in less than three months. "During fihe war, and for some time after, the bakers were not allowed to set their own .prices .on bread. Her bert Hoover's department prevented them from doing it. Not until they could show that they had begun to use the flour that cost them more maney were they allowed to raise the price. Four times this occurred. A year altogether thebakers were kept from realizing the profits of a rising market as other lines of business were doing. Now, having done that, it does not seem as though they should be expected to cut the price of bread faster than they use up their present stocks of flour and commence to use "that bought at a lower price." Frank Cunningham of the Steinert Company said: "We are satisfied with business and business conditions, Our. business is fairly good and I do not see any reason for thinking it is not going to be. It can not be expected that business Is going to always" be just the same every month in the year and every year 'in. concussion as the boy said. "The only people who need to be anxious when a little lull in business comes are the people who have over borrowed or have made foolish moves; who have over-played their hand as it were. I Imagine that all this wail of pessimism that we are hearing comes from that class of bus iness. ,"I do not think that any business which has been managed on conser vative lines has any reason for worry ing at all. There is plenty of busi ness to be had by going out after it. In fact I think that a little slowing up in business is a good thing for the men engaged in it. , "For a spell back men In business have Just been taking orders. People have come in in large numbers ready to buy and all a salesman had to do was to name prices and write down orders. Now he has to become a salesman again; find out where the potential business is, exercise his in genuity and salesmanship in getting at it, and making it actual. It is a much more healthy condition. "There is nothing - to be alarmed over in this shutting down 01 lac tones. It had to come and everyone will be better off for it. During the war period large numbers of men without previous experience obtained jobs at very high wages as mecnanics and skilled workers. They are what you might call weeds. They need to be gotten rid of. The only way it can be done is to shut down plants and discriminate when re-employing the men again. "No in my opinion there is no rea son for pessimism. If men will only take an optimistic view or me sit.ua tion and go out and create business everything will be all right.' M. B. Erlanger, District Manager for the P. & Q. Organization, is of the opinion that the downward trend of prices has reached its limit and that from now on they will be more or less stable. Mr. Erlanger, who had just come from New York, said: All the mer chants and manufacturers with whom I talked seemed to agree that not only are prices lower here but we are sell ing goods at the lowest prices that can be had for some time. c If there are any reductions later, on in the season they will he on left-overs and less desirable goods, r The . public is buying the cream of the merchants'. stocks now and those who wait think ing to get 'just as good' later on are likely to be disappointed. Howard Figg of the Department of Justice has also said he felt that low prices had now been obtained. . - "Manufacturers and experts with whom I came in contact seemed to be of the opinion that merchants and re tailers generally were giving the pub- lie goods at prices which the econom ics of the situation hardly warrants. Goods In many cases are selling for much less than the cost of produc tion. "As manufacturers we are endeav oring in every way possible to get down to figures for next spring- and I feel sure than spring prices will be prettw nearlv on a level with those prevailing this fall." David Lustig, of Lustig's millinery store, feels that "Everything will be all right if all hands will get busy and stop rocking the boat. I do not believe there Is anything to be con cerned over in the situation. All there Is for merchants to do here in Bridgeport is to watch the New York market -and when that drops, drop with it, and take losses if necessary. Of course, a man in Business can no more expect to go on and, never take a loss any more than the public can expect to never make a profit. During these readjustment periods losses have to be taken and the quick er they are the quicker a merchant's business will be in a shape to make the profits he must have to stay in business and pay his bills. We took our medicine last week- and a good dose of it, too. 1 .am looking for a heavy business the last two weeks before Christmas. It is unfortunate for it to come that way for it is less satisfactory to both the merchant and the "customer, but tf it comes that way we will have to do the best we can.". , , . Frank Todd, of the firm of Reid and Todd, said "I do not see any reason why we should not ha.ve a good -season. I look for as good a year as we had last ySar." DR. 

BURNS DID NOT TAKE BODY OUT BY COAL HOLE (Continued from Page One.) . cident has been the direct cause of a grave injustice to men who would not under any circumstances have permitted the body of a faithful em ployee to be treated except "with the utmost dignity and respect. The officials of the City National Bank did not cause the body to be re moved, through a coal hole It was not removed through a coal hole, but Dy an adjacent broad stairway, by the best and most convenient and most efficient means. The police reported asvpart of their investigation that Dr. Burns now says that he knows tof no dereliction of duty on the pnrt of the police. He saw two or three policemen there. They were keeping the crowd back, and he did not ask them for any other as sistance.' The Times reporter who took the fac's from Dr. Burns, was skeptical about the term 'coal hole." He says: "I was in doubt, and I went back to Dr. Burns, and asked him if lie meant coal hole, and if that was correct. Dr. Burns said- that was correct. He appeared to be vexed, and lie Is Ptill vexed, this morrinsr I called, the City National bank, because I want -to be sure, but there was nobody there to talk to me, and I concluded that I Was iustified in repeating what the ambulance surgeon had told me, not once, but twice."

A. O. N. O. M. S., last week. Mr. Richardson is the well known oil man of Stratford avenue and is one of the most popular mem bers of Pyramid Temple. FROM PRODUCER TO CONSUMER OBITUARY IT IS NOT the longest recommen dation that necessarily repre sents the most profound conse quences. President Wilson renews a suggestion, made to congress in a previous message. He says: "It would be most serviceable if it were provided that all goods released from cold storage or in terstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each pack age the selling or market price at which they went into storage. In order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the pro ducer, or the wholesale dealer. Indeed it would be very service able to the public if all goods destined for interstate commerce were made to carry upon every packing case whose form made it possible a plain statement of the price at whioii they left the hands of the producer." This simple recommendation if put into law and efficiently executed would probably do more to regulate prices and make the transition from the producer to the consumer one of fewest profits. That congress paid practically no attention to this pro posal when it was first given is sub stastlal evidence that the peoples rep resentatives have yielded no more lip service to sound principles of trade.
