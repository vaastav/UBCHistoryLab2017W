Accomac Court House, Va. Saturday, December 11, 1897. Entered at the Postoffice at Accomac C. K., Va., as second-class matter. The members of our present Legis? lature have gotten down to work earlier this session thau usual and there seems to be no question of their purpose to respect the demands made and pledges given to their constituents, to do all in their power to cut down the State expenses, if the number of bills introduced by them looking to that object furnishes any criterion by which to judge them. There is indeed no reason to doubt their willingness to apply the prun? ing knife in that respect, but it looks as if their labors might be in vain, tinless their schemes to that end are better matured and there is more concert of aetioujamong them. Hasty legislation is often bad legistation, and more is likely tobe accomplished if they proceed with more delibera tion, instead, of making two much haste as many of them now seem to be doing in their zeal for retrench inent and reform. Among the plans presented, one is for placing all the expenses upon the counties, another is for each county to bear the expense of prosecuting all misdemeanor cases and still another is to require all charges for criminal expenses to be approved by the Board of Supervis. ors before they are sent to the audi? tor for payment The suggestion which seems to meet with most fa? vor is lor the cities and towns to bear all the expenses of misdemeanor cases and the commonwealth those for felonious. Hon. S. W. Matthews has intro? duced into the Legislature, a bill to regulate the size of barrels used for the shipment of agricultural pro? ducts, commonly called trucks. The measure provides that it should be unlawiul for any person to use in such shipments a barrel of less size and dimensions than as follows: Heads and ends not less than sever teen inches, staves not less than twentyseven and one half inches, inside measurement at bulge not less than eighteen and one hatf incite;' and height of barrel not less than twenty-six inches. Any person vio? lating the above provisions shall be lined not less than one nor more than three dollars, and any person cr coiporation manufacturing or of fering for sale, after August 10, IS'jS, shall be liable to the same punish? ment. The same 'bill was before our last Legislatur.-1 and defeated under a misapprehension of some of the rep? resentatives from the appie districts* This year, it is stated, that no objec" tion will be raised Irom that quarter, and the losses incurred by most of cur farmers, in not having a barrel of uniform size for several years past, will certainly cause them to approve the bill and favor its passage. The fifty fifth Congress met in reg? ular session at noon on Monday, and t he President's message submitted to that body and read, is generally ac? cepted as a very creditable S^ate paper. At least the republicans are pleased with it and praise it as an able document and the democrats, if it does not suit them, seem for the most part to have witheld their eriti cisms, because of the patriotic senti ments it contained. The subjects treated by him are such, as were ex? pected?and his views on many of them are two much in accord with those of many democrats to be very severely criticised by them. Of course, they differ with him in bis views on the currency question and condemn that part of the message, indicating an intention on the part of the President 'to give gold a fur? ther superiority over silver as money.' A summary of the message is presen? ted in another column. Hon. John W. Daniel, as was ex? pected and as all Virginia demanded, will succeed himself as United States Senator from Virginia. He was unanimously renominated by the| democratic legislative caucus on the third day of the session and has since shown his appreciation of the honor conferred upon him by the following telegram to the General Assembly: "I pray you present my heartfelt gratitude to my Democratic brethren of the General Assembly, for the le Dewed and signal expression of their confidence implied by my nomination to succeed myself in the United States Senate. That honor gathers its greatest charm in the generous manner in which it has been bestow? ed, and renewing to all who tender it, and to our beloved Commonwealth the pledges of my devotion, I accept it with the deepest sense of obliga? tion and the hishest inspiration to faithful endeavor." The appointment of Professor F. P. Brent, as secretary, of the State Superintendent of Public Instruc tion, is a just recognition of the East? ern Shore and very gratifying to our people. It ought to be the steppiug stone later to the position of Super? intendent,and will be.if his qualifica? tions have the recognition they de? serve. The vote cast in May last on the question calling a constitutional convention has been canvassed by the Legislature and is as follows: Total vote, 121,779; for amendment, j 58,336; against amendment, 83,453. i Summary of President's Message Tho message opens with .in expre?^ sion of satisfaction "at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unifica? tion in all sections of our country, aud the lifting of great public ques tious above party prejudice." The subject, of greatest importance is the revision of the currency, anil President McKinley discusses it at length. He says, that Congress ought not to hesitate now to enter upon a reform of the currency which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from ambi? guity and doubt. It is manifest, he says, that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated redemptions. If this evil is nor correct oil by legislation, the President suggests that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized by Congress to sell bonds at long or short periods bear ing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. The President also recommends that, as soon as the receipts of tho government are sufli L-ient to pay all its expenses, all Uni ted States notes, after their redemp? tion in gold, shall be set apart aud only be paid out again for gold. The President invites careful con? sideration by Cougrtss of Secretary Gage's plan to protect the gold re? serve, and concurs with tho Secretary rbat national bauks be allowed to is sue notes to the face value of their bonds deposited; that the circulating tax be reduced to one- half of one per cent-., and that national banks may he established with a capital of $2f).000. He also recommends that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 aud upward, aud that they bo re quired to redeem their notes in gold. The President devotes much space in his message to a consideration of the Cubau question. He outlines bis recent instructions to Miuister Wool ford, which were to impress upon the Spanish government the sincere wish of the United Stutes to aid iu t-rmi uatiug the war by peaceful methods, accomplishing a resuit which would be just aud honorable to Spaiu and to t he Cuban people. It was also made known to the Spanish govern? ment that the United Stares could not contemplate an indefinite i eriod tor the accomplishment of this result Sptiiu's response was an announce ineut of its change of policy, the re? call of Weyler aud the proposition to bestow autonomy upon the Cubans, lie says that it is honestly due to Spain that it be given a reasonable rime iu which to test its new policy. Present conditions iu Cuba do not justify the recognition of the bellig? erent rights of the insurgents, nor of their independence. The President declares, in conclusion, that "the uear future will demonstrate whether a righteous peace is likely to be at? tained; if not," be adds, "the exigen? cy of further and other action by the L'uited States will remain to be taken.1' He heartily approves the annex? ation Of Hawaii, aud says that, while abrupt assimilation of the immature elements of its population should be avoided, just provision sLould be made for self rule in local matters, with the largest political liberty to rhe Hawaiians. The dispute betweeu Japan and Hawaii over the immi? gration question he declares to be in a satisfactory stage of settlement bv negotiation without the intervention of the government of the United States. While the international monetary commission failed to secure an agree uieut for international bimetallism, gratification is expressed at the action of France, and it is said the negotia tions are still pending. The Presi? dent expresses rhe hope that the labors ot the commissions may bring about an agreement. The opinion is expressed that by reciprocity arrangements under the tariff act the volume of our commer cial exchanges may be enlarged. The President earnestly hopes for the im provement of our merchant marine, ? he inferiority of which, he says, is humiliating to our national pride; International arbitration is indorsed by the President and declared to rep? resent the best sentiment of the civi lized world. A liberal appropriation is urged for a creditable exhibit at the approaching Paris Exposition. The President urges speedy legis lation to procure armor for the three battle ships now building, and says that for a time any increase in the naval equipment should take the form of increased facilities for our vessels. He urges that three or four ol the largest docks should be pro? vided on the Atlantic coast, at least one on the Pacific coast and a float ing dock in the Gulf. He indorses the proposed increase in the number of officers and enlisted men, and recommends an appropriation for only one more battle ship. He thinks several additional torpedo boats are required. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority with in the Territory. The President ap proves the suggestion of. the Secre? tary of the Treasury for an extension of the quarantine laws, aud also rec? ommends the appointment of a special commission to ascertain the cause of yellow fever. Referring to the pendiugsale of the Kansas Pacific Railroad, the President states that the Secretary of the Treasury has been instructed to bid at the sale a sum equal to the principal of the debt to the Government. Referring to the civil service law, the President says the system has the approval of the people, and it will be his endeavor to uphold aud extend it. At the same time the President declares that he shall Dot hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly includ? ed in the classified service, or to in? clude those which, in his judgment will best promote the. good of the service. In conclusion the President urges Congress not to encourage the in? crease of the estimates for the main? tenance of the government. On the other hand, these estimates, he thinks, will admit of a decrease in many branches, and be adds that it is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the receipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit.?Baltimore Sun There is no medicine in the world equal to Chamberlain's Cough Rem edy for the cure of throat and lung diseases.
