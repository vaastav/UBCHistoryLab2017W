We thank our breth ren of the Euioria Tribune for the use of the type on which our extra, containing the President's Message, Is printed. Those wanting to buy a No. 1 small farm should not fail to read the advertisement of L. I). Hinkley, of Cottonwood Kalis, In thl paper. 8. F. Bprague. carpenter and builder, advertise in thl paper. He has been here for some months, and is willing to let his work recommend hlin. In order that we may give the usual amount of reading matter, we present our readers with the President' Message in an extra. Frank ftchinldling, for some months, hns been butchering an average of twenty-five lieeves a week, beside numerous sheep and hogs. Bancroft's Real Estate paper has been delayed for some time on account of our being out of paper It will be iwued in a few days meantime. Major is doing a thriving business. m o State Treasurer Graham," Adjutant Morehouse, with Col. Sherwood and Mr. Perry, of New York came In on the first passenger train over the South ern Branch road on Tuesday. A few day ago we ordered from a paper bouse ten bundles of paper. They sent us tiro, conse quently we run out of paiier, which threw our work behind a couple of days. So wc are delayed with our issue this week. The weather for moot of I bo time during the week past ha beeu delightful. It pleases our new comers. The sun shines out warm, and the ky has been cloudless much of the time. At this writing December 9th we are without fire in our office, and feel a little like shedding our coat. Ccdak Point Mill. The advertisement of O. II Urinkwater ft Co.' flouring and suw mill at Cedar Point, Chase county, may 1ms found in this paier. We hope they may do a good business, as they have labored hard and expended a good deal of means to accommodate that ortion of country with a good mill. M. W. Phillips brought into our ofticc, this week, a twig of cottonwood, upon which the buds are green and seem almost ready to burst into leaves Mr. Phillips asks us, In a note, if we ever saw any thing like it In December. We never did. We have stuck this twig in a crevice in our counter, and shall not be much surprised if it grows into a fine tree. s m Dr. Pugh, of High Point, N. C, is now stopping at Plymouth, in this county, with bis old friend. Uncle John Carter. We had a pleasant talk with him one day this week. He represents prospects a rather gloomy in that State. Many people would like to sell and get away, but there are no buyers even at the rulnours prices at which property is offered. Sabbath School Association. a large number of representatives from the various Sabbath Schools of Emporia met at the Presbyterian hall last Sub- bath, at S o'clock, and organized themselves into a Sabbath School Association, to promote the interest of Sabbath Schools, and to gather into their schools all the children of the town. The Superintendents were appointed an Executive Committee, and ar rangements were made to hold meetings regularly every month. The object is a praiseworthy oneand should be encouraged. B. W. Randall, of Amerlcus, has sold half of his Land Agency at that place, to Capt. T. C. Hill. Both are old residents. Both are upright, honor able men, and those having use for real estate agents in this part or Kansas, and especially about Amerlcus, can't do a better thing for themselves than to favor Randall ft Hill with a call. The bus iness of the Amerlcus Ileal Estate Agency had in creased to such proportions that Russ could not do It Justice, hence a partner. Success to them. Addition Sad. "Additions" are the order. Lot of folk has 'em. We ought to have one. We always anticipated a great deal of pleasure In having an addition to Em poria. We could. In our fancy, look down the dim future for various and numerous generation, and ee fellows describing the boundaries of town lots in our addition. That had been our plan to trans mit our Initial to those that shall follow us. But alaal this source of glory is cut off.. Three or four years ago a fellow offered us some land adjoining town at S per acre, that would have made a fine addition. There was twenty dollars between us in the trade, and we let the chance go, thinking he would come down a little. It has always been a mystery to us that we didn't buy, as he offered to sell on credit. Now there is no chance. In some places addition are a mile deep, and the prospect Is that they will not stop till they get two mile deep all around town. We haven't got money enough to buy even a lot in any of the additions. We almost regard our mission in life as a failure. We wish we had been related to Peabody, or the fellow that gave tao.OOO to endow a Vigilance Com mittee In New York city, although we should not be happy to rob such a worthy object of Its funds. The harvest 1 over the summer is gone and we haven't got any addition. Good-bye, glory. THE

A description of the Building, Improve ments, Furniture, etc., etc. The Robinson House, situated on tho corner of Merchants street and Sixth Avenue, has had a large auumou built to it, ami lias uuUergoue such radical changes since it has fallen into the hands of the present proprietor, that we deem it but justice to him and to the publie to give a description of the improvements, together with the buildings, furni ture, etc The main buildinv 1 Ovf. f.t thr stories high, with an addition 30xGO feet, two stories nign. i-assing up a broad stairway to tho main entrance on Sixth Avenue, w e enter a hull io,.,i; direct to the office, ladies' parlor, and to other hall leading to all part of the building. Turning to the left we enter the office, which is neatly and com fortably furnished, and is always kept scrupulously dean and tidy. Besides the other furniture in the office we noticed a No. 1 Hall's safe. To the right ' of the office Is the family room, which is large and well furnished. Adjoining tho office is tho cloak room. To the right of the mala hall is the ladies' parlor, furnished with piano, fine cabinet orjran. di vans, sofa, chairs, tapestry, etc. Crossing the main uu ngui augra, is a long passage way, leading to fifteen rooms on the second Door, and to the stair way to the third floor, containing nine rooms. All these rooms have walnut furniture, carpeting and spring bedsteads all new. and of course in th. most excellent order. The basement contains ten room besides dining room, kitchen, store-room and washroom. The dining room is large, airy and well furnished. There is also a barber shop on the first floor.

CJKANU BAILBOAD CELKBBATIOJt. Tuesday, Peeember SI, 1869. Opening of the Moutbera Brunch Railroad Kinporls. The committee having tliematier In charge have decided upon celebrating the arrival of the South ern Branch railroad to this place on Tuesday, IH cember Mst, 1869. Tb- following la the plan, as near m it can be fixed now. Invitation ticket will be sent to different partsof the State, which will be a pass on the excursion train to those holding them. The train will arrive here from Junction City about 1 o'clock p. m. The excursionist will be met at the depot with carriage, and .will be taken ftom there to the Court House. At the Court House an oration will lte delivered by Col. P. B. Plumb. Theu will follow volunteer speeches. These exercises will be interspersed with music by the Emporia Hilvcr Cornet Band, and by bands lroiu Junction City and Topeka. After the speeches dinner will be served to the invited guests, at the various hotels. A grand ball will be given in the evening at Spi cer's Hall. It is regretted, not only by the committee, but by the citizens generally, that this affair could not he gotten up on a larger scale, and that all the citizens could not come together in a grand free barbacue. But tbis is out of the question at this season of the year, when it is too cold to celebrate out of doors, and there is no hall in Kmporia sufficiently large In which to give a free dinner, and bring the people all together. We, a citizens, are couiielled to do the best we can now, and await the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka A feanta Fe road, which it is thooght will be here by June next, when we can have an out-door celebration and all join in it. A grrl cultural Society There is some talk of organizing an Agricul tural Society in Lyon county. "We presume it would not be difficult to get a large number of townspeople to join a society of this kind. The difficulty is to get a sufficient number of farm ers interested in it, to take the lead and make the meetings interesting and beneficial. Large numbers of Eastern men are coming into our county and settling on farms. While they may have been excellent farmers in the East, they are entirely unacquainted with the nature of Kansas soil and climate, and will necessarily fail to some extent in their efforts to farm here, unless they are properly informed by those who have lived here some years, and have been successful in making good farms, it is our duty, as older citizens, to give to those who have come here to make their homes with us, the benefit of our experience. An Agricultur al Society, encouraged by our oldest and best farmers, could be conducted in a manner that would prove very beueficial to the older farmers, as well as to thoso who have recently come among us. If a society of this kind is organized arrangements should be made to publish so much of the debates as would be likely to interest the farming community. We hope to see this subject agitated until a society is organized and placed on a permanent footing. Improvement. Sir. Bo wen has just completed a livery stabU 20x40 feet, on the corner of Constitution street and Sixth Avenue. Messrs. Chudwick Bros have opened out a livery, sale and feed stable in the building. W. VT. Irish, of Indiaua, is building a htory and a half frame house 20x20 feet, on State- street, between Sixth aud Seventh Avenues. G. W. Frederick is building a frame house 14x22 feet, ou State street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Is also building n small frame house on the west end of Fifth Avenue. Gray A Mileseon tractors. Mrs. Paine has a new frame house nearly completed on the corner of Seventh Avenue and State street. Mr. HuUe, of Clark county, Ohio, has a small frame house on Neosho street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, nearly completed. Mr. Thomas, of Cleveland, Ohio, is building a frame house on the corner of State street and Ninth Avenue. James Ryan, of New York, has completed a small frame dwelling on the corner of State street aud Eighth Avenue. Last Wednesday night, a few minutes before 10 o'clock, the alarm of lire was given on our streets. Following the direction from which the light proceeded, we noon discovered that a stable on the alley in the rear of Commercial street, belonging to Frank Schmidling, was on fire. The wind was blowing from the south pretty strong, and a large number of citizens exerted themselves to put it out, but it was impossible. There were eight horses in the stable. Six of them were taken out, the re. maining two were burned to death. Had the wind been in almost any other direction the entire block would have undoubtedly been consumed. Favorable winds have saved Em porla from being burned up several times. Wc cannot always rely On the wind being in the right direction, therefore ought to find some means by which the town can be protected against fire. Public cisterns should be built, a hook and ladder company should bo formed, and every precaution taken to guard against this destructive element. The Emporia Cornet Band has been reorgan Ized, and will be ready in a short time to fur nish the public with some good music. Upon consultation it has been thought that the titi zenaof Emporia would contribute a sufficient amount of money to buy two new Instrument., and build a platform on one of the corners of Commercial street, if the Band would agree to play once or twice a week. If the members of the Band give their time and money to enter tain the public, we think the citizens generally can well afford to contribute a little money to help tho thing along. Several of our citizens have agreed to give five dollars each It is desired to raise one hundred dollars. Let everybody make up their mind to give liber ally when culled upon. Last Monday evening the Sons and Daughters of Temperance of this place held an open session at the Methodist church. Thcaudicucc- was very largo and enthusiastic. The exer cises consisted of a lecture by Dr. Walker, es say by Miss M. J. Watson, and temperance ongs by the Society. This organization is very popular in Emporia, aud is destined to do a good work. AVe hope they will meet with every encouragement from tho citizens cener- ally, and that their numbers may rapidly in- creas until they receive into their fold every man and woman within the corporate limits of Emporia. 0 Killed. While railroads arc very benifi cial to the community at large, they often prove very destructive to life and property Last Sunday, while the railroad track was be. lng laid in the bottom north of town, the con strut-lion train came along and run over a very valuable dog. Said dog was the onlv remain ing representative of a litter of five pups, and was the only dog of his species that lived Therefore, by this accident, a whole race of dogs was destroyed. WLile this accident was very unfortunate to the owner of the dog, it yet proved very boiteiici.il to a squad of Kaw Indians who chanced to be nc.tr bv when the accident happened. m tirand Itiill. A grand ball will take place at Spicer's Hall in this city, on Tuesday evening, December 21 1869. The Topeka and Junction City bands will make the music. Tickets, including sup per, (5.00. A geueral invitation is extended and we have no doubt that the attendance will bo large and the occasion one long to be re membered. Lost Found. Daniel Knox, residing on Sixth Aveuuc, lost, last Friday, five dollars iu money somewhere in Emporia. Thursday while he was fooking for it, he picked up a pocket book containing $13 in money. The owner can have it by calling on him, proving property and paying charges. G. R. Soule, of Eagle creek, planted one pound of Early Rose potatoes last spring, and raised 125 pounds therefrom, with nothing but orainary cultivation. iae southern Kansas Stage Company are running an omnibus to and from the depot to the hotels, to accommodate passengers. There will bo fun alive at It. T. Wright's store from now till after Christmas. Such piles or toys never were seen in Emporia before. m Forty-one house have been built in Emporia In the last forty days. . The State Normal School Catalogue for 1869, will be out next week. Kmporia L.ibraiy Association. Iargre antl Enthusiastic Meeting. A large number of citizens met at Presbyte rian Hall last Tuesday evening to perfect the organization of the Emporia Library Associa tion. A deep interest was manifested in the proceedings, and the general feeling was th:it it would be a success. A charter from the State has been applied for, which will be here in time to act upon at the next meeting. The town is being canvassed for members, and a number have already joined. The next regu lar meeting will be held at rresbyterian Ilall next Tuesday evening. All who feel any in terest in this mutter are invited to be present. Important business will be before the meeting. We can and should Lave a course of lectures this winter under the auspices of this society. Turn out, gentlemen aud ladies, and help along this good work. AVe have arrived at that point when it is ab solutely necessary for us as citizens to provide some means by which tho public can have reg ular literary entertainment of some kind dur- ng the long winter evenings. People must have opportunities for amusement. They will have it at the expense of everything ele. There s an inata desire in the heart of every man for the society of his fellow-man. This desire cannot be subdued, although it can and has been smothered for a season in Emporia by the seemingly more important desire for making money. The person who demanded and received nourishment for the mind in the East is not changed by coming West. Persons who have had free access to public libraries, and who have attended public lectures regularly all their lives, miss them badly when they com ? West. We can and should have here all the civilizing and refining influences which sur rounded us in our homes in the East; In fact we are fully able to adopt and carry out a pro gramme of public entertainments which would be considerably in advance of those in towns o equal or greater size iu more eastern localities. The question arisos-how shall this be done how shall this desire for recreation and amusement be met and guided into the proper chaunelf How shall we provide means by which the public can have access to a public library and bo entertained by a public lecture, at least once a week, during the winter season? Towns of larger growth and of more impor tance have solved these questions by forming Library Association. Let us follow their example. Remember the regular meeting next Tuesday evening.

Such an establish ment is much needed here, and wc are glad these young gentlemen propose to occupy the field. The series of meetings held iu the Christian Church for a few days past, by Dr. Walker, of Iudiana, closed on last Monday. The meetings proved very bcnificial to the church, and were well attended bv the community at large. Sev eral persons jolued the church and were bap tised bv immersion in theXeosho. Dr. Walker is an earnest sneaker aud will do much good wherever he goes. Rux Away.

Nearly twenty houses have been put up in town this fall for rent, and still there is not a suilieient number to accommodate those who desire houses. Mr. French, of the firm of Topliff& French, arrived from St. Louis Tuesday, accompanied by his wife. m We should have at least four large cisterns built on Commercial street, filled with water, and to be used only in time of fire.
