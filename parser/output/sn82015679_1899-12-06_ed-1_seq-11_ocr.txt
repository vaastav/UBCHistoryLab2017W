THE NEW CLASSIFICATION IT 3IEETS THE APPROVAL OF THE INTERESTED IIAILUOADS. Consignees 3Iut De More Prompt In Unloading Freights or Pay for Slorage General Notes. The report of the official classification committee renrescntlng the Trunk Line As sociation freight committee, the central freight committee and the Eastern commit tee, providing for the advance in rates on about five hundred articles of freight, has been sent to all of the railroad companies interested, and It has already been ap proved by many of them. A very large number of articles heretofore rated as commodities have been classllled, and this fact, coupled with reports from the West, has led to the erroneous Impression that commodity rates were to be abolished en tirely. Commissioner J. F. Goddard, of the Trunk Line Association, said on this sub ject: "I do not believe that we shall ever see the day when commodity rates are en tirely done away with. The matter of ad Justing freight rates depends so largely on circumstances and conditions that it is im possible to proceed under a fixed or uni form rule. You might as well expect a clothier to make all of his suits from the same modeL" Ineome of Railway. The preliminary report on the Income account of railways in the United Slates for the year ending June CO, 1K9, as compiled by tho statistician to the Interstate-commerce Commission from the returns of op erating railway companies representing 1S5.215 miles of line, received prior to Nov. 24, shows that the gross earnings of tho railways embraced In this advance report were, for the year ending June 30, 1503, 1.3U7..4$4, or $7,0J7 per mile of line. Pas senger earnings were $30),227.319; freight earnings jon.358.4S8; and other earnings from operations $G3,t67,677. The gross earn ings shown In the final report for 1J?S were n curly sixty minion dollars less than this amount. Tne oieratlng expenses for th8 last hscal year were l,42.t.lu3, or J4,tv2 pt-r mll3 of line. Ihe net earnings, or income fiorn operation?, uere 44.ci5to7j, an in reasi of fclAVi&M being Siiown in this item for the year. Income from sources other than operation amounting to fia.lTti.lto was re ceived by tho railways included in the re port. The report shows that the total In come of the operating railways included therein was $501,01,547. The total deductions from Income, erabrac ing by the term. Interest on funhKl debt, rents for leased lines, taxes (W4,1S,":H) and various other charges against income, tut not including dividends, were $371,018,518. This amount Is J11.327.M7 greater than the corresponding figures for 108. The ag re gate amount of dividends declared hy the operating railways under consideration was $v'.2H.fcj. The comparative amount of divi dends reported for the previous year was $"G,0a4K. The combination of the forego ing Items results in snowing a surplus of KA5e6,2 from the operations of railways during the year on about 98 per cent, of the mileage In the United States. Itoe corre sponding preliminary report fornhe pre vious year, covering lcl.333 miles of line, showed a surplus of i42.6O4.909. Palace-Car Companies Consolidated. Tho consolidation of the Pullman Palace Car Company, and Its rival the Wagner Palace Car Company, into one concern, .was ratified yesterday at a special meet ing of the stockholders of the Pullman company called at New York for the pur pose of expressing approval or disapproval of the" action of the recent meeting of the directors in taking steps looking toward the merging of the two corporations. Nearly every share of the stock in the Pullman company was represented at the meeting and the action of the board of directors was approved by practically a unanimous vote. In approving the action of the direc tors, the stockholders voted to Increase the capital stock of the Pullman company from $34,XR0OO to J74.00O.CCO, the Increase to be for tne purpose of purchasing the property of the Wagner Ialace Car Company. It was also voted to change the name of the com pany from the Pullman Palace Car Com pany, to the Pullman Company. An in crease In the number of directors from seven to eleven was also voted, and the following directors elected to the board: William K. Vand-erbilt, J. ITerpont Morgan, Frederick W. Vanderbllt and Seward Webb. Earnings of Home Roads. The estimated earnings of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis for tho month of No vember were J334.8SS.28, an increase of J20,7S3.77 over the corresponding month of 1808. The estimated earnings of the Terre Haute & Logansport for November were J66.0S1.50. an increase of J9.4U.43. The Peoria & Eastern, for four months, ending October, 1S0S and 1S90, shows: 1SD8. 1899 Total earnings JS29.543.73 J750.477!55 Total operating exp'n's.. 4S7,&i8.S9 526.134.07 Tot'l ded. from Income.. 147,20o.C3 152,500.00 Dalance to credit of In come 3.1.81 71.S43.43 Deficit. Personal, Local and General Notes. M. E. Ingalls, president of the Big Four, left yesterday for the East to be absent several days. Harry Miller, superintendent of the Van dalla main line, last evening went to Pitts burg to be absent for three of four days. Vice President Green and other o.Hcials of the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern, are on an inspection trip of the new work done the past season. The new roundhouse of the Wabash at Peru is nearing completion, the boiler houso is completed and the work of the office building is well advanced. T. II. Johnson, chief enfrineer of the Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburg, was In the city yesterday planning for contem plated Improvements in the spring. In November there were handled on the local bulk tracks of the Pennsylvania lines at South street 6.033 carloads of freight, chiefly fruit and vegetables, 320 more than in October. A canvass of the general passenger agents of the Eastern Trunk lines shows that they are not in sympathy with the movement to adopt a two-thousand-mile Interchangeable mileage book. H. G. Wines, of St. Louis, nas been ap pointed ticket agent of the Baltimore & Ohio at the headquarters of the general passenger department in Chicago, vico George F. Gallaher. resigned. Within the next few days Chief Eng netr Brown, of the Pennsylvania, who has been In Europe for the past three months, will return, when It will be definitely decided what Improvements will be made to the lines In lL'00. At the suggestion of E. O. McCormlck, passenger trarlic manager of the Southern Pacific, the company Is getting some heavy fast passenger locomotives, preparatory to still further reducing tho time between tho East and the Tactile coast. Last winter, when a strike of coal min ers was thought to be probable, the Pan handle Company stored at different points on Its line several hundred carloads of coal. Now It is distr.buting it where needed Instead of stocking up. A large membership of the Brotherhood of Railway Irainmen has been organized at Fort Wayne, and at its meeting on Sun day Orlow Hall was elected master. W. H. Clements vice master. J. W. Sunderland Focretary and C. A. Scott treasurer. The Indiana Car-service Association, which recently placed representatives at Vincennes and Muncle. will place one at Marion, one at Fort Wayne and one at Alexandria. The collections of the bureau last month were the largest In the history of the association. Shipments of dead freight from Chicago eastbound last week fell off as well as at Indianapolis, the ten lines taking out of Chicago in the week ending Dec. 2. tonR agalnt 112.02 tons In the p-evlous week, and against 1V.103 tons In the cor responding week Oi 1S08. A Pennsylvania ras?enger offlclal ex presses the? opinion that, within a short time, the Pennsylvania Company will be running solid trains between Cleveland and Chicago over the Cleveland c Pittsburg and the Pittsburg, x ort Wayne & Chicago roads. The line would bo about as short as that of the Baltimore 6c Ohio, which car ries a good many passengers betv.'een points named above. Train 11 on the Pennsylvania lines east is fast becoming very popular. No other train Is scheduled as fast between Indian apolis and Pittsburg, or makes as few stops, and much of the distance ten to twenty miles is covered at a speed of a mile a minute, or even faster if a little late. One of the Lake Shore's new passenger engines on Sunday hauled a train of ten cars from Cleveland to Chicago In nine hours and thirty minutes, breaking all rec ord with a heavy train. Between Toledo and Elkhart, a distance of 132 miles, no stops were made, nor between Slkhart and South Chicago. 'ihe Interchange business between the C, II. & D. and C, I. &. L. for November, cov ered by tho territory represented by Goorge S. Breeount, general agent or the Monon at Cincinnati, shows an increase over tho same month cf 130S of 20 per cent., and is the largest month's business of any month in either of the years 1S0S or M S. P. Bush, who. on Jan. 1. goes to the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul as superin tendent of motive power, has held a like position at Columbus, O., with the Pen handle, seven years, having spent sixteen years in the mechanical department of the company. Mr. Bush i3 now superintendent of motive power of the Fanhandle lines In the Pennsylvania system. In his new posi tion he will have the entire St. Paul road to look after. The fast mall on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul leaves Chicago at 11:45 p. m., reaching St. Paul at 7:55 a. m. A number of Eastern and Southern lines reach Chicago about y p. m., and passengers can now catch the fast train and reach St. Paul next morning. By this arrangement a trav eler can leave Indianapolis at 4:15. on the White Special, over the Big Four, or at 3:47, over the Monon. and have ample time to connect with the train which reaches St. Paul next morning. The incorporation of the Cleveland, Ohio Central & Cincinnati Railway Company, with J10.CM) capital stock, has been author ized by Secretary of State Kinney of Ohio. Tne company proposes to construct a rail road line to be operated by steam, electricity or other motive power, between Cleveland and Cincinnati. The tracks will be laid via West Salem, where the principal olllces of the company will be located. The Incor porators are F. CI. McAuey. Allen Greely, G. A. Cariln, E. W. McFadden, J. F. Brit ton. W. E. Salcn. W. V. Zeehner, E. J. Meyer. J. C. Clark. D. Meyer, F. Lv Berry, N. W. Zimmerman and D. W. Garver. John F. Miller, general superintendent of the Pennsylvania s Southwestern system, was In the city yesterday. In speaking of reports that some of tho employes were dissatisfied with their wages, he said it m'ght be that some uneasy men. who were always dissatisfied with their Jobs, would talk as reported, but they had no reason to complain; in no other line of work could they make the wages they now do. The engineers are getting from $135 to J1C0 a month, firemen from JS5 to Sift and the other trainmen in like proportion. There might be some minor matters to rectify, and if so the company, as heretofore, would do what is right, but any talk of a strike, he said, can be set down as not even mentioned by the conservative men employed on the Pennsylvania. 

SEIBERT IS REWARDED. He Succeeds Isaac N. BradTvell as Deputy City Attorney. Isaac N. Bradwell tendered his resigna tion as deputy city attorney yesterday and he will be succeeded by Henry Selbert, the appointment to that effect having been made last night by City Attorney Kern, with the approval of Mayor Taggart. Mr. Bradwell was the prosecutor In the City Police Court and his duties will cease to day, his successor taking charge of the work to-morrow morning. Mr. Seibert has been identified with local Democratic poll tics for some time and his selection for that office will create no great surprise among his friends, as he was expected to get one of the plums before the supply was exhausted. He made speeches during the last city campaign. City Controller Knifes n. Gas I111I. A representative of the Consumers Gas Trust Company called at the city con troller's office yesterday and presented a bill for J721 for six months' gas for the fire department. Controller Johnson refused to pay the entire bill, and only issued a war rant for payment for two months. He stated that the city was forced to buy coal for the fire houses, and he would not pay for gas the city did not get. After this he will allaw the gas bills for but one month at a time, providing the company furnishes the fuel. Large Issne of Dog Licenses. There have been 5.007 dog licenses Issued so far this year, which is the. greatest num ber ever put out la this city. Dogs of all kinds are now wearing license tags, as their owners are afraid that the canines will be shot unless they are provided with one of those fantastically shaped tags. Geologists Blatchley's Assistants. To the Editor of the Indianapolis Journal: Tho annual report of State Geologist Biatchley reveals two or three things that aro causing considerable comment among members of the party that put him In office for four years. His array of assistants, whoso names and addresses are printed in his last report, shows that at least three of them are nonresidents of this State, one being Mr. Ashley, of California, another Mr. Hopkins, of Pennsylvania; and the other Mr. Foerster, of Ohio. Why Mr. Biatchley should go Into other States and secure tho services of three assistants when Indiana contains scores of men versed in this par ticular science, many of whom would be glad to have employment in this depart ment. Is more than the average citizen can conceive. As a Republican, and one who was a delegate to the State convention and voted for Mr. Blaichiey, I believe I have a right to criticise his actions, especially when they are detrimental to Indiana geolo gists who should have been given prefer ment In his appointments. Another thing that does not set well is that Mr. Biatchley. not being satisfied with going outside the State for three assis tants', has selected a Johnscn county Pop ulist, a Mr. Kindle, who also Is drawing a good fat salary that really belongs to one who supports the Republican ticket. A casual glimpse through the geologist's report shows that the Onio appointee has succeeded in advertising the magnificent courthouse in Dayton, and in addition one or two other elegant buildings in his State, neither of which is constructed of stone that bears the Indiana brand. What this State wants is Its own products advertised, and not those of other States, and I hope that hereafter our geological reports will speak of our own resources and not try to cover those that are found elsewhere, and that all favors, such as appointment of as sistants in the oiiice of the state geologist, will go to residents of Indiana and not to persons scattered through other States.

COLLINS. The Queen of Englaud. London Spectator. The Queen has In truth, not from any culture or experience, -but from the grace of God. a talent for silence which Is not cold, for reiieence in which there Is no guile, and there la no form of capacity in a constitutional sovereign more protitabl-j to the people. Just reflect for a moment cn the st ems that would have occurred had the Queen, remaining as good as she Is. as qualified as she is, as constitutional os she is. been an indiscreet talker, given, let us say, to the epigrams In which so many women have avenged their powerless ness. or crushed the reputation of their otherwise unreachable foes. Party gov ernment would have been almost Impossible, even If we had not seen at last that long forgotten danger of the Constitution as it is. a sovereign's party holding the balance of power. Walter liagehot s.iid the Constitu tion would be near a breakdown whenever a man of genius mounted the throne; we can imagine a sovereign without genius be hind whom whole classes would rank them selves, instead of the whole nation. To-day the lople are one. standing silent, but de termined, around their utanJaul, and one, at least, of the reasons La that for sixty yeais their Queen, who not only bears, but is. that standard, has had no Impulse to speak a word which her people felt had better have been left unspoken. The stand ard has not only never been lowered. It has never, in the hottest tumult of battle swayed to one side or the other. Always when the battle was over the standard was there, a ctnter for the nation to rally around as if it had never been divided. He Will Answer Later. Baltimore American. So far, no one has asked Representative elect Roberts: "Is marriage a failure?" THE BLUE POINT OYSTER IT STILL EXISTS, RUT IX DECIDEDLY LI3I1TED QUANTITY. Where "Bine Point" Is and Why Its Bivalves Are of Especially Fine Quality Known by a Thick Shell. Philadelphia Times. A newspaper dispatch from Patchogue, L. I., brings the information that the field of the Blue Point oyster, which from early colonial days has been owned in common by the town of Brookhaven, Suffolk coun ty, and the Robert R. Smith estate, is to be divided. A partition suit has been begun in the Supreme Court by the Smiths, and the answer of the town has been served. The property in question covers the greater part of the Great South "bay, and carries with it the oyster, clams and fish In the waters and also the hunting privileges. The partition Is due to the fact that the town and the estate do not agree on the terms of the re newal of the oystermen's leasea. The nar rator has heard and read frequent argu ments between the two extremes of the dogmatic men who have Insisted that "there are no longer any genuine Blue Points; they are extinct," and the cred ulous fellow who believes that every dim inutive oyster placed before him is of this famous kind. Both of these classes of men are sadly mistaken. The true Blue Point still exists in very limited numbers, It Is true but it is made the subject of more misrepresentations and more successful de ception than any other food product known to mankind. Extravagant as that state ment may seem, it is not one jol beyond the truth. Not only are other bivalves opened in tho name of the Blue Point, but for the purposes of this masquerade there are selected what would otherwise be con sidered the refuse of a cargo of oysters, the cullings or "cullens," as tho dredger calls them and thus by a strange irony of commercial chicanery the cheapest of all oysters are placed before tho watering mouths or mankind at the highest figure which is placed uron bivalves. This decep tion is made possible by a popular fallacy of Ions standing whereh folKs believe that the Blue Point oyster Is the smallest of its kind. This unaccountable delusion permits the unscrupulous dealer and by dealer is meant the wholesale seller, for the restau rateur is frequently hoodwinked as well as his customers to find an exorbitantly re munerative sale for the small refuse oys sters which the sorters cast asic?e in sepa rating a cargo of oysters Into their various sizes. USED TO BE BIG. It will surprise nearly every one to be told that originally the Blue Point oysters were of monstrous size, and It was the empty shell of one of these of natural growth which suggested to the late George Arnold his delightfully amusing poem of "The Oyster," which "bivalvular hermit" arose upon its edge f and. swallowed "the good ship Emily ahd all Its crew. Natural decadence has lessened the slzo of the Blue Point, but not to the extent people have been taught to believe. It may not be gen erally known that some years ago Uncle Sam ihought this subject was worth in vestigation, and he employed Ernest In gersoil to perform the task. The result of his labors is told In one of the volumes of the tenth census of the United Scates, wherein is published an exhaustive treatise on "The Oyster Industry." Referring to what he termed the "Brookhaven Bay or Blue Point oyster." he says: "The natural growth of the oyster In the Great South bay is confined almost wholly between Smith s point and Fire island practically to the wter. east of Blue point, kown as Brookhaven bay. This was the home of the famous celebnty, the Blue Point oyster, which was among the earliest to come to New York markets. The pres ent oyster of this brand Is small and round, but the old 'Blue Points.' cherished by the Dutch burghers and peakhattcd sons of the Hamptons, who oasted the King long be fore our revolution was thought of, was of the large, crooked, heavy-shelled, elon gated kind, with which one becomes famil iar all along the coast in examining relics of the natural beds, and which are even now to be found by the thousand in all the mussel lagoons of the Gulf of St. Law rence. Now and then, a few years ago, one of these aboriginal oysters, of which two dozen made a sufficient armful, was drag ged up and excited the curiosity of every one. But the time has gone by when any more of these oysters may be expected." At the present time the Blue Point has Its bed in more circumscribed limits than Mr. Ingersoll describes. First ;et ne ex plain that, geographically. Blue Point is a small promontory of Long Island, reach ing into the Great South bay. Whether it gets its name from the famous oyster or whether the process of nomen.iat.ure has been the reverse of that, it i3 impossible fcr the narrator to say. The under shell of the oyster in question has a number of small spinous-like protuberances, the points of which are colored a greenish-blue hue, and from these, many oystermcn declare, the bivalve, and subsequently Its home, came to be termed Blue point. Three miles west of Blue point Is Patchogue, and from thence along off the coast as far as Oak dale and a short 3tretch of sand it is the true Blue Points can be found. The beds for that distance are all laid in the same water and are sowed each year by seedling oysters taken directly off Blue point Itself. ITS 

FINE FLAVOR, There is scarcely a restaurant or hotel in the land on whose bills of fare the namo does not figure, and In most cases honestly, too at least so far as the Intentions of the proprietors are concerned. Some may ask, "What difference does it make? Is not an oyster an oyster?" That question would never be asked by one who has had the rare experience of feasting upon the genuine Flue Point. No other oyster pos sesses Its substantial plumpness; a sciid fatness due to its feeding in Its natural beds in the pure waters ot the Great South bay. una easwy disungulshaoie from the delusive and liavoriess white plumpness of bivalves which have teen transierred to fresh water to gain In size. No other oys ter has It delicate flavor, which is such a marked pecu.iarity that it is noticeable even in a stew a clish of that kind when made from Blue Points having nothing about it rank in either taste or smeil. in fact, In all respects it is the beau ideal oyster, and no man knows the deliciousness of this moi lusk who has not eaten the Biue Point. Its food value even surpasses that of all its brethren, and It Is a tact wed known to expert oystermen that one dozen Blue Points, when eaten, equal in their invig orating results two dozen of any other kind of bivalves, with the probabie excep tion of the more recently cultivated Lynn Haven. Can one tell this rare creature from his meaner fellows by an Inspection from his shod? Yes, with careful study this can be done. Reference has already been made to tne greenish-blue points as one distin guishing characteristic, but, alas, that char acteristic is frequently possessed by Run aways, which tire must commonly used to defraud the public. The Biue Point, how ever, can almost infallibly be told by the extreme thickness and depth of Its shell, and above all by the oyster Itself when opened, filling every portion of its conch olcglcal cavern so completely that, like the clJampagne cork, one wonders how it was ever confined la its recent prison. The oys ter opener should know that he holds in his hind a bogus Clue Point wien he finds that he has to knock off quarter of an Inch of shell before iv c:m Insert his knife. The genuine submarine tid-blt is never built that way. The consumer can declare that it is nt the eye of a lilue Point which is staring into his unless the meat of the oyster to coin a thoroughly bad but thoroughly ex pressive phrase reaches to the very -dge of the shell. This substantial quality of the Blre Point in both oyster and shell has specially commended It for shipment for K'.ircpe, and no inconsiderable portion of each season's crop will be shipped abroad, mainly to England, where the Britisher has fcrgciin to praise his copper-tasting bivalvular abortions in his newly found love for the luscious rr.ollusks of Brother Jonathan. The difficulty met with in ex porting oysters arises from thtlr natural inclination to die when removed from their native element. Rut the Blue Point, with Its deep ?hel, is enabled to retain an extraordinary quantity of what men call Its liquor," .and in this, as long as It does nit open Its shell, it not only lives, but .actually fattens. In addition to this, in packing oysters for foreign ship ment their fital predlrposltlon to gape if discouraged by a 250-pound weight being placed upon them after they have beer placed In a b:rrci ir is very too. The rhV' shell of the Blue Point can withstand the pressure, while the thin covering of the Rockaways is crushed beneath the heavy burden. ONLY THIRTY NAYS. (CONCLUDED FROM FIRST PAGE.) views with Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania; Mr. Steele, of Indiana, and Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, in which they were alleged to have stated that Mr. Roberts was entitled to take the oath upon the prima facie evi dence of his credentials. Mr. Dalzell and Mr. Steele denied the interviews. Mr. Can non asserted that in his opinion If charges of : ineligibility were made it was competent for the House to receive them now here after. Roberts In Ills Own Defense. Mr. Roberts himself took the floor In his own defense after Mr. Richardson had concluded. He occupied a conspicuous place immediately in front of the clerk's desk. Several legal volumes were piled up In front and a bouquet of carnations lay upon his desk. The most Intense interest was manifested as he arose. Members crowded about but were compelled to te turn to their seats. Galleries were hushed. The occupants leaned over to listen, eager to let no word escape. Mr. Roberts first sent to the clerk's desk and had read hl3 naturalization papers. He then began to speak. His voice was soft and low, but his enunciation was distinct and in the stillness could be heard to the farthest corner of the hall. As he got Into his argument his voice grew louder until on several occasions it rang out until the fretted ceiling overhead gave back the echo. Mr. Roberts began by sending to the clerk's desK and having read a copy of his naturalization papers in order, as he said, that all the documents in this ex traordinary case should be before the House, lie then read a paragraph from McCreary on elections, containing a gen eral caution against hasty procedure in election contests. "Now, gentlemen," con tinued Mr. Roberts, "that is the statement of one whose book has authority in this country. And If it is the rule of the lloue of Representatives in cases that arise to the diginty of a contest how lnftnitely more should that rule be observed when only a mere protest is made against a member who presents himself to take tho oath of office. "I next proceed to consideration of the charges that are supposed to justify what the gentleman from OhicnMr. Tayler) him self concedes to be an unusual proceeding, and which my friend on this side (Mr. Richardson, of Tenn.) has demonstrated to be an unprecedented proceeding. The gen tleman from Ohio bases his charge on a court record: That some twelve years ago, In the midst of our conflict in the then ; Territory of Utah over the subject of polyg- 1 amy, that I pleaded guilty to a charge of a ' misdemeanor. The gentleman seems to i i bo oblivious to the fact that since the date ; of his court record on this subject we have . had two presidential amnesties proclaimed that have been applied to men disqualified by the Edmunds-Tucker act. WHAT TAYLER FORGOT. "The gentleman from Ohio has no court record to show that I was ever arraigned or condemned of crime whatsover since the promulgation of the amnesty procla mation of the President of the United States. The gentleman seems also to for get the fact that since the confession of that misdemeanor to whlc. he has referred there was passed by Congress an enabling act authorizing the people of the State of Utah to form a ctate government. That enabling act also had a provision embodied in it that qualified all citizens within the limits of the territory to become citizens of the United States, and was practically framed to remove the disqualifications and disabilities which have been created by the Edmunds-Tucker law. The gentleman seems to forget also that the state consti tution of Utah was satisfactory to the President and his advisers and Utah has been admitted as a State Into the Union, and has taken upon itself tho responsi bilities of a sovereign State declaring undei its constitution who of the people residing In its borders shall exercise the elective franchise and be qualified for office as cit izens of that great commonwealth. "The second charge, which is supposed to go to the question of eligibility of the mem- ber from Utah. Is that upon aftldavit ana other papers In his possession, the gentle man from Ohio says that ever since 1SS9 I have been a persistent lawbreaker In the State of Utah. If that be true let me ask why it Is that I was not punished for law breaking. Certainly there was no dispo sition not to execute the law on the part of the people of Utah. Its administration was in the hands of non-Mormons, of those who had no sympathy with men of my re ligious faith. All the machinery of the law was In the hands of federal appointees. How Is it, then, that I could be an open and defiant lawbreaker and yet escape the penalty of the law? The gentleman's ob jections, then, are based not upon court records, but upon affidavits and papers that have been furnished him by the peo ple. 

ALLEGED UNFAIRNESS. "And now as to the manner in which these charges are made. It has been about fifteen months since they began, since the representative from Utah was heralded throughout this land as a defiant law breaker. And yet I walked the streets of Salt Lake in open day, within easy reach of the law, and my faults lay open to the law if I were guilty of transgressing. Other men were arrested before the courts of Utah and were fined for the very offense alleged against me. and yet no complaint was made against me. No, It did not suit the purpose of those who had this present agitation in hand to vindicate the law quietly and by the usual methods. They desired particularly to have this case up on which apparently to arouse the senti ment of the country. Not until my busi ness called me East did they undertake to make any charges against me. But the moment, or shortly after my departure, they began this agitation, resulting in the present sentiment of the country now aroused against me. "I call your attention next to the fact that the only charge against me, even by the proponents of this resolution, is that of a mlsdeamenor. They do not charge a felony. I understand members of Congress are granted certain privileges while in at tendance on this House. It would be im possible to arrest any one of the members on the charge of a misdemeanor. And yet you would deny me the privilege of being sworn as a member of this House upon the allegation of the existence of some charge or other that I was guilty of a misde meanor. For the things for which the law itself couid not lay a hand on me wnile in attendance upon this House, you propose I speak of the little coterie of men who have entered into this conspiracy to crowd this question to the front at this particular time, and for the reason that they are fearful that if the matter should go to a consideration under a resolution to expel the member from Utah they could not marshal the necessary two-thirds vote to accomplish their purpose to pass the pres ent resolution. , 

INVOKES PROTECTION. "I understand, sir, that these immunities are not given for the benefit of the indi vidual menders. They are given rather as a protection to his constituency, who are entitled to his sendees as their representa tive, and therefore I invoke the protection that it. given to the constituency of a sov ereign State against the proceedings that are instituted here to deprive me of the privilege of being sworn in as a member of this House. Privilege, did I say? I am not asking any privileges In this House. I am not asking any favor of the members of this House. Under the shadow of the Constitution of the United States 1 merely demand, both for myself and for the peo ple of my State, the protection that Is due to us. It is a demand It is asking no favor." Applause on the Democratic side and in the gallery. Mr. Roberts next called attention to the precedent in the Forty-third Congress in the case of Mr. Cannon, adding: "I can add nothing to the force of that gentle man's remarks, except this: That in the case of Mr. Cannon the House was dealing with a delegate from a territory, not the representative of the people of a sovereign State. They were dealing with a delegate who was created by a statute passed by the Congress of the United States, and throughout the discussion It was alleged as a reason for taking the exceptions to him that they could do so because he was unprotected by the provisions of the Con stitution. And yet, sir, notwithstanding he was but a creation of lav . still they admit ted him as a member uptn the floor of this House. "It is to be remarked in this connection that, strange to say, the course of nature was not disturbed. Notwithstanding an rJ- x - leged polygamlst was permitted by the vote of a Republican Congress to remain upon the floor of this House, it did not transpire, as It is said it did transpire in ancient Rome a little ere the mighty Julius fell. The graves stood not tenantless. The sheeted dead did not stand and gibber In the streets of Rome. Why, sir, the sun was not darkened, nor was the moon turned to blood. Actually, sir, the rain continued to fall upon the just and the un just alike. Laughter and applause. Gentlemen of the Democratic party, some few of whom may perhaps tremble -a little at the thunderous objection that has been presented as pretending to voice the senti ment of the country upon this subject. I want to call your attention to another thing, and that Is. that notwithstanding a Republican Congress seated this man. yet the Republican party really survived its action. Iaughter. -Why, It Is here to day, and I believe, gentlemen of the ma jority, that it could survive, even if it should seat the present representative from the State of Utah." 

CHARGE AGAINST M'KINLEY. Proceeding, he took up the charge that Utah had broken her compact with the United States by the election of an alleged polygamous representative. If that was true, then Utah had simply followed the illustrious example of the present national administration. "I affirm." said he. "that there Is abundant evidence that objections similar to those In the present case were made to the President and the Senate against the appointment of certain federal officials In Utah, but the objections were waived aside." "Do you mean to say that polygamlsts were appointed to federal office in Utah by the present executive?" queried Mr. Hop kins (Rep.. 111.) "With the Jtnowledge of the President?" added Mr. Grosvenor (Rep., O.), quickly, amid some laughter on the Democratic side. "When men were applicants for federal offices In Utah," reiterated Mr. Roberts, "objections were made and affidavits were filed both with the President and the Sen ate, but, nevertheless, the. appointments were made." "That docs not answer my question," ob served Mr. Hopkins. Mr. Roberts urged that the caso ought to go to the Judiciary committee, where It could be investigated. He warned the Re publican side that this was a serious ques tion. If the people of Utah were guilty of violating the compact with the Union, what of the President, who had appointed to life positions In Utah men chargeable with tho same offenses? Mr. Robe-ts ridiculed the manner in which the petition favoring his expulsion had been procured. In conclud ing he denied that the members who voted to seat him would be voting for polygamy. The question of polygamy was settled. "I hold it as an honor." said he. "that I will be quoted long In Utah as one who helped to settle that question on the floor of the constitutional convention. I am not de fending polygamy. It is dead." Mr. Rob erts concluded, by thanking Mr. Tayler and the House for their Indulgence. He was given a round of applause as he took his seat. Mr. DInsmora (Dem., Ark.) briefly op posed the Tayler resolution. 

DENOUNCED BY GROSVENOR. Mr. Grosvenor (Rep., O.) denounced Mr. Roberts's statement concerning the ap pointment by the President of polygamlsts in Utah as a miserable subterfuge. T make the statement," said he. "and I defy contradiction, that the President of the United States never knowingly appointed a polygamlst to office. As well might one charge that the President had plunged his stainless hands in human blood as to charge that he appointed to public office men guilty of the crime alleged against the gen tleman from Utah." Great applause on the Republican side. "I charged and reiterate It," said Mr. Roberts, "that men appointed to office in Utah were charged before the President and the Senate with the same misdemeanor of which It is charged I am guilty." "Were they guilty?" Inquired Mr. Dal zell. "It does not appear whether they were guilty," answered. Mr. Roberts, raising his voice and looking around the hall. "They were only charged as I am charged." Ap plause on the Democratic side. In which many people In the gallery joined. Mr. Tayler concluded the debate. Mr. Roberts, he said, had exhibited a large In capacity to misunderstand his (Tayler's) position. He did not say Mr. Roberts was guilty. But he Indicted him upon his own responsibility. The vote was then taken, first on the substitute, which wa3 defeated 49 to 217. The vote then recurred on the adoption of Mr. Tayler's resolution, the roll being called on the demand of the Republicans. The resolution was adopted 302 to 3a Thoso who voted In the negative were: Adamson, Allen (Miss.), Bailey, Ball, Brewer, Burllson. Carmack, Cooper, Da vey, De Graffenreid, Dinsmore. Fitzpatrick, Fleming. Kitchen. Lesjter, Lewis, McClel lan, McCulloch. Maddox. Norton (S. C), Rhea, Richardson, Robblns, Slayden, Small, Snodgrass, Stephens, Turner, Dem ocrats; Newiands. of Nevada sliverlte; Loud, of California, Republican. The speaker then appointed the follow ing members as the special committee un der the resolution: Republicans, Tayler, Ohio, chairman; Landis, Indiana; Morris, Minnesota; Freer, West Virginia; Little field. Maine; McPherson, Iowa. Democrats, De Armond. Missouri; Lanhara, Texas, and Meyers, of Indiana. The death of the late Representative Set tle, of Kentucky, was then announced, and at 6:25, as a further mark of respect, the House adjourned until Thursday. . 

3IESSAGE READ IX SENATE. Adjournment Then Taken on Account of Mr. Haywnrd's Death. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. To-day's session of the Senate lasted two hours and forty minutes, practically the entire time being occupied in the reading of the President's message. The reading was largely perfunc tory, few senators according it any atten tion. The announcement of the death of Senator-elect Monrce L. Hay ward, of Nebras ka, was received by the Senato with sin cere regret. Although he was not officially a member of the body, he was well known to many ot the senators and was held by them in high regard.
