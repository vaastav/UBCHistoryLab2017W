TOWN IN NARROW VALLEY So Situated That (irave .tears Are entertained for Its Safety. MEAGER REPORTS RECEIVED Last Winter Residents Had to Take to High Places Because of Bushing Waters. . DENVER, December .".?A special to the News from Phoenix, Ariz., says: Private railroad dispatches received here , say that sixty lives were lost at Clifton yesterday In trie greai. nooa mm through the camp, destroying many business buildings, wrecking the smelting plant of the Arizona Copper Company and tearing out miles of track of the Arizona and Mexico railroad. Clifton, which has about 3.r>00 people, lies In a narrow valley near the eastern line of Arizona. The less prosperous of the inhabitants live in Chase Creek canyon, a peculiarly dangerous situation in times of high water. Two years ago twelve lives were lost in the canyon and Immense damage was done by the rise of the San Francisco river. Half of Town Destroyed. 

PHOENIX, Ariz.. December 5.?T'p to a late hour lust night nothing confirmatory of the Clifton disaster iuiu uru except private dispatches sent from one friend to another. One of these said: "Half of Clifton destroyed. I am O. K." Numerous inquiries have been directed to the scene, but they have been unavailing. It is believed here that a disaster has undoubtedly occurred. Clifton is a town in Graham county, southeastern Arizona. In 1!HM> the population was W4. It is located at the end of a branch of the Arizona and New Mexico railroad, and has a telegraph and express " office. It is built upon the tiank of the Riy San Francisco, a branch of the Salt rlv<T. frr>?ff various Boints in Arizona last night told with no detail that the town had been half destroyed by a cloudburst. Has Sisters in Clifton. i)r. James R. Patterson of 1740 F street northwest called at the Star office this morning to learn the particulars of the dis^ aster. Mr. Patterson has tv - sisters in Clifton, Mrs. A. A. Anderson and Miss Blanche Patterson. He also has two sisters residing with him here, Mrs. Lloyd Irvine and Mrs. Isabel Elridge. who are on the verge of distraction in their anxiety to learn something of the particulars of the disaster. Mr. Patterson said this morning that he had the gravest fears for the whole town. "My brotner-in-iaw, .*?. Kiiunsuu, oam Jlr. Patterson, "Is a business man, and I am sure he would have wired Uo 10 relieve our anxiety if it were possible. "Clifton lies in a basin, and if mere has been such a disaster as is feared there is no telling how many people lost their lives. There was a similar occurrence out there Just about this time last year in which six or eight lives were lost. There was three or four feet of water in some of the houses, and many families had to take to the hills and pass the night. ' Mr. Patterson had made every effort to reach his sisters by wire without success. He said he feared also for other towns in the vicinity. HAU AGAIN REMANDED. Proof of the Death of Frau Molitor is Asked. LONDON, December 5.?Karl Hau, the Washington professor who has been under arrest here since November 7, charged with the murder of Frau Molitor, his mother-in-law. at Haden-Baden, again appeared on remand in the Bow street police court today. The prisoner, who has fully recovered his health, was remanded for another week in order to enable the Merman representatives to obtain further evidence. The magistrate said the evidence already here was sufficient to warrant Hau's extradition, but to make the ease complete it was necessary to have proof ol' the cause of the death of Frail Molitor, which the German authorities had omitted to obtain. Hail, although laboring; under a prr^at mental strain, which lias entirely changed his appearance, was quite calin during the brief proceedings. and at the cl.ise. when asked by his counsel whether he understood what had occurred, lie replicJ affirmatively. SENATE WANTS INFORMATION. Calls for All Reports on the Japanese Question. Without debate the Senate today adopted n resolution calling on the Secretary of lommerce unu i-auor to furnish the Senate | copies of all official letters, telegrams, rej>orts. etc.. filed In the d(|>artment In connection with the Investigation of the matter of Japanese attending the public schools of San Francisco. The resolution was pre?ent -d by Senator Flint of California. _ ? Four Injured, Two Fatally. PITTSBURG. Pa..

The caucus of the democrats of the House last nlsht elected Paul B. Porter of Mississippi to succeed the late Col. Isaac R.

There were half a dozen or more candidates for the place, but tne contest was mainly between Air. Porter and T. J. Appleyurd of Florid*. WILL TEST THE LAW ORDERS RECEIVED IN 'FRISCO ON SCHOOL UESTIO*. SAN FRANCISTO, December 5.?Under direct orders from Washington tho representatives of the Department of Justice in California have been Instructed to begin an action in the courts to test the legality of the state statute which provides that chll dron of Mongolian descent shall attend a separate school. President Allmnn of the board of education yesterday received a communication f rn?vi lTnlto^ GtatflC Attftrnov "DfiVlill T6" questing a conference in order tliat arrangements might be made to institute a suit. I This conference will be held at the rooms of the board this afternoon. When the attention of President Allman was called to that portion of the President's message referring to the Japanese school Question, he said that the utterances of the President on that question would have no ' effect on the action of the board. "We have simply put into effect a law passed by the law-making body of this state," he said. "Individually and collective ly each and every member of the board Believes that it is a good law. We will not recede from the position which we have taken, and believe that our action will' be sustained by public sentiment throughout the state, even if the courts should declare it to be unconstitutional', or a violation of treaty rights." Storm of Protest. That part of President Roosevelt's message dealing with the Japanese has stirred up a storm in San Francisco, and the newspapers reflect the popular feeling on the subject. The Chronicle, which was the first to suggest the exclusion of the Japanese, says: "It is difficult to treat with the respect uic Affir.o rasmrrilpss of the indi UUC IV IIW . --C vidua], the astonishing outburst of the President in that portion of his message which refers to the law of California under which children- of Asiatic parents are taught in public schools of this city. We care nothing whatever for Mr. Roosevelt, but we do desire to at all times speak with respect of the President of the United States. "It is necessary, however, to say that the President has degraded his position by assertions which are untrue, assumptions which have no basis in fact, recommendations which can only excite ridicule, implied threats which he has no nower to execute, all presented In a tone calculated to arouse national and international passion. And the worst of all is that he Is evidently insincere. "The President says "to shut out Japanese from public school? is a wicked absurdity. ' They are not shut out from public schools. That is an untruth. The President demands more power to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. The context shows that his assumption lf? that. ^ the Japanese have a treaty right to enter our schools. There is no basis of fact for j that assumption." 

BURGLARS SCARED OFF. Beat Broker Senseless, But Left Their Loot. NEW YORK. December 5.?Awakened by the sound of a stealthy footstep in his home in East 63d street near 5th avenue early today, Elias Asiel, a broker, found himself confronted with two revolvers held only a few inches from his face. "We'll shoot if you make a squeak," said a voice as the men behind the guns began ] to draw slowly away toward the door of the room. Mr. Asiel did not heed the warning, but, raising himself on his eLbow, shouted for help. In an instant the two men were upon him, raining blows upon his head, and when a servant, who had ] heard the crics, rushed into the room the j broker was lying helpless, on the verge of i insensibility, his pillow soaked with blood. ; The robbers had escaped. i Investigation showed that the burglars j gained entrance to the house by sawing an i inch-thick iron bar, which held a gate guarding the basement door, and then cut- , ting out the glass panel of tfte uoor. A , large amount of gold and silver plate In | the dining room had been gathered and , tied up in two compact bundles, but In , their flight from the house the men did , not have --time to take their booty with them. , So far as can be learned the only reward they gained for their desperate act was a ' few silver knives, forks and spoons which ?thrnat into tholr nnoketa ' n* 1C ^IVUUUV V... r while looting the dining room, and a dozen 1 pearl and sapphire stick pins, which are 1 missing from Mr. Asiel's bed room.

HABBIHAN SYSTEM. Investigation Proposed by the Interstate Commerce Commision. The proposed Investigation of what Is known as the Harriman system of railroads will be the subject of a conference by the Intei-state commerce commission tomorrow. The commission has for some time had the matter of an investigation under advisement because of communications which have reached it alleging that the effect of the alleged combination is to suppress competition. The active work of the Inquiry will be delegated to some responsible persons in whom the commission has full confidence and upon whose report a decision will he reached as to what if any further steps shall be taken. RESOLUTION^GO OVER Blanket Discharge of Colored Troops. IliPAniiflTiAii ia ir*ri> IIMrUnlvltt I IUIM 15 UtblhtU In Absence of Mr. Penrose Senate Postpones Consideration. STATEMENT WILL BE MADE Secretary Taft Will Make Public Tomorrow That Part of His Annual Report Dealing With Affair. The resolutions relative to tine discharge of the negro troops of the 25th Infantrywere called up in the Senate today by otmaior roraKer or umo, who proposed the adoption of his resolution which calls on the Secretary of War for information as a substitute for that of Senator Penrose calling on the President. Senator Warren of Wyoming offered a substitute for both which* was addressed to the President. To this suggestion Mr. Foraker was opposed. lie did not want to disturb the President about the matter. The information he desired was, he said, in the pos session of the War Department and could be obtained there without difficulty. j Senator Penrose was not present, and Mr. Foraker, not desiring to put the resolution of the Pennsylvania senator aside In his absence, asked that his own resolution be considered independently and not as a substitute. Senator I-odge insisted that the Penrose resolution be considered first. Senator Knox asked thai the matter go over, and Mr. Warren suggested that the Senate military committee was to meet tomorrow and would take up the subject. Immediate Consideration Wanted. Mr. Foraker, still insisting on immediate consideration, said it was not usual for committee consideration to be had on a simple call for information. The Vice President ruled that as the resolution had been amended its status was changed, and an objection from any senator would carry the resolution over one day. Mr. Knox made this objection. Mr. Foraker then obtained unanimous consent to amend his resolution and followed this step with a motion for immediate consideration. Before this was acted upon Senator Culberson offered an amendment to the Foraker resolution calling, in addition, for the order issued to Maj. Penrose, in command oi me zoin miantry, a i reeling Hint not tQ MiMr-to the civil Authorities of Te*;w certain members of his command charged with assault to murder and murder. This was accepted by Mr. Foraker, who was about to demand a vote on the question of immediate consideration, wlien Senator Spooner called attention to the fact that Senator Penrose was absent from the city and it was unusual to press matters In which a senator was especially interested in his absence. Mr. Foraker at once accepted this view and after the Warren substitute had been formally offered and read the whole question went over until tomorrow. Secretary Taft's Statement. in consequence or trie criticisms made against the blanket discharge of the entire battalion of the 15th Infantry (colored), Secretary Taft, at the suggestion of the President, has decided to make public tomorrow morning all that part of liis annual report bearing on that subject. The Secretary has not yet completed fhe preparation of his annual report, but expects to do so in about a week or ten days. ^>wing to the general Interest In the subject it was decided to publish the chapter relating to the discharged battalion at once is u scjiuraie uoeumeni Wiinoilt availing the completion of the full report. It 1b understood that Secretary Taft accepts the reports of Inspector Generals Gkirlington and Blocksom as fully establishng the connection of the battalion with the raid and as showing that the entire mem>ership conspired to protect the perpetrators svith full knowledge of their identity. It is admitted at the department that there are no facts In the report that were lot contained in the spocial report previousy issued by the department, but it Is added that Secretary Taft has made a powerful md vigorous defense of the President's ac,1 null. 

COGHLAN RETIRES SUNDAY. rhe Rear Admiral Will Continue in His Command. It was announced at the Navy Department today that Rear Admiral Joseph B. Coghlan, commandant of the New York navy yard, will be transferred to the retired list of the navy on the 9th instant by operation of law on account of age, but that despite his retirement he will continue on active duty in command of the New l'ork navy yard until otherwise ordered.

The length of time he will continue on duty is not specifio/1 hnt It la tVi.it it will Ho until next February, at least, when Capt. Benjamin F. Tilley, now commanding the battleship Iowa, will be promoted to the grade of rear admiral. That will mean that either Captain Tilley will be given the New York yard command or that his promotion will push another officer Into that command. Captain Tilley will be succeeded In command of the Iowa by Capt. Henry McCrea, who has been stationeu at the Washington navy yard for some time as president of the board of inspection. Orders were Issued today for Capt. E. F. Qualtrough to be detached from the Naval War Col>ege at Annapolis to till the vacancy that will be caused by the transfer of Captain McCrea.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., December 5?In a fire that started from an exp'.osion of thousands of paper matches at the match factory of F. A. Rathbun & Co. this morning, eight girls were burned, four of them probably fatally. The others were painfully burned and Injured in their frantic efforts to escape from the building. A sheet of flame swept out and almost covered the second floor, on which there were about fifty girls working. A panic followed and the majority of the girls ran to the stairway. The flames overtook them, and in an instant there was a struggling mass of giris wjm burning nair ana aresses on me stairway. The girls fought to reach a placa of safety. Several of tiie girls were penned in like sheep on the side of the room opposite the stairway, and when the flames settled over them they threw themselves out of the windows. The girls who jumped are Helen Stapp, Lulu Breedlove and Lizzie Richards. There were many acts of hero ism among tlie girls. wnen tney r^acnea a place of safety they began figiiting the lire that burned each other's clothing. The flames were checked and prevented from spreading to compounds which would have wrecked the building by explosions. NEW OFFICE BUILDING PLANS FOR THE NORTHEAST COR NER OF 15TH AND F STREETS. It is understood that Sir. W. O. X. Scott, who controls the property at the northeast corner of 15th and F streets, is giving consideration to a. i>iojec t for erecting on that site a tail building which will be suitable, at least as far an the upper floors are concerned. for office purposes. r,,u" " ? -1 > -> nnnnnlcrl :t v.lfrl ti. n im - i Ht* glUU'iU iKJ -Vi UV.<_u^?v? v y w . -prise a frontage of fifty feet on lotli str ,-et and sixty feet orj F street.

COUNTESS WILL PAY SHE WILL SETTLE LEGITIMATE CASTELLANE INDEBTEDNESS. " ' s' PARIS, December 5.?The reply of Maitre Cruppi, counsel for Count Boni dc Castel lane and the former countess in tlie suit of their creditors, consumed the entire session of the tribunal of first instance of the Seine today. M. Cruppi described how the tradesmen's and usurers' bills had been cleverly mixed up, and reiterated the perfect willingness of Madame Anna Gould to settle the legitimate debts, although a delay was necessary, as there were 110 funds from the trustee of the estate at her disposal at r.i /"'/ii.ne,,! >. that it n'ae liniiict yicscxL. .. and illegal to attempt to make Madame Gou'd responsible for the enormous sums borrowed by Count Boni of usurers to meet his "mad extravagances and princely prodigality." PROMOTIONS OF DIPLOMATS. Henry White Will Go to Paris and Lloyd Griscom to Rome. Henry White, American ambassador to Home, will be transferred in the near future from that post to Paris, where he will succeed Robert S. J Cormick as ambassador. Mr. White will be succeeded at Rome by I. ioyd C. Griscom, now American am- I bassador to Brazil. Mr. White Is now In Washington. It is stated that beyond these changes the President lias not definitely settled upon the persons who are to be appointed to fill the vacancies caused by the promotions and exchanges. The name of Chas. Par:-* Bryan of Illinois, the minister to Portugal, has been mentioned in connection with the post of ambassador to Brazil, which will be vacated by the promotion of Mr. Griscom to Rome. Mr. Bryan was formerly minister to Brazil, and his assignment to Portugal was in the nature of a promotion. Now it happens that as the Brazilian post has since been raised to the rank of an embassy his return to ikio would likewise be a decided promotion. Une vacancy at St. Petersburg, which will result from the transfer of Ambassador Meyer to the cabinet, will probably bo filled by the promotion of a person now In the dlolomatic service with the rank of minister, though the change will not be made until next spring, in order to await the retirement from the cabinet of Secretary Shaw and the transfer to the treasury of Postmaster General Cortelyou, which will afford the necessary place for Mr. Meyer. 

EMPLOYING CHILD LABOR. Measure Designed to Prevent It Introduced by Mr. Lodge. Senator Lodge today introduced a bill designed to prevent the employment of child labor by prohibiting interstate commerce in any article In the production, of which a child under fourteen years of age has been employed, and the prohibition extends to children under sixteen years of age who cannot read and write. The violation of the law is made a misdemeanor punlshal 'i by fine of $500 and imprisonment for one ., c-ar. opeuiimy ui um uiu Dt-n<tiur paiu: "There is great interest in the question in my own state, where we have had f^r a long time excellent laws on the statute books forbidding the employment of ihild labor, and In the last three or four years the matter has been very much discussed in Massachusetts, especially by Governor Guild, who has been most earnest in advocating some national regulation." OUT OF POLITICS. Justice Harlan Has No Thought of Engaging In a Contest. When asked by the Associated Press today for an expression regarding the discussion of his possible candidacy next year for the governorship of Kentucky, Justice Harlan of the Supreme Court of the United States promptly answered that he "had no such thought, nor any purpose to In any form engage in political con tea Lb at any time or in any way." INQUIRY JJNDER1* Investigation of Recent Accident on Southern Railway. HEARING AT LOCAL OFFICE 1 Operator Mattox, Charged With Negligence, in Attendance. HE DECLARES HIS INNOCENCE Col. Andrews to Act as President of Company Until Successor is Named. An investigation was begun this forenoon at the offices of the Southern Railway Company in this city to determine officially the cause of the wreck last Thursday. in which President Spencer and seven others lost their lives. Operator G T. Mattox. who has been held responsible for the disaster, was present, as was Operator Jacobs, who is stationed at lawyers, Va.. and both testified. The hearing began at 11 o'clock before Mr. C. H. Ackert, ^ourth vice president of the company and general manager of the road, and Mr. E. H. Coapman, general superintendent of the northern district of the Southern railway. The Investigation was held behind closed doors, in the office of the fourth vice president, and all the testimony was recorded stenographically. All the employes of the railway who had anything to do with the handling of the two trains that were in the collision are here and will give their testimony. Operator Muttox asserts he did not let train No. 37 into the block until he had been given a clear track by the operator at .Lawyers, the next signal tower beyond. Operator Jacobs of Lawyers denies statements of Mattox. and declares that he re ceived no report of the movements of train No. 33, which was struck by the Atlanta express. Col. A. B. Andrews, first vice president, will act as president of the Southern until a successor to the late President Spencer It elected. The hearing was still in progress at a late hour this afternoon and officials of the Southern say the findings will not be given out until tomorrow. Telegraphers Here as Witnesses. The two young telegraph operators, G. D. Mattox, who was stationed at Rangoon, and R. J. Jacobs, whose post of duty was at Lawyers, came to this city last night over the Southern railway. Although the men traveled on the same train there was no cumKuinleaJtUm between them and they did not meet face to face lititfl they appeared before the Investigating commission today. lOach man was accompanied by friends. Tills keeping apart was no doufbt due to the fact that in their former statements each had accused the other of being responsible for the wreck with Its fearful consequences. Mattox went directly from the depot to a boarding place at 20 Pennsylvania avenue last night, and soon thereafter retired, declining to be interviewed. Just before taking the train for Washington yesterday he Is reported to have said he would make a full and complete statement at the hearing, without the slightest reservation. He asserts that he Is In no way to blame for the wreck in which President Samuel Spencer lost his life, and that the fault Is all with Operator Jacobs. Mattox claimed that Jacobs permitted the second train to pass Into the block before the first had cleared. Jacobs says that Mattox did not report to him that No. 33 had passed on to his block. Failed to See Signal. i The statement was made at Lynchburg yesterday. It Is reported, that owing to the twilight Engineer McKinney, who was running No. 87, did not see the light of the flagman from train No. 33, and that the flair man threw his lantern at the engine as it passed. At this instant the emergency brake was applied, but too late to avoid the collision. It is claimed that the accident occurred at an hour when It was too light to see the lantern and too dark to dlstinsruish th? i flagman's signal. Some railroad men believe the investigation wlH develop that Mattox's action made the wreck possible, and that the flagman wag late in hurrying < back to warn the oncoming train. Mattox has never been arrested, nor has any charge been placed against htm. This has been Impossible, owing to the laws of \ irginla, which do not make criminal negli- . gence a felony. Otherwise It 1s probable that he would have been taken into custody , some time ago. The operator at Lawyers, R. J. Jacobs. ' appears to be about twenty-three years of ; age, and has remained at his key since the wreck, while It Is said Mattox has not Deen Oil uuiy biiujc inaim^giviug uttj, wneu the disaster occurred. Jacobs did not de- 1 nounce Mattox, but is reported to have ' said: 1 "I was on duty Thanksgiving morning, he said. I never received word that train No. 33 was in the block. I got the report from Mattox that train 37 had entered. When this was reported the thought occurred to me: 'Where is 33?' Naturally I thought No. 33 had been set out some place and that No. 37 had been run around her. > "Then I heard of the wreck. That was the first I knew that No. 33 was In the block. I never received word that the train having President Spencer's car at/ XT ,)r>\ J 

ICVCUCU V (Ml) UOU CUIC1CU IIIJ* U1VMJR, {11111 as It was the duty of Mattox to noOfy mo when she passed him, It is plain that I am In no way to blame." Independent Inquiry. A reoort has been received from Riehmand to the effect that the Virginia state corporation commission is preparing to make an exhaustive Independent inquiry Into the causes leading- up to the wreck. Officials of the road and Operators Mattox and Jacobs have been summoned to appear. H. C. Ackert. third vice president, 1 has been called, and will* be rpnnim/i tn bring the other necessary witnesses with ] him. , Col. Joseph E. Wlllard of the commis- ( sion said yesterday that no daite had been < set for the Investigation. He added that | it would not result in any criminal pro- , ceedlng# against any person, or the railroad company, so far as the commissioners are concerned. An effort will be made to arrive at the responsibility of the Southern.

ALGEOIRAS TREATY DEMOCRATS NAME CONDITIONS FOR SUPPORT OF IT. Whether democratic senators shall support the Alceoiras trr?tv' In relAtlrm to Moroccan affair; when it is voted upon In-, the Senate December 12, will depend upon the fate of a resolution to bo presented disclaiming the responsibility of the United States for the convention and declaring that the participation of this government Is only In furtherance of its general policy of 1/iviuuiiuK yeuce ana in ine interest 01 lis commercial relations with Morocco. The Senate committee on foreign relations today considered the treaty, and ordered that It be favorably reported to the Senate. This action was taken, however, after a committee consisting of Senators Spooner, I^odge and Bacon had be?>n named to phrase a resolution which would declare that the United States had no intention of interfering in the regulation of Kuropean internal affairs. Senator Bacon insisted .that a resolution of that character should be submitted to the Senate, and in his statement to the committee said that such a declaration would be the only way in which we could consistently defend our right to be considered supreme in the western hemisphere. The contest in the Senate over the treaty will be close in the event that a disclaimer of the character outlined is not adopted. The United States is exempted from the responsibility of enforcing tile treaty through a reservation made by Ambassador ..hlte, f hp Amoricon ,1 5 ? : : - uviv6aic, in &>iguuig tut; aci. Democratic senators argue that if the I7nit(-d States is not to take a hand in the enforcement of the act, then this government should not take responsibility for its enactment. EXTENSION OF SMOKE LAW. Bill to Include Railroads in the District. Representative Sinrms of Tennessee, a member of the House District committee, will introduce a bill tomorrow extending the provisions of the local smoke law to railroads in the District. A bill that went over to the Senate last session had this amendment on It, but the proposition is still sleeping at the other end of the Capitol. Mr. Simms does not see why railroads should have any more privileges than local firms who have been "Jacked up" for violation of the law and he Intends to push this bill along. "I just managed to scrape through the gate," said Mr. Simms after the locomotive smoke had blown away. "The contest down in my district was so close that It took the official count to settle the matter, but praise the I^ord, here I am again." CONGRESSMEN'S SALARIES. Mr. Littauer's Proposed Bill for an Increase. Representative Llttauer of New York will introduce a bill In a few days which he will offer In the nature of an amendment to the legislative measure Increasing the salaries of members of Congress to $7,500 a year.- Mr. Littauer will voluntarily retire from tfc?'i?ouBe at the close of the present flAOolAn '?" ' ... .xiM ou lie ueueves that he can, with perfect propriety, offer such an amendment. There has been some little talk around the Capitol this session, as usual, about the hard lot of a member of Congress and the vast amount of real money it costs him in addition to his little Btipend of $5,000 to get along down hero at the national capital. But there does not seem to be any general sentiment in favor of an increase. In fact, a number of representatives who were asked about it this morning, said they would be very glad to vote for a 1)111 to abolish all salaries to ....uuno ?nu representatives, but would both speak and vote against any proposition to increase compensation. It is Mr. Littauer's indention to offer the amendment and then let members do what they want with it. 

EXPOSITION BILLS. To Advance Date of Opening and a Loan of $1,000,000.

VIEWS AT THE CAPITOL Opposition to Interference With Sail Francisco. CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES Representative Jenkins Analyzes tht Obligations of Treaties?Senator Rayner's Argument. Republicans and democrats, northerner? and southerners, radicals and conservatives, In the House of epresentativea seem to be generally of the opinion that San Francisco should be permitted to man. ago her own schools. It has been a lung time since the once white-hot question of str.tes rights has been discussed so generally under the dome. Today that portion, of the President's message dealing witli the Japanese situation on the Pan Francisco school problem has been discussed all over the House side of the Capitol, in committee rooms, in corridors, and, In a qui"t way, on the floor itself. Save for a few, among them Representative McOall of Massachusetts. It seems to be the consensus of opinion that the national government has but little reason to even consider the question of interference In connection with the San Francisco Japanese controversy. View of Representative Jenkins. Representative Jenkins of Wisconsin, chairman of the judiciary committee of tlie House, a conservative, a good lawyer and a man well thought of on both sides of the chamber, has given considerable thought tc the subject and today he made the following statement of the case to a Star re porter: "Primarily," said Judge Jenkins, "it might be said that the entire school question is under the absolute control of thn state by virtue of the police power unle?? interfered with by the treaty-making power. Unquestionably a treaty can bo made covering and including the question, but It is not for me to say whether tho treaty does or does not cover and include It. Thi.t is for the administration to de'ermine until the courts decide. There is no sensa or Justification In talking war. It is worse than silly. It is cruel and unamerlcan. We do not know enough about it to even express an opinion. All the facts are not before th? public, and I apprehend that but few have carefully considered the law. The people can implicitly trust President Roosevelt. He Is big enough to defend the honor and dignity of the nation and at the same time will do all In his pov. er to avert war and will be fully equal t.? the occasion. "I am not a states-right man in the sense in which it is ordinarily understood. but there is no man In the country more tenacious about the rights of the state nnder the Constitution than I am. i nquesnon.iDiy me ripnts or the state under the Constitution will be carefully looked after. So far this nation, as I understand it. has not any cause for complaint and should wait for some overt fact or declaration of war. If any trouble arises it will be from our dual systa-n of government. "If the question Is not covered by treaty Japan has no couse for complaint, for In a case of this kind, if not covered by treaty, the nation cannot be held responsible for the action of the state, acting within its sovereign powers. If the question is covered by treaty, this nation must abide by treaty stipulation or violate them at the risk of war. Constitutional Provision. "The Constitution provides that the President shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to mak? treaties, providing two-thirds of the sena? tor? present concur. "The power to make treaties Is con? ferred In general terms. There is no limitation in the words creating the power. "And the Constitution has p>aced no liml tation on this general power. The Constitution strengthens the power oy providing that all treaties made or which shall b? made under the authority of the Uniteil States shall be the supreme law of the land and the Judges in every state shall be bouni thereby, anything in the Constitution of any laws of ar.y state to the contrary notwithstanding. ' Unquestionably the treaty may contain anything known to international law If the subject has not been considered elsewhere by the Constitution."

IIIC auuj'iV.1, CIO ivr|/i^o*,iiLainc uvunui^ views it. but from some of t. e talk around the Capitol it is apparent that a good m:iny members believe that there simply isn't any question about the violation of treaty obligations and that in their judgment the President had no reason to make, as one representative It, "a veiled threat" against California. State's rights are sitting up and taking notice today. Senator Rayner's Argument. It is expected that Senator Rayner will speak in the Senate In a few days, the text of his remarks to be that part of tlio President's message referring to the Japanese. Mr. Rayner's resolution, published in yesterday's Star, sets forth the ground that he will take, which is. In the first place, that the Japanese treaty does nut cover the point at all and that there is nothing in u, oy any construction or interpretation, that can be made to apply to the right of Japanese ?o any educational privileges in California or any other place. His second point is that although the fitli article of the Constitution provides that laws ca,n be made In pursuance of the Constitution treaties can be made under the authority of the United States. His contention will be that there Is no difTe renew whatever between these two clauses and that the "authority of the United States" la equivalent to saying "under the Constitution of the United States." The third section of the resolution calls for the opinion of the Senate upon the proposition to instruct the President to notify the government of Japan and any other foreign government with whom the Question may arise that we have no federal jurisdiction over the school systems of the United States. < The contention here will evidently be that the tenth article of the Constitution, which reserves to the states all powers not dele gated to the federal government, carries ftith it the anrtemu of education that ara in vogue in the different states, and that a treaty that would invade this province of the state would vio4ato the Constitution. Although it has been held that one need not look the Constitution for authority to make a treaty, he will contend that it bM been consistently held that no treaty
