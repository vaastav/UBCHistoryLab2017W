THE WEEKLY DEMOCRAT- Thursday, December 7th, i871. Valedictory. With this weeks mstie termi nates my connection as Editor with the Kiiton Weekly Demo crat. It) Lidding adieu to the Readers of the Democrat, I feel conscious of having performed my entire duty never swerving from the line. I had markod out In the bpginuing to ever defend the interests of the party, and people at large, and I sincerely hope the same cordial and will ing hand will bo extended to the in commiug Editor, Mb. L. G. Gould, as has been extended to words myself, their is but one way to the success of the Dem ocrat, and that lays with your selves, to Rally around your standard bearer, and give it that support which is due to yourself and 1he party. - It has been ever xny policy while editing the Democrat, to defend the true in terests of the people by exposing corruption and crime wherever found, give strict and prompt at tention to tho welfare and inter ests of our town, to encourage en terprise and instil vigor and ac tion Into the minds of the citizens to keep up with the tim s. F. T. Foster. To Our Old Patrons. After years of absence, we again return to the control of the "Eaton Democrat." Since our connection with the paper, many changes have taken place with in the political world, through sit of which the Democratic par ty .has passed unscathed, and stands, to-day, the only true and unflinching friend of a' Republi can form of government. We in tend to print a Democratic sheet, i 4-Via efii nt a r r j n 4 a A0ftiAa. 1 6ion; not advocating impractica bilities, but dealing with living issues os they now stand. The war haa changed the stat us of the colored race, and for tunately for the nation the negro has been removed out of politics, except so far as his social rela tions are concerned. All the an tecedents of the rebellion, we shall give the go-by, and deal in no acerimonies of the past; but in politics, advocate a conserva tive course, and endeavor to heal sectional strife. The Democrat will sustain a republican form of government, and advocate the true interests of the laboring classes, as against the intrigues of corrupt money ed circles, land grabs and protec tive tariffs. If there be one in terest in tho government which should be more cared for than another, it is productive labor; for from this source the nation derives all its wealth. We will therefore advocate the interests of the laboring classes, and our paper shall come to them as an especial friend. The usurpation of power, by both the Executive and Legisla tive branches of our government, will be opposed, and the "Demo crat" will advocate a return to ancient land marks. In this re- ppect we shall insist that the sovereignty of the government resides within the people; and that all office-holders are but their agents, with powers dele gated, for the time being, on the express condition to be used for the benefit of tho people, and not for their own exclusive advan tage, as ha3 been the case for many years; and that this princi ple is applicable to both the na tional and State government; and that so far as the sovereignty of the people is concerned, no Ex ecutive or Legislature can by any act whatever, permanently im pair or take it away, to their in jury; but that the people, th rough their representatives, have an in licrent right to peaceably change or modify all such injurious acts and legislation. We shall further advocate that under the Constitution, the Na tional Government has 110 right to impair the legitimate powers of .the State government; for such a course would inevitably lead to a central despotism. . The. State governmeLts were intended by our ancestors, to act as so, many wholeKome checks to a central ization of power in the Federal government. Of late years, there has been a fearful tendency on tho part of the national govern ment to dwarf and over-ride the State governments; and if the;peo- ple ever lose their liberties, the primary cause will come from this quarter. We do not intend to publish an old Hue partisan sheet, but do intend to pursue 6iich a liberal and conservative course, that all men who love their country and are opposed to corruption in offi cial stations, whether National State or County, can cordially unite in its support. VVe pro pose to interest the Democrat in the local affairs of the town and county, but not in an invidious or sermonising manner to the pre judice of any one; and for this purpose a column or two will be set apart each week. In a word, we intend to make the Democrat a family news-paper, and invite pioneer sketches, reminiscenses of the West, incidents and acci dents, communications on all scientific and literary subjects, from all parts of the county. L. G. GOULD. Meeting of Congress. In accordance with one of 'fixtures' of our country, the For ty Second Congress of the Uni ted States, assembled in Wash ington City ou Monday last. Af ter the appointment of the sever al committees, the President's Message was read in silence to that august body, and ordered to be printed. It is not a very lengthy document, and reflects credit upon those who assisted "Useless'' in composing it. The important points in the docu ment are "a recommendation that the tariff and revenue be modified, and that all - internal txes, except on spirits, tobacco and luxuries," be abolished a suggestion in behalf of' the es tablishment of a postal, telegra- pointtijentsin the navy above the rank of Captain be made by se lection, and not by seniority a recommendation for the re moval of disabilities imposed up on the people of the South by the Fourteenth Amendment, ex cept upon those whom he terms the worst criminals tho attens tion of Congress is directed to the fishery question brief refer ence is made to the Cuban ques tion and the recent ill treatment of American residents in the Island of Cuba by the Spanish authorities, and he announces authoritatively that polygamy will be tolerated no more under the cloak of religion speaks fa vorable of the preseut economi cal, just and Christian method of treating our Indian bauds, and recommends a Territorial Gov ernment for Indian Territority, and economy in land grants. The Message disappointed both friends and enemies of the Presi dent. His friends at his change ot front about amnesty and his enemies at the occasional streak of common sense glimmering through it. It will be found in full on our outside. gWA. colored convict, by the name of Bell, in the Ohio Penis tentiary, confessed to the killing of Mrs. S. A. Ormsby, in Spring field, Ohio, on the morning of the I6th, o( July, 1869. He was sentenced eixteen years for burg lary, and has served three of them. It is thought the Gover-: nor will pardon Bell and he will bo taken to Springfield and tried for murder. There is nothing astonishing in the Radicals not voting for the most eminent negro in the East. Their professed love for the ne gro is hollow hearted sycophan cy; and while the base wretches are howling negro suffrage and negro equality, secretly they de spise tho nation's pets, and re fuse to support them for otlice. Hypocrites, all? j36 Gov. Palmer receives the earnest support of Senator Trum bull in his late action in regard to the Chicago trouble. We also understand that John A. Logan gives his unqualified support. 'Xcxt." S The School Seat Manufactory and several other local matters, will be atten ded to in our next. Mr. Fish Threatens. It is reported in Washington that in consi quence of the late outrages committed by the Span iards in Cubd,both on defenseless Cubans in the interior and on Spaniards,. Cubans and foreign ers alike in the cities, a note has been addressed to Don Hamilton Fish to his colleague, Don Maui ioio Lopez Roberta, the Spanish Minister, in which interference is threatened unless a stop is put by Spain to such outrages. liad a note of this nature ema nated from any other pen than that of Den Hamilton, we should hail it with joy as the inevitable preieurser of the -er3' speedy de livereueeof the United States from an enormous disgrace, and Cuba from the yoke of her opres isor. But Mr. Fish bus barked so often and never bitten, that his threat has become a standard joke among the Havana volun teers. Over two years he distinctly said to Spain: " Accept my terms or I will give the Cubans the rights of belligerency." Morales Lcmus, the then Cuban Minister, told him before he sent his ulti matum that Spain would neitii er agree to his terms nor reject them, whereupon the Secretary scoffed at .he idea that he could be humbugged by any one. But not only weie he and bis repre sentative in Madrid, General Sickles, cajoled by the Spaniards, but the latter has been oblieged publicly to declare tlio fact, htut ing in his letter to Mr Bivero that the United Stales Govern ment refrained from interfering in the affairs of Cuba because the Spanish Cabinet pledged itself that island should be treated as an equal providence of Spain. Of course it is not the existence of the Cuban revolution that has prevented the fulfilement of this promise. The neighboring island of Porto Rico has never revolted, but the benefits of the Spanish Constitution of 1869' have been withheld from that island also, simply because the Havana vol unteers require it. But as if to si lence any question as to the in tention of the Spanish Govern ment in the means used to pre vent American interference in Cuban matters two years ngo, its subsided organ in this city open ly asserts that Gener.'.l Sickles should be recalled for daring to meddle with .the internal affairs of Spain; that if Phil. Shcrrann, or Becerra made any such prom ises.as thoe referred to by Gin. -Siekles, tlny-tlid o irhTrgf Vn thority; and finally, that Spain has a perfect right to tr at. her uolouies as she pleases, whether such conduct is agreeuble -or not to the American Government. However, Mr. Fish knows full well that Spain i-i utterly nntible to repress the outrages of the volunteers; and vet, at this elev enth hour, he addresses threat to a power which officially boasts of having deluded him. and which - is perfectly jnstifiid in laughing at the fact. Far Better or Worse. That beautiful specimen of a Prosecuting Attorney, whom the people defeated - and sent a wiz zing from office, has made up hia mind to emegrute to Cincin nati, to studv LAW. But if he is not , careful he might as he once said ''be corn-swob bled, poor fellow, what a loss it will be 10 eociciy in jviuion wnen lie is cone Blaekstone and Swan will suffer terrible. In trying to edu cate that swelled cranium good by, leave a lock of hair before vou tro and carrv of the In dictment bills. Is it So. There appears to be rumor on our Streets started by those who do not wisu to aid the School Desk Company fund, that they intend to open a Grocery store to sup ply their hands. We hope that the Company will deny this and thrust the lie upon those it be longs. We did not think their was a man eo mean in Jaton, as to start a Calumny against this enterpise, and if he don't intend to aid it, let him hold his peace and not endeavor to keep others frooa so doing. A man who is op posed to enterprise and the de velloping the interests of the town m which he lives, is not a useful citizen. And just as long as such people remain, so long it will stick in the mud.
