It seems to lie expected of every pa per, city or local, largo or small, to give at least a fair synopsis of the President's annual message. But to do so even approximately in the Journal would crowd out all other reading mat ter and local news. Knowing that our readers would much dislike to have our Stalwart President's message take up all our available space, we concluded to givo it in the form of a supplement and let each ouo have his own conclu sions about it. We may still have some comments to make upon it at a later period, but have not the time, nor are we in just the exiet humor to do so now. Suffice it to say that we take no stock at any price in President Arthur. In order to off-set tho dry and prosy message of the President, we cbncluded to print our own annual message on the other side cf oor Supplement. Our message differs widely from Arthur's, but we shbinit to the inteligent people ofthe United States whether ours is not the plainer, more pointed and practi cal document of the two. Our sug gestions and recommendations are not hid and lost in a multiplicity of words, but will be readily understood by all. Neither are we soexculsiveand tipish as to address ourselves to a select class of senators and congressmen only: we speak to all —wether senator, congress man or plain citizen. In one other point our message has a most dec id I'd advantage over President Arthur's— it is brief. "Brevity is the soul of tcrt." Arthur's message has neither brevity nor wit, and least of all—soul—in it. We know what people like to read, es pecially at this festive season. Ait bur don't—and that's the difference be tween Arthur and tee. Le win's Clothing, Lewiu's Clothing, Lewiu'a Clothing, Is the best, Is the best, Is the best, Anil the cheapest, And the cheapest.
