g Death of Horace Greeley. NEW YOEE, November 2S.-The. Tri bune, this morning, says :. " We arc deep lv pained .to say that hi the last thirty six hoars Hr. Greeley's condition bas greatly changed for the worst. Through yesterday he remained nearly all th** time unconscious.' In a counsel ol' some of the most eminent physicians bf the city, only one was without hope, but all regarded the case as critical aud alarming." NEW YORK, November SO-The ac counts published of Mr Greeley's last moments represent him to have been con scious. During the* day. as is usual in cases of inflammation of the bruin, his ?hysical suffering was extremely slight, >ut increased and a morbid a-tion of the mind waa evident from exterior manifes tations. He was asked " Do you know that yon aro dying ?" Without tremor or emotion he answered, " Yes.1' Agnin when asked if he recognized Mr. Reid, he looked up with immediate recognition, lifting his hand, grasped Mr. Reid's feebly and said distinctly, "Yes." . ' His last words were, " It is done." Ks face hardlv. changed, only seithng a little into a look of perfect peace. The Tribune says: "The melancholy death of the editor and founder of the Tribune, though ter a few days it had been expected by his family and intimate friends, fell upon us with alf tho* stapes oli sudden calamjtv. He had Cached rndfed; a ripe old age, but time uhdi not? hiid Hr withered touch upon him. His splendid eonstitwtion oa?ily bore the strain of enor mous labor. His mimi was as fresh and strong and suggestiv.? a?*in the prime of . life. His generous impulses were nnehill ed by disheartening experience tl rjugh the trying Jouipaign just clo-ed. ' His. physical vigor, his tact, his intellectual ac tivity, surprised even those who knew him .best, asd seemed to premise many yean? of usefulness. It is certain that no histo ry of the must critical period in nationa bte can be written in which Horace Gree ley shall not be a oonspicious figure. But the noblest career in his eyes was that which is given up to others' wants. The successful life was that which is worn ou in conflict wjth wrong ami woe. The only ambition, worth following, ir?s the ambi tion to alleviate bumau misery and leave the world apitoie better than he found ir That he had done it, wa? the consolation which bnghtened his hist days and asaur ed him.he had not lived in vain. " It is not for us, in the first hour of our loss, to paint bis character cr catalogue,his virtues. AJtbougb for several inonibs.we have missed the '?naprriitjon of ?B'-pr?s ence and the guidance of his wise counsel his spirit has never ceased to animate those chosen to continue his works, and the close bond of sympathy between the chiel and his assistants has never been broken. We leave his praises to the poor whom he succored-to the lowly, whom he lifted up-to the slave, whose back be saved from tho lash.-to. the oppressed, whose, wrongs he im><?e>his own.'* ! The IIeraid;\ii?ta editorial upon Gree ley, says : " He ha?, in a mistaken aspira tion for a higher field of usefulness and power and glory than journalism, fallen a sacrifice to his political ambition. He had failed to appreciate the commanding posi tion which he had secured as a hading American journalist, and leaving it to pursue the ignis fatuus of the Presiden cy, he dropped the substance for the shad ow of a great distinction. Otherwise, the history and the eaduring rewards cf Mr. Greeley'* industrious and useful career are full of encouragement to youug men who, without capital, personal influence or pow erful friends, have the battle of life before ihem."

WASHINGTON, November 27. The President, in conversation to-day, again declared that hi intended to inaugu r?t*1 no particular line of policy towards the South, as had been reprts-n'ted, unless it was embodied in tho cartful considera tion of applications for the pardou ol' the Ku-Klux prisoners. He hal already pardoned one, and ahould probably pardon more, though he intended no general jail delivery. He thought that where the neighbors of th^e. Kn-Kluxprisocers ap plied for pardon and' represented the aver age sentiment of the community, all ap plications should be promtply acted upon ; but to favor a general release of that ele ment would, in his opinion, be a virtual admission, thai they had been improper iv convicted, or thar the law under which Uley were .imprisoned was unnecettfaryi Tai- Late Fire on Erliste Islam!.

A quantity of loose cotton which was lying in her lap ignited from the m.itch and communicated th? flames to her cloth ing, and thence to the cotton heaps around her. At rh.U time there were MJtV-titree women and two men, all negroes, at work in the mot ing room. In the confusion which billowed many caught on fire, and a number of rim women were very serious Iv burned.

C., Dec ?, 1873. lie Tournament and Ball of the Pal metto Sabre Club. In our li rsc announcement of the Tour amentand Ball ot* th* Palmetto Sabre Jlub, we predicted they would prove uch a* brilliant and joyous occasion as Sdgefield had not known since long bo oro the war. And so it turned out to ho letter. Major. W. T. Gary, President >f tbe Club, and bis Comniittee-nien and issistants had worked like men in ear ie8t, and when the day came, all was io arranged as to insure that the first/eie >f the Club should bo an honor and i triumph. The mornipg dawned bright, but in tensely cold, and with a sharp and cut ting wind. . But this deterred no one. By ll o'clock all Edgefield, within ten miles of tho town, was gathered upon the field-the ladies brilliantly dressed in the height of the gorgeous styles now In vogue. At about noon, the Club, spcndldly mounted and In full uniform, repaired to ike scene. They were pre ceded by their honored guest*, a,depu tation from the Augusta Sabre, Club, Ly Brand's celebjated Columbia band making the air peal with martial music the while. Soon after their arrival, Gen!. John D; Kennedy of Camden, /that dis tinguished soldier of the late war, moun ted upon a powerful bay, waa introduced to the Club, drawn up in line before him, ?nd proceeded to make them the foilow hgi^eautiful address : Gentlemen of the Palmetto Sabre Club :'" ' In response to the very kind Invitation bf the Ladles of ytfur County, I ?ni here to-day lo represent them In this most in teresting ceremony ; and although con tclQus of my inability to do justice to them or it, I bring to the task a willang rad appreciative heart,. The nleasure is enhanced by the fact that I stand Iii the midst of comrades and sons of comrades, and have an opportunity of looking upon: the bornes of those whose gallantry ir th 3 field prepared me to behold the cul tivation and refinement bf their hearth stones.- The scene here presented re minds me of the peering forth of the sun iinld dark and lowering clouds when the stor m has wrapped the heavens in its sombre mantle. It is a rift in the darkened- sky. which overcasts us ; and be~day, surrounded by the beauty of pb?r tirne-honored District, we feel that there is life In the old land yet ; and that there is much,- aye, very much, to live, ict, and hope for yet. The tempest has for vean, lashed ita fury about us ; dark, rollfng"clouds h?ve obscured our horizon ind hidden from us every landmark.' But this scene is a beacon-light .which meera the soul and nerves the heart mew. And, my friends, it is no mean ingless ceremony or empty pageant, but lias a moral which points a truth and illustrates a principle. It is an evidence' 3f your elastic spirits under the depres dons of these sad davs ; of your frater nal, social spirit in banding yourselves together. It is a proof of mutual good Aili andan augury of better times; it shows clearly that you have the courage which defies, adversity, and that you dare tb hold up your heads and be nien. And standing to-day ou thin classic soil, with the memories of the past clustering ?ibout ns, and- methinks,' the spirit.? ot statesmen and soldiers hovering .around ns, and with this throng of devoted, lovely women beaming lipon us with their heavenly smiles, and sending you Ellis ottering of their infection, woven by their own delicate hands, the symbol not )f gory warfare, bbt a tribute Of their ippreciation of your endurance of the woes you have antlered, andu harbinger sf your future prosperity, what theme ls there more appropriate for me than, is brierly as possible, t ) call to your at tention two of those characteristics which bave iu the past made South Carolina what she was ; and which, though foes may deride, ?nd vainly iu their hearts uf beaYts wish to emulate, are yet, under diff?rent auspices, to redeem and save ber. And I deem this particularly ap propriate, aa the representative of these lair donors, who are to-day truer to their dear old Mother, hi her hour Of calamity ind affliction, than they were even when ?he stood proud among the. proudest in wealth, prosperity and peace! .' One or these characteristics ia devotion to duty. The history of South Carolina is one corruscation of this virtue-a de votion which knew no measuro, counted no cost. Turn to every page of that his tory, ami there you fiud it beaming with the steady ray of the North Star. You <eo it in the patriots of tho Revolution who dared to rebel against unjust aud tyrannical usurpation of power, and left, is monuments uf their devotion, King's Mountain, Eutaw, and Camdem. It ??irred tho hearts of her noble sons who planted this Palmetto on tho gates of Mexico. And it was this that fired the ??ou?s of old men and boys, matrons and maidens, iu the late war, and ou a hun dred field?added undying lustre to the irlury of Sooth Carolina. It was this Chat glorified tho sacrifice of Bee and Jenkins, and wreathed with a beautiful bale thje dyjng brow of. Bland. Amid the urumbljrijf ruins of Sumter, on the itonn-swept heights of Gettysburg, ?dong ivery slope or plain, wherever duty call id, her sous ru ?lied to thc slaughter. This it was that made her private soldiers, the real heroes ol every field, endure hun ger, fatigue, exposure, whether in the ?nows of winter or heats of summer. And tUttM Jowly njounds scattered from ihe Pommau to'the Mississippi are silent but eloquent mementoes pr jhcjr tovo tion to duty. This it was that enthused clio intellect of Calhoun; inspired the tongues of Hayne, McDutlio and Pres i?n ; and lilied to overflowing tho states manship and patriotism of Pickens. Time would fad to speak of tho noble ?ons of your own gallant District, whose memories are household word*. An at tempt to enumerate some might do in itiative to others. This devotion tn duty was exemplified in their every act and ?paled with tiieir hearts blood. And certainly there never was a Mme when South Carolina more demanded tills virtue of hersons than now. Tire past is gon.e save in its remembrances ind influences. Living under a new ??der of things, with new-duties and re ?ponsl hil ?ties, she calls upon -her sons to .iseto tho e^icencjes of the situation; ind, while bowing to the inevitable, and iceopting for her good so much as be leoMwary for that good, yet f > bo true, ?arnest. devoted, and, aboyo ul I things, nire and unsullied, not doing aught that vonld deprado their manhood or falsify mr record for honesty, Integrity and rirtue.

This week we have tim? to mention but ono or "two of ita salient points. It refers to the ;,GenevaMarbitr&tipr4; of tho Alabama Claims and its satisfactory results, which-have left the two Govern ments, America and England, without a shadow on their friendly relations. ".Referring to Eu Klux disorders, the President does not say thore shall be too move of the tyrannical arrests ami per sooutioris of white people in the1 South;' wbicli have disgraced the U. S. gov?rn' "mont for two years past, but.simply ex presses tho.conviction that "under the obvious advantages of good or dei- and peace" it will-soon be unnecessary to carr ry on such " prosecutions.". He recommends to Congress to acquire possession of and title to all telegraphic linos now in ?op?ration in the United' States. He suggests that all the Indians shall bc-confined to thc territory south of Kansas, and that farms shall bc secured to them.
