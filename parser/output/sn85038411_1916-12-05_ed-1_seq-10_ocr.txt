Riches I can owe to fortune, beauty to my parents, but character I can owe only to myself. —lvan Paxix. AN END TO PATIENCE ONCE more the Republican party of Pennsylvania Is in a stew over the eternal controversy between Philadelphia leaders. But the inter est of the party at large In tills State In the fortunes of these particular leaders is not nearly so great as the aforesaid leaders imagine. They are making so much noise in their own little corner that it is quite natural that they should be deceived as to the echoes of the row in other parts of the Commonwealth. Should they examine closely the results beyond the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers they doubtless would discover that general dissatisfaction and disgust character ize the attitude of Republicans be yond Philadelphia county limits. If these so-called leaders insist upon ripping open the party every few months for their own peculiar pur- poses then they should be allowed to have the field all to themselves with out any aid or comfort from the party in the State. Of course, the Democrats are chuckling over the situation. Why shouldn't they? When foolish Re publicans set about paving the way for Democratic successes hereafter it is unreasonable to expect Democrats to conceal their satisfaction. They have a right to chuckle and should ■the bickering in Philadelphia open the way for a Democratic successor to Governor Brumbaugh the responsi bility for that result should be placed precisely where it belongs and no where else. ' • It is trying, indeed, for those Re publicans who believe in harmony of action and efficient management of the party s affairs to be constantly drawn into the internal rows which have characterized the Philadelphia wing of the party for several years. There is an end of patience in all things and the Philadelphia tactions are forcing the limit, so far as the party in the rest of the State is con-! cerned. A. Mitchell Palmer is again opposed to a "bi-partisan alliance," having failed last Fall to form one with the Progressives. SPEED: A SPEEDING automobile, a cry of horror, toddling footsteps, a thud on the asphalt, a small still body! i hat will be the story to appear in the local papers one of these days if the Harrisburg police force continues to allow the intolerable speeding along the River Front by men and v b °s" B crazed with the exhilaration of express train velocity. Sunday afternoons are no different from any other day for these speed maniacs. The heavy automobile traffic between the city and Rockville on a Sabbath afternoon makes doubly dangerous any excess of speed, and the life of a pedestrian along the river on such days is nothing short of mis erable. A large dog miraculously escaped death under the wheels of a machine passing Front and Maclay streets at an accredited speed of thirty to thirty-five miles at the most popular hour of the afternoon Sunday, and It was only by the gentle grace of providence that a motorcyclist was not struck instead. A few arrests, followed by several stiff sentences, are evidently necessary to abolish the free license which now goes untrammcled to the danger of life and limb. Perhaps with the in crease of the police force several men could be spared to put an end to the speeding. City Commissioner Lynch is right in his suggestion that the annexation of 1 Riverside will mean the' extension of the Intercepting sewer along the River i Front to Include the proposed new ' boundary of the city. Even this should not interfere with the annexation of what is certain to bo an important ad- I dttlon to Harrisburg. PLEASE, MH. GROSS! YTTITHIN a month Harrisburg will iVV be invad ed by the usual delega tion of legislators and prominent people Interested in the session of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania. These visitors always find pleasure in walking along the River Front and they go away from Harrisburg with a fine impression of the city's treatment of the embankment. Distinguished landscape architects, city planners, municipal experts and others have sung the praises of Harrisburg far TUESDAY EVENING, and wide and nothing should be per mitted to change this good opinion during the present winter. While the permanent treatment of the slope has been neglected for sev- | erai months without reason or excuse, | may we not ask in the name of the j community that Park Commissioner' Gross at least put a few men to work cleaning the granolithic walk from one end of the city to the other of the deposits of dirt and stones which have been permitted to accumulate for several months. Surely the city has a right to expect that its officials pro tect the good name of Harrisburg. Constantinople having been prom ised to Russia, all that remains to do is to go and take it. THE 

PKESIDENTS MESSAGE PRESIDENT WILSON'S message to Congress to-day contains little | that is new and omits reference to many things of vital importance lo the country which the people as a whole have been hoping at least would be touched upon. Not one word has he to say concerning protection for American business at the end of the war in Europe and there is absolutely no mention of steps to relieve the con sumer from the well-nigh intolerable and ever-advancing cost of living. The President excuses himself for the brevity of his message and the limi tation of his recommendations on the score of the short legislative session, but the country will resent failure of executive suggestions along definite lines on problems in which it is greatly interested far more than it would a lengthy presidential message. So far as the President is concerned, the high cost of living situation does not exist, and American business men ! are left entirely in the dark as to what his attitude will be when the industries of the nation are again thrown into direct competition with the cheap for eign goods of Europe. President Wilson will bring himself [into direct and open conflict with the labor unions of the country, whose spokesman he was when the brother hood eight-hour law was before Con gress, by liis advocacy of the amend ment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, con ciliation and arbitration of such con troversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation pow provided for should fail, a public Investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be at tempted. Evidently, he clearly foresees strong labor opposition to such a measure in Congress, for he meets the union arguments against it before they are made, holding that while Congress is powerless to compel any individual to work who does not so desire, so ciety is well justified in safeguarding "the necessary processes of its very life" by forbidding labor organizations from striking until a public investi gation of conditions shall have been made. With these views of the President the great mass of the people will agree. If labor's cause is Just, it can well afford to give the public time to ascertain the merits of the case, thereby assuring Itself of public opinion in its behalf. If it is unjust, then the public has a right to know it and a strike is unjustifiable. Labor can lose nothing by such a course, but on the other hand has much to gain. By antagonizing such a legislative measure it will arouse suspicion in the public mind that it is no more un selfish or unreasonable than it accuses capital of being. Nevertheless, a big fight is to be expected over this recom mendation of the President when the measure he advocates reaches Con gress. Enlargement of the powers of the Public Service Commission' is such an apparent need that there will be small objection to the enactment of some such bill, and the same applies to the legalizing of some plan for the en largement of American business op portunities abroad, although all may not agree with the details of the Presi dent's program. Acknowledgment of the Interstate Commerce Commission's powers to approve increases in rail road rates to cover any advance in expenses and withdrawal of the bill having to do with that phase of the railroad dispute is belated admission of facts never in dispute and is of small importance. Explicit approval of Congress authorizing the commis sion to raise tariffs as a result of the operations of the Adamson law, after due investigation, was not necessary. If our friend Schwab keeps on the Steel Trust is going to lose its name. 

CITY EXPENDITURE AS the proposition of Mayor Meals to utilize the surplus funds of the Water Department for pay ment of the light bill of the city is more closely studied the suggestion is generally approved. At first there was some doubt as to whether this could be legally done, but it is said now in view of the fact that the water debt of Harrisburg has been extin guished there is no reason in law or good sense for increase in taxation which can be avoided through the use of funds not needed by the de partment whence the revenue is derived. Harrisburg is in good financial con dition and there is no reason to get into a hysterical state of mind every time some unusual expenditure is sug gested. No city anywhere has done so much with so little real burden upon its people. All that is required is careful consideration of the needs of the municipality and wlso pro vision for the administration of the several departments. In the making up of the annual budget care doubt less will be taken to cover the several matters which require particular at tention, especially the maintenance of the paved streets, the proper care of the parks and the River Front and the other matters which call for wise and efficient management. Only two persons were killed at the opening of the Unlontown speedway, Saturday, but the management shouldn't feed bad; the track hasn't had a fair chance as yet.

Cox, the South Philadelphia member who is backed by the State administration forces for the Republican caucus nomination for the speakership of the next House, was here last night for several hours' consultation with At torney General Brown and other men interested in his campaign and re turned lo Philadelphia to see other leaders to-day. Mr. Cox came to town quietly, conferred quietly and departed quietly. He made no statement and except for the usual announcement that Cox was going to win the head quarters of his boom gave out nothing about his visit here. It was intimated that Mr. Cox came here to meet some members from up-State and some labor leaders, but they either missed connections or something happened. He was an nounced as about to begin a tour of the state, but according to what Paul N. Furman said to-day he had gone back to Philadelphia. While Mr. Cox was here Senator Penrose at Washington was announc ing that he felt absolutely confident that Representative Richard J. Bald win would be the caucus nominee. Mr. Baldwin has the same opinion. —The belief is that the adminis tration forces are commencing to think that the only way to stiffen their fight is to commit the Governor to a policy of uiing patronage and of dropping men from the State service whose home members do not go along. Sev eral of the more vigorous members of the administration have favored this plan all along, but the Governor is said to fear the effect of such a policy on confirmation of some of his appoint ments. —Governor Brumbaugh will sit In at a high council of war at Philadel phia the latter part of the week, when it is predicted things will begin to move. —The Cox boom was helped along by a clarion blast from Insurance Com missioner J. Denny O'Neil at Philadel phia last night. He said: "It is not a contest between two men. It is a battle between right and wrong. It is a fight between corporate greed, cor rupt politics and all the allied selfish interests against human rights and the common people. I appeal to every man in the state who loves his home and wants to pive his boys and girls a chance to grow up in a clean, decent state to line up in the fight, to get busy and see their members and ask them to vote for Representative Cox." —Notwithstanding the North Ameri can's Vlaim that Mayor Smith, of Philadelphia, is lined up with the State administration in the speakership tight, the Philadelphia Record to-day says: "Just before he left the city yes terday for a week's hunting trip In Pike county Mayor Smith again dis claimed any interest in the bitter con test between the Penrose-McNichol and the Vare-Brumbaugh forces over the election of a Speaker of the House. Despite his persistent protestations of neutrality little credence Is attached by politicians to the Mayor's announce ment, as It is generally believed that he has declared his readiness to "go the limit" for Representative Edwin R. Cox, the Vare-Rrumbaugh candi date for Speaker. 'I have made no an nouncement whatever concerning the speakership,' the Mayor is quoted as having said. 'I am not paying atten tion to it, and do not intend to mix in the fight at all'." The Philadelphia Press, which is strongly booming Cox for Speaksr, claims that he has enough in sight to win. The North American opens an attack on Baldwin because of his atti tude on some cold storage legislation. The Scranton papers seem to think that Baldwin has the better of the chances. —Congressman Barchfeld has start ed a fight to hold his seat in Congress. The courts will settle it. —Congressman Butler turned up with a plurality of 12,777. —State administration leaders claim three legislators in Lackawanna. The other side say the best they can get is two. —Chester will <>uUd a $250,000 city hall. —Mayor Jones, of Coatesville, has started to fight the contest to unseat him. He says that he can win. Lancaster city officials for the next two years, elected last evening by council, are all Republicans, as only four of the thirty-six select and com mon councllmen are Democrats.

Alarm in the Liquor Trade [New York Sun.] It Is apparent that the successes of the prohibition movement in widely separated States cannot be adequately accounted for on the ground of local conditions. While the Southern States were outlawing the saloon It was easy to point to the negro and say that his weakness must be guarded against. But Missouri defeated pro hibition at the last election, while Michigan, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota adopted It. Bonfort's Wine and Spirit Circular does not attempt to conceal the uneasiness Intelligent men in the liquor industry feel over the outlook: "It Is well known that prohibition laws are ineffective and create condi tions in many instances far worse than even badly conducted saloons, and we hold no brief for the indecent drink ing emporiums: but something Is radi cally wrong and we are searching for the cause, because we believe that the liquor Industry of the United States Is facing a crisis which may not prove fatal If the proper remedies are ap plied without delay. "We have lost much ground. We must not lose any more or we shall be dangerously near national prohibi tion, and that means the destruction of our vast Industry In all of Its branches. It means confiscation of capi tal and property. It means pauperism for hundreds of thousands of men and women who now make their llvell hod out of the employment given them by the liquor industry. "All these arguments have been used with no avail. The people continue to outlaw our business In one State after another." This authority believes the whole trade should organize, not merely to prosecute Its defense In the way It has been conducted hertofore, but to examine the record, disclose the errors that have been made and adopt new methods for protection. It believes the Industry may save itself, but It rec ognizes that it must work hard In or der to do it. YOUNG, PRETTY H TURNS BACK ON SOCIETY t TF you were young, wealthy, ex- ceptionally good looking, and had society and all Its engrossments for a woman beckoning to you—would you take advantage of your social op portunities? Or would you go to school two years, learning what is needed by the poor and friendless, how to dispense charity and how to administer philan thropy? The former means brilliant func tions, rounds of pleasure without end, visiting!, entertaining, meeting bril liant persons, living luxuriously, and all that. Pleased With Her Decision The latter means studying home life where the pinch of poverty is too evident, excursions Into disease laden air, work among the morally and physically unclean, association with feeble-minded, criminal and in sane. This, briefly, is the two fields of activity in life that Mrs. M. Lowen stein had to choose between. She chose the latter and is im mensely pleased with her decision. Soon after being left a widow she studied for two years in the New York School of Social Economy to perfect herself for work in her chosen field. She is executive secretary of the chil dren's code commission. She has been spending her time and money freely in helping to pre pare a code of State laws that will govern with a kindly and sympathetic interest the lives and destinies of destitute children, delinquent, the blind, the deaf, feeble-minded, in sane and others of the less fortunate members of the human family. 'There are laws now on the statute books of this State that would solve sonie of the many problems except for the fact that there is no provision made for their enforcement," Mrs. Lowenstein said. To Save Children of Poor "We are working toward an end that will mean salvation for the chil dren of the poor and of the delin quents. They will have a chance to become useful citizens. Their edu cation will be cared for and every thing possible will be done to give them the right outlook and bring LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Appeal For Christmas Gifts To the Editor of the Telegraph : The late Dr. Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskegee Institute, year by year, appealed to generous friends for Christmas remembrances of one kind and another to be distributed through him to the colored children of the South who, without such Christmas remem brances, would have nothing to re mind them of the Chrlßtmaß season. Floods, the boll weevil, and Industrial conditions generally among the negro farming classes have brought about a rather depressing state of affairs. Many people are in actual distress and want, while In hundreds and thousands of homes there will be little to indicate that Christmas is a time of joy and blessing. Anything whatsoever, no mat ter how Inexpensive, will brighten a situation otherwise largely unrelieved by any cheering ray. I shall be glad to serve as did Dr. Washington, that is, to act as the in termediary through whom the public may transmit their gifts to these chil dren. and to take pains to see that they reach those who are worthy, distribut ing them over as wide a section as the South as possible, through Tuskegee offshoot schools, graduates, former stu dents, Jeanes Fund workers, etc. It.

"The legislators are asked to do their part by adopting laws as sug gested by the commission. These recommendations will be made only after an exhaustive research has been made, and it is evidenced that they are the best possible. "There already are a number of things that will be suggested to the coming Legislature. If the sugges ions are adopted it will mean so many things for the benefit of chil dren. "Every county will have a chil dren's court to x which all children who break the law will be brought. No child will be left in a common jail with adults, and no destitute child will be confined in State reformatories wilh delinquents. Boys under 18 no longer will be committed to the peni tentiary, and adults responsible for the delinquency of a child will be dealt with by the same tribunal that dis poses of the child's case. ("arc of Feeble-.Minded "Additional provisions will be made for the care of the feeble-mind ed. At present tliere is one institu tion in the State with a capacity of 700 inmates. The institution is filled, and has a waiting list of 800. "The education of the blind, the deaf, the feeble-minded and the epi leptic will be placed under the State department of education. These insti tutions now are under the direct charge of the heads of the separate organizations with no means of in spection." Changes in the wording and man ner of enforcement of Missouri's child labor laws also are contemplated, and an inspection of factories in all towns and cities will be possible. Boys under 21 will not be permitted to engage in night messenger service and girls under 18 will not be per mitted to engage in street trade.
