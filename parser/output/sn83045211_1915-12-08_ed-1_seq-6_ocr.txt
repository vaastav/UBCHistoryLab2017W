WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. Tho United States will procure safe conducts for tho German attaches, Cap tains Hoy-IM and von Papcn, as soon as Berlin Issues the foimal notification of their recall. The German Foreign Of fice will accede to tho demands of tho United States vltliout further parley, It wan reported today. Tho controversy betw een Secretary Lan sing and Count von Ucrnstorft concern ing the charges or roasom that led to tln rpmicst for their recall has been set tled. Captain Boy-Ed has gone to New York and Is not expected to return to Washington. With Captain von Papen he will begin at once to arrange his affalra In preparation for hl3 trip across the At lantic under British and French promises of protection The arrangements for the withdrawal of tho naval and military attaches of Germany without further controversy was bi ought about through an exchange of notes between Secretary Lansing and Count vol Bernstorff. Shorn of diplo matic verb.age, the compromise may be stnted as follows: Secretary Lansing gave Count yon BernBtorff a clean bill of health in every particular and absolved him of any con nection wfiatever with improper activi ties In this country. Secretary Lansing assured Count von Bernstorff that the United States Gov ernment has not charged. Intimated or suggested in any way that Captain Boy Ud or Captain von Papen has been In volved In any political activities against the United States or any of the Indi vidual States. As far as the records of the Govern ment are concerned tho attaches have been held blamable only In relation to the Hamburg-American case and In the Archlbald-Dumba Incident. This diplomatic disclaimer on the part of this Goernment In writing appears to havo satisfied the Gorman Ambassador In every detail, and he Is now content to part with his naval and military aides. It Is protable that Secretary Lansing will mako formal application today to the British and French Ambassadors for the safe conduct. It is assumed that he has sounded the diplomats already. Diplomats are supposed to be Immune from arrest by their enemies In the cir cumstances under which the two Ger man offcers will leave the United States, tut the German Government will rake no chances TODAY'S MARRIAGE LICENSES VtJrlck G.

LOAN SOCIETY rUh The mon In the ranks, the workers who havo to toll haul for n bare livelihood, hold varying views regarding President Wilson's message. Those who are working In the Industries fear the adoption of the President's sug gestion regarding n tax on oil, Iron, steel nml other things would affect their wages. They figure that employers would endeavor to retrench In some direction nnd think of their payrolls llrst. Small shopkeepers nlso expressed their disapproval of tho tax feature, because they believed It would mean additional burdens. Many nlso expressed tho belief that tho suggestions for preparedness were out of order, ana contended that wo needed more schools nnd other public In stitutions. In some enses the opposition views were held for selfish rensons. The waiter and the barber, for Instance, said their tips would bo cut down If their pa trons had to pay more taxes. Following arc some of the opinions ex pressed: 

GEORGE T. POWERS, bank clerk. 8730 Frankford avenue Tho only thing I can say Is that the proposed tax on checks will add to tho work of the bank employes. I don't see anything wrong in taxing gasoline nnd engines. Let tho rich "pay the bills. TIinODORE J. HOPKINS, farmer nnd trucker. Camden Count-, New Jersey. I voted for President Wilson, but I won't do It agnln. Thero la nothing Just In making the farmer pay the defi cits of tho Government caused by the war. If these 'deficits are to he met, let us tax the ammunition makers who are profiting from the war, and not the farmer who Is unable to stand further taxation. 

FP.ED MUELLER, saloonkeeper, 2347 Or thodox street. All this talk about hy phenated Americans makes me sick. What about the Anglo-Amerlcans7 They are the ones who aro making tho most trouble for tho country. If Presi dent Wilson means what ho says, why doesn't he arrest the English agents in this country. This Ill-advised message will be answered next November. PAUL II. MELLON, carpenter. 310 Ben son street, Camden I don't approve of the President's message. What do wo want with a bigger army and navy? After this war thero won't be anybody left to fight. And as for taxing auto mobiles. It makes no difference to me so long as they don't tax anything that I hac. 

JAMES M. CUMMINS, waller, 1525 West ern avenue Yes, I read tho message, but I don't get all of It. That was great Htuff about the hyphenated Amer icans, wasn't It. Sure, I'm In fnor of n big navy and a big army; tho big ger tho better. Only I don't sco all these taxes The llrst thing you know the people will have so much tuxes that they wilt forget to pass tho tlpw. rilEDERICK CASEY, Ironworker, 005 Quarry streot No, I didn't read the nicssiKe.
