TREATS OF NATION'S FOREIGN RELATIONS Advocates Passage of Bill Recommended by Knftx Permitting the Applica tion of Graduated Duties. Washington, D. C., Dec. 3.—A note of warning to European powers which lay indirect means continue to dis criminate again&r American trade a strong appeal to the congress to up lift the great foreign policies of Amer ica above mere questions of partisan ship a triumphant vindication of the diplomacy of the administration, wnich Is characterized as that of "dollars vs. bullets" a masterful pride in the enormous expansion of American trade as a-result of the foreign policies of his administration and an earnest appeal for joint action by congress and the executive to open new mar kets for American industries—these are the more striking features of President .Taft's fourth annual message sent to congress today. The message is the first of a series of such communications and deals en tirely with the foreign relations of the United States. Beginning with the usual reference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the president adds that these have* been strengthened by "A greater insistence upon justice to American citizens, or interests, wherever it may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need of. mutuality in commercial and other relations." Has Received Good Treatment. For the first time in its history says the president the state department has obtained substantially the most favored nation treatment from all of the countries of the world. Therefore, he says that it is only natural that competitive countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning, "If in some instances, the measures taken by them to meet it are not en tirely equitable, a remedy should be found." To this end. the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the government instead of imposing the full maximum rates of duty against discriminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to that maxiihum of twen ty-five per cent. The state department, "an archaic and inadequate machine," at the begin ning of this administration, the presi dent says, has become a new organiza tion, with highly specialized bureaus and experts dealing with every phase of American trade and diplomacy. Holding that the essence of this re organized service is found in the merit system', which President Cleveland is credited with having introduced, Presi dent Taft makes a strong appeal to congress to make this machine perma-1 nent, by giving the force of statutory' law to the executive orders governing admission to and promotion in the dip lomatic and consular services. To show that these appointments are already largely non-partisan, the president points to the fact that three of the present ambassadors are hold overs that of the ten he has appoint ed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister that of the thirty ministers appointed, eleven were pro motions and that in the consular service no less than fifty-five per cent of thei consuls appointed by him were from the southern states. The president adds that "because modern diplomacy is commercial, there has been a disposition in some quarters to attribute to it none but materialistic aims." '.'How strikingly erroneous 18 such an'- impression may be seen from a study of the results," he said. Help Others to Help Selves. "In Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nica ragua and Honduras to help them selves," says President Taft. While they are the immediate beneficiaries, the profit to the United States is two fold, he adds. The Monroe Doctrine Is more vital in the neighborhood of the Panama canal, and such countries should be relieved of the jeopardy of heavy foreign debts likely to provoke brJulli

MD ritv-V*: international complications. Commending the successful results of the application of the new neutral ity laws to Mexico and other troubled countries the president suggests that means be found in addition to prevent the professional revolutionists from making American ports "foci" for re volutionary intrigue. He reiterates his determination to adhere in the case of Mexico to the "patient policy of non-intervention, steadfast recogni tion of constituted authority, and the exertion of every effort to protect American interests." The message concludes with an earnest appeal to congress to cooper ate with the executive in its efforts to apply the old principles of diplomacy which have governed the country, to the omentuous new situations of to day, when America finds itself at the threshold of her middle age as a na tion "too mature to continue in its foreign relations those temporary ex pedients natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern." The president's message in full fol lows: nir-iiiiw and linn.-.. seutativen: The Joreign relations of the Uniu States actually and potentially afl'o the state of the Union to a degree r.ii widely realized and hardly surpassed by any other factor in the welfare oi the whole nation. The position of the United States in the moral, Intellec tual and material relations of the fam ily of nations should be a matter of •ltal Interest to every patriotic citi zen. The national prosperity and power impose upon us duties which we cannot shirk if we are to be true to our ideals. The tremendous growth of the ex port trade of the United States has already made that trade a very real factor in the industrial and commer clal prosperity of the country. With the development of our industries the foreign gommerce of the United States must rapidly become a still more essential factor In its economic welfare. The relations of the United States with all foreign powers remain upon a sound basis of peace, harmony and friendship. A. greater insistence upon justice to American citizens or inter ests whferever it may have been denied and a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other re lations have only served to strengthen our friendship with foreign countries by placing those friendships upon a firm foundation of realities as well as aspirations. Reorganization of State Department. At the beginning of the present ad ministration the United States, having fully entered upon its position as a world power, with the responsibilities thrust upon it by the results of the Spanish-American war and already en gaged in laying the groundwork of a vast foreign trade upon which it should one day become more and more dependent, found Itself without the machinery for firing thorough atten tion to and taking effective action npon a mass of intricate business vi tal to American Interests in every coun try in the world. The department of state was an archaic and inadequate machine, lack ing most of the attributes of the for eign office of any great modern power. With an appropriation made upon my recommendation by the congress on Aug. 5, 1909, the department of state was completely reorganized. There were created divisions of Latin-Ameri can affairs and of far eastern, near eastern and western European affairs. The law offices of the department were greatly strengthened. There were added foreign trade advisers to co-op erate with the diplomatic and consular bureaus and the politico-geographical divisions in the Innumerable matters where commercial diplomacy or con sular work calls for such special knowledge. The same officers, together with the rest of the new organisation, are able at all times to give to Ameri cau citizens accurate information as to conditions in foreign countries with which they have business and likewise to co-operate more effectively with the congress and also with the other ex ecutive departments. Merit System In Conaular and Diplo matic Corps* Expert knowledge and professional training must evidently be the essence of this reorganisation. Without a train ed foreign service there would not be men available for the work in the reor ganized department of state. President Cleveland had taken the first step to ward introducing the merit system in the foreign service. That had been fol lowed by the application of the merit principle, with excellent results to tha entire consular branch. Almost noth ing, however, had been done in this di rection with regard to the diplomatic service. In this age of commercial di plomacy it was evidently of the first Importance to train an adequate per sonnel in that branch of the service. Therefore, on Nov. 20, 1909, by an executive order I placed the diplomatic service up to the grade of secretary of embassy, inclusive, upon exactly the same strict nonpartisan basis of the merit system, rigid examination for ap pointment and promotion only for effi ciency, as had been maintained with out exception in the consular service. Merit and Nonpartisan Character of Appointments. How faithful to the merit system and how nonpartisan has been the con duct of the diplomatic and consular services in the last four years may be judged from the following: Three am bassadors now serving held their pres ent rank at the beginning of my ad ministration. Of the ten ambassadors whom I have appointed five were by promotion from the rank of minister. Niue ministers now serving held their present rank at the beginning of the administration. Of the thirty ministers whom I have appointed, eleven wers Mbr* 4 l' •." 1 1 promoted from the lower grades of tie foreign service or from the department of state. Of the nineteen missions In Latin-America, where oar relations are close and our interest Is great, fifteen chiefs of mission are service men, three having entered the service during this administration. The thirty-seven secretaries of em I bassy or legation who have received their initial appointments after passing successfully the required examination were chosen for ascertained fitness, without regard to political affiliations. A dearth of candidates from southern and western states has alone made it Impossible thus far completely to equal ize all the states' representations In the foreign service. In the effort to equalize the representation of the va rious states in the consular service I have made sixteen of the twenty-nine new appointments as consul which have occurred during my administra tion from the southern states. This is 55 per cent. Every other consular ap pointment made, including the promo tion of eleven young men from the con sular assistant and student interpreter corps, has been by promotion or trans fer, based solely upon efficiency shown in the service. Larger Provision For Embassies and Legations Recommended. In connection with legislation for the amelioration of the foreign service, 1 wish to invite attention to the advisa bility of placing the salary appropria tions upon a better basis. I believe that the best results would be obtained by a moderate scale of salaries, w'^Ji adequate funds for the expenses of proper representation, based In each case upon the scale and cost of living at each post, controlled by a system of accounting and under the general di rection of tbe department of state. In line with the object which I have sought of placing our foreign service on a basis of permanency, I have at various times advocated provision by cougress for the acquisition of govern ment owned buildings for the residence and offices of our diplomatic officers, so as to place them more nearly on an equality with similar officers of other nations and to do away with the dis crimination which otherwise must nec essarily be made In some cases in favor of men having large private fortunes. Diplomacy a Handmaid of Commercial Intercourse and Peace. The diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern ideas of commercial Inter course. This policy has been charac terized as substituting dollars for bul lets. It is one that appeals alike to idealistic humanitarian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and strat egy and to legitimate commercial aims. It is an effort frankly directed to the increase of American trade upon the axiomatic principle that the gov ernment of the United States shall ex tend all proper support to every legiti mate and beneficial American enter prise abroad. How great have been the results of this diplomacy, coupled with the maximum and minimum pro vision of the tariff law, will be seen by some consideration of the wonder ful Increase in the export trade of tbe United States Because modern di plomacy is commercial there has been a disposition in some quarters to at tribute to it nene but materialistic alms. How strikingly erroneous Is such an impression may be seen from a study of the results by which the diplomacy of the United States can be judged. Successful Efforts In Promotion of Peace. In the field of work toward the Ideals of peace this government negotiated, but to my regret was unable to con summate, two arbitration treaties which set the highest mark of the aspiration of nations toward the sub stitution of arbitration and reason for war in the settlement of International disputes. Through the efforts of American diplomacy several wars have been prevented or ended. I re fer to the successful tripartite media tion of the Argentine Republic, Bra zil, and the United States between Peru and Ecuador, the bringing «f the boundary dispute between Panama and Costa Rica to peaceful arbitra tion the staying of warlike prepara tions when Haiti and the Dominican Bepublic were on the verge of hostil ities the stopping of a war in Nicara gua tbe halting of Internecine strife in Honduras. The government of the United States was thanked for its influence toward the restoration of amicable re lations between tbe Argentine Republic and Bolivia. The diplomacy of the United States is active in seeking to assuage the remaining ill feeling be tween this country and the republic of Colombia. In the recent civil war In China the United States successfully joined with the other Interested powers in urging an early cessation of hostili ties. An agreement has been reached between the governments of Chile and Peru whereby the celebrated Tacna Arica dispute, which has so long em bittered international relations on tbe west coast of South America, has at last been adjusted. Simultaneously came the news that the boundary dis pute between Peru and Ecuador had entered upon a stage of amicable set tlement China. In China the policy of encouraging financial investment to enable that country to help itself has had the result of giving new life and practical appli cation to the open door policy. The consistent purpose of the present ad ministration has been to enpourage the use of American capital in the develop ment of China by the promotion of those essential reforms to which China is pledged by treaties with the United States and other powers. The hypothecation to foreign bankers •fK• .'•: i, »«. f. 

OTTUOCWA COURIER. THURSDAY. DECEMBER S, 1912,. In connection with certain Industrial enterprises, such se the Hukuang rail ways, of the national revenues upon which these reforms depended, led the department of state early In the admin istration to demand for American citi zens participation in such enterprises, in order that the United States might have equal rights and an equal voice In all questions pertaining to the disposi tion of the public revenues concerned. The same policy of promoting inter national accord among the powers hav ing similar treaty rights as ourselves in the matters of reform, which could not be put into practical effect without the common consent of all. was likewise adopted in the case of the loan desired by China for the reform of its cur rency. The principle of^ international co-operation in matters of common in terest upon which our policy had Al ready been based in all of the above in stances has admittedly been a great factor in that concert of the powers which has been so happily conspicuous during the perilous period trf transition through which the great Chinese natloa has been passing. Central America Needs Our Help In Debt Adjustment. In Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nicaragua and Honduras to help themselves. They are the immediate beneficiaries. The national benefit to the United States is twofold. First, it is obvious that the Monroe doctrine is more vital in the neighborhood of the Panama canal and the zone of the Caribbean than any where else. There, too, the mainte nance of that doctrine falls most heav ily upon the United States. It is there fore essential that the countries within that sphere shall be removed from the jeopardy involved by heavy foreign debt and chaotic national finances and from the ever present danger of inter national complications due to disorder at home. Hence the United States has been glad to encourage and support Ameri can bankers who were willing to lend a helping hand to the financial re habilitation of such countries because this financial rehabilitation and the protection of their custom houses from being the prey of would be dictators would remove at one stroke the men ace of foreign creditors and the men ace of revolutionary disorder. I wish to call yonr especial attention to the recent occurrences In Nicaragua, for I believe the terrible events re corded there during the revolution of the past sum t—the useless loss of life, the deviation of property, the bombardment of defenseless cities, the killing and wounding of women and children, the torturing of noncombat ants to exact contributions and the suffering of thousands of human be ings—might have been averted had the department of state, through approval of the loan convention by the senate, been permitted to carry out Its now well developed policy of encouraging the extending of financial aid to weak Central American states with the pri mary objects of avoiding just such revolutions by assisting those repub lics to rehabilitate their finances, to establish their currency on a stable basis, to remove the custom houses from the danger of revolutions by ar ranging for their secure administra tion, and to establish reliable banks. I wish to congratulate the officers and men of the United States navy and marine corps who took part in re-estab lishing order In Nicaragua upon their splendid conduct and to record with sorrow the death of seven American marines and bluejackets. Since the re establishment of peace and order elec tions have been held amid conditions of quiet and tranquillity. Nearly all the American marines have new been withdrawn. Our Mexican Policy. For two years revolution and counter revolution have distraught the neigh boring republic of Mexico. Brigandage has involved a great deal of depreda tion upon foreign Interests. There have constantly recurred questions of ex treme delicacy. On several occasions very difficult situations have arisen on our frontier. Throughout this trying period the policy of the United States has been one of patient noninterven tion, steadfast recognition of constitut ed authority in the neighboring na tion and the exertion of every effort to care for American interests. I pro foundly hope that the Mexican nation may soon resume the path of order, prosperity and progress. To that na tion in its sore troubles the sympa thetic friendship of the United States has been demonstrated to a high de gree. There were in Mexico at the begin ning of tbe revolution some 30,000 or 40,000 American citizens engaged in enterprises contributing greatly to the prosperity of that republic and also benefiting the important trade between the two countries. The investments of American capital in Mexico has been estimated at $1,000,000,000. The respon sibility of endeavoring to safeguard those Interests and the dangers insep arable from propinquity to so turbulent a situation have been great, but I am appy to have been able to adhere to the policy above outlined—a policy which I hope may soon be Justified by the complete success of the Mexican people in regaining the blessings of peace and good order. Agricultural Credits. A most important work accomplished in the past year by the American dip lomatic officers in Europe is the inves tigation of the agricultural credit sys tem in the European countries. Both as a means to afford relief to the con sumers of this country through a more thorough development of agricultural resources and as a means of more suffi ciently maintaining the agricultural population, the project to establish credit facilities for the farmers la a 1 5n-# concern of vital importance te tkta na tion. No evidence of prosperity among well established farmers should blind us to the fact that lack of capital is prevent ing a development of the nation's agri cultural resources and an adequate in crease of the land under cultivation that agricultural production is fast fall ing behind the Increase in population and that, in fact, although these well established farmers are maintained in increasing prosperity because of the natural increase in population, we are not developing the industry of agricul ture. Advantage of Maximum and Minimum Tariff Provision. The importance which our manufac turef have assumed in the commerce of the world in competition with the manufactures of other countries again draws attention to the duty of this government to use its utmost endeav ors to secure impartial treatment for American products in all markets. Healthy commercial rivalry in interna tional intercourse is best assured by the possession of proper means for protecting and promoting our foreign trade. It is natural that competitive countries should view with some con cern this steady expansion of our com merce. If in some instances the meas ures taken by them to meet it are not entirely equitable a remedy should be found. In former messages I have described I the negotiations of the department of state with foreign governments for the adjustment of the maximum and mini mum tariff as provided in section 2 of the tariff law of 1909. The advantages secured by the adjustment of our trade relations under this law have contin ued during the last year, and some ad ditional cases of discriminatory treat ment of which we bad reason to com plain have been removed. The depart ment of state has for the first time in the history of this country obtained substantial most-favored-nation treat ment from all the countries of the world. There are, however, other instances which, while apparently not constitut ing undue discrimination in the sense ef section 2, are nevertheless excep tions to the complete equity of tariff treatment for American products that the department of state consistently has sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. Necessity For Supplementary Legisla tion. These developments confirm the opin ion conveyed to you in my annual mes sage of 1011, that while the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law of 1909 has been fully justified by the success achieved in removing pre viously existing undue discriminations against American products, yet experi ence has shown that this feature of the law should be amended in such way as to provide a fully effective means of meeting the varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of Ameri can commerce in foreign countries still encountered, as well as to protect against Injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either legislative or administrative measures the financial interests abroad of Ameri can citizens whose enterprises enlarge the market for American commodities. I cannot too strongly recommend to the congress the passage of some such enabling measure as the bill which was recommended by the secretary of state in his letter of Dec. 13, 1911. The ob ject of the proposed legislation is, in brief, to enable the executive to apply, as the case may require, to any or all commodities, whether or not on the free list from a country which discrim inates against the United States, a graduated scale of duties up to the maximum of 25 per cent ad valorem provided in the present law. Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations irrespective of the treatment from them received. Such a flexible power at the command of the executive would serve to moderate any unfavorable tendencies on the part of those countries from which the impor tations into the United States are sub stantially confined to articles on the free list as well as of the countries which find a lucrative market in the United States for their products under existing custom rates. It is very neces sary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of negotiation adopted to modern econom ic conditions in order that we may at all times be in a position to gain not only technically just but actually equit able treatment for our trade and also for American enterprises and vested in terests abroad. Business Secured to Our Country by Direct Official Effort. I As illustrating the commercial bene fits to the nation derived from the new diplomacy and its effectiveness upon the material as well as the more ideal side, it may be remarked that through direct official efforts alone there have been obtained in the course of this administration contracts from foreign governments involving an expenditure of $50,000,000 in the factories of the United States. It is germane to these observations to remark that in the two years that have elapsed since the successful negotia tion of our new treaty with Japan, which at the time seemed to present so many practical difficulties, our export trade to that country has increased at the rate of over $1,000,000 a month. Our exports to Japan for the year end ed June 30, 1910, were $21,959,310, while for the year ended June 30, 1912, the exports were $53,478,046, a net in crease in the sale of American prod ucts of nearly 150 per cent, The act adopted at tbe last session of congress to give effect to the fur Mai convention of July 7.1911. between SSaSMlMMrtMIl liyy l|jii |i.i|'iyi» Hfiililliljull' I ."HH'1 1 A 1 1 -.*eis^ir rf' Great Britain, Japan, Russia and the United States provided for the sus pension of all land killing of seals on the Prlbllof islands for a period ot five years, and an objection has now been presented to this provision by the other parties in Interest, which raises the issue as to whether or not this prohibition of land killing is Inconsist ent with the spirit If not the letter of the treaty stipulations. The Justifica tion for establishing this close season depends, under the terms of the con vention, upon how far If at all It is necessary for protecting and preserv ing the American fur seal herd and for Increasing its number. This is a ques tion requiring examination of the pres ent condition of the herd and the treat ment which It needs In tbe light of actual experience and scientific inves tigation. Final Settlement of North Atlantio Fisheriee Diepute. On the 20th of July lastian agree ment was concluded between the Unit ed States and Oreat Britain adopting, with certain modifications, the rules and method of procedure recommend ed in the award rendered by the North Atlantic coast fisheries arbitration tri bunal on Sept 7, 1910, for the settle ment hereafter, in accordance with the principles laid down in the award, of questions arising with' reference to the exercise of the American fishing liberties under Article I of the treaty of Oct. 20, 1818, between the United States and Great Britain. This agree ment received the approval of the sen ate on Aug. 1 and was formally rati fied by the two governments on Nov. 15 last. Opium Conference—Unfortunate Fail ure of Our Government. In my message on foreign relations communicated to the two houses of congress Dec. 7, 1911, I called special attention to the assembling of the opium conference at The Hague, to the fact that that conference was to review all pertinent muncipal laws relating to the opium and allied evils and certain ly all international rules regarding these evils, and te the fact that it seemed to me most essential that the congress should take immediate action on the anti-narcotic legislation before the con gress, to which I had previously called attention by a special message. The congress at its present session should enact into law those bills now before It which have been so carefully drawn up in collaboration between the department of state and the other ex ecutive departments and which have behind them not only the moral senti ment of the country, but the practical support of all the legitimate trade in terests likely to be affected. Since the international convention was signed adherence to it has been made by sev eral European states not represented at the conference of The Hague and also by seventeen Latin-American re publics. Europe and the Near East. The war between Italy and Turkey came to a close In October last by the signature of a treaty of peace, subse quently to which the Ottoman empire renounced sovereignty over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania in favor of Italy. Dur ing the past year the near east has un fortunately been the theater of con stant hostilities. Almost simultaneous ly with the conclusion of peace be tween Italy and Turkey and their ar rival at an adjustment of the complex questions at issue between them, war broke out between Turkey on the one hand and Bulgaria, Greece, Montene gro and Servla on the other. In the exercise of my duty In the matter I have dispatched to Turkish waters a special service squadron, con sisting of two armored cruisers, in or der that this government may if need be bear its part in such measures as it may be necessary for the interested na tions to adopt for tbe safeguarding of foreign lives and property in the Otto man empire in the event that a danger ous situation should develop. Liberia. As a result of the efforts of this gov ernment to place the government of Liberia in position to pay its outstand ing indebtedness and to maintain a stable and efficient government, nego tiations for a loan of $1,700,000 have been successfully concluded, and it is anticipated that the payment of the old loan and the issuance of the bonds of the 1912 loan for the rehabilitation of the finances of Liberia win follow at an early date, when the new receiver ship will go into active operation. The new receivership will consist of a gen eral receiver of customs designated by the government of the United States and three receivers of customs desig nated by the governments of Germany. France and Great Britain, which coun tries have commercial Interests in the republic of Liberia. The Far East. The political disturbances in China In the autumn and winter of 1911-12 resulted In the abdication of the Man chu rulers on Feb. 12, followed by the formation of a provisional republican government empowered to conduct the affairs of the nation until a permanent government might be regularly estab lished. The natural sympathy of the American people with the assumption of republican principles by the Chinese people was appropriately expressed in a concurrent resolution of congress on April 17, 1912. A constituent assembly, composed of representatives duly chosen by the people of China in the elections that are now being held, ^as been called to mee£ In January next to adopt a permanent constitution and organize tbe government of the nascent repub lic. During the formative constitutional stage and pending definite action by the assembly, as expressive of the popular will, and the hoped for estab lishment of a stable republican form of government capable of fulfilling its ''"*7t$ 4 1 I i* International obligations, the HUM' States is, according to precedent, main" talnlng full and friendly de fMfee re lations with the provisional govern* ment The new condition of affairs thus created has presented man/ eerioua and complicated problems, both ef in ternal rehabilitation and of IndMRUi tional relations, whose solution It realized would necessarily much time and patience.
