Moore, Director ot the Wisconsin Weather Service, speaks as follows about the climate of Wisconsin: The climate of Wisconsin is one of the most healthful in the United States. With an annual rainfall sufficient to give the state high rank in agriculture, its atmosphere is still so dry and free from disease breeding germs that our mortality record is as low as the lowest, in some cases the death rate not being over one-half what it is in southern and eastern states. In the east we have heard people refor to the air of Wisconsin as vapor-laden from the lakes. Nothing can be further from the truth. The general east erly movement of all air carries the ascending vapors from Lake Michigan to the more easterly states, and the absolute humidity of Wisconsin is but a shade greater than Minnesota and the Dakotas. The Weather Bureau records for ten years, from 1876 to 1886, for January, show an average of 0.8 of a grain of vapor per cubic foot of air in Wisconsin, 1.0 grain in Colorado, 1.4 in Ohio, 1.7 in Virginia and 3.0 in the southern half of all the Gulf States. The same record for July, is, Colorado 5.0 grains, Wisconsin 5.5, Ohio 6.5, Virginia, Missouri and Ten nessee, 7.0; South Atlantic and Gulf States 8 to 9 grains. The record of Wisconsin in this respect should be fully understood. We all understand the vitalizing influence of electricity on animal ■life. The human body is a much better conductor than dry air, and when existing in such air not only I retains the electricity received from the earth, but continually gathers it from the atmosphere, thus invig orating the muscles, strengthening the constitution and rendering the physical system almost impregna ble to the microbes of disease. When the atmosphere is heavily charged with moisture it becomes a better conductor than the*human body, and the body rapidly-looses this tonic force. The low mortal ity of the north central states is sometimes attributed to the com paratively thin population, but it is more reasonable to give the credit to the atmospheric conditions of these staces. If the population should become as dense as in the Atlantic Coast States, there is no reason to believe that the death rate will ever become as high as in the latter states. The cool, dry, invigorating air of Wisconsin is one of the most munificent bless ings of nature. HONORS FOR HON. C. M. WEBB. We are glad to note that nomi nation papers arc being circulated in the interest of our esteemed townsman and Judge, Chas. M. Webb, for him to become a candi date for the office of Justice of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Lyon, whose term of office expires Jan. ist, 1*894, l ias declined to be a candidate for re-election, and consequently the people of Wis consin will be called upon to elect an associate Justice next April. Justice Orton, by senority, will be advanced to Chief Justice. The many friends of Charles M. Webb, Circuit Judge of the Seventh Cir cuit, comprising the counties of Portage, Waupaca. Waushara and Wood, recognizing in him one of the ablest jurists in Wisconsin, and his circuit being located in a por tion of Wisconsin, never having been represented upon the Supreme bench, deem it peculiarly appro priate that the honor should be, conferred upon him. At home the desire is unanimous for his 1 election. All over the state he stands high in the estimation of the legal fraternity, and in the circuit over which he presides there is but one opinion, and that is, he is entitled to and worthy of the honor. I here is a great Teal of real distress among English farmers. They have lived under the free trade policy in its full development for about fifty years, and yet the other day, an important meeting, composed of farmers, in the North Nottinigham district. solemnly condemned free trade, as largely, if not entfrely, contributory to their woes. At a farmers’ meeting in Derbyshire resolutions were passed declaring that English farmers can t make a living under free trade und they demanded a protective, duty on wheat. And so runs the tendency. These farmers have all the cheap free trade goods they want, but some how {h e system hasn’t dione any thingg 20 help them. —Ex: WHY DO 

THEY CO.'IE? Thousands of immigrants count to the L nited States every year. Why do you think they conn here? In order to earn starvation wages, to be deprived of their earnings by “tariff monopolists.” to be taxed for the benefit of the “robber barrens?” No; they come here because ex perience at home, under the slavery of the European wage system, has taught them that only in this coun try of high wages and prosperity, of contentment and protection, is the laborer worthy of his hire. Only in this land of “taxes” has he an adequate scope for the exer cise of the faculties with which nature has blessed him; only here can he own his own home, furnish it in comfort and educate his chil dren to be good and patriotic citizens. Immigration is thus the best possible tribute to the benefits of protection, a mute but eloquent index of American progress under the American system. Immigrants did not flock here in free trade periods. They remained in their own countries, because the pauper standard of wages which free trade entails was not a suffici ently strong inducement to bring them here. Pauper wages can be earned just as well at home as abroad. When protection again tri umphed, when our mills and fac tories again hummed with life ano action, when plenty again blessed the land, then the masses of Europe again knocked at our door and asked us to share with them our abundance. Immigration we do not advocate Restrict it if you please, prohitit it if you can. But never lose sight of the fact that immigration would not trouble us if we were poor. When free trade begins the gates of Castle Garden will swing out ward instead of inward. Under that system immigration stops. Emigration takes its place. —Cen- tral Wisconsin. NO REFUTATION OF PROTECTION. The Hon. Richard E, Pettigrew, United States Senator from South Dakota, said in a recent public interview: “I do not think the election of Cleveland means a refu tation of protection, nor as the Democrats claim, that the Repub lican party is dead. They will find that the Republican party will be very much alive for many years to come, and that protection will survive. I think a good many Democrats arc in favor of protec tion in some form. I do not be lieve they will dare pass any meas ure looking to free trade. Any party that undertakes to abolish protection will soon go out of power. Protection has resulted in prosperity for the farmers in the Wcat, and especially in the two Dakotas. They are great wool raising states, the product amount ing to over 2,000,000 pounds year ly. A bill is pending in the Senate providing for free wool. If that should be passed it would cripple, if not ruin, wool growers. Should an attempt be made, which is not probable, to pass it at the coming session of congress, I shall offer an amendment to put all woolen goods on the free list. This is the Hen that Lam the Eggs, that are found at the City Cash Store. We have no patent on the Hen, but we have what is even better —a disposition to deal fairly with those who buy Eggs at out store. And we have butter too. Not laid by this Hen, but laid down by the best butter-makers in Wood County. We have other things, of course, but those you can see when you Go for Those Eggs. There are also bills (passed by the House) pending in the Senate to put rotton, binding twine, tin plate and ead ore on the free list, but I do lot tiiink they will be passed at :he next session. I shall not vote for them. If the Democratic party represented anything but what is bad, if it did not lack moral senti ment, it might remain in power. But any power without character or principle and suppored by the solid South. New York and Chi cago is not likely to last long. I think that Tammany Hall influ ence will be felt at the White House and aid in retiring the Democrats from power four years hence.” It is silly to talk ofa party being dead that cast over 6,000,000 votes as did the Republicans last fall. President Harrison’s Message. The President’s message gives a comprehensive review of public govermental affairs for the past year, and during the four years of the Harrison administration. He sums up briefly and tersely the extraordinary progress the country has made in all that pertains to art, wealth, and individual prosperity. By carefully compiled statistics he gives proof of the commercial and individual prosperity of the nation. He believes and accentu ates that belief that the better con ditions of our workingmen are due ■ o the policy of protection. Since March 4, 1889. the govern ment has reduced the public debt by $260,000,000 in round numbers, saving an annual interest charge of nearly $12,000,000. The reve nue of the government has been reduced by $32,000,000. The esti mated surplus for the current year ending June 30, 1893, is a little over $32,000,000. This estimate, however, is based on the continu mce of the condition of affairs under the policy which has been maintained by the present admin istration. It may, and is likely to be materially affected by the pros i pect of extensive changes soon to be made in the tariff. A consider able diminution of imports will occur, it is reasonable to expect, while the country is waiting for [ such changes and uncertain as to their nature and extent. Among the things of vital inter j est to the people he touches upon are the Cholera; Immigration; the Indian question; Agricultural bu reau; protection of R. R. employees and it is with no uncertain sound he utters a note of warning against the violence and oppression shown the black man. The message is a readable and manly resume of his views and worthy of a careful perusal by every intelligent citizen. In this final “message” to the people he has strengthened him self in the esteem of all all loyal, intelligent Americans. His devo tion to what he considers the best interests of his country is beyond question. His record may well be “written on vellum paper in letters o r shining gold.” In the army of the nation’s de fenders, in the senate chamber, in the white house as Chief Execu tive of the nation, and in the role of a simple, unofficial citizen of the United States he has been the same simple, just, courageous and patriotic man, one of the people who has won and will retain the reverent respect of all classes.
