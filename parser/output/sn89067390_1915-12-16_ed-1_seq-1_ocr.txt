Dickey, being vol untarily assembled in mass meeting on November 29, 1915, and realizing that "Whereas, For more than two years past, the industries of the nation have been disturbed, trade and commerce distressed, alarmed and halting, and a wide business depression has prevailed throughout this country, threatening the permanent destruction of the pros perity that formerly distinguished ths American people, and which depres sion has bien only accidentally aud partially relieved by the unnatural conditions growing out of the disas trous war In Europe, which is stimulat ing a temporary demand in certain lines of Industry, but which Inevitably will be followed by even greater Indus trial stagnation than that which w have recently experienced unless wise precautionary and preventive meas ures be early adopted by our govern ment and "Whereas, Commercial prosperity Is tbe life of the nation and when com merce is disturbed and interrupted by unwise legislation, a blow Is struck at the heart of every trade, profession and employment of the people, and "Whereas, The essential ingredient of success and progress is efficiency, which applies to government, aa well as to business administration, and the attainment of ef Vlency in any under taking requires ...e services of experts, skilled in the work to be undertaken, and "Whereas, We realize that the prob lem confronting our government to day, and which will confront it during the Immediate future, is the restora tion of the industrial and commercial progress and prosperity which this na tion enjoyed, with but slight and tem porary Interruption, for nearly fifty years succeeding the Civil War, and during which time it attained a growth In material wealth, in population, In social advancement, In individual lib erty and opportunity, in Intelligence of citizenship and in the enjoyment by all people within Its jurisdiction of the highest blessings which civiliza tion ran bestow, and "Whereas, Whiie the problem which confronted the nation in 1861 and with which our fathers wrestled, and which they solved to the satisfaction of suc ceeding generations and the eternal glory of the nation, was a social prob lem, the problems which confront the nation today are largely commercial and Industrial and demand more than ever before In the history of our nation the services, the rlpo experience and matured judgment of our successful business men, and call for the drafting into politics of business men, whose ability, integrity and patriotism have been thoroughly tried and proved, and "Whereas, Our fellow townsman and neighbor, Walter S.

(These resolutions were passed by a rising, unanimous vote amidst a scent tt remarkable enthusiasm.) Washington Letter Washington, December 13th. President Wilson's third annual mes sage to congress is chiefly remarkable for its admission not (rank, but never theless unmistakable that the demo cratic administration has resulted in a serious deficit; for its proposal that special taxes be levied on the imple ments and products of industry; for its complete reversal of Mr. Wilson's own views on the sugar tariff and military preparedness; for its insincerity in dis cussing "Pan Americanism;" and for its beautiful rhetoric. A notable fea ture cf the message is the president's insistence on the McAdoo Shipping Bill, despite abundant evidence that a majority of the people oppose it and despite the further fact that the treas ury is practically empty now. Many of those who heard the message read gained the impression that Mr. Wilson, by means of his beautiful rhetoric and melifluousness of expression, was try ing to write 'over the heads" of the majority of the people, to charm with beauty of phrase, while he concealed the essence alike of true conditions and the scope of his recommendations. It was notable, too, that as the mes sage was being read his platitudes were greeted with applause, his recom mendations with silence. In the state ment regarding the merchant marine, that "we should promptly remove ev ery legal obstacle that may stand in the wav uf this much to be desired re vival of our old independence and should facilitate in every way possible the building, purchase and American registration cf ships," many of Mr. Wilson's hearers believed they per ceived an admission that the iniquitous Seamen's Bill, which the President signed even against the advice of his own Cabinet and which has done so much to injure American shipping, was a serious blunder and should be repealed. But Mr. Wilson's most ardent admirers could not regard it as a frank avowal of his unpardonable b'under. After disclosing the fact that his Administration had produced a serious deficit, President Wilson told congress that there were many sources of rev enue "which can justly be resorted to," and he promptly proposed a tax of SO cents per horse power on all automobiles and internal combustion engines, and a tax of one cent a gal lon on gasoline and naphtha. The "justice" of the first tax is apparent when it is reflected that the man who buys a 22 horsepower runabout for $390 would have to pay a tax of 811 or approximately three per cent of the cost price, wher? as the man who buys a 40-horse power touring car for $3,000 would pay a tax of $20, or one hall of one per cent on his investment. The occupants of houses and apartments fitted with gas ranges would not feel the tax on gasoline, but the family which was compelled to cook with a gasoline stove would pay something over one cent a gallon because the re tailer would add something to the tax to cover the expense of himself and the wholesaler. The man who uses his auto daily, in his business or other wise, would, even for a light car, be thus taxed on gasoline from 84 to $6 a month. Both these taxes would fall on every newspaper which used a gas engine for powr, on every farmer who used a gas engine in his dairy and farm work, etc. But the com paratively wealthy manufacturer using a steam engine would pay no tax Mr. Wilson further proposes to raise 818,000,000 a year by a stamp tax on bank checks, and 120,000,000 by a tax of 25 cents a ton on pig iron and fabricated steel and iron. This latter tax would not only raise the domestic price, but would amount to a tax on experts as well, and so would place American manufacturers at serious dis advantage in the markets of the world. The impression made by this portion of the President's Message was that, fearing that a bond issue sufficient to make good the deficit produced by his party would serve to emphasize that deficit, he sought to increase the revenues by special taxes wholly with out regard to the injustice such taxes involved. Mr. Wilson was far from frank in disclosing the deficit and so mixed up the figures of the past with his discus sion of a military preparedneas pro gram for the future as emphatically to create the impression that he hoped the average reader of his message would be misled into believing that the special taxes he proposed were needed solely (or preparedness. An analysis of his own figures, however, discloses the fact that, leaving the preparedness program entirely out of consideration, the deficit for the coming year, unless revenues are increased by sppcial tax ation, will amount to $80,000,000, leaving, according to his figures, only $20,000,000 in the treasury. He adds criticism to. explain (in a foot-note) that his alleged balance is not a true balance. The president refers to the treasury balance on July 1st as $104, 000,000. Secretary McAdoo now ex plains, in his daily treasury statement, (in fine type at the bottom of the page), that this balance includes $60, 000,000 "to the credit cf disbursing officers," but he does not explain that this is not correctly a balance at all, but the money held to meet the checks drawn on it by disbursing officers, which moneys have already been ex pended but the checks not actually paid. As has been explained before, if Mr. McAdoo had adhered to the sys tem of bookkeeping which the treas ury had employed for upwards ol twenty years his daily statement would Talking Through a Hat May Be Double-Barreled Slang "Proverb." (Our constructive work has started an irresistible movement which cannot be stopped. Anyone who tells you otherwise is talking through his hat." From President Wilson's speech in conference with the Democratic National Committee.) Two score and fifteen Democrats Within the White House dined ; They talked of their accomplishments, Their campaign they outlined; They could not see the G. O. P. It was doomed right off the bat, And he "who told you otherwise Was talking through his hat." The war tax hits our pocketbooks, Carranza hurts our pride, Our ships are safe from Johnny Bull When anchored on our tide. The price of dye has gone sky-high, But when you speak of that Just take it from the president, "You're talking through your hat." We've sent notes to the British lords, We've kicked to Berlin, too ; We've sternly told the warring world The grim things we would do. Our literature was strong and pure, But it was turned down fiat. "Tut, tut," declares the president, "You're talking through your hat." We've stigmatized a million men, We've slashed the taiff , too ; We're put to all our resources To dig up revenue. To circuvent all all argument, Our record will prove that, Having heard the president, We voted through our hat. L. E.

Whether we have ben- ' filed Mexico by the course we have re er.aciing the war tax, and by repeal ing the free sugar clause of the dem ocratic tariff bill, which has not vet gone into effect.

And all this and much more Mr- Wilson said when nothing but interference, which went to the extent of landing troops and shedding blood at Vera Crur, forced Huerta out of, and Carranza into, power; when to day there is a highly unpopular gov ernment in Nicaragua maintained in power solely by the presence of our marines; when we are collecting and disbursing the customs revenues of Santo Domingo, and when we have only just completed a similar treaty with Haiti, negotiated and ratified under the guns of our battleahips and marines, and now awaiting ratification by our senate. Had Mr. Wilson's entire dis cussion of the relations of the United States with its Central and South Amer ican neighbors been uttered by other than a president of the United States it would have been pronounced the cheapest sort of buncomb by everyone familiar with the facts. "I we are to lay aside partisanship for military preparedness, our Demo cratic friends should lay aside partisan ship for industrial preparedness, with out which he shall suffer crushing de feat as soon as the war is over; and in dustrial preparedness means protec tion." This was the answer of one of the Republican leaders of the House when asked what would be the re sponse of the minority to Mr. Wilson's appeal for non-partisanship consider ation of his preparedness program. There is, obviously, strong sentiment in the Republican party for adequate national defense, but il the so-called preparedness program is merely to be made the blind behind which is to be hidden the national deficit and the evi dence of Democratic inefficiency in the administration of the nation's affairs, it is not likely to receieve stalwart Re publican support. Had the President been frank, instead of evasive, had he stated tee facts instead ol trying to becloud them and to mislead the pub lic, his chances of procuring Repub lican co operation for his preparedness program would have been far brighter. The Democratic National Committee has determined to hold the National Convention in St. Louis, beginning June 14th, and it did so because ol the assurances of Speaker Champ Clark and Senator Stone that nothing short of holdng the Convention there could keep Missouri out of the Republican column next November. "I wish we could hold at least a dozen National Conventions," remarked one of the National Committeemen, "for there are at least that many doubtful Stales which need saving just as much as Missouri." St. Louis had a marked advantage over Chicago, however, be cause it was freely admitted that even a National Convention in Chicago, St Louis' chief rival, could not save Illi nois to the Democrats. There was much forced and superficial jubilation among the Democrats at the National Committee meeting, but under the surface there wan nothing but anxiety and gloom. Brilliant Republican prospects are indicated by the municipal election just held in Portland, Me. For the first time in five years that city elected a republican mayor, overthrowing the incumbent Democratic mayor by 1,338 majority in a total vole of 12,000. Furthermore, the Republicans carried two thirds of the city wards. The newly elected mayor, W. G. Chapman, received the largest majority given a Republican mayoralty candidate since 1904. The news is most gratifying to the Republicans, who confidently expect Maine to elect a Republican Senator next fall. Municipal elections held in Massachusetts this week also gave the Republicans a sweeping vic tory. The official figures for the Massachusetts election of last month show that the Republican state candi dates received average majorities of 70,000. From ever quarter the political news brings renewed en couragement to the Republican leaders. Wilson's Auto Tax Opposed The suggestion made by President Wilson in his annual message to con gress that a federal tax be levied on automobiles and gasoline in order to increase the revenue of the country will be brought before a meeting of the executive committee of the St. Louis automobile club, to be held this week. The president's proposal probably will meet with opposition here, accord ing to opinions expressed by St. Louis autoists yesterday. Roy F. Britton, president of the club, yesterday said autoists now felt that their taxes were extremely heavy. However, he would not predict what action would be taken by the executive committee of the auto club or the ultimate opinion that would be formed among the autoists of the city. "Autoists are now paying three taxes," he said. A small car of pop ular make costs annually $3 city tax, $3 state tax, and a personal property tax of 82.35 on every $100 valuation. The president's suggestion would in crease the tax on this machine more than 100 per cent. The federal license would cost $10, and it would cost 1 cent for every twenty miles the owner traveled. "Owners of high-priced cars ate paying $12 city license, 812 state license, and can run only six miles on one gallon of gasoline. The federal tax on a 60 hossepower machine would be $30. Such taxes are prohibitive. Should the suggestion be enacted, the small car owner would disappear. The autoists of Missouri now are paying approximately $250,000 in taxes an nually. The president's proposal would increase that six fold." Globe Democrat. Congressman Chandler of New York and Congressman Copley of Illinois, progressives, announce their adherence henceforward to the regular republican ptrty. Next! Mr. Bryan may be for peace, but ; nobody will give him any. A Bit of Missouri History W. L. Webb, of Independence, a local historian, is responsible for bring ing again to the light the fact that Missouri at one time was a republic all of its own, says the St Joseph Ob server. "This fact," says Webb, "was offi cially and legally declared in the pre amble to the state constitution under which Missouri was admitted into the the union in 1821. "Congress was in an uproar for two two years over the admission of Mis souri, but no objection was at any time urged against the clause that de clared the state to be a 'republic This first constitution continued iu full force until overthrown by the Civil War. "As a republic, the state of Mis souri had its own fitg, a beautiful en sign of blue merino with the coat c! arms of the state emblazoned in gold fiiit on each side. This flag and the stars and stripes fbated together in perfect accord until the war broke out whereupon the State of Missouri de nied the right of any hostile army to trespass upon her sacred soil and therefore flew to arms against the forces which invaded the state under the United States flag. "For one whole year General Price marched up and dowu the state at the head of the Missouri State Guard, which carried the blue merino flag and fought many great battles and was victorious in them all. After the battle cf Pea Ridge, March 7, 1863, the Missouri State Guard disbanded and Gen. Price accepted a commission in the Con federate army, whereupon the state flag was furled forever. In its Siead came the 'Secesh' or Confederate flag. But the State of Missouri did not cease to be a legal republic until 1865, when the Drake constitution went into effect." Attorney General Gregory has ten dered an opinion that the organization of the Federal re erve bank districts is not reviewable. The law says it is not reviewable "except by the reserve board." Which is to govern? The law- or Mr. Gregory's opinion?
