If they grow as fervid when they go Soul has they wei a oo that occasion. guns, pistols aud razors may be laid aside and only African musk used. Land Grabbers Aci Sustained. In au opinion delivered by Judge Harrison of the Supreme Court in two cases last Thursday, known as the'-laud grabbers" cases, the constitutionality of the act was sustained. This was as ex pected. In the first place a court never holds a law unconstitutional unless it be so clearly so, that there is no possible way to avoid it, the utmost latitude always being given to the Legislature in making law.-. It was therefore ex pected that the act would be sustained. But the way out of this outrage on tbe property owners of the State, is to re peal the law, and this can be attended to when we elected our next legislative body. Pledge the candidates to a re peal of it. Didn't Know the Law. Gen. Walker has been twice elected to Congress under the laws of Virginia governing electioue. When he was elected the laws were good enough. Now that he is defeated they are very bad. Gen. Walker, however, showed marked ignorance of their provisions last Monday in Richmond. He grew boisterous when Mr. Lawless, the Sec retary of State, told him ihe packages had been opened before the canvassing board met, but mellowed, when Mr. Lawless showed hiul the law, aud as strange as it may seem, and as much as Cci). Walker had bae„ supposed to study the Virginia election laws, he ad mitted he did not know that there was a provision allowing this to be done. This shows that Gen. Walker has set out to damn the laws, just as many others eh>. it has been no unusual thing to hear men grow furious over them, who could not state any siugle provision they contained. Nen, Walk er is not quite this bad, but he is de nouncing the very beat that twice cur ried him safely over the stream. A Terrible Truth. Years ago if a man stooped to take advautage of another simply because he had the power the entire world de nounced him. Iv this day aud time it is yet a crime among a large class of people, bnt there are many who credit the advantage takers with, being the"' brainy men of our country. The latest crime of this character has just been unearthed and the President of tiits-: United States and Mark Hanna arc the guilty parties. The story is best told, by Hon. John Sherman, who since the I death of James G. Blame, racks as the brightest light in the Republican party. Mr. Sherman says: "I was always a supporter of Presi dent McKinley. You know that what ever he desired to have—goveruor, pres ident, anything—l sustained. They always called upon me, and I respond ed. But Ido not believe that my sug gestions or wishes would now be sus tained by the administration. I con sented to give up my scat ;is I did nor want to appear exacting. Always with I good nat ure 1 have subscribed to the program. I think that I have; been] "They really did not want me in tic- 1 cabinet, but wanted my senatorial If was represented to me tint - could not make up the cabinet without i me, and that questions were coming j along that 1 ought to have eoutrol of. I I know that Hanna wanted ihe rest of! i> y term, and as he had always been friendly to me I did not desire to seem j disobliging. So I resigned my seat and went into the cabinet Mr. Hanna re ceived tbe rest of my term, but wheu be tried for a term for himself he could only get it by a single vote notwith standing thoadministration's support. It then began to be said (hat 1 was growing forgetful and senile. Hanna, whom I had obliged with my seat was among tbe first to say that I had lost ray mentality. It wai wa a very kind return for my vacating my seat foi Was there ever a greater trick played? AVas there ever more deceit prastised than ia this incident'/ Being a man who loves his party Mr. Sherman has Withheld from the public this statement, j but when be Lord that Mr. Hanna, i had said that he, Sherman, was "grow-' ing forgetful find senile." ir was too much for tbe old man and he could not longer withhold the truth thai known only to himself. The Obiausj had always elected Mr. Sherman to the Senate by a unanimous vote, but when Mr. Hanna came along for re-election lie won by one vote and was afterwards I indicti.il for bribery in securing that j much. Men In office should always be j grateful to those who aided them in their promotion, but McKinley and Hanna appear to be without this princi ' pie. What this county needs is men, meu with honor and men who are some-' Commission, so we hear, though really the trouble has been slight. It was con eluded Wednesday, aud President M. E Ingalls, of the ('. &(.)., was the prin cipal witness for the defense. While admitting that the investigation had disclosed a rather peculiar condition of affairs and some iliegal acts, yet in a general wav lie defended the maimer in which business had beeu done as con serving the best interest of all. He made it known iv a very emphatic man- I ncr that hereafter the published I tariff rates of the company would be After btrief arguments by both sides, I .airman Knapp, of the oommis ""- : said there seemed to be no testimony warranting the commission iv making any order respect ing the terminal facil ities of tha road al Cincinnati, as to which discrimination is charged i he general charge of freight discrimination will be treated in some future order of the commission. The chairman said that it was n regretable thing that ■ railroad largely engaged in business should be conducting it in a conceded violation of the mandate ot Congress. ! reused gratification, however, company had promised to here in ply with lhe law. this it will be seen that a railroad y need have little fear of being ■d in fines and costs. There Ins iolation of tariff rates by the aud admittedly one of the must But the chairman of the coin seems indisposed to take ac e was much gratified that Liere b company would comply with which admits that heretofore ot done so. This action ou the he commission will be lcokei suspicion and is calculated to at body into disrepute. When iysagoMr. Wickham, of conn ie road, admitted violai-ions, but 1 to do better, the commission 1 him that this would not do, as mission had a public duty to aud must take hold of viola heuever they appeared. Now le matter has gone off into va the laws' cuds are satisfied with vise of the company to go aud lore. Tiie trouble was that too is proven, and admitted, and mission was in a bole It never intention of punishing the We are now more and the opinion that the commission c. We have always contended people had suffered more from roads since than before, and thai of mer are fit to manage rail ho were wined and dined by them, and traveled in special trains, aud in the most sumptuous palace cars over the Hues they were to pass judg ment upon. Ever since the commission was formed we have been opposed to it, and now more so than ever. It has given the roads an excuse for all the grinding they have inflicted on the pub I.e. This is the first case where a road litis ever plead guilty so far as we know, and so soon as the plea was entered the commission found there was no power given tiieiu to take action. It were far better the commission were wiped out and the roads and everybody els j left this fight began it was doubted whether the, C, & O. could be held, because Mr. ingalls had been so active in the lasl campaign; he bad done so much to pre serve Republican rule. The comnussioi is a fraud on the public. Here area few men who enjoy themselves, they draw large salaries, they fare sumptuously every ciay, they practically do nothing, and no good so far as we have seen has ever come from any of their acts.

The President's ISessage. The President has promulgated his I a uiual message. To tha nation at laiye |it is very satisfactory, it is among tbe first presidential messages that bare ; emanated from a Republican chief magistrate that has been able to tre;;t ; th--country as oris uudivided country, .' tbat has not marked it out, and 6taked [it ofl into sections, and drawn loi g i blcck lines of demarkation through it. "Omnia Gallia in partes tres divisa stmt," wrote Csesar. Ad (iaul is divid ed into three parts. Ali of the United States is divided into two parts, tie Republican Ciesars heretofore have written. Oue is the North the other the South. Mr. McKinley has changed the text, and now.wrir.es the United States as one. He necessarily ln;s much to say about the war. He praises the valor of onr soldiers and the patriot ism of our people, he notes with empha sis our oordial relations with ; ireat Britain aud the annexation of Hawaii, lint he does not lay down any plan for the government of Cuba, Porto Rico or tne Philippines, but ie-ives them for the present to the military rule c . • lished. He recommends au increase lor the appropriation for the Paris exposi tion, c. change iv the extiadition laws. and a conference with Mexico lo avoid .smuggling over the border, he asks for Kw home department of jus'ice, alio .meudmeiit to tlia alien labor laws. I He wants the army Increased to 100.000 men, but does uot recommend any financial lejdtlatiou, any change of the tariff, or a decrease of existiug taxa tion. He discreetly asks for no force : oilis, nor does he propose to stir the country to its depths by asking Con gress to take hold of the race ques:i >::. Had he asked a reduction of taic ; . and for a broadening of our trade by reci | procity or otherwise, we would have little fault to find with his utterances.] Hut let the message l;rek ever so much I we will uot find fault with him for what he has uot said, and we have lir ! tie fault to find with him for wba has Baid. We only hope the party may ■ bss as conservative and wise as its I acknowledged he id has proven himself In this instance. Tiie Union Pacific Railroad with its] side dishes of Credit Mobilier, ex ,j should make Uncle Sam move slowly iv ' the canal business. We want a canal I before we have another war. but wel don't leir.-k for any more "foreign poteu-1 tates" to tackle us for somi time to j come. So tion't be in too big a Lurry , 

STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND VINDICATOR. This subject is waxing warm. The j styrm centers of the opposition are I'.os ton and Baltimore, so say experts. These two large and influential cities are powers of course, but they do not control the destiny of this country as! they must sooner or later learn. The trouble at Boston is that Mr. Hoar has grown old, he thinks in the past in.-tead of the future tense. He, like in uy men who have been giving atten tiou to national affairs, thinks he has a l copyright on the business. But annex ation is fixed and certain, and they who oppose it might as will cry no moreover spilt milk, but go to work to fill the bucket again. Every time the United St itcs lias advanced her territorial lines the pessimists have issued warnings, and c sent forth gloomy foreboding, dangers j haw been abundant. Yet the country ! '•viiii ou regardless ot these sad and sor- I rowfal people. There is no very good Ireason for a large country going to' B c] nicker than a small one. Khode Island is really no safer in its polities] I Idestiny than New York or Texas. Rus sia is no nearer destruction so far as wel lean Bee, than Denmark, or Sweedeu. So that we must conclude that it is not lhe size which weakens. The most powerful nation iv the world is admit ted to be England, aud yet her policy is i.c acquire every foot of ground she can lind. Do any of tho.-e who see so much danger ahead, see disintegration, aud decay in oar mother country ? We are the same people, why may we uot have a government in many respects like hers, and why may we not own colonies aud have our Bag planted as England plants hers in every land and every clime? Let what come, soever, we are now the owners of territory stretch ing nearly half way round the earth, and whilst we have our internal bick cringe, we know of no feeling that can make our home, our central govern-1 ment anything but one of great strength ou account of the loyalty, aud uatioua! devotion of the people. England has unified her home government by rea son of her foreign holdings and colonial I policy. To touch her is to touch a hive, I every inmate is stirred to the utnmst degree. We believe therefore that the same result will follow here. We be lieve instead of weakness the acquire ment of the territory now about to come into our possession will prove a source of strength in that it will broaden our 'conceptions, increase our loyalty, en gender more national pride, and in 'many ways add new strength to every fiber of our being, take us out of our narrow ruts, bring us in touch with the I great world which surrounds us. makes us know by the evidcuce of others than | ouitel yes that we are a great people and '■ enjoy the blessings of such knowledge, and the pleasure of such iiride. » -*_ » Leander I.
