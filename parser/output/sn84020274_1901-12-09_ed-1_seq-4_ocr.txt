Rabbi Hatrison. fTRUE RELIGION IS EMINENTLY PRACTICAL" The Itcrerend X. Luci'o'ck Tolls of the Rotation of Money to Daily Life. At the Union M. E. Church jestcrday the Reverend N". I.uccock, D. D., took for his text, "The Shekel of the Sanctuary." In part, he said: "True religion is eminently practicable. It touches life at every point. It as so ot Judaism. The devout Hebrew was never far away from his God, his soning and reaping, his buying ana selling, his social fellowship and worship were all regulated'and illumi nated from that radiant center, the sanctu ary. It is so with Christianity, the fuil hloom flower of Judaism, of all that it pic tured, prophesied, dreamed and sung. Strauss, in his life of Jesus, criticises the unlettered Gallilean because of the narrow range of bis teaching. The Xazarene, he declares. Ignores science, art, the family and the State. "Socialism of a certain type, mainly French and German, -rejects Christianity lor the same reason. It has no present-day message, thev sav for this tollin-r. baffled -world, beyond resignation and other worldll ness. If this be true; the time for fare wells has come. If the old ship of Zlon bear no nearer hope, belter sail on down lire horizon,, while we 16ok for a braver Ship, nlth a better device, to come sailing through the bitter waters. "But, It W not true. The Bible from end to end abounds in principles, commands add directions for the proper regulation of hu wan.llfc. Man is steadily contemplated, not Only as a son of God, and an heir of immor tality but 41 a human brother, as a citizen of this present worla; a toller and a worker in it; n builder of God's kingdom of holi ness, Justlco and humanity on earth. In the law of Sinai, the foundations of the endur ing society !- laid in a spiritual, regulating principle within and in a reciprocal rela tion without. Christianity at once effectlve lv guards the rlghtl of. man, and as effec tively emphasizes the duties of' man. The 1'rineh Revolution in its wild enthusiasm over the rights of man Ignored the neces sary emphasis on the duties of man, and thus failed. All this because It had broken away frum the true regulating principle religion. ."you cannot have a beautiful landscape c earth without the sky. The fields will aot break forth into blossom and harvest without the sunshine and the rain from heaven. So religion nourishes human life. It Is at once Its regulator, its champion and Its Aurse. The toaster passion that atlr-men most deenly. that move them for ward in great crusades, are these: To en Joy, to"ruie, tp know, to adore; in other words, wealth, rower, knowledge; religion. Xnw a man's. attitude toward these poten tial forces is revealed and, to a good degree, measured by his relation to property, by hi motive and method in acquiring It; by his estimate of It, by the use he makes of it. Hence, nothing bulks so largely in the prac tical Instruction of the Book of God as :ts . teaching concerning property. The books of Moses are so full of It that they still remain the best authority on social eco nomies'. The Psalms and the prophets are full of it, alfo. And our Lord spoke of nothing so much, not even of pTayer. or the Sabbath, as a man's use of property. One day our Ixjrd took a Roman coin bearing the Image ot Tiberius Caesar and made luminous forever the fact of man's twofold obligation', political and religious, and their divine- hntmony. So let us take this shekel f the ranctuary and listen to its present day message. For jne thing, observe that the shekel is boly. It has Its place In the sanctuary. It has Its part and function In worship as truly as the sacrificial offerincr, the altar and th Incense. Doubtless, one reason why offerings of grain and fruit, of flock and herd, of gold and silver, were brought to the sanctuary was the divine (companionship through the whole of human life might be made plain to us. God makes ur toll possible, and rewards it and Is, after 111. the greatest toller of all. He prepares 'the foil for the seed more truly than the MlUf band-can; Ac makes the trees to grow "out of which we build our houses; he stores away the wealth of mines, out of which we tnrlch our Industry, and commerce. We ;wok wltfThls gifts, and out of the Increase - ye gl-c him of his own. And thus all our ..human activities, our industries, our com mercc. our money-getting, may be kept pure and clean and high, in touch with , highest arsoclatlons. The shekel Is holy. "m -i. ,ve.or nioney-may be a root of all evil. That Is an inorrilnstR lnv or if m ,f n end In itself may be an inspiring motive leading to any form of-sln; but only be ca.'.'K.a sood 'ntrument Is put to bad uses. All the end. of trade, the peace and wel fare or community and the Integrity de fend upon the fixed standard of exchange. The shekel of the sanctuary suggests to us .2.J1l,,er order of value which Is also fixed. The most precious thing in money is not the silver or gold It may contain, but a cer 'Mlh moral quality passing into it from the transaction in which it has been employed. If ever)' dollar were tested, would It ring true With full equivalents? Now It does not narrow the range of human activities to touch them with thee higher values. The , -moral, limits are wide enough for the play nt all our energies. It Is legitimate, ven imperative, . to increase the talent". It Is legitimate to hold as much wealth as one can nobly and profitably usi Certain .occupations you would -not engage in. however profitable. You would not steal, nor rob. nor entrap men Into vice. Why? Berauhe of these higher values, which reg ister In the soul. But there .are hair lines in business difficult to trace. Speculation. for Instance, is legitimate: It nromotes In dustry, commerce and advancing civiliza tion. But speculation may be pushed Into sheer gambling. Well, day shades into night almost imperceptibly. However, we do know the difference between day and night. So an honest man can detect the borderland of shadows well enough for safety. Combinations, trusts and even mo nopolies ere legitimate. Without aggrega tions of capital certain great and impera tive enterprises could lot.be undertaken. But If the aim be not service and legitimate reward, but sudden vast and unjust profit, the transaction will not stand In the Judg ment. Beware of covetousness. Capital, through covetousness withholds more than Is meet and oppresses. Labor through covetousness -violently takes more than is meet and destroys. Only through a sense of higher values and higher obligations will Industrial peace come. ,....,. "Many streams of toll, thought. Industry and mutual service meet in a dollar. What a story It could tell of the many ways it has touched human llfc-a bridge of sliver or of cold over which a thousand ministries have passed. This direction occurs In relation to thejubllee. The Jew was never allowed to forget his human brotherhood. The danger of our modern life lies In this loss of broth erhood. Money, which should be a human trend, becomes a wall of separation. Men emphasise the things that separate them from their fellows, and magnify these dis tinctions In many ways. Dives may have been-a cultivated and amiable man in his own circle, but he lived too exclusively wlth- tn that circle. He lost the sense of brother hood and social sympathy altogether and f owed his wealth at last of no valuo In that land where only love Is currency. "The shekel of the sanctuary becomes a subtle test ot human character. The esti mate a man puts on money, what he will or wilt not do tor it, and the use be nuts It to, often reveal 'him 'quite truly. The young man who caught the vision of eternal life kaltet for, a fatal moment and was lost. .What a splendid tne be might have put that lOrrane xo ana now muco more uie wouia to' tn tr. him If tin had risen to its IK-" highest values., Just that Zaccheus did, f -v fcrinflng his tll-Wten rains Into the light vw ana test or toe -sanctuary, wringing nts : srssitn unaer tne law oi rtgnteousness ana 1c ve. he entered into new and full possession of himself and fortune. "Heaven's laws touch our daily tasks and make tbcm opportunities ot growth and ministries of love." 

SAYS GOD'S REMEDY FOR SIN IS ADEQUATE. Isaiah's Vision and the Lesson It Taught the Trophet Discussed by Doctor Henderson. The Reverend Doctor H. G. Henderson, In his sermon at the First Methodist Church, yesterday morning, discussed Isa iah's vision, taking as his text the follow ing words from Isaiah, vi., 1: 10: "In tho year that -King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high end lifted up. and his train filled thentemple." In substance Doctor Henderson said: " "The historic background Is given in a sentence, 'In the year that King Uzziah died." "The Jewish theocracy was on the de cline, and the Roman civilization was just beginning. "The place where the vision was mani fested was the Temple of Solomon. This shrine was standing In stately grandeur. in its noiy oi nones uod revealed himself in tne snekinah. Isaiah, the seen to whom the revelation of the divine glory was granted, was in the flush of early prime, and a character eminently filled for tho exercise of the prophetic office. - "The Infinite God. clothed in the drapery of light, appeared to the prophet. He was fitting upon a throne high and lifted up.' The thrones of earth are grand and gor geous. Often made of ivory and gold, and ablaze with regal magnificence. Here Is an Improvised miniature throne of the liv ing God. "whose train filled the temple.' Gods throne Is In heaven. The earth Is his footstool. The stars are jets In the chandelier of his vast cathedral. The great white throne, where the triune Godhead reigns, is Incomparable In its august gran deur. "Briefly thread the links, 'The Lord sit ting upon a throne' attitude of dignity and majesty: 'sitting upon a throne' a symbol of dominion and power, God's sceptre Is everlasting. 'High and lifted up' exalted In rank. The lofty character of its occu pant lifts it above the plane of earthly thrones.' "Above It stood the seraphim.' this is the only mention of this angelic order in the Bible. They are evidently next to God In the heavenly hierarchy, the chcrutim next in order. They are said by the rabbis to be the ones that love In contradistinction to the cherubim, who know. Seraphs are the depositaries of love. me aimoners oi mis virtue. Tnetr function Is to adore or fly on missions of love. They are six-winged. 'Tn the august presence of God. whose radiant throne was surrounded with these seraphlms. the seer was overwhelmed and cried under the miracle or splendor. Hu mility is a first fruit of consecration. Job tells us the stars that shine in the evening canopy in their virgin beauty are unclean In God's sight. "The seraphim, the highest order of ce lestial beings, that burn and blaze In their primal purity before the throne, are sensi tive to the supernal splendor of the divine glory, and with two wings cover their faces to temner the inefrnhln radlano f the Most High, and with twain they cover their feet to veil their deformity. "God's holiness reveals our sins. The effulgent blaze of the divine glory was an Illuminated background that made the sins all the blacker. Isaiah not only realized his own depravity, but also the guilt of his people. God's remedy for sin. however, is adequate. Then flew one of the seraphlms unto me. having a live coal In his hands.' under the touch of the fire the propht was ready to do and dare." "BEN-HUR" AND ITS RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS. Interest in the Galilean Is Respon sible for the Story's Vogue, Says Rabbi Harrison. At Temple Israel yesterday Rabbi Leon Harrison spoke on "The Religious Element in "Ben-Hur." " In part, he said: '7 am to speak to you to-day of the religious element in the book "Ben-Hur" "Jd '"tfce Play made out of that book. The religious element Is the verv atmos phere of the two compositions. The scene is chiefly laid in Jerusalem: the action oc curs during the first third of thn nrat Christian century. The birth and death of Jesus commence and conclude the story. It is obviously the Immense Interest attach "ig t0 Aho Kreat Galilean that accounts for the widespread vogue of both novel and drama. "So to make profitable to the author this Immense Interest, the personality or the illustrious Jew; is interwoven with the tale, and that the Indolent eye may be arrested with a spectacle vividly presenting the same narrative, the contents of the book are made visible behind the footlights I cannot Imagine the state of mind of one to whom the sublimities of religion are en- """ "i jjn-neiimiion in sensational drama. The religion so represented, it Is true, is not my religion. The chief per sonage shadowed forth In these portrayals possesses, from my standpoint, a, purely historical Interest. Yet as the sentiments of reverence and awe are common to all religions and their followers. It seems piti ful to n Jew that earnest Christiana should encourage cheap catch-penny devices that trade In religious sentiment, and trans plant behind the footlights for a price the sanctities of altar and shrine.

"T5e JZf'TeZ' BlbIe n-" charm and power; so the Christian Testament; but the mass of mankind considers this one personage central. But f all this, our author affords no explanation, no convincing picture. In his Jesus, there Is little charm and no power. He Is an Idea simply, with a voice superadded. No fine lineaments are dis tinctly etched, no subtle Impressions given of characteristics of individuality of the man. The portrayal of the writer Is color less, vague, and where passingly clear Is weak and effeminate. Such a being must have been a wonderful, a mighty, man to give to any the Impression of Messlah shlp or of divine essence. But of all that not a trace In these shadowy and Impor tant delineations. "In its few personal touches. Indeed, the story Is the orthodox one and closely fol lows the gospels. And It does not even follow the gospels with any One apprechu tlon of their worthiest context. Our author does not vividly portray a noble teacher, an unselfish moralist, renouncing, helping, ex cii-jmuii wc nvuucnui magic oc a rare spirit of wonder-working that fills the en tire foreground and rivets the attention of the principals, yes. of the people at large, as here represented. "Has It never, perhaps, occurred to such a writer that to heal the morally sick, the spiritually leprous, to restore dead, stag nant souls to life, would, perhaps, at least to-day. be a mightier appeal to the world's reverence and honorT Even If a man clous lybelleves In every such miracle ot super natural cure, shall he erect that into un natural prominence, shall It be all-in-all, and a truly exalted personage be but a miracle-monger, to shrink and vanish away altogether when the belief of any man or of any generation of men In the miraculous shall have faded into doubt and lncredu MtyT .. . "And as a matter of fact to-day, be it noted with reluctance, or with Indifferenca. the belief in the miraculous is waning and passing: and the faith and Institutions based thereon are menaced by Imminent danger. It Is the miracle of human influence that counts to-day; the purification wrought by a lofty soul, the immense value ot a commanding personality. These elements will survive the crash and wreck of creeds. It Is the man that counts, the human equa tion; and especially the human type, where It touches naturally and universally gn the Divine. "It Is the human types that arrest atten tion; that condense history. And we are pre sented with two human types' of absorbing Interest; one a Roman, one a Jew. The one is. a Roman, conquering the world and en slaved by conauest: DauDerized br his very prosperity, degenerate in his domination. Two pictures reveal and describe this soldier-sybarite. The one Is tho Grove of Daphne, where Love reigns without law; where the cup of pleasure meets the eager lip; where beauty is denizen, and conscience is dead, and the servile world hides its fet ters with roses. And the second Is the Ro man galley, where the masters of the world scour the seas for conquest, and drive their ships with slaves chained to the boards. Pleasure and Power were the twin deities of sensual, masterful Rome. "iiessala, the Roman, hates Ben Hur, the Jew, as Roman paganism antagonized and fought to the death, to its own death. Jew ish monotheism. Hebraism and paganism strove together In deadly combat, and tho Hebrew David, the tiny champion, slew the gigantic heathen Goliath. There Is In this tale a climax of surpassing Interest. Tho ironv of Fate or shall we say the provi dence of history? brings together thee two bitter enemies, the Roman Messala. and the Jew Ben Hur. The Jew. like his na tion, liad been exiled. ensla-ed. oppressed and at last, under powerful protection, re stored. They meet face to face with the vat multitude cheering on the Roman. It n rhnrint nffl thnt whizzes bv: two men. straining, quivering, wrought up to that tension that burns up years in moments. The whole world had doubted not the Ro man wins. Their roar deafened him. He speeds and speeds, and vainly strains with strength and trick, to beat tho Jew. His fortune wagered: his very life upon his stake, and-the hoofs of thunder eat up space, but still his rival flies with even pace, faster, faster, and the Roman crashes down at last to ruin and defeat, and the Jew has won the race. "Ah, it was Judiasm that won the longer fight, or shall we say, in the broader sense. Hebraism? Unspeakable vice was clothed In royal purple. cruelty ran riot, the limits of a nation bounded Its respect for men. humanity was not-dreamt of. Then sud denly into the world there came an as tounding change. A divine enthusiasm that philosophers could not kindle, simple Jew ish peasants could. Barbarians os the Romans called them, fishermen, artisans, a little knot of poor, plebeian country men, were to be tne yeast mat snouiu leaven the world. Without culture, with out the philosophy of the schools, without the external advantages of fortune, power. authority, their teachings spread, tneir ois clrcles multiplied, their message readied the four corners of the earth, cut through the underpinning of an ancient civilization, and on the summit of its toppling ruins built up In proud pre-emlnece the throne of the-church. It was not an army, It was not an organized force, it was not a phys ical compulsion, it was the power of an Idea, of a, Jewish idea in Its morals and human sympathies, that moralized, that humanized the ancient and the modern world. "And in the tumults of the nation ere the fall we sec ngaln at the end of the story the Galilean dreamer. He antago nized the priesthood In the temple, the In numerable Pharisees, by his bitter denuncia tions, and estranged the people nt large by his Indifference to their burning patriot Ism. He fell, like many a Hebrew prophet before him. and with his death entered into unri-ersal fame. "Not such a one had they eagerly await ed as their Messiah In the paraxyams of their expiring nationality, but a heTo rather and lntreDld leader to restore the dories of David's thrqne and the Independence of David's countrymen. "It is the feast of lights to-day. The tapers burn that mark the life and death of Maccabean herwei. Thev are tapers, tho candle that the blinded traveler needs rath er than a star, the shining valor longed for. by a perishing people, rather than Utopian dreams. And still. the Jewish tapers burn. And still the Chrlstlnn, cross Is lifted up. Until perchance at the end the worshipers of a sorrowing one. are merged into tho people of sorrows: and the lights of Chanka fade Into the universal light."

"Did Jesus act thus? Nay. he rather took the Iambs Into his bosom. 'Neither do I con demn thee' aro his wonderful words. A lamb Is weak, and If it tries to follow tho large sheen in their wanderines. It Trill often stumble and fall. It will become en tangled In the briars and lost In the dark ness, -unless the older sheep or the shep herd help it. Now, a good Bhepherd takes such weaklings, that cannot travel. Into his bosom and carries them, and gently leads even the old sheep that are lame, or weak, or blind. "Jesus Is the good shepherd, and when he finds a iamb that Is a weak member of his flock, he helps It. Such weaklings are described in the epistle where Paul warns against offending them, or causing them to fall. They are such who believe and are really disciples, but because of little In struction, or little grace or experience, or because of specially dominating sins, are not able to do, think, believe, eat or drink As other Christians, who are stronger, may do safely. A lamb is never-a stubborn, un believing hypocrite, who simply wants his way, without trying honestly to find out whether It Is right or wrong. A lamb is a Christian,- but weak, weary, footsore, by battling with doubt and uncertainty so long. He is probably as deeply wounded by Satan's despafrlng doubts, that he would die' if no help came. "Paul's lambs or weak ones, were weak In knowledge. Paul says. "I know.' He had the knowledge tl.at It was right to eat and to drink, at all suitable times and all suita ble things, but others doubted If it were right to cat meat sold In the market, which had before been offered to Idols. This ques tion presented many aimcumes io euiuc, who said: 'Meat offered to an Idol is usual ly partaken of by the worshipers of that Idol, hence, do we not become worshipers of the idol by eating that meat, even though we buy It In open market?" "Paul said: 'The Idol Is nothing, and the meat cannot possibly be spoiled by Its be ing offered to such a nothing, and is sold on the market; but,' he continued. 'It by eating meat I cause my brother to fall, for whom Christ died. I ahall eat no meat as long as the world stands.' How gently and yet .pos itively he receives these weaklings! Jesus received sinners and ate with them, so often that It became a serious charge against mm on the part of the, Pharisees. .But what salth that living Savlor?-'I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance, and they that be whole need not a phys clan. but they that are sick-' .in.d. tho dnticr'n friend, even, and especially, of those whom we usually despise those whom Christ condemns not.

THE REVEREND M. RHODES. Who celebrated the thirtieth aniversary of his pastorate of St. Mark's English Lutheran Church. The Reverend Doctor 31. Rhodes, pastor of St. Mark's English Lutheran Church, preached his thirtieth anniversary sermon as pastor of the congregation. Notwithstanding his advanced years, the doctor Is reasonably strong and fills his ecclesiastical offices with ardor to the cause which he serves. For a number of years he has been a member of the International Sunday School Lesson Committee, and has had much to do In shaping the work of that committee. He Is also a trustee of the United Society ot Christian Endeavor and president of tho Board of Education of tho English Evan gelical Lutheran Synod of America. From early manhood he was a close stu dent, improving his spare time in gaining knowledge. He mastered Greek and taught it in an academy before he entered the ministry. After becoming a minister ho served two pastorates before coming to St. nounce that person, cast him oft and per sonally regard him as no Christian one who ought to be excommunicated. Is that right? Jesus says: "Judge not." We do not know but at that very moment that person may be a far better Christian than we are, labor ing, however, under peculiar difficulties. "Woe unto us who condemn. Wo cast our own pearl away by denying it to others. We deny that very love by which alone wo stand. We banish ourselves from that fam ily circle of received sinners if we will rot associate with tbcm. Let us receive them into our bosom of Jove, of prayer and of Christian attention to help them over their difficulties, else their difficulties will fall up on us and crush us. Woe unto him that de spises a sinner a Iamb, a weakling in the faith! The Good Shepherd will assuredly require his blood at his desplser"s hands. "Wherefore, receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to tho glory of God." 

UNIVERSAL VIEW TAKEN OF ALL BIBLE TRUTHS. The Reverend Doctor Lee Says a Proper Perspective Is Neces sary to Understanding. The Reverend James W. Lee, at St Johns Southern Methodist Church, yesterday spoke on "Christian Key of History." Ho said In part: "Perspective Is a word used much among architects. It means to see the whole object, or building, before the observer. It refers to seeing things In proportion, and as they really are. Intellectually and phil osophically, It Implies such a conception of the nature of things, as corresponds to tho contents, order and relations of the whole. Such a view, for Instance ns Hegel sought to give In his system of philosophy, or, as the one, Herbert Spencer seeks to give us In his. "Truth cannot be arbitrarily created nor can It be established any more by mere authority, as in the time of tho great coun cils. The truths of the Bible are accepted, because they have been found, through tho experience of the most competent. con-e- craiea men on cartn. to ue in accordance with an eternal spiritual order. And any honest. earnest man. who will put the teachings of the Bible to the test, will find that spiritual order verified In hii own ex perience. The basis upon which the author ity of tho Bible rests Is changing. "A universal view is necessary to a proper particular view. A correct Idea of the dog star Is Impossible unless one has some Idea of the whole machinery of tho heavens. The man who does not see but one thing, does not see that properly. In the Scrip tures Christ Is presented as all and In all. all things In glory, all things in creation, and all things In redemption. He is called the Alpha and the Omega. The origin of all visible and Invisible worlds and creatures. AH the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, whether pertaining to God or to man, to heaven or to earth, to provldenco or the fu ture, ore In him. He Is the head over all things, because In him all the fullness of the God-head has a bodily expression. He bridges all extremes and mediates between all that Is highest and lowest. It is true that man can never exhaust the fullness of his being, but he can know that he Is in It, living and moving, and through the holy light Of his life, he can look out upon God ana numamiy ana tne universe, ine past, the present and the future, and thus get a view that harmonizes all the facts of exist ence, v. "Christ is the prototype of every man, and In him God, the universe, providence. Scripture and humanity center. Relng the prototype of everv man, he is human, and was human from" before the foundation of the world- As the oak Is in the acorn, so all humanity was in Christ before the world was. Christ sees of the travail of his soul and Is satisfied In the case ot every man who realizes the eternal, essential self with in him. through faith In his Redeemer and Lord. The triumph'of the whole creative, administrative and redemptive process Is seen In the complete realization of the im age of God In man. "Nothing absolutely can add to the sig nificance, the majesty, the glory and tho wonder, of the simple, silent, blessed, eter nal and universal truth, as It Is and as It always will be In Jesus Christ our Lord. No Wohder the Psalmist exclaims. "Let all that are In heaven and all that are In earth, and under the earth praise him. Praise him In the heights, praise him In the depths. both young men and maidens, old men and children, let them, praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, his glory Is above the earth and the heaven.' Let everything that hathja-eath praise him. Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad.' In the heavens his glory hath triumphed and In the earth. In the life of man.,his glory and his essential nature is latent. Implicit, and will triumph. "In order that wo may have a universal view. We must look at all things through a principle, a life, a personality In which all things are summed up. From the valley la which Grindelwald is situated, one gets Louis, one at Sumberry. Pa., aild the other at Lebanon, Pa. After ten years ot experience In these two pastorates Doctor Rhodes u.ime to St. Louis, arriving In December. 1S71, and took charge of St. Mark's Church. The building was unfinished at the time, and the main part was not dedicated until the following January. Within ten years the membership so Increased that a new church became imperative, and tho present site was chosen rnd the building erected at a cost of 

JCI.OCO. When the congregation entered its new building twenty years ago there was a debt of J32.W0, which was not entirely paid off until three years ago. Doctor Rhodes stands high as a minister, as a pulpit orator and as a pastor. For years he lias been more or less identified, with prominent religious movements in the city, and. with one exception. Is the patri arch pastor of the cltv. This exception Is the Reverend Doctor S. J. NIccoIK pastor of tho Second Presbyterian Church, who has passed his thirty-eighth anniversary in this relation. a very limited perspective, but from the top of Jung-Frau. he gets a. view that takes In France and Italy and Switzerland and Germany. The universal life Is in man, but it is in the valley covered and held down by mountains of sin, and the conse quence of sin. In Christ the universal In man Is triumphant, enthroned In glory. But when the universal in man triumphs through faith In Christ, then he has within himself a standpoint from wlilch to get a universal outlook. For the spiritual nature Qf man is more universal than creation, and Is ns high and deep as eternity. It was In the Word, which was In the beginning and which was the archetype of man. "According to the teachings of astronomy, tho earth In company with the whole solar sstem Is being transported through space at the rate of 1W,U09,0W ot miles every year. Who knows but that we arc advancing on n path through the heavens ultimately to bring us into a region where the earth shall be bathed In an atmosphere of such bril liancy as to turn the globe into a paradise, where the ice will melt at the poles, and where all the desolate places of the worid shall find themselves covered wit verdure and filled with song? Whether we are to reach far out in the untraveled spaces such a region no one can tell. There Is not any doubt, however, but that the human race Is moving through an Infinite domain, in company with the lord Jesus Christ.lts head administrator and redeemer, to a cltv whose f.iir mansions are up to the ttjJe of our faculties, and whose builder and maker is God our Father." "SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD." Things Overlooked in the Hurry of Everyday Life Explained by -the Reverend "Mr. St. Clair. Tho Reverend H. C. St, Clair at Trinity Church took as a text, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." Mat!, vi. ."3. In part,-he said: The text to-day reminds U3 of something-, of bomethinr which In the hurry and bustle of eeryday life Is often forgot ten, it tells us about sorting God. hrst. best and in the truest way. Consider then this statement as tho outline of the ser mon I will preach to ou this morning. I would tell you about serving God in the first, best and in the truest way. if upon a lonely road, from which many another road branched oft, we should meet a trav eler who should ask us the way, we should think it strungc If he failed to earn out our very first direction. We Indeed would not think It so very strange If after carry ing out some of our directions he should finally became contused, but to full to profit by our very first direction given to him, we should think Indeed strange. "And j ct hew do multitudes of people act undsr the same circumstances? How do we act? We, too, stand where many a road crosses and rccrosses. There can be but one right way. And wj have had such plain directions and yet bow many get lost. .how many lose the road to tho .Father's house. And thousands of thousands are lost because they fall to carry out the very first direction given. The gospel nar rative tells us the very first step neces sary, it is very Diain. How can we fall to at least start right? It is this: "Seek ye first tho kingdom of God and his rlghteousnesp." Isothing cc-.ild be plainer than these words. The kingdom ot God ! and hl3 righteousness are placed as the great things to be desired and sought aft er and struggled for, while other things of less value and importance are to be Judged In tho light of their own value and importance. Of what value the meat and the drink and the raiment and the pleasant view. If the road upon which we travel be the wrong road? Of what use to worry and fret over getting these? "Wo find the answer in the gospel of St. Matthew, from which the text is taken. The explanation Is this: "No man can serve two I :attcrs; for eltner he will hate the one and leve the other, or else he will hold tc the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.' "Alas, the story of the fall of man Is that ho chose self Instead of God. Although God had said ot certain forbidden knowledge, 'the day thou portakest of It thou shalt surely die,' man listened to the voice of the tempter, who said. Thou shalt not surely die.' " 'For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what commun ion hath light With darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Bsllair We stand and wonder, first, that there should be any so foolish or so Ignorant as to make a choice which accepts darkness instead of light and death instead of life, and sec ondly, that there should be those who would attempt to harmonize- these things. Many people live out their lives serving these twa' masters, first one, then the other, usually at the same time,. and at tbe. inconsisten cies of such Christians Satan laugbs. "It's a real danger -which confronts Christians. The danger of not being able to determine where the heart Is. Not one of us but would have our hearts fixed where true Judges are to be found. "The great safeguard is to love God. After we have sought him and sis righteousness let us obey just as far s we are able the first and great i iiiuiaaspin n ' Let us love God with all the heart 2d soul and mind. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with nil thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. The truest way Qod is a spirit, and they who would worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. "FOR THEIR SAKES I SANCTIFY MYSELF." The Reverend M. Burnhani Dis cusses Christ's Consecration of Himself to Ills People. The Reverend Doctor M. Bumham. pas tor of Pilgrim Congregational Church, preached yesterday morning on "Christs Sanctiflcatlon of Himself and His People, taking as a basis the words of Christ as recorded in John vii. 13: "And for their sake.-. 1 sanctify myieir. tnal mey ai might be sanctified through the truth." Ha said In part: . "Reverently we stand before this chapter. This prayer or Christ is a rich legacy for his church. The great purpose of our Re deemer's life is brought out In It: the vital union of Christ with the Father, of Christ with his church. "The theme is practically one of double relation, or a theme that Includes two things, our Lord's sanctiflcation of himself, and our Lord's plan for the sanctiilcatlcn of his people. The word sanctify there is the same word as under the Jewish ritual. "There was much that was symbolic In the outward cleansing, but. es all such cleansing was the type of what was Inher ently true of the spirit, the outward cleans ing had a moral significance. Ceremonial sanctiflcatlon stood for moral purity and inner sanctiflcatlon. So Paul speaks of the Gentiles as being sanctified by the Holy Ghost the same word, meaning Inward snnrflfientlnn Henentedlv the EDlstlCS make use of that word sanctiflcation to ex press the purification of the hearts of tbe Gentiles by the influences of the Holv Spirlt. Paul speaks of drunkards ana sucn as washed and sanctified. He also says that Christ gave himself for his church, "that he might sanctify and cleanse It with the washing of water by the word. Again, For both he that sanctifleth and they who are sanctified are all of one." Also. "Where fore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate." "But to sanctify means to set apart to a sacred use. In this sense our sanctiflcation must begin in moral cleansing. There Is not one of us that hath not sinned and come short ot the glory of God. There Is not one soul on the footstool that will. through its own moral purity, apart from Christ, ever enter heaven; all must enter heaven under the cover of the cleansing blood and by the power of Calvary's cross. It Is too late in this twentieth century to talk of human Innocence meriting heirship with heaven, save as the life becomes In herent through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and we are cleansed from the guilt ot sin and saved from the love of sin by him. "The church of God is set apart from a common to a sacred, holy use. A man can teach certain things without being Christ's; a man con be a farmer, or a me chanic, or a student, in a sense, without being Christ's, although he has no moral right to live any life apart from Christ. But a man cannot be In the church of God, In his place and In his power, without be ing set apart to a holy use and service. "Again, it is the consecration" to a sacred and holy use which gives God the leverage power In his church. Tour and my conse cration Is not an abstraction: It Is a self devotion to the sacred uses for which God designed us. I ask the question to-day of myself and of you. In all solemnity. To what do you consecrate yourself? Here Is the church, with Its toll, with Its care, with its anxieties; here is the dying world; here Is a suffering humanity; here is a lost hu manity." . PULPIT OPINION OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Reverend Frank G. Tyrrell Discusses Welfare of the Nation Praise Awarded. The Reverend Frank G. Tyrrell, pastor ot Mount Cabanne Christian Churcbpreached yesterday morning on "National Welfare; a Review of the President's Message." His text was from Matthew xxi, 43: "Therefore. I say unto you, the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you. and shall be given to a naUon bringing forth the fruits there of." Mr. Tyrrell said: "It is wholly gratuitous to assume, when a minister announces a sermon such as this, that he Is to deliver a political partisan harangue, or In any way degrade the pul pit. We should never forget that God deals with nations as weU as "with Individuals. Through a nation he wrought to give us a revelation of his will: through the loins of a nation came our Savior; and, as seen In this text, tbe establishment, advancement and final triumDh of his kingdom Is Insep arably connected with a nation or nations. Collective as well as individual, national as well as personal righteousness Is demanded; and how can we ever have it If we never studs its conditions? "Again, the President's message deals with the great issues which confront us, and they should be studied In the light ct God's word and in his fear. Our statesmen and others who represent us should seek so to view all national questions. Such digni fied, earnest study of public measures by the Christian citizens of the land cannot but be most wholesome, God forbid that the time should ever come when the churches are too holy or the preachers too dignified to be patriotic. Many a church needs the discussion of great questions and biblical Il lumination of political problems to save It from bigotry. Intolerance and perpetual and shameless littleness. "The message opens with a discussion of anarchy. This shows kindness and consld erateness, as well as the desire to secure Infrlotaflnn nnnnrtlltlMl "Tllh tTIPflSUrAS nrO, posed to exclude anarchists and punish them for their deeds are wise: but. while in per fect sympathy with the measures, I find my self at variance with the social philosophy underlying them, as stated by President ltooseveit. opcaaing ok tne miiuiuibi, io says: 'He Is not tne victim or poiuicai or social Injustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of his crim inality Is to be found In his own evU pas sions and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on. not In any failure by others or by the Stata to do Justice to him or his. This is not only an erroneous statement, betraying a very superficial study of the question, but It Is contradicted by fair in ference from other parts of the message. The President's remark may be true In an Individual case here and there, but as a generalization it is entirely false. "When he comes to speak of Immigration In connection with this grave problem, he betrays the same want of discrimination. He asks for an educational test, because It would tend to decrease the sum of Ig norance, so potent In producing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order, out of which anarchistic sentlaent Inevitably springs.' According to this, ig norance is the mother of anarchy. But the President has Just admitted that certain anarchists belong to the class of 'intelligent criminals.' I think that if he will recall his history, he wi" greatly modify this and ah .ifnllo. lat.mpnf& rfia ma!rA Is trans' and comnrehen- slve.

He Is not so ana- t..iV.4i h in bin message to the New York t oiisiature. when Governor; but he Is specific when he comes to the remedy. "Publicity." he declares, "is the only sUre remedy which we can now Invoke. " And that Is about as sagacious as the decision ot the rata that they must put a bell on the cat! Supervision must always depend on a supervisor. May it not easily be that the trust manipulators can hoodwink any honest supervisor, and would they, hesitate to bribe the dishonest? Then, what becomes of your "publicity'? I regret with all ray heart, that the history of such M""ns of wealth and power up to the present prove that they are conscienceless. A more rational and statesmanlike suggesUon would have been to ask for a thorough In vestigation of the so-called eras of the trust, and In every case where they are perpetuated behind the law, whether the tariff or any other law. A fair Held and no favors Is all the American people ask ot Congress and the President.

Several times throughout the .message appears soma statement which declares the unity of so ciety. For instance.

ESAU'S FOLLY USED ' M AS AN EXAMPLE. The Reverend T. C. Carleton Spoke on the Trading Birth- rights. j' The Reverend T. C. Carleton or Lafayette Park Baptist Church spoke on tradmst birthrights, taking his text from Genesis xxv. 33. In part, be said: "Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. For 3.700 yenrs his blunder has) been to the world a warning- against the folly and rashness in dealing with Inherited! rights. Still the Esaus have been multiply ing continually. And for every footlals E.sau there Is always some demon-possessedi Jacob to drive a sharp bargain. Alas, that men will sell their souls! "There are blrthwrongs as well as bnrth righti. Herein the multitudes are enthraHl so that it is easy and natural to play the) fool and bargain the greater for the less, the eternal for the temporal. Adam, ana Eve had only birthrights, but In the exerclss of their right to obey or disobey they chose) the latter, and thus brought upon them skives and their posterity depravity or In clination to sin. Though with proclivities) slnward man Is still free. He has the birth right of the truth, conscience and the spirit of God to show him his possible galas ana possible losses, and to give him the neces sary aids to Judgment and win to decide foe the right and against the wrong-. Eve sola her birthright of innocence and favor wlta God for the forbidden fruit that she did not need. How many girls and women to day are selling their Innocence and fhTot with God for trifles that please the taste. the eye or the ear! Truly Mother Eye has) many daughters. How many boys and men, like Adam, sell their favor with God and their moral Integrity for a woman' nwur and companionship In her sins! "Perverted and weakened natures ana wills are our blrthwrongs. But where sun has abounded to hurt Brace has much) more abounded to help. So we hare the birthright ot repentance and faith throota which weget rid of sin and all Its conse quences. Though born sinners we have toe birthright of betas; born again, ret-rerMtated: thus becoming the children of God. Th brings us Into new and greater birthrights. By the natural and universal birthright ws hasre access to Christ and pardon andanew; life, with a new nature, through' repent ance and faith.

"The dignity and Importance of ma among created beings Is shown by these birthrights, and freedom of dealing wltl them. The range of man's possibilities foe. good or evil are marvelous and incalculable. Before him are the birthrights of the sn of God, and likeness to Christ In characte and In position.
