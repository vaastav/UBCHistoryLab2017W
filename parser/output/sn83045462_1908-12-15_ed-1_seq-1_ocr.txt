The message follows: ! To the Senate and House of Representa- I tives: | In view of the constant reiteration of { the assertion that there was some corrupt , action by or on behalf of the United States government in connection with 1 the acquisition of the title of the French j company to the Panama canal, and of < the repetition of the story that a syndicate of American citizens owned either one or both of the Panama companies, I J deem it wise to submit to the Congress ; all the information 1 have on the sub- i ject. i These stories were first brought to my J attention as published In a paper in In- , dlanapolis, called the News, edited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The stories were ' scurrilous and libelous in character and J false in every essential particular. Mr. Smith shelters himself behind the i excuse that he merely accepted the state- < ments which had appeared in a paper < published in New York, the World, owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It Is telle to say that the known character of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that the ] statements in that paper will be believed , by nobody; unfortunately, thousands of persons are 111 Informed in this respect ' and believe the statements they see in 1 print, even though tliev appear in a news- 1 paper published by Mr. Pulitzer. A member of the Congress has actually introduced a resolution in reference to j these charges. I- therefore lay all the facts before you. , Denunciation for Press. The story repeated at various times by the World and by its followers in the newspaper press is substantially as fol- I lows: That there was corruption by or on behalf of the government of the United State* in the transaction by which the Panama canal property was acquired from Its French owners; that there were improper dealings of some kind between agents of the government and outside persons, representing or acting for an American syndicate, who had gotten possession of the French company; that among these persons, who it was alleged made "huge profits." were Mr. Charles P. Taft, a brother of Mr. William H. Taft, then candidate for the Presidency, and Mr. Douglas Robinson, my brother-inlaw; that Mr. Cromwell, the counsel for the Panama Canal Company In the negotiations, was in some way implicated with the United States governmental authorities in these improper transa<*-> tions; that the government has concealed the true facts, and has destroyed, or pro cured or agreed to tne destruction or. certain documents; that Mr. W. H. Taft was Secretary of War at the time that by an agreement between the United States government and the beneficiaries of the deal all traces thereof were "wiped out" by transferring all the archives and "secrets" to the American government, just before the holding of the convention last June at which Mr. Taft was nominated These statements sometimes appeared in the editorials, sometimes in the news columns, sometimes in the shape of contributions from individuals either unknown or known to be of bad character. b \[ WAS

The wickedness of the slanders is only surpassed by their fatuity. So utterly paseless are the stories that apparently :hey represent in part merely material collected for campaign purposes and in >art stories originally concocted with a riew of possible blackmail. The inventor of the story about Mr. Charles P. Taft. for instance, evidently -upposed that at some period of the Panama purchase Mr. W. H. Taft was Secretary of War, whereas in reality Mr. W. H. Taft never became Secretary of War until long after the whole transaction in uestion had been closed. The inventor of tlie story about Mr. Douglas Robinson had not taken the trouble to lind out the fact that Mr. Robinson had not had the slightest connection, directly pr indirectly, of any kind or sort with any phase of the Panama transaction from beginning to end. The men who attacked Mr. Root in the matter had not taken the trouble to read the public documents, which would have nformed them that Mr. Root had nothing to do with the purchase, which was entirely arranged through the Department pf Justice under the then Attorney General. Knox. Pulitzer to Be Sued. Now, these stories as a matter of fact need no investigation whatever. No nf nroof lias heen. or can tw> nrn. iuced In behalf of any of them. They L-on.slst simply of a siring of infamous libels. In form, they are. In part, libels upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft and Mr. Robinson for instance. But they are in fact wholly, and In form partly, a libel upon the United States government. I do not believe we should concern ourselves with the particular individuals who wrote the lying and libelous editorials, articles from correspondents, or articles In the news columns. The real offender is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor and proprietor of the World. While the criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer has been guilty is in form a libel upon individuals, the great injury done is in blackening the good name of the American people. It should not be left 10 a private citizen to sue Mr. Pulitzer for libel. He should be prosecuted for liivel by the governmental authorities. In point of encouragement of iniquity, in point of infamy, of wrongdoing, there is nothing to choose between a public servant who betrays his trust, a public servant wlto is guilty of blackmail, or theft, or financial dishonesty of any kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph Pulitzer has been guilty In this Instance. It is therefore a high national duty to bring to jus tice this vilifler of fhe American reople. this man who wantonly and wickedly and without one shadow of justification seeks to blacken the character of reputable private citizens and to convict the government of his own country In the eyes of the civilized world of wrongdoing of the basest and foulest kind, when he has not one shadow of justification of any aort or description for the charge he has made. The Attorney General haa under consideration the form in which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall ba brought. Meanwhile. 1 submit to you all the accompanying papers, so that you may have before you complete information on the subject.

REVOLT IH THE HOUSE Republican Insurgents and Democrats Cause Scare. MAKE A SHOW OF STRENGTH Take Leaders by Surprise and Put a Motion Through. FINALLY LOSE OUT, HOWEVER Parliamentary Melee Indicates That Factor Exists to Be Reckoned With in Future. Revolt, organized, open revolt?broke out in the House of Representatives today. There was a outer, out moouiess engagement between the republican insurgents who want to revise the rules of the House, allied w itli the entire democratic strength, and the regular republican organization standing behind its field marshal, "Uncle Joe" Cannon. At the conclusion of the scrap the insurgents, with their democratic allies, retired from the field in disorder. But notwithstanding the defeat of the allies "Uncle Joe" and his friends have a whole lot to think about, because, for a while, the result was very much in doubt. The parliamentary melee today demonstrated that the insurgents of the House, allied with the democrats, may he a factor to he reckoned with, and that their boast, that they would bring about radical changes in the rules at this or ilie next session of Congress may not be an idle one after all. Trouble Starts Early. The trouble started very soon after the convening of the House today, when Representative Gardner of Massachusetts, the leader of the insurgent forces, arose and moved to discharge the House committee on foreign affairs from the consideration of his resolution asking the Secretary of State to inform the House of Representatives whether he has in h;s possession arty information as to whether or not the house of commons has recently adopted a resolution to the effect that a committee of eight members from that body he immediately appointed to consider the existing rules of the house of commons and recommend changes, if any are deemed desirable. Much to the astonishment of the regulars and the delight of the republican insurgents and the democrats tlie motion was carried. 140 to TM. Regarded as Dangerous. Immediately, emboldened by this success. Mr. Gardner made a motion to strike out the lirst half of Ills resolution, which, if carried, would have left it in the followIn^ dangerous form: "Resolved. That a committee of eight members of the House be immediately appointed. five to be selected by the Speaker and three by the leader of the minority, to consider the existing rules of the House ; and to report, not later than February 1. ' JboP. wftat changes, if any, It is desirable j to make." i The regulars were much flustered by this excellent tactical form on Mr. Gardi ner's part, and there wa? something of a flurry on tthe floor and in the press gat' lery. where the import of this proposition was fully understood. There seems to be no question but tliat tlie organization was taken by surprise, and that the House leaders, in view of the previous t vote which registered a victory for the ' republican insurgents and the democrats. : were apprehensive regarding the outcome. Dalzell Makes Point of Order. Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania. one of the big Ave of the House, j immediately jumped to his feet and ? fc? T r* /~\ -\ t T T A r T * T*/*\ T ^ f "T? M r KU.Vl J IMP, IU I I Alll. shall, From Time to Time, Give to n." Art. II, Sec. Ill, Constitution < made a point of order against Mr. Gardner's motion declaring that the strik. ing out of the Hist half requesting information concerning tiie houses of commons of Great Britain from the Secretary of State deprived it of its previously privileged character. Quoting many precedents of liis own and of Speaker Carlisle and others of his predecessors in the chair, Speaker Canon held that Mr. Gardner's motion amending his original resolution was out of order. Then Mr. Gardner reg stered an appeal from the decision of the chair, and upon this appeal the yeas and nays were ordered. The greatest interest was manifested during the call of the roll on this proposition. The organization won out. but the vote was close, the ruling of the Speaker being sustained by a vote of 149 to 136. Lays Resolution on Table. Immediately afterward Mr. Gardner moved to lay his resolution on the table, which was done. This closed the engagement for the time being. Previous to making his motion to lay the resolution on the table Mr. Gardner offered time to any member of the House wishing to discuss the I merits of the proposition. But no one took liim up. As lie stood there looking: around the House, as if expecting one or more of his insurgent comrades to rise and ask for time. Sereno Payne, chairman of the House ways and means committee a'nd the majority floor leader, looked over to Vjr. Gardner and, without rising from his seat, called: ".Your resolution does not seem to have any merit." Dead for Present Session. ' After the conclusion of the scrap Mr. Gardner admitted to a Star reporter that the resolution was as dead as a door nail so far as this session of Congress was concerned. He intimated, however, that the Insurgents and the democrats might yet have something up their sleeve. The insurgents undoubtedly wanted a test of strength, and they got it. Many of t>hem professed to bel eve that the demonstration will have an excellent effect upon the House organization and leaders and make the big five and other powers In the lower branch of tlie national legislature intolerant of criticism more willing to listen to suggestions with respect to certain changes in the rules.

TALK OF AN INVESTIGATE Strong Disposition in Both House to Probe Into Operations of the Secret Service. Not only are both houses of Cangre as determined as ever to administer I dignified rebuke to President Rnnstev* for liis criticisms of Congress in his r cent annual message, but they are rea< to go one ntep farther even than ths It became known today that there is distinct disposition among the repnblicai and democrats of both branches to cau a thorough investigation of the seer service by a congressional committee, at perhaps by two. This action, if it is taken, will folio the adoption of a resolution of censnm It can be definitely stated that the res lution of censure will be introduced in tl Senate within the next few days, probab today or tomorrow. All of the stories the effect that Congress would back wat in this affair are without foundation. It will be a republican who introduce the resolution. Senator Hale of Mali and Senator Burrows of Michigan are t! prime movers. The principal reason f the delay has been that the right man take charge of the matter on the floor hi not yet been determined upon. Apparently No Defenders. Senator Hale will undoubtedly introdu It himself if no other republican senat can be induced to do so. The stateme was made today that Senator Dillinglia of Vermont had consented to undertal the task. It seems likely that the resolution w be referred to one of the standing cor mittees of the Senate, as has been stat< heretofore. The rumors current sever days ago to the effect that there would strong opposition to the resolution on tl floor of the Senate from Senators Bodi of Massachusetts. Beveridge of Indiai and other friends of the President seer today to have been without foundatio Mr. Beveridge has said that he had 11 considered the matter at all one way 1 the other. As for Mr. Bodge, all that cs be said is that he has not given eviden of a determination to stand up for M Roosevelt when the matter comes up. I i ue reason mat mere will probably 1 i no great opposition on the floor is th the resolution which Mr. Hale has dra* up is not as severe as it might be. does not contemplate the expunging fro the Record of tlie portion of the Pre; dent's message which treats of the seer service. No Real Quarrel With Him. It has been stated that the Senate real had no quarrel with the President in co nection with secret service strictures, i 'he did not intend to reflect in any w; on the Senate. To back up assertions this character it has been pointed out th the provision in the sundry civil appr priation bill passed at the last sessii curtailing the operations of the seer service, which was the basis of the Prei dent's intimations that congressmen we afraid of being investigated, was reject by the Senate when the bill came fro the House. This situation, however, is really havh no effect on the minds of senators. Ft while it is true that the Senate did reje this portion of the bill when it was tir considered by that body, later the Sena and House conferees put it back in agai and the Senate adopted the conferen report. In other words, the Senate tak as much of the responsibility as does t House. i SdOLHOUSES IN f j SOI

This is an epitome of the findings upon kg the physical condition of the public schools of Washington, following a rigid investigation made by the special committee of well known architects and buildera appointed by Engineer Commissioner Morrow, and which has been reported to him. JS The District of Columbia has not kept pace with the other large cities in its school house' architecture, the committee reports. The blame is placed at the door of Congress for not being more generous ss with appropriations. a The committee makes it plain in its fit report that it has avoided intentionally e~ any attempt to fix responsibility for derely it lictions that exist. After describing in detail the conditions j a ns as they relate to architecture, construcse tion, arrangement of hallways, rooms et windows, exits, tire escapes and tire prevention the recommendations of the comlW mittee are presented. This report was submitted to Commiso sioner Morrow yesterday afternoon after three weeks', work. One. hundred and lv . thirty school buildings and a number of to er rented buildings u?sed for school purposes were examined. Afterward twenty-seven es stated meetings were held at the commitie tee s headquarters in a room in the Dishe or trict building. The committee notes that during the is twenty years following the origin of the present form of government, in which j period most of the schoolhouses were pc constructed, the plans were prepared 01 by the building inspector, but from n t m 181)8 to the present time most of the plans ie for schools have been prepared by architects appointed by the Commissioners and working under the supervision of the presS(j ent building inspector and his predecesal sor. th" Fire Hazards Considered. The question of tire hazards is then tak?e en up by the committee. This subject it la treats as of three classes: ns First, where inflammable materials are oi within communicable distance of Are used or in the building. in Second, where materials are stored within buildings of a more or less easily r' ignitable nature. Third, woodwork used in the construcat tion, finish and fitting of the buildings vn which would make a 'ire more easily jt transmittable throughout the building. im Under the first class of hazards are par3). ticularly described several of the older buildings" which were not in any way built with proper safeguards against flic." It was found that during the past year most of these had been tireprooted or lire proly tected. _ Within the second class of these tire hazards the committee noted considerable as quantities of more or less lnnammaoie *y materials stored in the buildings, but of noted, also, in tills respect an improved at condition over the recent past. The committee makes suggestions look[j* ing to the removal from basement build" ing of carpenter shops and quantities of , lumber stored nearby for the service in " this connection. ' Criticism is also made of the use of oil as floor dressing. Under the third class of Are hazards is noted a more or less extensive use of wood in the older buildings and use of wooden wainscoting, wooden ventilating ducts and various wooden partitions and wooden lockers and other furniture. te Fire Dangers in Detail.
