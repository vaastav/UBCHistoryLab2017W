PHES DEUT'S MESSAGE President Roosevelt lu hi annual , rnessago again urge! the enactment of j a law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He J also urge the passage of tbe measure conferring upon the government the light of appeal In criminal cases cn questions of law. Continuing, the president suys: I cannot too Wrongly urge the pas- sage of the bill In question. A failure j to pass It will result lu seriously bain- J per'ng the government In It effort to ' obtain j entices especially against) wealthy individuals or corporation who do wronr, and 121:13 also prevent the government from obtaining Justice ;r ' wagewojl.crs who are not them- j stives able efT cllvely to contest a case i whir- the Ju.lgiumt cf mi Inferior court ),; been against them. 1 have -pee !!: -ally In lew a le-cent elecMou by a district Judge living railway cmployee without remedy for viola- tloii of a certain so calh-d labor statute. The Import;. mc of enacting Into law tho particular bill In question Is fur ther Increased by the f.. t that the gov ernment lwis now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust 11 n 1 Interstate commerce cases w here such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper I ae of Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection -with tbe Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying Injunctions lu labor cases should be wholly abolished. It la at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of Injunctions In such eases would stand the test of the courts. In which case, of course, tbe legislation would be Ineffective. More over, I believe It would lo wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of Injunc tions. It Is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands In upholding the law, and If roen seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no Im pairment of the power of tho courts to doal with them In the most summary and effective way powlble. Rut ao far os possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some audi law os I advocated last year. Airlt Lrnchtn. I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us and, above all, to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now In one part of our country, now lu another. Each sec tion, north, south, east or west, has Its own fuults. No section can with wisdom spend its time Jeering at the fadlta of another section. It should be busy trylug to amend Its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption It Is necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certainty lu the execution of the law. When we deal with lyuching even more Is neces sary. A great many white men ore lynched, but tho crime Is peculiarly frequent In respect to black men. Tbe greatest existing cause of lynching Is the perpetration, especially by black men, of tho hideous crime of rape, the most abominable In nil the category of crimes, even worse than murder. lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon, ami when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations nml lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two thirds of the lyuchlngs are not for r.iue at nil. while a considerable 1 proportion of the Individuals lynched are Innocent of all crime. There Is but one safe rule In dealing with black men as with white men. It Is the same rule that must be ap plied In dealing with ri li i.icii and poor men-that- i, to treat each man. whatever his c A y, his creed or his no dal position, with even handed justice on his real worth :is a man. White pes ip!e owe It quite as much to tVin selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that be deserves such treatment. There Is no question of social equality or negro domination Involved. lu my Judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as Is the ca with murder. Assault with Intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least In the discretion of the court, and provision should be made by which the punish ment may follow Immediately upon the heels of tho offense. No more shortsighted policy can be imagined than In the fancied interest of one class to prevent tbe education of another class. The white man, If he Is wise, will decline to allow the negroes In a mass to grow to man hood and womanhood without educa tion. "I'rrachera o? Mere IHacontent." In dealing with both labor nnd cap 1 1 mi 1. with the questions affecting both corporation and trades unions, there It one matter more Important to re member than aught else, and that Is tbe Infinite barm don" by preachers of mere discontent. The are the 11. en who seek to excite a violent cla- ha tred against all men of wealth. They week to turn wise and proper move incuts for the better control of corpora tions and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth Into a campaign el hysterical excitement an I falsehood In which the alio U to In flame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogue and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometime seek to as xiate themselves w"! those working for a genuine reform In governmental 'and social methods and sometimes mas querade as such reformers. In reality I they are tbe worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, Just as tbe purveyors of sensational blunder In i newspaper tr magazine are the worst 'ii:nii'S of nil men who are engaged lu an honest effort to better what It La i In our tioclnl and governmental condi tio!'. ''Corruption is never o rife a In com munities where the demagogue and the agitator bear full away, bemuse lu such communities all moral bauds be come loosened, and hysteria and sensa- i H. ti . i.. ,. ........ ,1 "'" ir,.-.."- . man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure 1 11 the end to turn toward uny leader who can restore order, and then their relief at being free from the In- i tolerable b-:i l' Tis of class hatred. vio lence and d tn..g"-y Is such that they c annot for some time be arouse, to l:i- i donation against misdeeds by men of i wealth, ho that they permit a now 'growth of the very abuse which were In part responsible for the 01 li-inal oiit- j hrcuk. The one hope for success for I our people lies iu a resolute and fear less but sane and cool bended ndvanee along, the path marked out last year by this very congress. There mut be a utern refusal to bo misled Into ful lowing cither that base creature win) appeal and pander. to tho lowest In stincts and passions In order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally lase, but no baser, who In a spirit ot greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortune seeks to exploit bis fellow Americans with callous dis regard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others In order to obtain a high ode stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred Is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. The plain ieople who think the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors owe It to them selves to rememter that the roost dam aging blow that can be given popular government Is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Railroad Employ' 1 1 car. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure la a very moder ate one, and I can coneelvo of no seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far os it is In our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal tho general In troduction of an eight hour day. There are Industries In which It Is not pos sible that the hours of labor should be reduced. Just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, If In the tropics, so situated that thero Is no analogy between their needs and ours In this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for Instance, tho condi tions are In every way so different from what they are hero that on eight hour day would be absnrd. Just as It Is absurd, so far as the Isthmus Is con cerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work Is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. Hut tho wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that nllke from the merely Industrial stando!nt and from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can In the direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough Investigation of the conditions of child labor nnd of the labor of women In the United States. Tie horrors Incident to the employment of young children lu fac- t tries or :t work anvwhere are n blot 011 our civilization r ...li-. ..' ..11 '..,.! I by employer there are unavoidable ac cldents and even deaths Involved In nearly every line of business connect ed wilh the mechanic arts. It Is a great social injustice to compel the em ployee, or. rather, the family of th.' killed or ill-abled victim, to bear the entire burden of tc1i an Inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks Its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the Injury comes from what may be cnlled the legiti mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due In nny hue of Industry to the actual conditions un der which that industry Is carried ou should be paid by that portion of the community for the benefit of which tho Industry Is carried on that Is, by those who profit by the Industry. If the entire trade risk Is placed upon the employer, be will promptly and prop erly add It to the legitimate cost of pro duction and nsses It proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It I therefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Ct tl t n I ami Labor Itlaitulea. Ifecord show that during the twen ty years fioui .Ian. 1, isi, to lec. Ml, 1 ' mn 1, there were f'rike allocting 117. rift' e.stablii-buent., and 1 ' .". V. I em ployees were thrown out of employ ment. I Miring the same perio 1 there were l,"t".i .cottt.4. Invohinx nearly pi,MHi e tn7'tid,mcut, throwing over l.'Xjo.oiyi p.-ople out of employment. These strikes and lockout Involved au estimated los-i to employee of $.",)7, U00,i M und to employers of $113.(. 000. a total of f i:,i).0(H).tixi. The public suffered directly and Indirectly prob ably as great additional loss. Many of thes strikes and lockouts would not have occurred bad the par ties to the dispute been required to appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for their con- tentlon. The exercise of a Judicial spirit by a disinterested body repre senting the federal government, such as would Is? provided by a commission ou conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create an atmosphere of frjend llncHs and conciliation ; between ' con tending parties. Control oC Curpumlloat, It cannot too often be repeated thrt experience has conclusively shown the Impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different stato legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporation which do not oper ate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, wheth er by a national license law or in other fashion, wo must exercise, 21ml that at an early date, a far more complete control than at piesent over these great corporations a control that will, among other things, prevent the evils of cx- '; vesslve overcapitalization and that will compel tho disclosure by each big cor ! poration of its Mock holders nnd of Its 1 properties and business, whether own ed directly r through subsidiary or ntllliated t orporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of laor j din ate profit by favored Individuals at ! the expense whether of the general 1 public, the stockholders or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control It as I to see that It results in no harm to the people. Combination of capital, like combina tion of labor, is a necessary olenient of our present industrial system. It Is not possible completely to prevent It, and If It were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combina tion, but to secure such rigorous and adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their Injuring the public or existing in such form as Inevitably to threaten Injury, for the mere fact that a combination Las secured practically complete con trol of a necessary of life would under any circumstances show that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the public Interest. It Is unfortunate that our present laws should forbid all combinations instead of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combinations which do evil. He bates, for Instance, are as often doe to the pressure of big shippers (as was shown lu the Investigation of the Standard OU company aud as has been shown since by the Investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the Initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining Improper advantages at the expense of small shippers and of the general public. Buch a combina tion, instead of being forbidden by law, shouUJ be favored. In other words. It shouljbe permitted to railroads to make agreements, provided these agree ments were sanctioned by the Inter state commerce commission and were published. With these two conditions complied with It Is Impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the' public at large. Inheritance and Income Tax. The national government has long derived Its chief revenue from a tariff on Imports nnd from an Internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there is every reason why, w hen next. our sys-! tern of, taxation I revised, the national ' government should Impose a graduated i Inheritance tax and. If possible, a grad- , tinted Income tax. I am well aware that such u subject a this need long and careful study lu order that the people may becomo fa miliar with what I proposed to be dope, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with wisdom and self re straint and may make t:p their minds Just how far they are willing to go in " e'Kis.a- ,"r' !Ul n'"'I' 0,lt '"' project lu Iieecs- ary detail. Hut I feel that In the near future our national legislators should enact n law providing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily In creasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bomieM or devise to nny Individual or corporation. There can be no question of the ethical pro priety of fh government thus deter mining the 'conditions upon which nny gift or inheritance should be received. As tho law now stand It Is undoubt edly difficult to devise a national In come tax which shall be constitution:.!. I'.ut whether It I absolutely Impossible Is another iptestlon, pud If possible it Is most certainly desirable. The first purely Income tax law was passed by the congress In 1S51, but the most lm porta nt low dealing with th subject was that of IS'.M. This the court held to be unconstitutional. Tbe question 1 undoubtedly very in tricate, delicate and troublesome. The decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It Is the law of the land nnd of course Is accepted as such and loynlly obeyed by nil good citizens. Nevertheless the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole In coming to 11 conclusion, when considered to fetlier with prcvioii divisions on thu subject, may perhaps Indicate the poj. sihillty of devising a constitutional la com tax liw whhh shall sulci. intlally accomplish the icsU;i. nlnusl at. The dllliculty of amending the constitution Is so great that only real tie.-esslty can Justify n resort thereto. Kvery effort should be made in dealing with this subject. II With the subject of the proper control by tbe national govern ment over the ue of corporate wealth In Interstate business, to devise legis lation which without such Of tlon shall attain the desired end. but If this fall there will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment. Indaatrlal Training. Our Industrial development depends IsrgHy upon technical education. In-' eluding In this term all Industrial edu cation, from that which fits a man to Lho a good mechanic, a good canenter 'f blacksmith to that which fits a man to do the greatest engineering feat. The skllled ine hanlc, the skilled work man, can best become such by tech-, nlcal Industrial education. The far reaching usefulness of Institutes of technology and schools of mine or of engineering Is now universally ac knowledged, and no less far reaching i the effect of a giwd building or me chanical trades school. 11 textile or watchmaking or engraving school. In every possible way we sh vild help the wagewoiUcr who tolls with hi hands and who must (we hope In a constantly lm reading measure' also, toil with bis brain. Under the eonstitu tl !i the national legislature can do but little of direct impoitnnco for hi wel fare save where he is engaged In Work which penults it to act under the In terstate l omiii'Tce clause of the consti tution, and tills Is one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the legis lative nnd Ju lii ial bram-hes of the pv eminent will con-true this clause of the constitution In the broadest possi ble manner. Tlte farmer. . The only other person whos .,1 fare is n vital to the welfare of th whole co- try as I the welfare of the wagewo ts are the tillers of the soli. the farmers. tseveral factors must cooperate In the improvement of the fanner's c6n dltlon. lie must have the chance, 1. senso, Ir e senso w hich keeps ever h,, view the ntluiate relationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Organlxstlon has become necessary In the ' islness world, and It has ac complished much for good In the world of labo-. It Is no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good In Itself and Is capable of a well nbxh Infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It Is kept to Its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage arc partly economic and part ly socio'1 'deal. Irrlaatl n4 Kornt Preservation. Much now being done for the states of tho Hocky mountains and great plains through the development of the national policy of Irrigation and forest preservation. No government1 policy for tho betterment of our Inter nal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Dl-raree Legislation. I am well aware of how difficult It Is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, In my Judgment, the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to tho au thority of the national congress. The change would be good from every standpoint. In particular It would be good because It would confer on the congress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently w ith iolygamy, and this should bo doue whether or not marriage and divorce are dealt with. It Is neither safe nor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by lljo several states. Merchant Marine. Let me once again call the attention of tho congress to two subjects con cerning which I have f;v'iently be fore communicated with them. One Is the question of developing American shipping. I trust that n law embody ing fn substance the views or a major part of the views expressed In the re port on this subject laid before the house at Its last session will be pnssed. It seems to ine that the proposed meas ure Is as nearly unobjectionable as any can ls. The C'tirrem-y. I especially call jour attention to the second subject, tin condition of our currency laws. The national bank act ha ably served a great purpose In aid ing the enormous business deviiop merit of the country, and within ten year there has been an Increase In circulation per capita from 'fl'l.tl to J'k'I.O's. Tor several years evidence has been accumulating that additional leg islation 1 needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasize the de fects of the present laws. There must soon be n revision of them, because to leave them ns they are means to In cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation lu the Interest on' call money from 2 per cent to .10 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of tho treasury had to step In and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. I do not press any especial plan. Va rious dans have receutly been pro poped by expert committees of bank ers. Among the plans which are possi bly feasible nnd wjilch certainly should receive your c ' deration Is that re pcatedly brou;;' f your attention by the present se ry of the treasury, the essential : jires of which have N-en npprovV y many prominent bankers and l , ties men. According to this plan, - t 0n.1I banks should be permitted ti-ue a specified propor tion of their capital In notes of a given kind, the Usim let be taxed at so high u ro' a t drive the notes back when not wanted In legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional prof Its, but to meet the emergency 'resent ed by time of stringency. I do not Kiiy tint this I the tight sys tem. I oftly advance : to emphasize my ls'llcf that there 1 "1 f r the adoption of some sys! is!l be automatic nnd ope oond banks so ns to avoid a. of dlsetimlnotlon nnd favoritism. The law should be amended so as "PIncally to provide that the fund derived from customs duties may be treated by the secretary of tho treas- ury as he treats funds obtained undet the Internal revenue laws. There should be a considerable Increase In tills of small denominations. Permis sion should be given banks. If necessa ry under act tied, restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger amount than three millions a month. Oar Outlylutf I'oaaraaluna. I most earnestly hqe that tho bill to provide n lower tariff for or else abso lute free trade In 1'hlllpplno products will become a law. No harm will come to any American Industry, ami, while there will be some small but real mate rial benefit to the I'llipinos, the main beneiU will come by the showing turide a to our purpose to do all In our pow cr for their welfare. I'orto Itletiw Attn Ira. American rltlvti.ship should be con- f erred mi the citizens of l'oito Kico. ! The harbor of San .Juan. In I'orto IiicoJ should be dredged and Improved.

This exposition In Its pur Itowca and scope should appeal not only to the people of the Pacific slope, but to the people of the United Htates at large. IMabta of Alien. Not only tnuwt we treat all nations, fa but we must treat with justice ar rood will all Immlgcants w ho come h. under tho law. Whether they are Cutb Me or Protestant, Jew or gentile, wne'uer they come from Kngland or (Jen any, Ilussla, Japan or Italy, mat tem nothlnr. All we have a right to tj icatlou Is the man's conduct If he b; honest nnd upright In his dealings w.r'his neighbor and with tho state, tt he Is entitled to respect aud good treal nent. Esjteclallj do we netsl to rememlKT our duty to the stranger within our gates. It Is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or In any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who Is con ducting himself projerly. To remem ler this Is Incumbent on every Amer ican citizen, and It Is of couriy pecul iarly Incumbent on every government official, whether of the nation or of the several states. I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed tovv-rd the Japanese In this country. TH hostility Is sporadic and Is limited to a very few places. Never theless It 1 most dlscredlUble to us as a people, and It may le fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. I ask fair treatment for the Japaneso as I would ask fair treatment for (Jer tnans or Ungllshmen, Frenchmen. Rus sians or Italians. I ask It a due to humanity and civilization. I ask It as due to ourselves, because we must act uprightly toward nil men. I recom mend to the congress that an net be pnssed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here Intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrass ments attending the performance of our International obligation I the fact that the statutes of the United States are eutinly Inadequate. They fall to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through Unit ed States courts and by tin; uy of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rlht secured to them under solemn treaties which nre the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statute of the United States be so amended and add ed to ns to enable the president, uclng for the United States government, which is responsible In our Interna tional relations, to enforce the rights of alien under treaties. The ( ulmn .Matter. Last August an Insurrection broke out In Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cuban govern ment was powerless to quell. Thanks to tho preparedness of our navy, I was able Immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent the situation from Is'comlng hopeless, and I fur thermore dispatched to Cuba the sec retary of war and the assistant secre tary of state In order that they might grapple with the situation on the ground. In accordance with the so called Piatt amendment, which was embod ied In the constitution of Cuba. I there upon proclaimed n provisional govern ment for the Island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor un til I e oul. 1 b- replaced by Mr. Ma coon, the late inlnl-fer to Panama and gov- : riior of the enit.il zone on the Isthuiu 1 'Inwij.s were sent to support them and to relieve the navy, the expedition be ing handled with most satisfactory pvd and ellielencv. It ace has conn In the Island, nnd the harvesting of the sugar cine crop, the great crop of the Island, Is about to proceed. When the election has been held and tie new government Inaugurated In peaceful nnd orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an end. The United States wishes nothing of Cuba except that It shall prosper mor ally and mnterhlly nnd wi-hes nothing of the Cuban sive thst they shall l able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their Independence. If tin' elections become a farce and If the insurrectionary habit ! becomes confirmed on the island it Is absolutely out of the question that the Island should continue indepeudspt, and the United States, which has as sumed the sponsorship before the civ ilised world for Cuba's carevrn a na tion, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The Hl Conference. Tho (second international conference of American republics, held In Mexi co In the years l(U :!. provided for the holding of the third conference within five years and committed the fixing of the time and place and the arrangements for the conference to the governing lsard of the bureau of American republics, composed of the represent; lives of nil the American nations i i Washington. I hat hoard dlschare'J the duty imposed upon It with marked fidelity and pains taking cure, and upon the courteous Invitation of the United States of P.ra zil the ec.fifer.iieo was held lit lib) do Janeiro, continuing from the -.'.d of July to toe ir.it li of August List. Many subjects of common Interest to all tho America i nations were discii'scd by tin? con'erence. and the conclusions reiu lnsl, embodied In a scries of reso lutions Mid proimed conventions, xvill Ih laid before you upon the Coming of the final report of the American dele gates. Panama Trip. I have1 Just returned from a trip to Panama and shall report to you at length later on the whole subject Of the Panama canal. Tbe Alceelraa Convention. The Algeclras convention, which was ; signed by the United States as well as by most of the Kwers of I'urope, su persedes the previous convention .of' 1SH0, which was also slgued both by the United States and a majority of tho European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial rights with all Kuropcan countries and does not entail a single obligation of uny kind upon us, and I earnestly hope It may be sjs'edlly ratified. Seallaa-. The destruction of the Prlbllof Is land fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues. The hi I, which, according to the surve y r do In 1874 by direc tion of the congress, numbered 4,700, 000, and which, according to the sur vey of both American rnd Canadian commissioners In 1K91, amounted to l.om.OOO, has now beei reduced to about l80.nu). This result has t-een brought alsout by Canadian and some ' other sealing vessels killing the female seals while In the water during tuelr annual pilgrimage to and from the south or In search of food. Tho process of destruction has been accelerated during recent years by the appearance of a number of Japaneso vessels engaged In pelagic sealing. Suitable representations regarding' the incident have been made to the government of Japan, and we are as sured that all practicable measures will be taken by that country to prevent any recurrence of the outrage. We have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with Oreat Prlt aln for adequate protection of tho seal herd, and negotiations with Japan for the same purpose are In progress. The laws for tlie protection of the seals within the Jurisdiction of the United States need revision nnd amendment. Second llnuue Conference. In my last message I advised you that the emperor of Itussln had tnken ! the initiative In bringing nbout a scc- ond peace conference at The Hague, j Under the guidance of Itussln the nr 1 rangenient of the preliminaries for ; such a conference has leen progressing during the past year. Progress lias necessarily been slow, owing to the great numlor of countries to be con sulted upon every question that has arisen. It 1 a matter of satisfaction that all of the American republics have now, for the first time, been Invited to Join In the? proposed conference, j Army and Xirf. It must ever be kept in mind that war Is not merely Justifiable, but Im perative upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where pence can only Is) obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of national welfare. The United Slates navy Is the surest guarantor of peace which this country possesses. I do not ask that we con tinue to Increase our navy. I nsk merely that it Ik? maintained at Its present strength, and this can be done only if wo replace the obsolete nnd out worn ships by new and good ones, the equals of uny afloat In any navy. To stop building ships for one year means thnt for that year the navy goes back Inst "ad of forward. In Isith the army and the nAvy there Is urgent need that everything Hssble should be done to maintain the highest standard for the personnel alike as re gards the orilceTs a lid the enlisted men. I do hot believe that In nny service there I n finer body of enlisted men and of Junior olllcers than we have In both the army and the navy, Including the marine corps. West l'eiint and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. Wo do not need to have fhi-se school m.clo more scholastic. On the contrary, we'should never lo. skht of th. fa. t that the nlm of each school to turn out a man who shall be above everything else a fighting man. There should soon, be au Increase in the number of men for 01. r cnat de fenses. These men shouM be of th right ype nnl properly trained, and there should therefore he an Increase of pay for certain skilled grade, espe cially In the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troops to be massed In body and eierciscsl In maneuvers, particularly In marching.
