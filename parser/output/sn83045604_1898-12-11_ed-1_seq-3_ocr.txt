Dec. 10.—A special to the BTibur.e from Washington say-. A report that the preeident intenda to visit and Porto Rico at the first favorable opportunity has Ucomt known in the atate, w and navy departments, and waa quick |y made the -subject of serious fcpeculatton among various officials on account of tha exceedingly interesting questions it raised. Am ong other thing 3 there was a apontane «ta revival of the Action that t&e chief ex acative could not pass the boundaries of the United Spates without forfeiting his office. .It is peculiar how persistent is the notion «ven am >T.K higher officials that some con stitutional or statutory restriction confines the executive to American soil, when, as a Blatter of fa» % a.'nough none of President McKiniey*"! pr<-d«- '-."sor* have ever left the eountry during t..e.r term* of office, their actions w>re alone affected by tions of propriety or precedent, which no one could hoid to apply in the present in glance. It *!U generally recognized that the president might j aturally wish to make g personal t>ur of Inspection in those isl ands as soon as he could spare the time from pre».ng public business in Washing ton, and th*t no valid objection could stand against such a tour as he was understood to contemplate it is pointed out, how ever, that it would be practically impossi ble for him to B(xire the time requisite for auch an extended voyage a* that to Porto Biro before congress adjourns on March 4, Which is, fortunately, about the best time of year to make a short stay in the tropics. During the first six weeks of the new year, la addition to the continuous executive rou tine tnjah.e-s. the social obligations involved In the programme of public receptions and State dinners would restrict the president etc v .eiy to Washington, and after next week's Southern tour, he will hardly tind It possible to leave the White House for ■lore two days at a time before the beginning of I<ent. and the middle of Feb ruary. For the ensuing two we*ks, with the ruah of legislation which marks the closing days r.f a short se>-«!un of congress, th>-re will be no leisure for the executive, and therefore his pennant could hardly fly in the harbors of Porio Rico before the mid dle of March. _ With llavHria only a single night's run for the dispatch boat Dolphin from Tampa, there might lie a chance for the president to spend two whole days there in a w«>ek - s ahaence from Washington, and remain al ways In close telegraphic communication With the executive departments, m, that If a critical emergency occurred he coulj be In a railway train speeding toward the eap- Ittal within twelve hours No thought is entertained, how. ver, of a presidential trip to Havana before the* tfpan'sh (tag Is hauled down on January 1.

But no one appears to controvert the r;ght as well as the advisability of th« •xt-cotiTt visit to the new American pos sessions, provided it does not involve toe lor;g a n enforced absence from Washing ton. Before the outbreak of the war with Spain the of a presidential vi.-i: to Hawaii wm thoroughly canvass-*!. Ii was held by competent authorities that tht president would not t« compelled to leave the Jurisdiction of the United States, even , momentarily, during such a tour, as he j would be constantly or, American territory on a national vessel, even when on the high seas. In this case, however, the long voyage would have required the president to be wiuiout means of communication with Washington for at least a we#-k at a time, and even had there tx-en a cable to Hono lulu, he would have been out of touch wit the country for at least two periods of flv days each. These considerations prohl ited further contemplation of the visit. When the president visits Porto Rico d Cuba he will undoubtedly be aecompr *'■£ by Mrs. McKinley and several memt* the cabinet. with their wives, and, the stay of the j>arty in each port will not be longer than a single an absence of two weeks from Wa* ns ' on will be necessary.

This opinion still pre f'.JU though it has been somewhat modi r. 'p the explanation which the amt>assa j'' e.nt to the French press. It Is now { ,'ght Munson got an official tip to give jiice a warning, but that he spoke more , aly than waa intended. The address, wever, has served as a reminder to the eopie of both countries that the tire of i»e Soudan embrogiio is still smoldering tnd may burst into flame before it * inally disposed of. The ambassador's varning. according to those qualified to mow, was prompted by the fact that the •'rench government, sulking over the Mar hand affair, ts evading d.plomatic d.scus lion of pending Anglo-French problems, iiid was intended to intimate that with the hange of French ambassadors at London na week. Baron De Courcel being succeed ed by M. I'aui Cambon, the Marquis of Salisbury desired more active treatment of he points in dispute. Sir Edmund J. Munson's manly frank itiß is quite characteristic of the lor arid won for him the warm friendsh.D ■f Czar Aieiander and Emperor Franc s fos»-pn, both of whom asked the British ore-fcu office to send him to tluir resDoc ;lve capitals when he quitted Copenhagen, «rhere we was persona grata at the :ourt. He chose Vienna. Air. Chamberlain's speech on Thursday. ;mbracirig the whole range of domestic and 'oreign politics, aroused as much interest ibroud as at home. He forecasted the luiusterial domestic legislation of the coni ng session, and then held out tiie olive i-ranch to every foreign country except France, to which he administered a salu ary caution, which has been but little rel shed there, and which evoked all sorts of lews paper threats to thwart Great Br;t un's nrojecta. Mr. Chamberlain spoke lukewarmly on he subject of old age pensions, once his scheme, and refrained from promising the Dill which had been expected on the sub iect. Uut he promised hve measures to as sist the working class to acquire their own 1 Sellings, j romote secondary education md to insure the safety and h-.-alth of workers in dangerous trades. Mr. Cham berlain's declaration that an agreement vith Russia on Chinese affairs is desirable ias made a d<~> p impression In view of his 'orrner utterances, in which, referring to btUK-ia's evasion of agreements, he said: "He who sups with the devil must have i long spoon." This remark gave great umbrage to the zar, and it was then thought it boded ill tor a future understanding. The friendly references of Mr. Chamber ain to Germany suggesting mutual help in natters of common interest have met with i favoraMte reception in Germany. Vhe >res3 comments show veiled Joy at the pros ed of an Anglo-German entente, but the German papers refrain from an effusive llsplay of gladness, evidently with the >iew of securing the best part of the bar fain.

Sir William Ver lon Hareourt's position in the nominal eaderthlp of the Libera! party is insecure, jeeause it has n,»t been definitely establish es by the united voice of the- party, and it re eel \ed a rude shaking when Lord Rose rwry emerged from temporary retirement arid delivered mat bold rastioda qeclara tion. which resolved itself into a bid for the It adership.

Spaia Will Grow Tobaees. It is said that Spain has resolved to give permission for the cultivation of tobacco in the Spanish provinces. This will in crease the revenue of Spain, and she will revenge herself on the Americans, as the St>anish tobacco is expected to seriously compete with the American-grown weed. 

UORKKU FOR RECIPROCITY. Both Sides of the Anglo-America* Commission Discuss the Matter. WASHINGTON', Dec. 10.—Both sides of the Anglo-American commission held meetings today, to pave the way for the joint session on Monday, when efforts will be continued to get together on some ba sis of reciprocity. At the meeting today each side canvassed the extent of conces sions it was ready to grant and expected to receive. While the differences are quite material, members of the commission said today that there was no reason to take a discouraging .view of the outlook, as there were strong hopes that the differences on reciprocity, which are conceded to be the chief obstacle, could he reconciled. It is said President McKinley has taken occasion, during re cent talks with members of the commission, to express a most earnest desire that suc cessful results come of the negotiations.
