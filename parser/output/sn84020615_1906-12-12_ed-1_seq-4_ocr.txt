ALBUQUERQUE EVENING CITIZEN. PACE FOUP. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1906. the Albuquerque citizfn Published Daily and Wkly. tty The Citizen Publishing Company W. . STRICKLER, President. W. T. McCREIGHT, Business Manager. NEW MEXICO COAL PRODUCT The coal Industry la jtrowltiR la New Mexico, ac cording to the figures given '.he secretary of the Inter ior through the governor of the territory, by Jo E. Sheridan. New Mexico mine Inspector. This Is ac ceptable Information, though It Is difficult to realize here in Albuquerque, whore the price Is higher, the qual ity poorer, and the quantity scarcer than for the past few years. , According to Mr. Sheridan, the New Mexico output for this year la 1,726,738 tons, an Increase over last year of 254,630 tons. This Increase Is at the rate of 17.29 per rent. The value of the product at the mines Is given at 12,279,940.40, which is but a slight Increase over the value of last year, and cannot account for the Increase of cost to the consumer. The average number of employes at the mines was 2.354, of whom sixty-four were hoys. This shows an Increase over last year of twelve boys and 247 men. In this connection The Citizen understands that Rome parties In Albuquerque are hauling coal from the Hagan coal fields, some thirty odd miles across country, finding It cheaper to do so than to purchase that delivered here by cars. The people of New Mexico can certainly en dorse the recommendation of Inspector Sheridan that cocgress be asked for an appropriation for an Investiga tion into the character, extent and value of the coal fields in this territory, such as congress mode for a similar Investigation In Oklahoma and Indian Territory. No doubt this matter will be called to the attention of Dele gate Andrews. 

FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Henry Clews, In his Weekly Financial Review of December 8, tells us that money continues to com mand almost exorbitant rates on the stock exchange; that In spite of the enormous Increase In the supply of money, bank reserves are exceedingly low; that the scramble for gold exists in all the principal money markets of the world; that there are In prospect large Issues of securities by many railroads for Im perative Improvements. From these things he anticipates continued ten sion In money matters until the contest between high priced money and high priced values In all depart ments comes to an even break, either the price of money or the price of products succumbing to the other. He says that "a good many shrewd and ex perienced observers are of the opinion that we are on the -'verge of recession," which means another panic .and hard times.' In hh opinion. "If securities and money could only be restored to a more normal basis, allowing for the fact that we are now on a higher level than five years ego, we cpuld feel practically assured of an other twelve months of good business provided no crop disaster Intervened." Mr. Clews further says that the fact that no seri ous disturbance In financial circles followed the presl . Kent's message. Indicates a pronounced change In pub lic opinion, , while he thinks one thing Is certain : "many of pur industrial leaders are recognizing the force of an aroused public opinion, and are' adapting their business methods . In . stricter conformity to the anti-trust sentiment." ABOUT PORTO RICO : According to the message of president. RooHevelt, sent to congress yesterday as a special niesage on Porto Rico, ' he recommends the continuance of the present provisional government of that island, but also recommends that the full rights of American . citizen ship be conferred upon the people.-'. The two recom mendations. If carried out, ' would put Porto Rico In about the same condition ' New -Mexico, but with hardly as many political rights. v , '. ' At present the Porto Rican towns have complete autonomy In municipal government, with the excep tion that the Insular government may remove the of ficials for corruption or Inefficiency. In their legis lature, the lower house vis elected by the people, but the upper house is appointed. The president does not mention In his message the judicial system. His recent brief visit to the Island impressed him very favorably as to the growth of the people In their appreciation of American Institutions and their un derstanding of the principle of majority rule. He emphasizes the fact that as an American province the export trade of the Island has grown from $18,000,000 In 1901 to 145,000,000 In 19oC. though the coffee in dustry Is still languishing. The chief recommenda tlon of the message is that all the Insular govern ments which the American government has estab lished In the last few years, should be placed in one bureau, under either the war or the state department Los Angeles Examiner: V"heu the growing communi ties of the southwest, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arl- sona, ask to le admitted to the federal union as states. they are answered by the public men of the eastern part of the country thus: "If we admit you, you will be rotten boroughs, as Nevada has been. You will have with 200,000 voters, the representation lu the United States senate that New York has with nearly 4.000,000. You will be given votes In the upper house of the national legislature not deterved by you, and any one of your states, should they be made states, could cancel the votes of New York, of Pennsylvania, or of any other of the great and prosperous communities in the north west.' What is the vote today In the United States senate of New York? It is the vote of two discredited men one smirched by his association with the Equitable Life cor poration, the other even more disreputable in ways whU'h it Is not necessary to dwell upon. If Arizona or New Mexico could pick as their representatives two men more utterly unfit to represent a state of this union in the United States senate than are Piatt and Depew, they might be very justifiably execrated. Hut we don't, be lieve they could make so disreputable a discovery. The Tucumcarl News says that "if those papers and person, who are advocating the election of district at torneys will go over into Arizona and Investigate the con ditlons over there, wheve they elect all their district at torneyu, they will find that the system that we have here whereby the governor appoints them, is by far the most satisfactory." If this be true, would it not lie better to go back to the system which Alexander Hamilton advo cated? His plan was Ui elect the president for life, nib ject to good beluvior; for him to appoint the governors for life, with the same limitation, and for the Koternors to appoint in like manner the xariotis stale and coimty officials. ApiMiintment rather than election Is in direct subversion of every principle of the American govern ment, and any people not competent to elect their own officials are unworthy of American citizenship. Kl 1'aso Herald: There hits lie, n a tremendous de velopment In the newspaper press of the territories (New Mexico and Arizona) in t lit past two years. The number of papers has greatly increased, and the quality has Improved threefold. What most impresses the casual reader of these papers is the Intense loyalty of each to Its home commuulty, coupled 'th u breadth of view that would make a sensitive eastern metropolitan editor ashamed of his provincial iuriin.iiicc. County Commissioner U T. Link, oi (Irani county, thinks ihe legislature should abolish untiling and liquor selling in the territory. Me says that during the ear (rant comity has received from the licenses for liquor and gambling coiuliiued J 1 4 On i lie oilier hand, he finds tha couHS, prisoners ami pliei ifts have cont $I9,7HH. All the latter, he contends, would be saved were there no t-a loon and no gambling. I'roliuhly it it, easier t make this claim than it is to get any one to believe it. X)MXXOOOOOOOOCXX)XXX)00X00t 5 

GOVERNMENT FARAS IN 8 IRRIGATION DISTRICTS $ XXXXXXXXXKXXXXXXXXXOCC)XXXX The annual report of Secretary James Wilson, or the department of agriculture for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 190(1, 1. full of valuable Information, of sound observations and of sensible deductions. It Is not a dry, theoretical treatise on matters connected with the work of the dopartmest, but discusses timely, Im portant and absorbing questions clearly, iwlntedly and effectively. Some of the recommendations of Secretary Wilson are especially of great Interest to what Is called the Arid West and particularly to New Mexico, which Is vastly Interested these days la the subjecls of raising crops by Irlrgation and by the so-called dry farming methods of agriculture. The recommendation of the establishment of Irrigation . farni9 in various irri gation districts is one that is of great mo ment 10 the sunshne territory asd if. the secretary's recommendations nro carried out and three or four of these Irrigation schools established here, It will prove of great utility and much benefit to the agricultural In terests of New Mexico. These, as is well known and proven by facts are -advancing very rapidly and con stantly. During Ihe past year more 'homestead entries have been made In the four land offices of New Mex ico than lu any other state or territory In the United States. The Clayton land office standing No. 1 In the 2umler of entries and the Roswell land office No. 2, with the Santa Fe land office not far lx-hind. Comnuntlng upon the subject of the establishment of irlgation farms for the Instruction and eallghtment of the Irrigation fanners of tfie souuliwest, the El Paso Herald timely remarks that in his annual report Secreary Wilson of the department of agriculture, makes a recommendation that ought to be taken up and acted upon without delay. It is vital to the highest success or tne govemmtni. s recianiuuou jjiou. The secretary recommends that "on each reclama tion area a demonstration farm snoum ue estaDiisneu, which tbe mttnods of Irrigation can be taught by a practical expert from the department." The Idea Is I noc to be confused with the "expelmenttal farms al ready established in some localities. It Is rather an Ir rigation school or instruction farm, where farmers new i to Irrigation methods can aqtually leara tha art un der conditions exactly like those they encounter on their own lands. The. work of Irrigation Instruction has beea car ried on to some exent for three years by tne office of experiment stations in the department. The dtmand for instruction has beea very heavy among irrigation farmers, not only In the newly reciaimeu aisincm, but also In older Irrigation regions where water Is verv scarce and It Is vital to conserve it for the most beneficial use. The number of men available for thl.i work has leen far too small for it h e. demand, and all have devoted their time la aid of settlers under private works. Anybody who has tried farming la this valley or iuvwhere pise in the arid region, knows that few of the rules learned from books or hearsay and applied more or less successfully "hack east," apply here. 1 he preparing or the fields, the hanldlng of the water, the selecting of tools, the choosing of times for irrigation, the determining of the necessary quality of water to be used, and the cultivating of the land following each irrigation all these things have to be learned newly by evea an ''experienced farmer" of the older regime. Now if this plan could be coupled some way wim George H. Maxwell's plan of farm school colonies and colonized irrigation areas, it would nMt take long to fill up the valeys of the. wet with trained Irrigation farmers who would not know the meaning of crop fail ures. Mr. Maxwell purposes to select the pupils ud it'he colonists from the Intelligent established farming class at the start, later tj take in city people and the better class of Immigrants from farming countries. That Is what every new irrigation area should do select tho colonists, and provide for their efficient training, so as t0 guard against failure and disappointment. m OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO XX000000 R CALIFORNIA'S VIEW OF Sj JAPS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS tOCXK0000(XX)0000X000X)XKXKj (So general has "'been the misapprehension regard ing the so-called "exclusion" of Japane'j-ye children from the public schools of San Francisco that, in or der to place the matter In 'the right llht liofore Hp readers. The Citlzta, has secured from President Alt mun of the San Francisco board of education a state ment, clearly explaining the situation. In this state ment President Altmau makes It plan that Japanese children are not denied education at the expense of San Francisco that they are not "excluded," but that for good reasons and under the law of the state they are merely "segregated," a seimrate school belag provided for them and maintained out of the general school fund. The Japanese object to this, maintaining that undor the treaty Ahey have the privilege of sitting in the same school with the white children.) With all due deference to President Roosevelt,- I must say It surprises me thaj. with all the minuteness of detail of information furnished Victor 1. Metcalf, who came to San Francisco as tho special represeu tatlve of the president In this matter, and who uion his return to Washington must have undoubtedly plac ed all of this Information at the disposal of the chief executive of this country, there should be such a dis play of Ignorance upon the part of the president as to sta,te In ihis . message that Japanese pupils are barred from the public schools of this city. This would lead people outside of Sua Francisco to believe that we refuse an education to the Japanese children. Jaimnose children have not been excluded from the public schools of San Francisco. They have not, la fact, been denied any of the advantages which are accorded children of American birth und parent age, and not t-he slightest obstacle has been thrown in the way of their education. The Impression already gone forth that the Japanese children were indeed excluded from our local institutions of learning arises from (he fact that a section of the school liw of the state of California irovlding for a separate school for t'aese children has been put into force and effect. in other words, far from barring the Japanese chil dren f tx in the public schools of San Francisco, the board of education has merely said to them: "Attend this particular school and there find all the advantages and facilities which are provided for our own white children." In saying this, die hoard of education has Knu no further Miua to enforce a plain and unmistakable law which was enacted by represent Hives of the ue ple of California for reasims that, to them, appeared Just and sufficient. The' board of education holds that the government has no authority over the schools of California, nor any other stale. As proof of this, we refer to the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which reads lhat the "powers not de-legated to the Unlteil Slates -by the consit udoa, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the stales respect ively, or to the people." The control of our scholh. we maintain, Is thus evidently one of the things delegated to the states. The clause of the California state school law re f I red to Is es follows; "Trustees nhall have the power to exclude children suffering from coi'tagioiii, or Infectious diseases, and also to establish separate schools for Indian ch idren and for children of Mongolian or Chinese descent. When such separate scbooU are established. Indians, Chinese or Mongolian children must uot he admil led into any other schools." The reason for the cxiMuice of the law which 1ms crest i-d such tronUc iH lhat Ihe eplc here wish to prevent .lajaues.- of th lower class, who come to this couutiy In tremendous uumbers, from intermingl ing and crowding out the white children of the public school. Hy Aaron Abman, president of die San Fran ciico lsard of education. THE
