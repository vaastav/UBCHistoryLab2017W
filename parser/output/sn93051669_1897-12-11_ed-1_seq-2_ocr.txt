M." attempts to give reasons why the governrneat should not establish postal sayings banks, but his "reasons" are so weak hat they become arguments in favor Of the system- He begins by saying it Is no part or. duty of the govern people. It is the entering wedge of awlLltam a. thonrv advanced bv WW " oertSta men that the government should take care of everybody's busi ness, and in the end leave nothing for individual effort or individual care, If this theorr is carried out to its legitimate end, it would destroy am . ' bition and energy and reduce a nation to mechanical mediocrity." . . "r The writer possibly does not realize . that it has been the policy of the gov eminent the past 35 years to take care of the money and property of a certain s of pecnle, and that this paternal of government has been lauded vwas endorsed by the people at the .last general election. The enactment of a protective tariff and the establish lng of the national banking system is nothing short of the government undertaking to take care of the busi aess and money of a certain class. , To add force to his "reasons" again "J. B. M." casts a slur at President MoKinley and his cabinet for favoring tha nostal savinsrs banks system, and mftkes this unwarranted statement: , "The reason why Postmaster-Gen 1 Gary, the president and the cabi et advocate it, is not tne aesire w save the people's money so much as to get possession of the people's money. The new tariff so far from fulfilling the predictions of friends, in the first five months of the fiscal year, from July to December 1, has produced 946,000,000 ss than the expenses of the govern Vt. ver much President McEin- ?ls cabinet may desire to pendltures of the gov. the receipts, they are icome embezzlers to a& or to encourage a System that would convert the sayings 1 the poor into a fund for satisfying Wernment obligations. urther on he shows his utter igno- ce of the proposed system by say' N?ls cabl pendl Vn thi ,.lcom VeompiiaS this end, 1? -1 "The money deposited in savings banks is now loaned out to encourage enternrise. to enable farmers to im prove tneir farms, to mercnams ana others to build stores and warehouses. 'his money cannot be got if it is ocked up in the treasury vaults, or used by the United States to take up overdue bonds. There is probably 1,000,000 now loaned out by these in stitutions on this kind of property. If postal savings banks are established this money will be diverted from work of promoting enterprise and new un- fra V In era fn f..n rHpinor of anvern- aent bonds." It is not tha purpose of portal sav ings banks to pile accumulations up in the treasury vaults to rust and decay, but to invest them in certain securities, where the property of depositors will be secure and at the same time find its way into the channels of active trade. Nor is it proposed to retire any gov ernment bonds, with these accumu lations. They are to be used in carry log the public debt, and the people who support the government are to receive theinterest that now goes to the European creditors. The weakest part of his argument is however the fear he expresses that in the near future there will be no pub- . lie debt, and that the accumulations will become a tax upon the govern' ment. He expresses this fear as fol lows: "A time will likely come in the next '10 or 20 years, when all the bonds will be called there will be no public debt. What is the government to do with thA 1 rm (Wl (KYI. or mi-hnns S3. ,000,000 of money in the treasury? Interest on it for the privilege of charge of these deposits; pay 1,000,000 or $60,000,000 a year on ioney they have no use for?" .There may be a time when the itional debt will be wiped out, but Vs is no argument against the pro- i postal savings banks. If every j'ar of government bonds were can eled, there would still be in existence Sufficient municipal, school district and public improvement bonds extant, that are certain securities and pay a comparative high rate of interest, to furnish ample investment for a billion . or two dollars. The government .would never be at a loss to find secure- ties in which to invest the savings of v people. "J. B. M.'' like all others o oppose postal savings banks re- i to unreasonable and impossible orles and suppositions to find argu- 1 ment for their opposition. they relate to revenue and expendi tures, a department to be designated and known as the issue and redemption division. To this division the sum of $125,000 in gold should be set over from the general fund in the treasury, to be used only for redemption pur poses, and all the silver dollars now held for redemption of silver certifi cates and all the silver bullion and dollars coined therefrom, bought un 3er the act of 1890, should be passei' to the same account. Further, that the sum of $200,000,000 In legal tender notes of the United Stotes known as green backs be collected as hereinafter de scribed and deposited in the said issue and redemption division, to be dis bursed therefrom only upon the re ceipt in exchange therefor of an equiv alent amount or gold coin. Such gold when so secured, to be held in said division as part of the general redemp tion fund. "Second I recommend that pro vision be made for the issue of refund ing loan bonds, payable after 10 years at the pleasure of the government, such bonds to bear interest at the rate of 2i per cent per annum, payable, principle and interest, in gold; and that the secretary of the treasury be authorized to Issue such bonds and re ceive in paymeat therefor, with an equitable allowance for the difference in Interest, any part or all of the out standing loans ot the United States which mature by their terms of pay ment in the years 1904, 1907 and 192-5." 

MORE MILK AND WATER! GAGE'S PLAN. . . enacted at this session of congress it Will H nn I. II . IIIHDH UUbllUHU 1 1 V iTMI '. I m ( a v a Inw t Vi o. fiAUHA will Via iinrlan ntrol of Speaker Reed, who will not not embody in it Mr, Gage's views. However, the senate is still free from this influence, and is not liable to con cur in the plan. The ultimate result of the legislation recommended by " Mr. Gage would be to more firmly fix the single gold standard, to retire all uncovered paper.and to increase the in terest' bearing debt. In his annual re port to congress Mr. Gage outlines his plan as follows: "The recommendations I make must be construed as tentative steps in a direction which, if consistently pur sued", will ultimately lead to conditions theoretically desirable rather than as being in themselves final measures to AaX end.. The condition of the treas ury in its relation to demand obliga tions requires that one of the two teps be taken. The one may be a Vrge reinforcement of the permanent old reserve; the other may be by an mportant reduction in the objection- . . . , i.ii ml i Able form Oi iiaDiuueo. iuo miwr us, 5n my opinion, the most desirable -- "First I recommend that proper I legislation be enacted which will es Vblish, separate and apart from the nary operations of the treasury as President McKlnley's message to congress cannot but be disappointing to those of his party who had hoped he would outline a vigorous financial and foreign policy. It Is not such a state paper as had been expected, being outspoken in but few things, and couched in such obscure language as to admit of double construction, leav ing the reader to doubt what the policy of the administration is to be. The first question of importance dealt with is the currency, aud is about the only question en which he outlines a clearly defined policy. The president points out that the evil of our currency system is the great cost to the government of keeping all of the forms of our money at a parity; that we have $900,000,000 of currency that the government is pledged to redeem in gold, but its receipts are not re quired to be paid in gold, and hence the only means at the command of the government for obtaining gold is by borrowing it, which accounts for the increase of the bonded debt during Cleveland's administration of $362,315,- 400 to secure money to keep the gold reserve at $100,000,000. Should the present policy of raising gold by bond issues be continued, itis recommended that the secretary of the treasury be given authority to sell bonde bearing a lower rate of interest, and for long or short periods. He recommends that when a United States note is pre sented at the treasury and redeemed in gold, it shall not again be put in circulation except for gold. In his opinion, it is of great importance that the government should not be required to provide the gold needed for ex change or export. It is pointed out that the existing system .is fraught with great danger. He indorses the plan recently outlined by Secretary Gage for reforming the currency, and further asks that notes of national banks be restriced to issues of $10 and upward, and that national banks with minimum capital of $25,000 be al lowed to be organized, and all national banks be allowed to Issue notes equal to the face value of their bonds de posited to secure such circulation. The Cuban question Is considered at length, but not in a manner to meet the approval of the public pulse. A milk and water policy in treating with Spain for the termination of the war n Cuba is advised. The president shows that in the revolution beginning in 1868 the United States, through President Grant, endeavored to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba, 'but its ef forts were unsuccessful. At that time the question of granting belligerent rights to the insurgents was con sidered, as now, but was not favored by Grant, and McEinley takes a decided stand against it now, believing that it is unwise, but says he will take the step whenever right and duty demand it. "It is due to Spain" says the mes sage, "in view of our friendly relations, that she begin in time to prove that she can and will achieve the pacifica tion of the island and introduce re forms to which the present Spanish ministry is committed." The message favors the annexation of Hawaii and says every considera tion of dignity and honor requires it. The Nicaragua canal is also favored, and a message on this subject at some future time is promised. On the sub ject of international bimetallism the president recites the failure of the commission he sent to Europe, but ex presses a hope that the dreams of Wolcott may be realized. Other matters considered in the message are of minor importance, and throw but little light upou what policy President McKinley will pursue, nor do they make any definite recommen dations regarding future legislation. TO 

LOOT THE TREASURY. The attention of Oregon's represen tatives in congress should be called to the promises made that Baker City should have a government assay and postoffice building. Baker City busi ness men should join in a memorial asking for such an appropriation and proper effort will secure it. Baker City Democrat. The above furnishes an illustration of why the government treasury is looted and why it is tbat government expenditures are greater than the re ceipts. Some upstart who wants to go to congress promises, if elected, he will push an appropriation for a govern ment building to cost from $50,000 to $500,000 In every bamlet in his district, whether heeded or not. Kegardless of the needs of the government or the matter of rents for buildings required for postoffices, etc., he agrees when seated in congress to appropriate any sum that the ambitious citizens may want. That is, to secure his election he would promise to vote any tax up on the people of the nation for the "public Improvements." The gullible people listen to his seductive speech and vote for him, and at the same time vote a tax upon themselves, not only for the improvements they want, but for hundreds of other similar wants. An appropriation of $100,000 has been asked for a government building in Baker Ci-y, and a similar amount was asked for a postoffice in The Dalles. Aa a matter of fact neither is needed, for the government is able to rent office rooms in either city for much less than the lowest possible interest on the amount such buildings would cost. To appropriate such an amount would be extravagance, though no doubt Oregon's representatives have promised Baker City and The Dalles tbat the treasury shall be looted to satisfy the ambition of each city, and the-representatives of every other state in the union have made like promises, TO ANXfEX HAWAII. It Is wired from Washington that if a vote could be taken today the pro position to annex the Hawaiian islands would fail to carry, says the Portland Telegram, because not over half a dozen of the democratic senators are ready to support it. And there is probability of truth in the statement, In a recent interview Senator Jones, of Arkansas, was quoted as saying that the democratic senators would re sist annexation. Senator White, of California, a very trenchant fighter, is already on record as opposed to annex ation, and, according to the press dis patches, will go to extremes in his an tagonism. Senator Morgan, who visited the island this summer, is one democrat openly friendly to the treaty. There are eighty-nine votes in the senate, two-thirds of which will be necessary to ratify the treaty. Thirty votes would be able to defeat it. To the democrats must be added Senator Pettigrew,who has recently announced his antagonism. And with Senator Pettigrew will likely be a number of populists and silver senators. The opponents of the treaty will probably insist that it shall be con sidered in open session, and there should be no opposition to such a pro- j posal. The friends of annexation have no reason to be afraid of a puolic discussion, and they cannot too quickly throttle any insinuation that they are unwilling to take the people into their confidence and that there is somethi: in their plans that will not stand the test of popular scrutiny. Let the con sideration of the treaty be as full and open as its enemies desire. - - GARY IN VIE E 8 DISCUSSION. READY FOR THE GRAB. It has been hastily assumed that the transfer to the United States treasury of $14,000,000 on account of the Pacific railway sale has added just so much to the available assets, remarks the New York Post. But this is to overlook the extraordinary American genius for finance. That money is a sacred fund, as it were, not to be expended in any ordinary way, but to be devoted ex clusively to some form of extravigance. The Nicaragua canal association has already held a meeting and voted that this Pacific money be religiously set aside for themselves. We are sure the pension agents will also want it, and so will the ship armor men, and the sugar bounty men, and the bounty on exports men, to say nothing of the 1-cent postage men and the buying of Cuba men, and the other men, amount ing to the whole membership of con gress, each of whom would like to grab the whole sum. The fact Is that the unexpected ad dition of $14,000,0000 to the treasury is evidently going to excite the maddest competition -to see who shall have it. The net result will probably be some log rolling scheme by which $40,000, 000 or $50,000,000 will be taken from the treasury on the strength of this extra $14,000,000 put into it. The Ohio law, which requires that honorably discharged soldiers shall be given offices, has been declared un constitutional by the supreme court of the state. It was mighty easy fpr the republican legislature to pass an act to catch a vote and frame it after a fashion to compel the courts to hold it invalid. Postmaster-General Gary expresses pleasure at the widespread commen upon bis recommendation for the es tabllshment of postal savings banks-and invites further discussion of the sub ject. "If we all put our heads together,' the postmaster-general says, "the right plan can be devised, and that is what the country wants." It is not often that a cabinet officer manifests such a disposition to learn the desires of the peop'e on maters of legislation connected with the devel opment of his department. Post master-General Gary's request for widespread popular expression of opinion on the subject should meet with hearty response on the part of the people. The newspapers have already performed theh duty in the matter. Labor orgrnizations, too, have very generally given consideration to the subject and with almost unanimous voice have asked for postal banks. Ii remains now for other 'bodies, es pecially those representing the com mercial Interests of the country, to give their approval to the agitation, in order that congress may be assured that the sentiment of all classes in the nation is virtually united in favor o the early establishment of these much needed institutions for the safe-Keep-ing of the savings of persons of moder- ate means. It may be true that the commercial and business classes of the country have not such an immediate personal interest in the establishment of postal savings banks as have the wage-earners. But the commercial portion of the community cannot afford to manifest indifference to the well- being and contentment of the vorking population of the country. Let them do what they can to promote good feel ing at least by giving consideration to propositions like that for the establish ment of postal savings banks, the only object of which Is to do some thing for the people, whose interests are only too rarely the subject of in telligent consideration by lawmakers. Chicago Record. ANTI-CIVIL SERVICE. A paper has been announced to -appear weekly in the national capital, the main purpose of which will be to advocate the repeal of the civil service law, and incidentally to promote the election as president and vice-president of Congressman Grosvenor and Senator Gallinger, the special cham pions of the repeal. There is an unconscious acknowl edgement of the belated and un original nature of Us minsion "Quill and Sissors." To men of sense the spoils system compares with the merit system in public business about as does the quill with the typewriter or as scissors with brains. It Is but natural that the organ of spoils should find Its birthplace In the city filled with office seekers and loby ists. 'It will no doubt be quoted ex tensively by them as authority on sound doctrines, and will, as it were, be their bible, but with the people generally it will meet with little favor This Is an age of progression, and a system that elevates the civil service will not readily be laid aside. "Quill and Scissors," with the principle it espouses, is destined to be short lived. That tou4 by' no means a startling announcement made by an Ohio paper when it said Senator Hanna had the grip. He has had a grip for some time on Ohio politics. A Berlin humorous paper has been confiscated becausa it published a car toon distasteful to the emperor. Free press and free speech are not yet ac corded to the people of Germany. The back clearances for November In Tacoma were $3,821,170; Seattle, $5,107,917; Portland, $9,709,630, those of Portland boing more than double those of the two Washington cities. Chairman JJingley says public rev enue in the next fiscal year will bo sufficient to meet all public expanses. We hope it will. This country has been running behind long enough. The Furnish ring at Pendleton was woefully defeated in toe city election last Monday. J. E. Bean, Furnishe's candidate for mayor, was beaten 181 votes by Dr. Smith. Truely this is ba3 year for bosses. The Dingley deficit up to date is about $50,000,000. Aud as soon as the receipts from the Union Pacific sale have been absorbed by the increase in pensions the DiDgley deficit will re' Bume its work of self-development. Telegram. A Kentuckian who reached the Klondike with a heavy pack was not loaded down with pocket pistols, but with a large supply of quinine which he is selling at $3 a capsule. The average Kentuckian is a man of ripened knowledge when it comes to combat- lag malaria or snakebite. It is noticeable that, when the Aus trian threatened the Turk, the concert of the great powers didn't enunciate a single expulsory note. With little Greece the case was different. The Hellenic expostulations against Otto man injustice were drowned by along- continued clamor from the full band The effort to get provisions to the miners on Ukon is commendable, but it is doubtful if there will be very many men found who will hazard a trip across the mountain passes during the winter months even to relieve the sufferers. People do not deliberately court death to save the lives of others There now seems no hops for Dur rani's neck being saved, the supreme court of California having denied the two last appeals In his case. It will be well for the authorities to act hastily and hang the murderer as soon as possible, so his awful deed may be forgotten. It has agitated public mind long enough. Retrenchment will not be a part of the plan of the administration. Sec retary Gage's estimate of expenses in his departments is something over $30,000,000 more than last year. And so it is in all the departments. A reign of prosperity of officeholders is to begin and the people who pay the taxes now witness a period of the greatest extravagance in government expenditures in onr history. It is claimed the "silver issue" is dead in Boston. Undoubtedly it is. More interest bearing bonds are held in Boston than in any city in tbe country, probably excepting New York, The "silver issue" is not favorable to bond holding and bond issuing, while the "gold issue" is. Boston naturally favors that issue that promises to do most for those who own Boston and the peoDle in it. . The Chicago Times-Herald says "the country is besieging congress for monetary reform," which is "demanded by the people." Not at all says the Tacoma News. The socalled monetary reform is demanded very loudly by a comparatively few persons. The people are hot asking for it. So far as their recent expressions go the majority of them do not want it. Why not be honest and say that Messrs. Morgan and Ickelheimer and those who follow their lead want certain monetary changes made? Governor Lord Is said to be figurin on renomination and is making com binatlons to that end, remarks tfc Corvallis Gazette. It is also said that ho has made a trade with a Ben to republican for Benton county support, As if a dozen men could bo found i Benton county, goldite or silverite, Mitchell or anti-Mitchell, Oregonian or anti-Oregonian, who would fayor or icket. while in Independence the en tire democratic ticket was elected. The Wilson tariff law was con demned because Instead of creating a surplus in the national treasury it left a deficiency, and last year we were promised a law that would create enough revenue to put the government on a cash basis, provided there were a change in the administration. A change was made, and since the new law weji into effect last July, there has been a deficiency of about $50,000, 000, whereas tbe annual report of the treasury shows the Wilson law left a deficiency of only a little over $18,000 000 for the year ending June 30, last. It seems as if promises have not been sacredly kept. 

QUESTIONS AT ISSUE. Hentiment of Congress on Cuba, and the Currency. New York, Dec. 8. A special to the Journal and Advertiser from Washington says: A reporter has made a poll of con gress on the most yitai Questions like ly to come before that body at this session. Below are the exact ques tions submitted to the members: "Do you favor the retirement of greenbacks?" The surprise in the vote upon this proposition was in the fact that such republicans as Belknap, Dollivsr, Odell, Henderson, Mesiok. Bruce and Hopkins were found in opposition. Not a single populist, of course, favor ed the proposition, While Brenuerof Ohio and Kitchen were the only dem ocrats in favor. The following propositions were sub mitted to the senators: "Can any radical financial legisla tion, involving the retirement of tbe greanbacks, tbe limitation of the legal-tender quality of silver, or Ue issuing of gold bonds for the retire ment of greenbacks pass the senate?" There was practically a unanimous sentiment that nothing can be done. On this poll there was not an affirma tive vote. Tbe negatives were largely n the majority, and tbe doubt ex- presssd by certain senators virtually meant a negative. AUTONOMY DECREES ON THE WAY, Provisional Government to Vie Instituted In Cuba Next Weett. .NEW YORK, Dec. 9. A special to the Tribune from Washington says: Next Monday is understood to be the day set for the institution of the provisional government in Cuba under the autonomy decrees of Novem, ber 24 and 26. The state department has been given to understand that General Blanco has arranged to do this immediately upon the arrival of tbe decrees in Havana, where they are expected by Saturday or Sunday, Thia is in accordance with the decree of November 24, extending 'x the Antilles the electoral laws of Spain n a basis of universal suffrage, and provides for a new constitution for Porto Rico and Cuba in these words: In order to establish at once the new regime, tbe governor-general will appoint the secretaries of the insular government, with whom he shall gov ern the colony until the insular parli ament shall be constituted." The understanding is further that the provisional appointees will be Cubans and members of the autono mist party. Simultaneously the com mittee to take the census of tbe prov inces and make the poll list for the first election will be constituted and the necessary machinery organized to choose the 17 councillors:, or admin istrators; the members of the chamber of representatives later to tie author ized on the basis of one - for every 25, 000 inhabitants.

'stand In" on any trade made with Lord. Benton county people have memories and good sense. The summary which the cable fur nishes of the autonomy which Spai; offers to Cuba Is teo brief to convey clerely the scope of that scheme. But whether it is liberal or the reverse, the Cubans declare they will not accept it, They set forth very plainly that tbey are lighting for absolute separation from Spain, and not for any sort of home rule which would keep up a con' nection, however slight, between tbe island and Madrid. The world is bound to believe tbat the Cubans are fighting for independence solely, and that they will not lay down their arms until they have achieved it. A man who is close to the throne, and evidently knows what he is talk ing about, says that there is a trade on foot between the Mitchell and anti- Mitchell forces, by which Mr. Mitchell is to name the republican legislative ticket next year and the anti-Milchell crowd shall name the remainder of the state ticket. This is a nice little scheme, but the people of Oregon nave tirea oi allowing one man's interests to predominate oyer the interests of the entire state, and if such a combine is entered into, they will proceed to wipe the ticket thus put up off the face of the earth on the first Monday in June. Mr. jvicmniey. in bis message says that we have $900,0000,000 of currency which the government by solemn en actment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. The solemn enactment spoken of is a ruling of a secretary of the treasury to the effect that our cur rency will be redeemed in the metal desired by the holder of tbe note. Gold being the most valuable metal be cause of the legislation against silver, the holder of the note demands gold and. is paid in gold.

At Puyallup three stores were burglarized, general merchandise to the value of $500 being taken and $200 in cash from the safe of Rogers & Raymond. Rogers is a son of Gover nor Rogers. The Northern Pacific depot at Puyallup was also looted, the safe blown open and several cheeks and express orders stolen. Kansas Pacific Sale. Washington, .Dec. 7. The secre tary of the treasury today took the first steps to qualify on behalf of the government as bidder at wholesale of the Kansas Pacific. A transfer order for $900,000 was sent by Treasurer Roberts for certification to the National City bank, of New York, in favor of the master of tbe court haying jurisdiction of the case. This order will be delivered to the master five days before the sale by an officer of the treasury department, wbo it is believed. will bid at the sale under instructions from the president.

A dispatch to tbe Tribune from Havana says: President McKinley's message is re ceived quietly. Satisfaction is felt in official circles over the statement that the recognition of either belligerency or independence is not justifiable un der present conditions. The credit which the president gives for conduct ing the war on humane principles and for improving tbe conditions of the reconcentrados will strengthen Captain-General Blanco in carrying out his policy. The official feeling may be summar lzed in tne statement that tne govern ment does not now fear the embarrass ment which might come from action by the United States before instruc tions from Madrid could be carried into effect. The hint of ultimate in tervention causes some Uneasiness and discussion Has already arisen over what is meant by "reasonable time, but palac6 officials do not interpret it as likely to prevent the application of autonomy within the time needed for - frying out the detail of the system j. directed from Madrid.

PETERS The 8 CO., Dalles, CregDTi Will ot Ratify. Chicago, Dec. 8. A special to Tribune from Washington says: If a vote could be taken today the proposition to annex the Hawaiian islands would undoubtedly fail to se cure the necessary two-thirds major lty. This is the result of an informal canvass of the senate made since tbe opening by senators who are more or less favorable to the project. They say that thus far not over half a -dozen of the democrats have announced themselves as being openly in favor of the treaty. There are about 10 of the same party admittedly on the fence. At the present time they would vote against the treaty in all probability, but are expected to be won over in the course of the debate. The remainder of the democrats, numbering 18 or so, are apparently hostile to annexation for various reasons. Tbe full membership of the senate is 90. It therefore requires 60 votes to pass the treaty as a treaty and without resrting to tbe subterfuge of a joint resolution. Thirty-one senators can defeat the treaty entirely, and a much smaller number, if sufficiently bellig erent, can prevent action for a long enough time. The opponents of annexation say that at the present time they can count on 23 democratic senators, seven republicans and three independents, making a total of 35, or more than enough to defeat the treaty. There are many senators who believe that by withholding their votes on Hawaii they may be able to force the president and his advisors to do some thing for Cuba. THE

President Pier ola has vetoed the measure recently passed by congress legalizing non Catholic marriages in Peru, and pro viding for the-registration of such marriage. He gives as his reason the fact that the bill only authorized the registration of foreigners without pro viding for native-born Peruvians, de scended from Protestants who hold to the religion of their fathers.
