THE message of President Cleve land to congress ignores all other im portant subjects and is devoted exclu sively to the tariff question anil the gist of the whole thing is contained in two words—free trade. It will meet with approval bv the, free trail ers, but if Cleveland is nominated for president he can never carry New York or New Jersey on a platform fashioned after his message. Sjiiim* raising is fast becoming one of the leading industries of Dakota as will lie seen by the recent report on wool issued by the bureau of sta tistics,(showing a rapid increase in Da kota: In ISOo there were but ia.'l slice]) 111 the wholo territory.

AUDITOR \VAUI. in doing his duty as a public ollicer, is at the same time winning great popularity among the people, by closing out the rotten in surance companies that have gained a foothold in Dakota and his efforts are meeting with universal approba tion. lie has entered upon a good work and the people may rest assured that when completed none but good solid insurance companies will be left to do business in Dakota. Following the order revoking the authority of the Transcontinental Fire and Marine. of Mandan. to do business, is another order from the Auditor stopping the Chesapeake Insurance company of Washington City, from doing busi ness in the territory. This company has over 100 agents in Dakota. THE Northwest News, one of the leading democratic organs of Dakota, is fearful of the result in the presiden tial election next year. It says iu speaking ol' democratic chances that "It will not do to ignore the fact that democratic ascendency hangs by a very slender thread, despite the re sult in New York. New Jersey has gone republican and with the party disrupted there as it is, under the lead of MacPlierson, it will hardly again go Democratic. By the Interior depart ment antics, Indiana threatens to go the same way. Connecticut never was reliable. The democratic majori ty in Virginia is only about 2,000. Hearst made California republican for ten years more. Uy a -cussed" territorial policy every western state will be made republican solider than ever. New York, herself, may not be next year where she is now. A dicta torial policy that pays every attention to bosses and none to the people, will bring its rich reward of overwhelm ing defeat and it ought to do so." THE llainy Uuttes Sentinel, the able exponent of Hettinger county inter ests, makes the following sensible with prediction, abundant evidence to back it. "The West Missouri country is just dawning, the morn of develop ment. This rich tract of country has been almost unknown, on account of its inaccessibleness to railroads, until within a few years, and its rich re sources have gone unmerited, lint this is no longer to be the case. Our coal is wanted in other parts of the territory our grazing lands are expe dient on account of the abundance of water. The railroad companies real ize the fact that this country is about to make a grand and lasting step to wards the most wealthy and prosper ous section of Dakota, and iu view of this they have extended their lines in this direction until now they hover just on the verge of making a grand rush for the supremacy of a country wliich is destined to rank first. Those who have pushed their way to this country on these hopes, have not long to wait when the most sanguine ex pectations nraong them will be fully met."
