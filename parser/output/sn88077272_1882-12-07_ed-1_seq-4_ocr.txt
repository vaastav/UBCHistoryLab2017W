WASHINGTON, D. C., December 4, 1882. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: It ia proTtded by the Constitution that the President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient In re viewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the commencement of your sessions, I first Call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign aokirs. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our intercourse with other Powers has continued to be of the most friendly character. Such slight differences as have arisen during the past year have been already settled, or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens of the United Mates in Ireland under recent laws, which owe their origin to the disturbed condition of that country, has led to a somewhat extended corre spondence with the Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect our rights has been prac tically manifested by the release of the arrested persons. The claim of this Nation in regard to the super vision and control of any inter-oceanic canal across the American isthmus has continued to be the sub ject of conference. It is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing the di vergence between the two Nations whose friend ship is so cjosely cemented by the Intimacy of their relations and the community of their inter ests. Our long established friendliness with Russia has remained unbroken, it has prompted me to prof fer the earnest counsels of this Government that measures be adopted for suppressing the proscrip tion which the Hebrew race in that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our cour teous remonstrance has nevertheless been cour teously received There Is reason to believe the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure protection to all faiths within her borders. At an Internatio al Convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended by representatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in re spect to the ' protection of trade marks, patented articles and the rights of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the recommendations thus adopted is receiving the at tion which it merits. The protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by an International Con ference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy of this Government to favor neutrali zation of this means of intercourse, I requested our Minister to France to attend the convention as a delegate. I "also designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an International Committee at Paris for considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force. In view of the f n-cfuent occurrence of confer ences for the consideration of important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respect fully suggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with discretionary power to send dele gates to such conventions, and that provisions be made to defray the expenses incident thereto. The difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a judgment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted, but it is hoped and believed that negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of the position which seems to this Government so rea sonable and just. I have already called the attention of Congress to the factr. hat "in the ports ot Spain and its colo nies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against local legislations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved unsuccessful I regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish ' onsuls in American ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of the cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable expo.t duty, and that our re monstrances in this regard have notas yet received the attention which they seem to deserve. The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an international exhibition of domestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg in July, 1883. if this country is to be represented, it Is im portant that in the early days of this session Con gress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose. The death of Mr. Marsh, our late Minister to Italy, has evoked from that Government expres sions of profound respect for his exalted character and for his honorable career In the diplomatic ser vice of his country. The Italian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing In his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredited, both as Secretary of Legation and as Consul General at Rome. He" has been received as Secretary, but his exequatur as Consul General has thus far been withheld. The Extradition Convention with Belgium which h ss been in operation since 1874, has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified Its approval, and ratifications have been duly exchanged between the contracting countries To the 1st of extraditable crimes has been added that of assassination or attempted assassination of the Chief of State, Negotia ions have been opened with Switzerland looking to the settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance and become citizens of the United States without obtaining the consent of the Swiss Government. I am happy to inform you that the immigration of paupers and crimi nals from cert -in of the Cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased, and is no longer sanc tioned by the authorities. The consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August 3, 183.;, which had for its object the return of foreign convicts to their own country, should be so modified as not to he open to the interpretation that it effects the extradition of criminals. The Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which this Government has put up on the Treaty of I8& relative to it- jurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may be, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the United States in the countries of the East, a subject to which your attention has been already called by the Secretary of State. In the interest of justice toward Chili and Japan, I trust that the question of the return of the in demnity fund to the Governments of those coun tries will be reached at the present session, the satisfactory solution of which I had already rec ommended, and which has recently been foreshad owed by Congressional dlseusslon. The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits the action of the Senate. During the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American vessels served as a protec tion to the person and property of many of our own citizens and of citizens of other countries, whose Governments have expressed their thanks for their assistance. The recent legislation restricting Immigration of laborers from China, has given rise to the ques tion whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own. In constructing the act of May 2, 1880, in connection with the treaty of November 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as labor ers, and should not forbid a mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable. This Government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in the Repub lic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable set tlement of the boundary dispute now pending between that Republic and the British possessions of Sierre Leon. The Reciprocity Treaty with Hawaii will be come terminable after September 9, 1883, on two months' notice by either party. While certain pro visions of that compact may have proved onerous, its existence has foster d commercial relations which it Is important to preserve. I suggest, there fore, that early consideration be given to such modifications of the treaty as seem to be demand ed by the Interests of our people. In view of our increasing trade with both Haytl and San Domin- f o, I advise that provision be made for diplomatic ntercourse with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port-au-Prince. I regret that a certain class of American claims against the Gov ernment of Haytl have thus far been urged una vallingly. A recent rgreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by the armed forces of cither country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my message of last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness of the borders, and to the ne cessity of legislation for its suppression; I again in vite the attention of Congress to the subject. A partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention which now awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another touching the estab lishment of the international boundary between the United States and Mex co. If the latter is rat ified, the ac ion of Congress will be required for es lishing suitable ommlsslons of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led this Government to proffer its friendly counsel to both parties, has been ami cably settled. No change has occurred in our relation with Venezuela. I again invoke your action in the mat ter of the pending awards against that Repub lic, to which reference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last Bession. An invitation has been received from the Govern ment of Venezuela to send Representatives in Jnly, 1483, to Caraccas for the purpose of participating in the centennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American Independence. In connection with this erJnt it Is designed to commence the erectiou at Caraccas of a statue of Washington and to conduct an industrial exhibi tion which will be open to American products. I recommend that the United States be represented, and that suitable provisions be made therefor. The elevation oi the grade of our mission in Cen tral America to the plenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session, has been since effected. The war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chili en the other began more than three years ao. On the occupation by Chili In 1880 of all the litteral territory of Bolivia nego tiations for peace were conducted under the direc tion of the United States, The allies refused to concede any territory, but Chill has since become master of the whole coast of both countries and of the Capital of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted to you in January last, this Government sent a special mission to the belligerent powers to expre s the hope that Chill would be disposed to accept a money indemnity for the expenses of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the terri tory of her antagonist. This recommendation, which Chill declined to f How, this Government did not assume to enforce, nor can it be enforced without resorting to measures which would be in keeping neither with tha temper of our people nor with the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplemented by the armies and navies of the United States. Such interfer ence would almost inevitably lead to the estab lishment of a protectorate. A result utterly at odds with our past policy, in jurious to our present interests and full of embar rassments for the future, for effecting the termina tion of hostilities upon terms at once just to the victorious nation ana generous to its adversaries, this Government has spared no efforts, save such as might involve the complications which I have indicated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chili seems resolved to exact such rigorous conditions of peace, and is indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equita ble and just to command the approval of other nations. About a year since Invitations were extended to the nations of the continent to send representatives to a Peace Congress to assemble at Washington in November, 182. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote, in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the meantime the disturbances between the South American Republics would be adjusted, as that expectation seemed unlikely to be realized. I asked in April last for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress as to the ad visability of holding the proposed conven tion at the time appointed. The action was prompt ed in part by doubts which mature reflection had suggested, whether the diplomatic range and tra ditions of the Government did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult the Representa tives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in its character and far-reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by Congress in the prem ises, and that no provision had been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the convention, and so notified the sev eral Governments which had been invited to at tend. I am unwilling to dismiss this subject with out assuring you of my support of any measures that the wisdom of Congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this continent and through out the world, and I trust that the time is nigh, when, with tne universal assent of civilized peo ple, all international differences shall be de termined without resort to arms, by the benignant processes of arbitration. Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of sever .1 foreign powirs during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine Republic, Austria, Hungary, Braz 1, Chili, China, France, Japan, Mexico, th - Netherlands and Russia have pre sented their cedent als. The mlssinsof Deunvrk and Vrnsu laat this Capital have been raised in grade. Sw tzerland has created a Plenipotentiary m ssi on to this Gnv- rnmeat, aid an Embassy froni M .daga'car and a Minister from Siam will shortly, bixlve. Our d pi matlc intercours 1 has b en en larged by the establishme t of relations with the i ew Kingdom of rerv a, by the creation of a mis sion fto Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Gr ece. The Shah of Persia has expressed his gratification that a Coarse d'Affalrs wilt shortly be sent to that country, where the rights of our citi ze.s haebeen Hitherto constantly guarded by the represe tativ-sof Great Brit in. 1 renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United States in harmony with other maritine powers with respect to the inter national rules for the prevention of collisions at sea. In conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last, I have directed the Secretary of State to address foreign Governments in respect to a proposed co ference for considering the subject of the universal adoption of a common prime merid ian, to be used in the reckoning of longitude, and in the regulation of time throughout the civilized world. Their replies will in due time be laid be fore you. An agreement was reached in Paris in 1875, be tween the principal Powers, for the interchange of official publications through the medium of their respective Foreign Departments. The admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the Smithsonian Institution affords a practical basl- for our co-operation in this scheme, and an arrangement has been effected by which that Insti tution will perform the necessary lahor under the direction of the Department of State. A reason able compensation therefor should be provided by law. A clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular s rvice contemplates the reorganization of both branches of such ser vice on a salary basis, leaving feeB to inure to the benefit of the Treasury. I cordially favor such a project as likely to correct buses in the present system. The Secretary of Slate will present to you at an early day a plan for such reorganization. A full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury Department is afforded by the report of the Secretary.

EXPENDITURES. The ordinary expenditures for the same period were: For civil expenses, $18,042 386.42; for for eign intercourse, $1,387,583.19; for Indians,$9,736. 747.40; for pension?, $61,345,1 '3.93: for the mili tary establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenal, $43,570 491.19; for the naval establishment including vessels, machinery and improvements at navy yards, $15,032,046.26; for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light houses and collecting the revenue, $34, r,39. 237. 50; for expenditures on account of the District of Columbia, $3,330,543.87; for interest on the public debt, $71,077,206.79; total ordinary ex penditures $257 931,439.57, leaving a surplus rev enue of $145,54?,810.71, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury of $.:0,77,694.84 making $166,281,505, was applied to the redemption of bouds; forthe Mnkinjr'Fund.SGO, 150; of fractional currency for the Sinking Fund, $5,705,553; of loan of July and August, 1S61, $62, 57..050; loan of March, 1863, $4,472,90i; of funded loan of 1881, $37,194, 450; of loan of 1658, $1,000; of loan of Fcbruarv, 1S61, $ ;f 3 000 : of five-twenties of 1862. $2,100; of five-twenties of 1864, $7,400; of five twenties of 1865, $ ,500 ; of ten-forties of 18 .4. $254, 550; of consols of 186, $86,450; of consols of 1867, 8408,250; of consols of 1865, $141,400; of Oregon war debt, $675,250; of old demand compound interest and other notes, $18,35), Total, $166 231,505.55. FOREIGN COMMERCE. The foreign commerce of the United States dur ing the lost fiscal year including importsand ex ports of merchandise and specie, was as follows: Exports $800,159,751 Imports , 774,251.063 Excess of exports over imports $ 25,902,683 This excess is less than it has been before any of the previous six years.as appears by the follow in? table: Year ended June, excess of exports over Imports of merchandise l7t $79,643,4S1: 1877, $151,152,G94; 1878, T257,814,231 ; 1879, $264, 661,606; 1880, $167,683,912; 1881, $259,712,717: 1&82, 25,902,1-83. NATIONAL BANKS. During the year there have been organized 171 National banks, and i f these institutions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number than ever before. The value of their notes in active circu lation on July 1, 882, was $t2 1,656,458. I com mend to your attention the Secretary's views in respect to the likelihood ot a serious contraction of this circulation, and to the modes by which that result may, in his judgment, be averted. COINAGE OF SILVER. In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver certificates, I have seen nothing to alter, but much to confirm the senti ments to whiuh I gave expression last year. A comparison between therespective amounts of sil ver dollar circulation on November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 188', shows a slight increase of a million and a half of dollars ; but during the inter val there had been in the whole number coined an Increase of $26,000,000 of the $128,00,000 thus far CIRCULATION. more ,0i0 000 are circulation. The mass of accumulated com has grown so great that, the vault-room at present available for storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why if, is desirable to continue this coinage now so enormously in excess of the public demand. AMo the silverertificates, in addition to the grounds which seemed last year to qualify their retirement, may be mentioned the effect which is likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificates, for which issuance Congress recently made provisions, and which are now in active cir culation. You can not fail to note with interest the discus sion by the Secretary as to the necessity of pro viding by legislation some mode of freeing the Treasury of an excess of assets. In the event that Congress fails to reach an curly agreement for the reduction of taxation, I heartily approve the Sec retary's recommendation of immediate and exten sive reductions in the annual revenues of the Government. 

TAXATION. It will be rercembered that I urged upon the attention of Co gress at its last session the impor tance of relieving the industry and enterprise of the country fr ui the pressure from unnecessary taxa'io'i. It U one of the tritest m xim of politi cal economy that nil taies are burdensome. However w sely a: d prudently disposed, a d though there have always been among our people wide difference of -emiinent as to the best methods of raising the national revenue, and indeed aa to the principles upon which taxation t-hould be based, there has been substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ou.lit to be levied as are necessary for a wi.e and economical adminis tration of government. Of late the public revenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless chec-ed by appropriate legislation, such excess will con tinue to increase from year to year. For the fiscal year ended June 30 881, the surplus revenue amounted to $100,u00 000 For the fiscal year ended on the 13th of June last the surplus was more than -145,000,000. The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of these monies. They have not only an swered the requirements of the sinking fund, but have afforded a large balance, applicable to other reduction of the public debt. But I remember the expression of my conviction t at such rapid extinguishment of the National indebtedness as is now taking place is by no means a cause for con- fratulation; it is a cause rattier for serious appre ehsion. If it continues it must speedily be followed by one of the evil results so clearly set forth in the report of the Secretary either tlie surplus must lay idle in the Treasury, or the Goverment will be forced to buy at market r ites its bond not then redeemable, and which, under Bach circumstances, can not fail to command an enorraou premium on the swollen revenues, or will be devoted to extravagant expen diture, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an overflowing treasury. It was made apparent in the laws of the anima ted discussion which this question aroused at the last seBBion of Congress that the policy of dimin ishing the revenue by reducing taxation com manded the general approval of the members of both Houses I regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by which that policy should be made operative, none of itffbenefiu have as yet been reaped. In fulfillment ot what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope that I can make valuable contribution o the vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to It. Upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year, I felt justified in recommending to Congress the abolition of all Internal revenue taxes exoept those upon tobacco In Its various forms and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and exoept, also, the special tax upon the manufacturers and dealers in snch articles. I venture now to suggest that, unless it shall be ascertained that the probable expen ditures of the Government for the coming year have been underestimated, all internal taxes, save those which relate to distilled spirits, can be safely abrogated. Such a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of collection, which woald then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to result in diminish ing the cost of such collection by at least I2.5ti0.000, and In the retirement from office of from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. The system of excise duties has never commend ed itself to the favor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supply ing deficiencies in the Treasury, when, by reason of special exigencies, the duties on imports have proved inadequate to the needs of the Govern ment. The sentiment of the country doubtless com mands the present excise tax shall be abolished as soon as such course can safely be pursued. It seems to me, however, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of in ternal taxes would for the present be an unwise step. Two of these reasons are deserving of 

SPECIAL MENTION. First-It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties on imports is continued without modification those duties alone will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the Govern ment. It is estimated that $100,000,000 will be required for pensions during the coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the maximum annual demand for that object has yet been reached. Un certainty upon this question would alone justify, in my judgment, the retention forthe present of of that portion of the system of Inter nal Revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Second A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove a serious if not an insur mountable objection to a thorough revision of the tariff and to any considerable execution in import duties, 

TARIFF SYSTEM. The tariff system is in many respects unjust; it makes unequal distributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was practically recog nized by a majority of each House of Congress, in the passage of the act creating the I ariff Commis sion. The report of that Commission will be placed before you at the beginning of this session, and will, 1 trust, afford you such information as to the condition and prospects of the various com mercial, agricultural, manufacturing, mining and other interests of the country, and contain such suggestions for statutory revision as will practi cally aid your action upon this important subject. The revenue from customs tor the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1879, amounted to $137,000,009. It has in the three succeeding years reached, first, 1 180, 000,000, then $198,000,' 00, and finally, as has been already stated. $i20,000, 00. The income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last mentioned. If the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reductions frvin the customs revenue are en tirely feasible. While recommending this reduc tion I am far from advising the abandonment of the policy of so discriminating in the adjustment of details as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor, but the present system should he so revised as to equalize the public burden among all classes and occupations, and bring it Into closer harmony with the present needs of industry. Without entering into minute detail which un der present circumstances is quite unnecessary. I recommend an enlargement of free list so as to in clude within it the numerous articles which vield in considerable revenue, a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures, particularly those of col ton, iron and steel, and a substantial reduction of the duties upon these articles, and upon sugar, molasses, Bilk, wool and woolen goods. If A 

GENERAL REVISION OF THE TARIFF shall be found to be impracticable at this ses sion, I express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous inequalities of the present law may be corrected before your final adjournment; one of them is specially referred to by the Secretary in view of a recent decision of the Supreme Court. The necessity of amending the law by which the duties standard of color is adopted as the test of the saccharine strength of sugars is too obvious- to require comment. 

SEA-COAST DEFENSES. Those puts of the Secretary of War's report wnich relate to our sea-coist deienses and their armament suegest th gravest r flections over existing fortifications a? notoriously inadequate to the defence of the gr at hnrbors and cities for whose protection they were b ilt. The question of providing an armament suited to our present necessities nas oeen me sudj ct ot consideration oy a Bond, wbose report wa transmitted to Congress at the last session. Pcndin t e consider -tion of that report ihe War Department lv-s taken no steps for the manufacture or conversion of any heavy cum on, but the Secretary expresses the nope mat autnorit ana means to begin tnat im portant wor will be toon provided. I invite the attention of Congress to the propriety of mating more adequate provisions for arming and equipping the militia than is afforded by the act of 1806, which is still upon the statute books. 

RIVER AND HARBOR BILL. The grounds that Impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill eutitled "An act making appropriations for the construction, repair and preservation oi certain works on rivers and har bors," which became a law, near the close of your last session, prompt me to express hope that no similar measure will be deemed necessary during the present session of Congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your attention. I am informed by the Secretary of War that the greater portion of the sum appropri ated for the various items specified in that act re mains unexpended. Of the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurred upon two oniy, lor wnicn tne total appropriation was SjXlO, 000. The present available balance is disclosed by me EOHOwxaK uiuie : Amount of appropriation bv act of Aueust 2, 1882,$ 8,738,875; amount of appropriation by act june iy, ia, iu,wu; amount oi appropriation lor payments to J. B. Kids, 3O4,O0O; unexpended bal ance of former appropriations, 4,738, 63; total, vi, ins: leal amount drawn irom the lrcasury between July 1, U82, and November 3D, 1882, $&056,m; total, $17,734 041. It is apparent bv this exhibit, that so far as con cerns most of the items to which the act of August 2, 1882, relates, there can be no need of further appropriations until after the close of the ptesent session. If, however, any action should seem to De necessary lu respect to pirtic alar objects it will be entirely feasible to provide for those objects by appropriate legisl.it fon. It is possible, for ex ample, that a d?lav until the ossemblinfr of the next 'jongress to make uddttional provision for the Mississippi River improvement niiht be attended with serious consequence. THE 

JEANNETTE EXPEDITION. On the 21st of December, 1881, information was received that the exploring steamer Jeannette had been crushed and abandoned in the Arctic Ocean. The officers and crew, after a journey over the Ice, embarked in three boats for the coast of Sibe ria. One of the parties, under the command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the land, and tailing in with natives, was saved. An other under Lieutenant Commander 1 Long landed in a barren region near the mouth of the Lena Kiver. Alter six weeks had elapsed all but two of the number had died from fatigue and starvation. iso tidings nave been received irom the party the third boat under command of Lieuteuaut Chipp, but a long and fruitless investigation leaves little doubt that all its members perished at sea. As a slight tribute to tneir neroism l give in tins communication the names of the gallant men who sacrificed their lives ot this expedition: Lieutenant Com mander (ieorjje W. DeLong, Surgeon James M. Amber, Jerome J ''oil ins. Hans Halnicr, Erich Ben, lleinrich H. Kaaekc, George W. Bryd, Wal ter l ee, Adolph Dressder, Carl A. Gortz, Kelse Loeren, the cook, A, II. Lane, and the Indlau, Alexy. The officers and men in the missing boat were Lieut. Charles W. Chipp, commanding-, W il liam Dunbar, Alfred Sweet man, v alter Sharvell, Albert C. Kuehne, Edwin Star, Henry D. Warren, and Peter E. Johnson, lieutenant ' ales B. Horton and Master Win. H. H. Scheuizekesch are now bringing home the remains of Lieutenant DeLong and his comrades. In pursuance of the directions of Congress, the Rodgers lilted out for the relief of tho Jeannette, in accordance with the act of C n gress of March 8. 1881, and sailed from San Fran cisco June 1 under the command of Lieutenant Bobert M. Berry. On November 30 she was acci dentally destroyed by tire while in winter quarters in St. Lawrence Bav, but the officers and crew succeeded in escaping to the shore. Li utenant Berry and one of his officer, after maki g a search for the Jean ette alo; g the coast of siber a. fell iu with t hief Engineer M-l-villi.'s p. rty and returned home by way of Europ. 'I he olh r officers and the cr w of the Rodgers were brought fr. m St Lawrence Bay by the whal ing steamer N orth Star, Master Charles F. Putnam, who had been plac--d in charge of the depot f suppl e- at C'pe ierdze. returning to his post from St. Lawrence Bay across the ice in a blinding snow-storm, was carried out to sea and lost, not withstanding all efforts to rescue him. THE NAVY. It appears by the Secretary's report that the available naval force of thn United States consists of thiity-seven cruisers, fourteen single turreted monitors, buill during the rebellion, a large num ber of smooth-bore guns and parrot rifles, and eighty-sevtn rifled cannon. The cruising vessels should gradually be replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern armed vessels, and the armament by high-power rifled guns. The reconstruction of our navy, which was recom mended in my last message, was begun by Con gress authorizing in its recent act, the construc tion of two large unarmed steel vessels of the char acter recommended by th; late Navy Advisory Board and subject, to the final approval of a new Advisory Board, to bo organized as provided by that act. I call your attention to the recommenda tion of the Secretary of the Board that authority be given to construct two more cruisers of smaller dimensions anil one fleet dispatch vessel, and that appropriations be made for high-power rifled can non, for the torpedo service, and for other harbor defenses. SHIP BUILDING. Methods of reviving American ship building and of restoring the United States flag In the ocean carrying trade should receive the immedi ate attention of Congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair competition with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor and in sailing them, higher taxes and greater interest on capital, while tho ocean highways are already monopolized by our formidable competitors. These obstacles should in some way be overcome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lauds we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamer on the principal ocean lins, or any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted. While the nations which build and sail the the ships and carry the mails and passen gers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages in increasing their trade. POSTAL MATTERS. At the last session of Congress hills wee intro duced into the House uf Representatives for the reduction of letter postage to" the rate of two cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly per suaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the public. It has been the policy of the Government from its foundation to defray a- far as possible the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of ostago. It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be productive of a net revenue. Unless some change Is made n the existing laws the profits of the postal service will in a very fow years swell the revenues of ihe Goveranient many mill! ns of dollars Tne time ems auspicious, therefore, (or some reduction in the rate ot post ace. In what shall that reduction consist? A re view of the legislation which has been had upon this subject during the last thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the only class of man matter which has never been iavoreu oy substantial reduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the service laiis most unequally upon that class, and that more than any other it is entitl?d to present relief. That such relief may be extended without detri ment to other public interests will bb disovered upon viewing the results of former reductions. Immediately prior to tne act or io, iuo piaiaBc upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as follows: If conveved 30 u lies or less, 6 cent's between 30 and 80 miles, 10 cents; between 80 and 1-0 miles, 12 cents; between li0 and 4t.o miles, ivi-A cents; ovr 4H miles, 25 cents. By the act of 1843 tli nmUm nnmi n rinvls letter conveved for an V dUtance under 300 nines was fixe! at 5 cents, and for any greater distance at 10 cent. By the act of 1861 it was prov.ded that a single letter, if prepaid, should be carried any distance not exceeding 3,000 miles for 3 cents, and Any greater "istance for 6 cents. It will be noticed that both of these reductions were of a rad cal charac ter, and relatively quite as imports it as that which is now prop sed. In each case there ensued a temporary loss ot revenue, but a sudden and large influx of business, which substantially re paired that loss with'n three years. Unless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere goes for naught, it may be safely pedicted that the stimulus of fifty per centum reduction in tax for carriage would at once increase the number of letters con signed to the malls. The advantages of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of sealed prckets for postal cards and open c reulars, and in divers other nays the volume of first-class matter would be enormously augmented. Such increase amounted in England in the first year after the adoption of penny postage to more than 133 per cent. As a resu t of careful esiima es, the details of which cannot bs here set out, I have become con vinced that the deficiency for the first 'year after the proposed reduction would not exceed seven per cent, of the expenditures, or 3,000t 0 0, while the deficiency, after tne reduct.on of 1845, was more than fourteen p-r cent , and after that of 1861 was twenty-seven per cent. 

STAR ROUTE TRIALS. The Attorney Oeneral reviews the suggestions of his predecessor that in the interests of justice bet ter provisions than the existing lawB afford should be made in certain judicial districts for fixing the fees of witnesses and iurors. In my message of December last I referred to pending criminal proceedings growing out of al leged frauds in what is know as the Star Roate'ser vice of the Postoffice Department, and advised you I had enjoined upon the Attorney General and associate counsel, to whom the interests of the Government were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of tho law all persons who might be found chargeable with those offenses. A trial of one of these cases has since oc curred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the Supreme Court ot this District, and was con ducted with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the case has been again placed upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty persons shall finally escape punishment for their offenses it will not be'for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of ths EDUCATION. No survey of our material condition can fall to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellectual progress oi the people. The census returns dis close an alarming state of illiteracy in certain por tions of the country where the provision for schools is grossly inadequate. It is a momentous question for the decision of Congress whether im mediate and substantial aid should be extended by the General Government for supplementing the efforts of private beneficence, and of State and Territorial legislation in behalf ol education. The regulation of inter-State commerce has already been the subject of your deliberations. OUR RAILWAY SYSTEM. One of the incidents of the marvelous extension of the railway system of the country has been the adoption of such measures by the corporations which own or control the roads as has tended to impair the advantages of healthful competition, and make hurtful discriminations in the adjust ment of freightage. These inequalities have been corrected in several of the States by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily re stricted to the limits of their own territory. So far as such mischiefs affect commerce between the States or between any one of the wtea and a foreign country, they are subjects of Wational concern, and Congress alone can afford relief. MORMONISM. The results which have thus far attended the en forcement of the re- ent statute for the suppression of polygamy In the Territories are r ported by the Secretai y of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional legislation in this regard will be deemed desirable uutil the ef fect of existing laws shall be more closely observed and studied. I congratulate you that the Commis si ners under whose superv sion those laws have been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil at which they aimed may be suppressed with out resort to such radical measures as in some quar ters have been th u . lit indispensablo for success. THE TERRITORIES. The close relation of the General Government to the Territories preparing to be great States may well engage your special attention. It is there that the Indian disturbances mainly occur and that poli gamy has found, room for its growth. I can not doubt that a careful survey of Territorial leg islation would be of the highest utility. Life and property would become more secure, the liability of outbreaks between Indians and whites would be lessened, the public domain would be more securely guarded and better progress made in the instruction of the young. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The communication which I made to Congress at its first session in December last contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in rela tion to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to public service. Referring to the various plans which had heretofore been the subject of discussion in the National Legislature, plans which in the main were modeled upon the system which obtains iu Great Britain, but which lacked certain of tbe prominent features whereby that system is distinguished, I felt bound to inti mate my doubts whether they or any of them would afford adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct. I declare nevertheless that if the proposed measures should prove acceptable to Congress, they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive. Since the suggestions were submitted tor your consideration there has been no legislation upon the subject to which they r late, but ther - has meanwhile been an in crease in the public interest in that subject, and the people of the country, apparenll without distinction of party, lave in various ways and upon frequent occasions given express on to their earnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action should no longer be postponed. I may add that my own sense of its pressing importance has been quickened by obser vation in a practical phae of the mattes, to which attention has more than once been called by my predecessors. The civil list now comprises about one hundred thousand persons, for the larger part of whom must, under tne terms of the Constitu tion, be selected by the President either directly or through his own appointees. I trust that before the close of the present ses sion some decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils which inhere in the present methods of appointment, and 1 assure you of my hearty co-operation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most ap propriate term and tenure of tbe official life of the subordinate employes of the fiovernment it seems to be generally agreed that whatever their extent or character theoue should be definite and the other staple, and that neither should be regulated bv seal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an individual. I feel bound to correct a prevalent apprehension as to the frequency with which the present Execu tive has displaced the incumbent of an office and ap poln ed another iu his stead. It has been repeated ly alleged that he has iu this particular s gnaliy de parted from the course which has beu pursued un d. r roc nt administrations of the Government. The facts are as ;oilows: The who'e number of Ex ecutive appointments during the four years immedi ately preceding M r. Garfields accession to the Pres idency vai 2,090. I f this number 244, or l ine per cent. , involved the removal of previous incumbents. The rates of removals to the whole number of ap po ntments was much the same during each of those tour years. In the first year, with 79) appointments, there were 7 1 removals, or 0.3 percent. In the second, with 917 appointments,-tliere were 8 removals or 8.5 per cent. In the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48 removals, or 1' per cent. Is the fourth, with 429 appointments, there were $7 re movals, or 8.6 per cent. Iu the four months of President Garfield's administration there were 390 appointments and 89 removals, or 2:. 7 per cent. Precisely the same number of removals (89) has taken place in the fourteen months which have since elapsed, but they constitute ouly percent, of the whole number of appointments, i within that period, and less than 2-0 of the entire list of officials, 8,459, exclusive of the army and navy, which is filled by l'residential appointment. 

POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS. I declare my approval of fuch legislation as may be found necessary for supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political assess ments. In July last I authorized a public an nouncement that employes of the Government should regard themselves as at liberty toexercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make po liticnl contributions, nnd that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official status. In this announcement I acted upon the view which I had always maintained, and still maintain, that a public officer should be as abso lutely free as any other citizen to give or to with hold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation in fact, that by solicitation of superiors and by other methods, such contributions have at times been obtained from persons, wbose only motive for giving has been fear of what might'befall them if they refused. It goes without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment their col lection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually suppressthcm will receive my cor dial approval. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The report of the District Commissioners Indi cate certain measures whose adoption would seem to be very desirable. I instance in particular those which relate to arrears of taxes, to steam railroads and to assessments of real property. THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNT. Among the questions which have been the topic of recent debate in the halls of ongress, none are of treater gravity than those relating to the ascer tainment of the vote for President al Electors, and the intendment of the Constitution In ita pro visions for devolving executive functions upon the "Vice President when the President suffers from inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office. 1 trust that no embarrassment may result from a failure to determine these questions before another National election. The closing year has been re plete with blessings for which we owe to the giver of all good our reverent acknowledgement for the uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations; for the decay of sectional aniruosities: for the ex uberance of our harvests and the triumphs of our miniug and manufacturing indus tries; for the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence and the conservation of the public credit, for the growth of the country in all elements of national greatness. For these and countless other blessings we should rejoice and be glad. 1 trust that under the inspiration of this great prosperity our counsels may be harmonious, an 1 that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice and economy may be the adoption of measures in which the Congress and the Executive may heart 

CHESTER A. ARTHUR. A Southern paper says tbe girls of thp MiiHty clime describe this world as onr- of "bustle, toil isn ! care." We agre with them the women have all the bustle, the meu the toil and care, A Javanese Rampoken. A paper published in Java, says: yesterday took place the announced clearance among the tigers belonging to his highnesB the Sultan, in order to make room for a fresh supply when the new tiger-pens will be built. At about ten o'clock a. m. the Sultan, the Resi dent Military Commander, the Assistant Resident, and other spectators appeared behind the Kraton, and seated them selves in a grand stand constructed for the purpose. Thousands of Javanese flocked to the spot to see the combats. Soon a fight between a tiger and a buf falo together in a pen was commenced. The tiger was several times tossed into the air and then gored to death by the buffalo, which had been made as furious as possible by peppered water, burning nettles, and red-hot iron bars. This combat lasted fully two hours. After ward began the rampoken or tiger-fight On the plain alongside the Kraton stood Javanese, armed with stout spears hi teen to eighteen feet long, drawn np in rows, one behind the other, forming altogether an extraordinarily large square. The two foremost rows lay kneeling, the two hindmost stood erect jn tne centre oi tnis open spaoe were thirteen straw-roofed, wooden pens, in each of which was a tiger. At a given signal a musical instrument called the gamelan begins playing martial air to slow measure. The tiger keepers then step out of the ranks and approach the cage. Two of them bear each a burning torch, with which they set hre to the straw. The tiger, fright ened by the shower of sparks, is then forced out into the open space, but knows not whither to turn. It roams round and seeks whether it can find an outlet, until it endeavors either by a des perate spring to get away over the human wall which keeps it inclosed, or tries to creep through underneath. But it falls pierced by the many spears which have struck it. It utters a savage ciy, which is drowned by the applause and shouts of the multitude. In silent agony it strikes around it with its mighty paws. The shafts of the spears often break like glass. In such cases a single blow might cost the life of any unfortunate within reach of its claws. It is killed afterward in due form. This scene took place thir teen times successively with as many tigers, the festivity closing at two p. m. Only a few accidents occurred. One soldier by ill luck receiving a spear thrust when combatting with a tiger, and was severely wounded in the leg. A native received a bite when one of the tigers broke the square and was killed outside it, after causing great commotion among the spectators. The Cost of Religion. According to a statistical contempo rary, the cost of maintaining the churches of the whole country, and of conducting the benevolent work in which they are engaged, is $106,692,000 a year, or about $7 for each of the 16,190.936 members. Jews pay $135 each, Episcopalians $44, Congregational and Dutch Reformed members $15, Presbyterians $13, Baptists, Lutherans and Methodists $6, and Roman Catho lics $3. The total expenditure of the Roman Catholic Church is estimated at $20,000,000. The total expenditure of tne i'rotestant cnurcnes in this city amount to $6,500,000 a year, and the average per member in those churches is $34. Kew York contains about one fiftieth of the population of the whole Union, and were the expenditures to be at me same rate for tne whole country, the aggregate expenditure would be nearly $450,000,000.
