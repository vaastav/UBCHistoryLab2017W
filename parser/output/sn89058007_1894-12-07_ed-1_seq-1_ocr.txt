A jrratify ltmr re.ivnition of the uniform im PM' tiality of this country towards all foreign sta-es was manifested by the co-incident re quest of the Chinese and Japanese povern men ts that the aents of the United State should, within proper limits afford protection to the Hib-ects of the other during the suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state of war. This delicate oftfee was accepted, and a mis apprehension w hich jrave rise to the lelief that In affording this kindly unofficial protection cur aj-ents would exercise the same.

A convention has brcn finally concluded for the settlement by arbitration cf the prolonged dispute with F.cuador grown out ef the pro-cec-lings against F.millc Sanf-s, a naturalised citizen of the United States. i Our relations with the republic of France continue to bo such as should exist between ration so long bousid together by friendly sympathy uml similarity isi their form of gov ernniCiit. The recent crul assassination of the presi dent of this sister republic called forth such universal expression of sorrow and condolence from our people and government as to leave no doubt cf the depth en I sincerity of cur attach ment.

CLEVELAND was rea"hed with Gre it Britain concerning in structions to b given to the naval commanders of the two poverm'r.ts in Bering sea aid the contiguous norta Facile ocean for their ffsiid anee In the execution of tie award of the Pari tribunal arbitration and the enforcement of th regu'ations therein prescribed for the protec tion of seal life in the waters mentioned. An understanding has also lca reached for the payment by the United States of f Ii5.0 in full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by Great Britain for damage growing out of the controversy as to fur seals in Beht ingSea or the- seizurs of Hrlti-j a vessels engaged in taking seal in thoso waters. The award and findings of the Paris tribunal to a great extent determined the facts and principles upon which these claims should be adjusted and they have leen subjected by both governments to a thorough examination upon the principles rs well as the facts which taey inrolve. I am con Ince l that a settlement upon the terms men tioned would be an efpaita'de and advantageous one and I reeommc.id that provision be made for the prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus far, only France and Portugal have sig nified their willingness to adhere to the regula tion established under the award of tho Paris tribunal of arbltratloa. Preliminary surveys of the AlasUam boundary and a preparatory examination of the question or protection of the food fish in the contiguous waters of the- United Slates and the Dominion of Canada are in progress. The boundry of British Guiniea still remains in dispute between Great Britain and Veni zeula. Believing that its early (settlement on some just busis alike honorable to both par ties, is In the line of our established policy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of dif ferences with powers beyond the sea. I shall re new the efforts heretofore made to bring about a restoration of diplomatic reh.Uons between the disputants and Induce recourse to arbitra tion which Great Britain so conspicuously favors in principal and respects in practice and which is earnestly sought by her weaker adver sary. Since communicating the volumnous cor respondence In regard to Hawaii and the ac tion taken by the .senate and house of regre sentatives "on certain questions submitted to the Judgment and w ider discretion of congress the organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the Queen has been announc ed with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition usual In such cases has been ac corded the new government under our present treaties of cxtravation v-ith Italy miscarriages of justice have occurred owing to the refusal of the government to surrender its own sub jects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended convention obviating this diDleulty has been unavailing. Apart from the war in which the island em pire is engaged Japan attracts increasing at tention in this country by her evident desire to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid In the furtherance of her lauable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic affairs and full equality in the family of nations. The Japanese empire of to day is no longer the Japan of the past, and our relations with this progressive uatioa should not be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. Good will fostered by many interests in common has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighlor. Peace beisig restored along her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and nav igation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the intercourse between the two countries Is attested by the fact that during this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased under the role of mutual consideration, being neither stimulated by con ventional arrangements nr retarded by jeal ous rivalries or selfish distrust. An indemnity tendered by Mexico as a gra cious act for the murder In iss,- of Leon Bald win an American citizen by a band of marau ders in Durango has been accepted and is be ing paid in installments. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Kio Grande for irrigation should be solved by ap propriate concurrent action of the two inter ested couutrles. Rising in the Colorado Height the stream flows intermittently yield ing little water during the dry months to the irrigating channels already constructed along its course. In its course through level sands often raise embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdic tion. Prominent among the questions of the year was the Bluellelds incident. In what is known as ihe Mosquito Indian strip bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and within the juris diction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of 130 be tween Great Britain and Nicaragua the for mer government expressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self government was guaran teed to the Mosquito Indians to be exercised according to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers within its limits. The socalled native government, which grew to be largely made up of aliens for many years disputed the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and clufincd the right to maintain therein a practically independent municipal government. Korly in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances culminatinz in the suppression of the native government and the attempted substitution of an impracticable 'composite administration in which Nicaragua and alien residents were I) participate. Failure was followed by an insurrection which for a lime subverted Ni caraguan rule, expelling her osrieers sind re storing the old organization. This, in turn, gvo place to the existing local government established nnd upheld by Nicaragua. Although the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely American and the commerce of that region has been for some time and still is chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot for that reason challenge the rightful sover eignty of Nicaragua over this Important part of her domain. For some months one, and part of the time two. of our naval, ships have been stationed at Blueilelds for the protection of all legitimate interests of our citizeus. In September last the government at Nicaragua expelled from its territory twelve or more for eigners including two Americans for alleged participation in the seditious or revolutionary movements against the republic Bt Bluefields already mentioned, but by the earnest remon strances of this government, the two Ameri cans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management cf their business. Our naval commanders at the scene of these dis turbances by their constant exhibition of firm ness and good judgment contributed larjrely to the prevention cf more serious consequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. I regret tkat la the' n'dst of these occur rences there happened a most grave and irri tating failure cf Niraraguan justice. An American citizen r.amtd Wilson residing nt Kama, in the mosquito territory, was mur dered by one Angillo. the acting governor of the town. After some delay the murderer was arrested but so insecurely confined or guarded that be escaped and notwithstanding our re peated demands, it is claimed his recapture has been impossible by reason cf his Bight be yond Nicarajruan Jurisdiction. The Nicaraguaa authorities having given notice of forfeiture of their concession to the canal rororanv oa grounds putely technical and net embraced in the contract, hae receded from that position. Peru. I regret to say. shows symptoms of do mestic disturbances due rrcbabiy to the slow ness of her recuperation from the distresses of the war cf 151. Wcake-jed in resources, her difficulties in facing international obligations invite oar kindly s mpathy and justify our for bearauce in pressing long pending claims. I have felt constrained to testify this sympathy In connection with certain demands ur gently preferred by other iowers. The recent death of the C'ar of Kussia called forth appro priate expressions of sorrow and sympathy oa the rart of our jrovernment with hi ber?aved family and the Kdssian people. As a further demonstration of respect and friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies. The sealing interests of Kussta in BefcrinK- sea Bre sevocd only to our own. A modus d:endl has therefore been con cluded with the impes ia! governuient res:ric tlv cf poaetlng ca the lcusa tvoktila uul cf stalinj la witeri wt;h wi:e not cccjr-teu-.'ca a iivifvtci atfr, sfir,1 in a Paris sward. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian covernmet equality of treatment for ovr great life insurance compa nies whose operatUas have been extended throughout Europe, Admitting as we do foreign operation to transact business in the United States, tre naturally expected no less tolerance for our ow n in the ample fields of competition abroad. But few cases of interference with naturaliz ed citizens returning to Russia have been re ported during the current year. One Krze mlnski, w as arrested last summer in a Polish province on a reported charge of unpermitted renunciatiation of Kussian allegiance but it transpired that the proceedings originated in alleged maleasfance committed by Kriemldskl while an imperial oWcial a number of years ago. Efforts for his release, which promised to be successful, were in progress when his death was reported. The government of Salvador being over thrown by an abrupt iopular outbreak, certain of its military and civil officers, while hotly pursued by infuriated insurgents, soua-t refuge on board of the United States warahip Bennlnsrlon, then lvlng in a Salvadorn port. Although the practice of asylum is not favored by this government, yet in view of the immi ncnt peril which threatened the fugitives, odd solely from consideration of humanity, they were afforded shelter by our naval commander nnd then afterwards demanded under our treaty of citraditoa with Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson and robbery, I di rected that such of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be conveyed to one of our nearest ports where a hearing could be bad before a judiciary officer incompliance with the terms of the treaty. On their arrival at San Fran cisco such a proceeding was promptly insti tuted before the United district judge, who held that the acts constituting the alleged offenses were political ami discharged all the accused except Cienfuegoes. who was held for attempt to murder. Thereupon 1 was con strained to direct his release for the reason that an attempt to murder was not one or the crimes charged against him aud upon which his surrender to the Salvadorean authorities had beeti demanded. Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by Spalnon the vessels and commerce of the United States, have demanded from time to time, during the last twenty years, earnest re monstrance on the part of our government. In the immediate past exorbitant penalties have been imposed upon our vessels and goods by customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Kico for clerical errors of the most trivial character in the manifest s or bills of lading. In some case3 fines amounting to thousands of dollars have been levied upon cargoes or the carrying ves sels when the goods in question were entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when the error had been detected and the Spanish authorities notified before the arrival of the goods in port. This conduct isin strange contrast with the con siderate and literal treatment extended to Spanish vessels and cargoes ia our ports in like cases. No satisfactory settlement of these vex ations questions has yet been reached. The Mora casi, referred to in my last annual mes sage, remains rnsettled. From the diplomatic correspondence on this subject, which has been laid beforo the senate, it will be seen that this government has offered to con -dude a conven tion with Spain for disposal by arbitration of outstanding claims bet ween the two countries, except the Mora claim, which having been long ago adjusted now cnly wants payment os stipu lated and of course it coj Id not be included in the proposed convention. It was hoped this offer would remove parliamentary obstacles en countered by the Spanish government in pro viding payment of the Mora indemnity. 1 re gret to say that no definite reply to this offer has yet been made and a'.l efforts to accure pay ment of this settled claim have been unavail ing, In my last annual message I adverted to the claim on the part or Turkey of the right to ex pell, 83 persons undesirable and and dangerous, Americans naturalized in the United States and returning to Turkish jurisdiction. Numer ous questions in this relation have arisen. While this government acquiesces in the as serted right of expulsion it will not consent that Americans may be imprisoned or other wise punished for no other reason than having acquired without imperial consent American cittzenship. Three of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and I am advised that an appeal against the acquital of the remaining five has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officers. A convention has been concluded with Vcnezula for the arbitra tion of a long disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels, the property of citi zens of the United States. Although signed, the treaty of extradition with Venezuela is not yet in force, owing to the insistence of that government that, when stir rendered, its citizens shall in no case be liable to capital punishment. The rules for the prevention of collisions at sea which were framed by the maritine confer ence held in this city In IS-O having been con currently incorporstted in the statues of the United States and Great Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1, irc5, and invitations have been extended to all maritine nations to adhere to them, Favorable re sponses have thus far been received from Aus tria, France, Portugal Spain and Sweden. In my last annual message I referred briefly to tho unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty as signally illustrating tho impolicy of entang ling alliances with foreign powers, and on May 8, 1804, in response to a resolution of the senate I sent a special message and document to that body on the same subject, w h!ch emphasised my previously expressed opinions. Later oc currences, the corresiwndence in regard to which will tie laid ofore congress further demonstrates that the government which was devised by the three powers and forced upon the Samoans against their invcteri'te hostility can be maintained only by the con tinued presence of foreign military force and at no small saoriiice of life and treasure. The suppression of the Matasfa insurrection by the powers, and the subsequent banishment of the leader aud eleven other chiefs, as recited in my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the islands. Formidable uprisings continued and finally a rebellion broke out in the capitol island. The King again appealed to the powers for help and the combined British and German na-.-al forces reduced, theAtuans to apparent subjection not however without considerable loss to the natives. A few days later Yarna sese and his adherent, fearing the ships and the marines, professed submission. Keports received from our agents at Apia do not justi fy the belief that the peace thus brought about will be of long duration. It is their conviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present government; that such of them as profess loyalty to it do so from fear of the lowcrs ani that it would speedily go to pieces if the warships were withdrawn. In report ing to his government on the unsatisfactory situation since the suppression of the late re volt, by foreign armed forces, the Gorman con sul at Apia stated that peace w ill be lasting is hardly to be presented. The lesson givon by firing on Afia was not sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave a lustii impression on the forgetful Samoan temperament. In fact conditions arc existing w hich show that peace will not last and it is not seriously Intruded. Listen, the king, and his chief are convinced that the departure or the warships will be a signal for a renewal of war. The circumstan ces that the representatives of the villages of ail the districts whih were opposed to the government have already withdrawn to Atua to hold meetings and that both Atua and Aana have forbidden inhabitants of these districts which fojght on the side of the government to return to their villages and have already partly burned dow n the latter indicates a real con ciliation of the p3rties is still far off." And in a note of the lth Ula inclosing a copy of that report for th.- information of this gov ernment, the German ambassador said : "The contents cf the report awakenedotbe im perial governments apprehension that under existing circumstances the peace concluded with the rebels will afford no assurance of the lusting restoration i f tranquility In the is lands. The present government has utterly failed to correct, if indeed it has not atfgrevated. the Tery evils It was intended to prevent. It' hag not stimulated cur con.3.ercc v.itli the the u. lands.

The secretary of the "treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1W4. amounted to 3ri.80j,4siR.29 and its ex penditures to $442,601,738, leaving a deficit of 3,SC3,240.53. There was a decrease of f 13,!52, 74.C3 in the ordinary expenses of the govern ment as compared with the fiscal year lfia3. There was collected from customs S 131.818,530.62 and from internal revenue f 147,168,419.70. The balance of the income for the year amounting to 193.815.817.97 was derived from the sales of lands and other sources. The balance of our total dutiable imports amounts to $273.109,06, being f 155,657,(525 less than during the preceding year and the im portations free of duty amounted to $37!,7tt3, 536, being $04, 74S.675 less than during the pre ceding year. The receips from customs were $73,53(5.4K6.H less and from internal revenue $13,830,533.97 less than in ISM. The total tax collected from distilled spirits was $85,250,130.25 on manufactured tobacco $23,61 7,89.62 and on fermented liquors $31,414,788.01. Our exports of merchandise domestic and foreign, amount ed during the year to $892,140,572, being an in crease over the preceding year of $14,483,378. The report of the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme court in overcoming the arrears of its business and in reeching a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course very largely due to the successful working of the plan of inaugurating circuit courts of ap peals. In respect to these tribunals tho sug gestion is made in quarters entitled to the highest consideration that on additional dis trict jude for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence re posed in their adjudications. And that such an addition would not create a greater force of judges than the increasing business of such courts requires. I commend the suggestion to the careful consideration of the congress. Other important topics are adverted to in the report, accompanied by recommendations, many of which have been treated at large in previous messages, and at this time therefore need only be named. I refer to the abolition of tho fee system as a measure of compensa tion to federal officers. The enlargement of the powers of the United States commissioners at least in the territories, the allowance of writs of error in criminal cases on behalf of the United States, and the establishment of degrees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the attorney general of much impor tance is the condition of the administration of justice in the Indian Territory. The perma nent solution of what is called the Indian problem is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present conditions as the existing system will admit of ought not to bo neglected. I am satisfied there shonld be a federal court estab lished for the territory with sufficient judges, und that this court should sit within the terri tory and have the same jurisdiction as to terri torial affairs as is now vested In the federal courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas. Free Thronjrh tho Malls. The postofilce master general believes that io the near future all legitimate newspapers and periodical magazines might be properly trans mitted through the mails to their subscribers free of cost. I invite your prompt consideration of this subject, and fully indorse the views of the post master general. The total number of postofficee in the United States on the 60th of June 1S".4 was 69,805 an in crease of 40J over the proceeding year. Of these 34'8 were presidential, an increase in that class of OS over the preceding year. Six hundred and ten cities and towns aro provided with free delivery. Ninety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the law have not been accorded in on ac count of inefficient funds. The expense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than $12,300 000 and under existing legislation this item of expenditures is subject to constant increase. The estimated cost of raral free de livery, generally is so very large that It ought not to be considered in the present condition of affairs. During the year 8-70 additional domestic money order offices were established. Tho toial number of these offices at the close of the year was 13.2C4. There were 14 303 041 money orders Issued during the year, being an increase over the preceding year of Wt..Tnt. The value of these orders amounted 1o' $138,793,579.4), an increase of $11 217.1 P5.84. There were also is sued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,619,091.55. During the year 213 international money order offices were added to these already established, making a total of 2.625 such offices in operation June 30th, 18t4. The number of in ternational money orders issued during the year was 917,sj i, a decrease in n jmber of 138, 17;5 nnd their value w as 13.792,455,81, a decrease in amount of $2 54',3S2..V. Tho number of orders paid was 801.180, an increase over the preceding year of 60,262 and 1 heir value was $6,563,433.73, an increase of $1,20,118.03. From the foregoing statement it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes or the year mounted to $K,220.2i9-;. The number of letters and packages mailed durin!,' the year for special delivery was 3.436, 870. The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $313, 797. The messengers fees paid for their de livery amounted to $261. .0 ).70, leaving a bal ance in favor of the government of $82,487.30. The report shows most gratifying results in the way of eeonemics worked out without af fecting the efficiency of the postal service. These consist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy contracts, re-letting of mail contracts, and In the cost and amount of supplies used in the service amounting to f 16 619.017.42. This report also contains a valuable contri bution to the history of the Universal Postal union, an arrangement which amounted prac tically to the establishment of one postal sys tem for the entire civilized world. Special at tention is directed to this subject at this time, in view of the fact that the next congress of the union will meet in Washington in 18t7 aad it is hoped that t i pie ly action will be taken in the direction of perfecting preparations for that, cyents The postmaster general renews the sugges tion made in a previous report that the depatt ment organization Ik? increased to the extent of creating a direct supervision of all postal affairs, and in this suggestion I fully concur. There are now connected with the postofilce establishment 32.661 employes who arc in the classified service. This Includes many who have been classified upon the suggestion of the postmaster general. He states that another year's experience at the head of the department serves only to strengthen the conviction as to the excellent working of the civil service law in this branch of the public service. Attention is called to the report of the secre tary of the navy, w hich shows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our new navy. AU the vessels now building, in cluding the three torpedo boats authorized at the last session of congress excepting the first class battleship Iowa, win probably be com pleted during the coming fiscal year. The estimates for the increase cf the navy for the year ending June30. 1896. are large, but they include practically the entire sum neces sary to complete and equip ail the new shipo cot now in commission r;o that unless new ships arc authorized the appropriations for the naval service far. the fiscal year ending June 30. 1897, should fall below the estimates for the coming year by at least $12 000.000. The secretary presents with much earnest ness a plea for the authorization of three ad ditioaal battle ships and ten or twelve torpedo boats. While the unarmored v sselj heretofore authorized, including those now nearing com pletion, will constitute a fleet, which it is be lieved is sufficient for ordinary cruising pur poses in time of peace, we have now completed and in process of construction but four first class battle ships and but four torpedo boats. If we are to have a navy for warlike operations offensive and defensive, we certainly ought to Increase both the number of battle ships and torpedo boats. I recommend that provision be made for the eoristrtsetion of additional batteship and tor pedo boat. The secretary r-cornmer.ded the uiar4ufactr Rwt ecly f a rer supply ot ordnance and ordnance material for ships of the navy but also a supply for the auxiliary field. Onus and their appurtenances should be provided and kept on hand for both these purposes. We have hot today a single gun that could be put upofi the ships Paris rr New York of the international navigation com pany or ariy other ship of or reserved nory. The manufacturer of guns at the Washington navy yards is proceeding satisfactorily, arid none of our new ships will be required to wait for their gun or ordnance equipments. An important order has been issued by the secre tary of the navy, co-ordiuating the duties of the several bureaus concerned in the con struction of ships. This order it is believed will secure to a greater extent than has here tofore been possible the harmonious action of these several bureaus and make the attain ment of the best results more certain. During the past fiscal year there has been an unusual and pressing demand in many quarters of the world for vessels to guard American interests. In January last during the Brazil ian Insurrection a large fleet was concentra ted in the harbor of the Rio dc Janeiro. The vigorous action cf Rear Admiral Benham in protecting the personal and commercial rights of our citizens during the disturbed conditions afforded results which w ill, it is believed, have a far reaching and wholesome influence when ever in like circumstances it may become nec essary for our naval commanders to interfere in behalf of our people in foreign ports. The war now in progress between China and Japan has rdndered it necessary or expedient to dispatch eight vessels to those waters. The report of the secretary of the interior exhibits the situation of the numerous and in teresting branches of the public service con nected with bis department. I commend this report and the valuable recommendations of the secretary to the careful attention of the congress. The public land disposed of during the year amounted to 10,401.605.77 acres, including 28, 876.05 of Indian lands. It is estimated that the public domain still remaining amounts to a little more than 6X,000,000 acres, including, however, about 360,000,000 acres in Alaska as well as military reservations and railroad and other selections of land as yet unadjudicated. The total cash receipts from the sale of lands amounted to ?2,674,L'85.95, including $91,931.03 received from Indian lands. Thirty-five thou sand patents were issued for agricultural lands and thirty-one hundred patents were issued to Indians on allotments of their holdings in severalty. The land not allotted being inalien able by the Indians for a period of twenty-five years after patent. There were certified and patented on account of railroad and wagon grants during the year 865,556.45 acres of land, aud at the close of the year twenty-nine acres are embraced in the lists of selections made by railroad men and wagon road companies and awaited settlement. The selections of- swamp lands, and that taken as indemnity therefrom since the passage of the act providing for the same in 18-19, amount to or nearly or quite eighty million acres, of which f if ty-eight million have been patented to states. About 138.C0) acres were patented during the last year. Nearly 820,000 acres of school and education grants were approved during the year, and at its close 1,250,363.81 acres remained unadjusted. It appears that the appropriation for the cur rent year, on account of special service for the protection of the public lands and the timber thereon, is much less than those for previous years and inadequate for an efficient perform ance of the work. A larger sum of money than has been appropriated during a number of years past on this account has been returned to the government as a result of tho labors of those employed in the particular service men tioned, and I hope it will not be crippled by an insufficient appropriation. I fully endorse the recommendation of the secretary that adequate protection be provided for our forest reserves and that a comprchcnscve forestry system be inaugurated. - At the close of the last fiscal year, on the 30th day of June,lS94. there were 969,644 persons on our pension rolls, being a net increase of 3,532 over the number reported at the end of the previous year. These pensions may be classified as follows: Soldiers and sailors',, survivors of all wars, 753.978; widows and relatives of deceased sol diers, 215,182; army nurses in the war of the rebellion 414. Of these pensioners : 32,039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to the late civil war and the widows or relative of such soldiers. The remainder, num bering 93 ,505 are receiving pensions on account of tho war of the bebellion and of these 469,340 are on tho rolls under the authority of the act of June 27, 890, sometimes called the depen dent pension law. The total amount expended for pensions dur ing the year was $139,801,461, leaving an unex pended balance from the sum appropriated of $23,205,712. The amount necessary to meet pension ex penditures for the year ending June 30, 1896, is estimated at $sl4aooo.im The commissioner of pensions is of the opin ion that the year 1895, being the thirtieth after the close of the war of the rebellion, must ac cording to all sensible human calculation see the highest limit of the pension roll and that after that year it must begin to decline. The claims pending in the bureau have de creased more than 90,CO0 during the year. A large proportion of the new claims filed are for increase of pension by those now on the rolls. The number of certificates issued was 80,213. The names dropped from the rolls for all causes during the year numbered 37,951. Among our pensioners are nine widows and three daughters of the revolution and forty five survivers cf the war of 1812. The bare-faced and extensive pension frauds exposed under the direction of the courageous and generous veteran soldier now at tho head of the bureau leave no room for the claim that no purgation of our p?nsion ro!ls was needed or that continued vigilance and prompt action are not nee es.iary to the same, and the accusation that an effort to detect pension frauds is evi dence of unfriendliness tow ards our worthy -et-erans and a denial of their claims to the gener enlty of the government, suggests an unfortu nate indifference to t Lie commission of any of fence waich Las for its motive the issuing of a pension, and Indica'ioa of a willingness to be blind to tho existence of mean and treacherous crimes which play upon demagoic fears and make sport of the patriotic impjlsecf a grate ful people. The completion of the eleventh census is r.ow in charge of the commissioner of labor. Tiie total disbursements on account of the work for the fiscal year ending June 30th 1894, amounted ?19,S6V076. 31, a? the close of the year the number persons employed in the cen sus office was 67J, at present there arj about 40J. The whole number of volumes necessary to comprehend the 11' h census will be twenty five and they w ill contain 22,270 i riated pages. The assurance is conf'de itly made that before the dose of tie jreen eOcn'ar year tin material still incomplete will be practically in hand and th3 census can certainly be closed by the 4th of Mar.h, 1895. After that the revision and proof reading necessary to bring out the volumes will still be required. The text of the census volumes has been lim ited as far as possible to the analysis ofjtbo statistics presented. Tcii method which is in accordance with law has caused more or less friction aad in some instances individual disap pointment for w hen the commissioner ot ;labor took charge of the work be found much matter on hand which according to this, rule he was compelled to discard. The tariff act passed at the last session ef congress needs important amenedments if it is to be executed effectively and with cettainty. In addition to such necessary .amendments as will not change rates of duty, I am still very decidedly in favor of puttiDg coal and iron on Ae free list. So far as the sugar schedule is concerned, I wouldbe glad, under existing aggravations, to see every particle of differential duty in favor of refining sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If w ith all the favor nov accorded the sugar refining interests in our tariff laws it still lan guishes to the extent of closed refineries and thousands of discharged workzren, it would seem to present a hopeless case for reasonable legislative aid- ' . - i'! During the last month the' gold reserved la the treasury for the purise of redeeming the notes of the government circulating as money in the hands of the people became so reduced and its further depict ion in the near future seemed so certain that in the exercise of prop er care for the public welfare it became nec cetn&ty to iepler.lsli this reserve and taua KalBta'.n popular fsutb. in tha LttUy etii ;. tefmirtaMon of the government to meet, agreed, its pecuniary obligations. It would have been well if iri this emergency authority had existed, to issue tue: trends of the gov ernment bearing a low date ot Inleret and maturing within a short period, but Ihe eon gross having failed to confer such authority, fesor t was necessarily had to the resumption act of 1873, and pursuant to its provisions bonds were issued drawing interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum and maturing ten years after their issue, that being the short est time authorised by the act. I am glad to say, however, that on the sale of these bonda the premium received operated to reduce the rate of interest to be paid by the government to less than 3 per cent. Nothing could be worse or further removed from sensible finance that the relations existing between the cur rency. The government has issued the gold bonds for its redemption and the means which must be resorted to for the purpose of re plenishing such redemption fund when in spired. Kven if the claims upon this fund were confined to the obligations originally in tended and if the redemption of these obliga tions meant their cancellation the fund would be very small. But these obligations when read and redeem ed in gold are not canceled but are reinsued and may do duty several times by way of draw ing gold from the treasury thus we have an endless chain of opera Hon constantly deplet pletlng the treasury's gold end never near a final rest as if this was not bad cnought we have by r statuatory declaration that it is the pclicy of the government To maintain the parity bet ween gold and sil ver, aided the force and momentum of this ex hausting process, and added largely to the cur rency obligations claiming this peculiar geld redemption our small gold reserve is the sub ject to drain from every side. The demands that increase our danger also Increase the necessity of protecting this re serve against depletion and it Is most unsrtis factory to know that the protection afforded Is only a temporary palliation. It is perfectly and palpably plain that the only way under present conditions by w hich this reserve when dangerously depleted can be replenished is through the issue and sale of the bonds of the government gold, and yet congress has not only thus far declined to authorize the issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there seems a dispositionin some quarters to deny both the necessity and power for the issuo of bonds at all. I cannot for a moment believe that any or our citizens are deliberately w ill ing that their government should default in its pecuniary obligations or that its financial op erations should be reduced to a silver basis. At any rate I should not feci that my duty was done if I omitted any effort I could make to avert such calamity. As long therefore as no provisfon is made for the scheme modifying present banking laws and providing for tho is sue of circulating notes by state banks free from taxation under certain limitations. It is proposed to repeal all laws providing for the deposit of United States bonds as necu rity for circulation, to permit national banka to issue circulating notes not exceeding in amount seventy-live per ceut. of their paid-up and impaired, capital, provided they deposit with the government as a guarantee fund in United States legal tender notes, including treasury notes of 1893, a sum equal in amount to thirty per cent, of the notes they desire to issue this deposit to be maintained at all times, but when any bank retires any part of its circulation a proportionate part of its guar antee fund shall be returned to issue, to per mit the secretary of the treasury to- prepare and keep on hand ready for issue in ca.se an in crease in circulation is desired blank national notes for each back having circulation and to repeal the provisions of the present law ira-' posing limitations and restrictions upon banks desiring to reduce or Increase their circulation thus permitting such increase or reduction within the limit of seventy-five percent, of capital "to be quickly made as emergencies arise. In addition to the guarantee fund re quired it is proposed to provide a safety fund for the immediate redemption of the circulat ing notes of failed banks by Imposing a small tax, say one-half of one per cent, upon the average circulation of each bank until the funds amounts to five per cent, of the total cir culation outstanding. Each national bank, except in rase of a fulled bank shall redeem or retiro its notes in the first instance at its own office or at agencies to be maintained on account of deposits. Another very important feature of this plan is the exemption of state banks from taxation by the United States in cases where It is sho n to the satisfaction or the secretary of the treas ury and comptroller of the currency by banks claiming such exemption that they have not had outstanding their circulating note exceed ing 75 per cent of their paid up and unimpaired capital, that their stockholders are individually liable for the redemption of their circulating notes to the full extent of their ownership of stock; that the liabilities of said banks upoa their circulating notes constitutes under their state law a first lien upon their assets; lhat such banks have kept and maintained a guaran tee fund in United States lepral tender notes in cluding treasury notes of lJw equal to thirty per cent of their outstanding circulating notes when presented at their principal or branch of fices. I conclude tbis communication fully appre ciating that the responsibility for all legisljticn affecting the people of xht United States rests upon their representatives in congress and as suring them that whether in accordance with recommendations I have made or not, I shall be glad to co operate in pe rfecting any legisla tion that tends to the prosperity and welfare cf our country. .
