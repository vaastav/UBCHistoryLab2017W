In the days when booze flowed without limit any mother who appealed to a saloon keeper not to sell liquor to her husband or son got a laugh in the face from the proprietor, who didn't have to consider the woe he wrought. It's different now. At Fon du Lac, Wis., a court has jnet awarded a wife a verdict of $3,600 gainst a liquor seller for ruining her husband against her protest. Under the terms of Irish independence the people of the emerald sle must remain loyal to the British king, yet they will have prac tlcallly the same measure of rights as arp ac corded to a republic. The government of Ire land will be fashioned after that of Canada. Canada remains a British nation, a part of the united kingdom's group, although the people there run their own government and affairs.

Why the Farmer Can't Buy. Burins the lt month, the federal reserve board says in its review of business conditions, improvement has not been so pronounced. "For the time being." the board says, "the peak of demand has been reached and passed." " That is an eastern view. The west knows that its own demand for goods can not get back to normal until the prices of the things it wants are more nearly in line with the prices ' othe things it has to sell. A farmer last year could buy a pair of shoes with two bushels of com. Today it will take ten bushels Last year after buying the shoes he had eight bush els of corn left over with which. to purchase other things. This year he uses up all ten bushels of corn on the shoes and he must go without the things he was able to buy when the corn was worth more. The farm purchasing power represents nearly half the purchasing power of the coun try. So long as it is cut to pieces industries most run part time and men must be out of work because the fanner cannot buy. There is no present hope of any. great advance in farm prices. These are eet in world markets. Re lief will come only through the balancing of industry- by the lowering of prices of transpor tation and the other things the farmer must bay. How these prices are to be brought down is a question that ought to receive careful at tention from every business man and worker. For until they get down and the purchasing power of the farmer is restored there is bound to be depression, with unemployment and bad living conditions. , The President's Message. President Harding, in his message deliv ered to congress yesterday, charts a sound cource to follow to bring the nation back to normalcy. In showing that our first duty is to save ourselves, -he but cities the first law of nature, although he would not have us be un responsive to the appeals from other parts of the world where there Is suffering and where we are able to offer relief. But the president In a comprehensive grasp Pt Xtt entire situation. Impresses the people with the thought that there most be a read justment all along the line and that it can be accomplished only hrongh the cooperation of all of the elements of industry and society. For several years America has-been con cerned With the woes of other nations, and while weJiave been seeking to straighten out the difficulties of our neighbors our own affairs have gotten sadly out of joint. That's the plain truth of the matter. The cities are over crowded, war (obs having attracted hundreds of thousands of young people from the agricul tural sections to the cities. The majority of these jpung people are still in the cities, many of them jobless. There are places for them back on the farms, and they must go there. Eventually they will, but In the meantime there is a problem to meet. The country Is as rich and productive as It. ever was. There Is work for everybody. . There Is market for our pod acts of the farm and the mill and factory, there is a good living for everybody wishing to work for his living. All vthat is necessary to bring about the happy con ditions that prevailed before the recent world d its trr bance Is for everyone to get back where he belongs. Most of ns are out of our regular grooves. The president offers excellent recommen dations to congress in the form of helpfuflegis lation, and It is hoped that the body will see fhe wisdom of his counsel. Especially helpful will be tariff enactments to meet changing con ditions and laws that will prevent disturbances between capital and labor than have heretofore been so disastrous to the country. The presi-' dent rightfully lakes the position that labor should be permitted to organize as well as cap ital, but, too, he maintains there should "fte a tribunal with the power to compel agreements betwen employer and employe when they are unable between themselves to reach understandings. Better Home Life. Speakers at the state welfare conference, being held this week in Peoria, have empha sized the importance of good home life. "If the home life of Americans were better," said one speaker, "ourork would be correspond ingly less. Communities which pay attention to improving the homes are always the com munities which have the best spirit and the best citizens." . America will learn some time what the best people have known all the time that the home life must be brightened, that the home must be more attractive than the places which are now drawing so many yonng people, that discipline must start in the home, and that home training is reflected in the attitude and actions of per sons when they are out in the world. A welfare worker recently took the time to make investigations of the early life of some men who have just started penitentiary sen tences. One man, less than 35 years when he was sent up for burglary, was never held in check by his parents when he was young and at the age of eight years could not be handled by his father. A man who had been sentenced on a criminal charge reported voluntarily that his father knew that he had robbed a corner grocery when the son was about twelve years old, but that he never as much as reprimanded him. A hi-Jacker who is now serving time "ran his home" when he was 14 years old, ac cording to members of his own family, and confessed that in all his life his parents never tried to keep him from going wrong. The home is the center of character in thi3 or any other country. It is also the place where industry and initiative, and common sense, and humanitarianism, and charity and respect for others are taught. The speakers at the Peoria, conference are doing a good service in empha sizing these facts, and as soon as Americans generally learn this they will start on another grade toward improved character and better general conditions.

Illinois City Corr., The Argus. v We are sorry to say the smallpox has started up again. Mrs. Clyde Kent has it down at the foot of the Bluff Hill. SIGN on a local eatery on Fourth avenue between 20th and 21st streets (as lamped by the H. R.) : "Chops and Stakes". A stake is furnished with every chop, we surmise, for the purpose of holding it help less during the attack. Which is the better? The Guileless Youth; with a Crooked Nose and a Receding Chin, in 1 whose Pants Pockets much Spondulix abound- eth; Or a Bronze Apollo, who getteth In Bad, and over whom much Swill is spilled; Or the Independent Farmer, who selleth his Corn for. twenty-seven cents per Measure, which cflsteth him twenty-seven cents per the development of such deformi ties and give the young idea a chance to shoot straight in life. But theteaching staff itself is gen erally anything but physically trained, so it is probably natural What these physical defects should be ignored in the schoolroom. The hump backed seats in many school rooms predispose the chll- ! dren to round shoulders, . fiat chests, ptosis and genera! atony. Many school boards order seats without sufficient regard for the physical welfare of the children. They never think of seeking med ical counsel as to the form and construction of the seats. And consequently one finds a hollow in the seat right where there should be a supporting prominence, in the small of the back; and a promi nence where there should be a hollow, behind the shoulders. And instead of adjusting the seat to the stature of the- child, some school boards prefer to adjust the child to the peculiar huild of the seat. If your John or Mary is growing round 8lfouldered or flat chested, with a slumped belly and a general slouchy posture, now is the time to take a hand and save the child fapm lifelong inefficiency. And don't get the silly notion in your head that a pair of Indian clubs or dumb bells or any such folderol will suffice. The child must be trained physically. One excellent exercise for such a child is the dachshund crawl around the room six to eight times every night, and morning in pa jamas. Any kid knows how to im itate a dachshund, with hips hi?!i and elbows bent out so that the head and chest are'low. This ex- V1T t A. JT W K1L which! aumgLun, u. --, fee 0.11111, ?Si LJZle ft contest.

Should a mother try the Karell regimen while nursing a baby? I have taken on so much superfluous weight that I am a sight, but I do not want to imperil i the baby's health in any way. (Mrs. C.) Answer Certainly she should Karell if she is1 too stout It will probably do the baby good, for an cbese mother is never a howling success at nursing her baby. The "Catarrh" Delusion Still Going1 Strong. Is there any good remedy . you can suggest catarrh can be perma nently cured by? Is there any pre scription that will drive catarrh completely out of the system, and cure catarrhal deafness? (G. W. B.) 1 Answer There is no such thing as catarrh in the system, friend. "Catarrh" is not a condition or s"tato of disease or entity; it is simply a, blanket title for all sorts of nose and throat diseases, a title applied when the teal nature of the disease has not been corractly diagnosed. Of course, no prescrip tion or remedy or treatment would be appropriate for all the diseases so confused. Visit your doetof and have him examine the nose and throat, or if he does not do such work he can refer you to a nose and throat specialist for a diag nosis qf your trouble. 1 1 !

" deal of criticise because of her re- 71L T TJ" .WJ? naval and military strength over the others, Is now apparent to all who have closely followed the pro ceedings. Furthermore, it Is no surprise to those who understood the nature of the gatherings. No nation is going-to disarm as long as the causes of international war re main unchanged, for the simple reason that they are bound to cause war again. A certain saving in taxes is the most that can be expected from the disarmament phase of the conference. Its con sideration of the far eastern ques tion, on the other hand, may be re garded as the nearest thing to a sincere attempt which modern di plomacy has ever made to remove canses of war. Whether the at- tempt will have any success at all remains doubtful:- France is coming in for a great fusal to reduce her standing army, which she asserts she needs to pro tect her against Germany and Rus sia. It has been pointed out re peatedly that both of those nations are incapacitated for an indefinite length of time. France is accused of employing sophistries to estab lish her right to a' large army. So, it appears, she is, and so are all the other nations. Her stand ing army is all France has. She possesses no strength on the sea, where she ia outclassed by three other powers England, the United States and Japan. Eaeh of those nations is trying to get out of the disarmament conference some ad vantage in naval armament. Japan stands out resolutely for a ratio that will leave her relatively stronger than she was before the conference. She brings forward the sophistry that, he peculiar po sition makes necessary this extra strength. The Submarine Question. England stands out for reducing the submarine to the lowest possi ble status. Hemmed in on her lit tle island, Great Britain is more menaced by the submarine than by anything alse. It nearly starved her during the war. It is capable of making the transportation of food and material from her colonies almost impossible. On the other hand, it is not important to the de fense of her short insular past line. Hence, large submarine flo tillas and the development of the submarine are the greatest men aces to great Britain. She is in: favor of almost abolishing snbrna- She also comes forward with her little sophistries. What a horrible thing .submarine warfare j time in her 18 sheltered, coddled ! years.

The president of the Cook county board op posed a proposal for the decoration of Chicago parks with captured German cannon.Niut there was such a fervid protest from the American legion and other interested citizens that the verdict was speedily revereeed. Forty-two centimeter howitzers and specimens of the famous minnen-werfer are to serve as com panion pieces for Taft's and St. Gauden's noble works of sculptural art. If the public's taste for park furnishing can be appeased only by the permanent exhibition of obsolete artillery, the public should be given the artillery. It pays tha bills for the maintenance of the parks and the parks exist for its pleasure and recrea tion. It is interesting none the less to examine this peculiar passion for park armament, and especially the explanation of .it, as advanced by Chicago officials of the legion. The artillery, it is contended, will serve as a preventive of a future conflict like the one from which we recently emerged. The reas oning is delightfully fresh. It answers not only as a guide for the future, but provides for the first time, an explanation of a policy adhered to in the past. Heretofore no one has seemed able to say just what practical end was served by the placing of Civil war cannon in our parks and court house squares. Now that it appears that the aim was not merely deco rative, there will be an universal experience of relief. Understanding of the purpose does not necessarily imply, however, an unexceptional approval of the means. Skepticism is encour aged by the unanswered question of how it was possible' for the people of this nation, with the grim reminders of the Civil war cannon before them, to go Into the Spanish war, apd then the World war, with every appearance of unani mity. It must be granted that this method of exorcising war has not always worked. Ger many itself, it may be recalled, by this stand ard 6houId have been the most pea'ce-inclined nation on earth. There was a mam en to of some early war in every German city square. It is just possible, of course, that emphasis upon these failures of the token Is an Injustice to its average success. If the pre ent genera-i tion of Americans had not been reared in the 1 night of the silent muzzles of the Civil war artillery perhaps we should have been involved long since in wars with every people on the globe. Perhaps it was , only the equestrian statues in the German plasas that restrained the Prussians from embarking upon ft war of conquest rery year. Who knows? Forever the names of those who strive.
