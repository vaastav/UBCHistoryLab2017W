Washington, Dec. 15, President Roosovelt today transmitted to con Erosa a apodal niessngo dealing with tho purchase of tho Panama canal site, together with n number of docu ments hearing on tho same. Ho takes up tho charges made recently In con nection with tho acquisition of tho canal property, to which ho vigorous ly roplles. Tho president's message follows: To tho Senate and Houno of Repre sentatives: In view of tho constant rcltoratlon of the assertion that thoro was some corrupt action by or on behalf of the United States government In connoc tlon with tho acquisition of tho" title of the French company to tho Pana ma canal, and of tho repetition of tho story that a syndicate of American citlzons owned either ono or both of tho Panama compnnloH, I deem It wlso to submit to tho congress all the Information I havo on tho sub ject. Theso stories wore first brought to my attention ns published In a pa per In Indianapolis, called Tho Nowb, odltPtl by Mr. Delnvnn Smith. The Btorics woro scurrilous and libelous In character and falso In every essen tial particular. Mr. Smith shelters himself behind tho excuso that he rnorely nccoptcd tho statements which had appeared In a pupor pub lished In New York, Tho World, own ed by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It Is Idlo to say that tho known charactor of Mr. Pulltzor and his newspapor nro such that tho Htatonienta In that pa per will bo bolleved by nobody; un fortunately thousands of persons nro ill-Informed in this respect aid bo llovo tho Btntemonts they seo In print, oven though thoy nppoar In a newspaper published by Mr. Pulitzer A momber of tho congrerfu has actu ally Introduced n resolution in rofcr enco to theso charges. therefore lay nil tho facts boforo yoli: Tho story repented at various tlmoa by tho World and by Its followers In tho nowspapor press is substantially ns follows: That thoro was corrup tion by or on bohalf of tho govern mont of tho United States In tho transaction by which tho Panama cannl proporty was acquired from its Fronch owners; that thoro woro Im proper denllnga of some kind bo tweon agents of tho government ana outsl'do porsons, representing or not ing for an American syndicate, which had gotton. possession of tho Fronch company; that among theso porsons who it was nllogod mado "huge profltai were Mr. Charles P. Tnft, a brothor of William II. Taft, thon can didate for tho presidency, nnd Mr. Douglas Itobinson, my brother-in-law; that Mr. Cromwoll, tho counsol for tho Pannma canal company in tho negotiations, was in somo way Impli cated with tho Unltod Stntos govern ment authorities In thoso Important transactions; that tho government has concealod tho truo facts, and has destroyed or procured or agreed to tho dontructlon of certain docu ments; that Mr, W. II. Taft was sec retary of war at tho tlmo; that by an agreomont botwoon tho United Statos government and tho benoflclarlos ot tho deal all traces Uiorcof woro "wiped out" by transferring nil tho archives and "secrets" to tho Amer ican government Just beforo tho hold ing of tho convontlon Inst June, at which Mr. Taft was nominated. Says Stories Baseless. Theso statements sometimes ap peared In tho editorials, sometimes In tho nowB columns, sometimes in tho shape of contributions from Indi viduals, eithor unknown or known to bo of bad character. They aro falso In every particular from boglnning to ad. Tho wickedness of tho slanders la only surpassed by tholr fatuity. So utterly baseless aro tho stories that apparently thoy represent In part merely material collocted for cam nalgn purposes, and in part storio originally concocted with a vitw of possible blackmail. The inventor of tho story about Mr. Charles P. Taft, for instance, evi dently supposed that at somo period of the Panama purchase Mr. W. H. Taft was secretary of war, wheroas In reality Mr. W. II. Taft nover be came secretary of war until long after tho whole transaction In ques tion had boon closed. Tho Inventor of tho story about Mr. Douglas Robinson hnd not taken tho troublo to find out tho fact that Mr. Robinson had not had tho slightest connection, directly or Indirectly, of any kind or sort with nny phase of the Panama transaction from begin ning to end. Tho men who attacked I Mr. Root in tho.mattor had not takon the troublo to read tho public docu ments which would bavo Informoi' tCela .hat Mr. Root Tind nothing to with the purchase, which was entire ly arranged through tho department of Justlco, under the then Attorney General Mr Knox. Now, thoso stories as a matter of fart need no investiga tion whatever. No shadow of proof has been or can be produced In be half of any of them. They consist simply of n string of Infamous libels. In form thoy arc In part libels upon Individuals, upon Mr. Tnft nnd Mr. Robinson, for instance. Uut thoy nro In fnct wholly and In form partly a libol upon tho United States govern ment. I do not bellevo wo should concern oursolvos with tho particir lar Individuals who wroto tho lying and llbolous editorials, articles from correspondents or articles In the news columns. Tho real offender Is Mr. Joseph Pulltzor, editor and pro prietor of tho World. While tho crlmlnnl offense of which Mr. Pullt zor has-been guilty Is in form a libel upon Individuals, tho groat injury done Is in blackening tho good name of the American people. It should not bo loft o a prlvato citizen to sue Mr. Pulitzer for libel. Ho should be prosecuted for libel by tho govern mental authorities. In point of en courngomont of iniquity In point of Infamy of wrong-doing, there Is noth ing to chooso between n public ser vant who betrays his trust, a public servant who In guilty of blackmail, or theft, or Ilnanclnl dishonesty of any kind, and a man guilty ns Mr Joseph Pulitzer hns been guilty In this Instance. It Is therefore a high nntionnl duty to bring to Justice this villflor of tho American people, this man who wnntonly and wickedly, without ono shadow of Justification, sooks to blncken tho character of roputablo prlvato citlzons, and to con vict the government of his own coun try In tho eyes of tho civilized world of wrong-doing of tho basest and foul est kind, when ho hns not ono shadow of Justification of any sort or de scription for tho chnrgo ho has mado. Legal Action Threatened. Tho attorney general hns undor consideration tho form In which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall bo brought. Mcanwhllo, I submit to you all tho accompanying pnpors, so that you may havo boforo you com plete information on tho subject. I call your nttontlon to my communica tions In my mossnges to tho congress of Jan. 20. 1002; March 11, 1003; Dec. 1, 1003; Jan. 4, 1001, and Doc. 17, 190C, In which I sot forth at length tho history of vnrious phases of the wholo transaction. I recall your at tention to tho report and opinion of tho attornoy general rendered to mo, dnted Oct. 25, 1002, with tho accom panying documents and exhibits. I call your attention to tho correspond enco of tho ofllcors nnd agents of tho Pannma Cannl compnn with tho prosldont and other olllcprs of tho United Statos printed In Sonnto Docu ment No. Ill, Doc. 10, U02. Also to tho copy of tho olllclal proceedings of tho Now Pannma Canal company at Paris on tho 30th of Docmbor, 1003, together with a report of tho council of administration of that company, printed in Sonato Document No 733, Jan. 28, 1904, nnd to tho copy of the gonoral convoynnco by tho now Pan ama Canal company to tho United States; also copies of certain tele grams from tho prosldont oi the com pany making an offer of sale, and At tornoy Gonoral Knox's cablegram In responso, In Sennto Documont No. 285, March 23, 190G. I call your attention furthermore to tho oxhaustivo testimony recorded In tho public document (Sonato Docu ment No. 401, Fifty-ninth Congress, Second Sossion), which contains tho Boarching investigation Into tho wholo transaction mado by tho con gress for its information nnd fully considorcd by tho congress boforo It took action. In tho net approved Juno 28, 1902, "To Provide For tho Construction of a Canal Connecting tho Waters of tho Atlantic and Pacific Ocoans," the congress provided as follows: "That tho prosldont of tho Unltod States is hereby authorized to no qulro for and on bohalf of tho United States, at a cost not exceeding $40, 000,000, tho rights, privilogos, fran chises, concessions, grants of land, right of way, unfinished work, plants and other proporty, renl, personal and mixed, of every nnmo and nature, owned by tho now Panama Canal company of Franco, on tho isthmus of Panama, and all Its mnps, plans, drawings, records, on tho isthmus of Panama nnd in Paris, including all tho capital stock, not loss, howovor, than C8,GG3 shares of tho Panama Railroad company, owned by or hold for tho use and aid of tho canal com pany, provided a satisfactory titlo to all said property can bo obtained." Shareholders of No Concern. It thereupon became tho duty ot tho pros'dent In exocutlon of this tatuto to purchase the proporty spoclflod from the New Panama Canal company of Franco, provldod he eould obtain a satisfactory title. Tho department of Justlco was in atructed to oxamlno the title and after such an examination Attorney General Knox reported that a satis factory title could bo obtained. Pay ment of the purchase prlco was there upon made to tho New Panama Canal company, in nccordanco with tho act of the congress, and tho proporty was convoyed by that company to the United Stntos. It was no concorn of tho prosldont, or nny ofllcor of tho executlvo department, to inquire ns to what the Now Panama Canal com pany did with tho monoy which It re ceived, As a matter of fact the New Panama Canal company did dis tribute tho monoy between Its share holders and tho shareholders of the preceding Panama Canal company, In accordance with tho decree- ot a French court, nnd the records of the Fronch courts show who wero the shareholders, who received tho monoy; but thnt Is no concern of ours, . I call your attention to the accom panying BtntoiiHTit as to tho attempt to form un American company, In f899, for the purpose of taking over tho property of tho Fronch company. This attempt proved abortive. There was no concealment In Its effort to put throuah this plnn; Its complete failure and abandonment being known to everyone. The Important points set forfli In the accompanying papers, nnd in tho papers to which I havo referred you, nr as follows: The Investigation of tho history, physical condition and oxlstlng value of the enterprise by the congress, re sulting In tho enactment of tho law of 1902, authorizing tho prosldont to acquire the property for tho sum of $40,000,000 upon socurlng a satis factory title and thereupon to under take tho work of construction; the falluro of tho Americanization of the enterprise in 1899, tho transmission by mo to tho congress from tlmo to tlmo of full Information nnd advice us to the relations of this government to transit across the Isthmus and un der tho treaties as to tho negotia tions nnd final acquisition of the title, nnd Inter as to tho progress and condition of tho work of construction; the previous authorization of tin sale to tho United States by tho stock holders of the new company and tholr subsequent ratification; tho examina tion and npprovnl of tho title by Mr. Knox; the nrinnitcnifnta foi payment through .1.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT, and finally, the subsequent apportion ment and distribution of tho fund to tho creditors nnd stockholders of tho two conipnnks under thnt decree. Tho Pann'nn Canal transaction was nctunlly cn.rlcd through not by either tho then secretnry of stato, Mr. John Hay, or tho then secretary of war, Mr. Ellhu Root, both of whom how ovor wero cognizant of all tho es sential featuros; but by the nttorney gonornl, Mr. P. C. Knox, at present senntor from Pennsylvania. I di rected or approved every action and ,am responsible for all thnt was done In carrying out tho will of tho con gress; and the provisions of the law onncted by congress, after oxhaustivo examination and discussion, were scrupulously complied with by tho ex ecutive. Cromwell's Part. Whllo tho transaction wus pending I saw Mr. Cromwell but two or thrco times, and my communications with him woro limited to the oxchnnge of purely formal courtesies. Secretnry Hay occasionally saw him, In tho snme manner; I doubt whether Mr. Root held any conversation, with him. Tho attorney general saw him fre quently, ns ho was counsol for tho Panama company. Their communica tions woro olllclal ns roprosontlng tho two sides. I encloso copies of my correspondence with Mr. William Dudley Foulko, who first brought thoso scandalous stories to my atten tion, nnd with Senator Knox and Mr. Cromwell, to whom I wroto In re sponso to tho requost of a geutloman who wished to know about tho stock holders In tho Panama Canal com pany. Tho titlo to the Panama Canal pro perties was vested In tho new Pana ma Cannl company of France, which was tho legal owner thereof, and the old or so-called De-Lessep company had a largo equity therein, Tho title was not in a New Jersey company, nor in any other American company, nor did this havo any deal ings with any American company throughout the affair, Tho exact le gal status, to tho most mlnuto detail, appears In the oxhaustivo opinion of Attornoy General Knox approving the title to be mlven to tho Unltod Statos, which clearly establishes that the only party doalt with was tho New Panama Canal company of Franco, with tho concurrence of tho liquida tor of tho old company, and not any American corporation or syndicate. Title Was Clear. Tho action of tho United States government was, of course, wholly un influenced by nnd had nothing what ever to do with nny quostlon ns to who wore, or who had been, tho se curity holders of eithor tho now or the old company. Who such security holders woro was not our affairs, If, as a matter of fact, tho canal com pany, either or both, hnd been own ed by Amertoan citizens or by cltl sons of any other nationality, it would not havo altered In tho slight est degree tho action token by this government. Our concern was to get tho cannl proporty which was owned by tho French company, nnd to see that tho tlt'e was clear. Our transac tions wore carried on oponly, nnd wero published In detail, and wo dealt solely (o far as iho Interests of the other Panama company wero concerned) with the liquidator ap pointed by the proper French gov ernment body, the civil tribunal of the Seine, and In accordnnco with tho decreo of this samo tribunal, with the Now Panama Canal company, which nlso went Into liquidation upon the snlo to the United States. All our transactions wero carried on open'y and wero published In de tail. The distribution of our payment of $10,000,000 follows the award of the nrbltrator chosen by the new company nnd tho liquidator, author Izcd by the decreo of this samo civil tribunal of tho Solne, and providing for n dlssomlnatlon of tho proportion ate division between tho now and old companies. Wo paid tho money through the Now York banking house of Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Company, acting as fiscal agents of this govern ment, into tho Rank of Franco In Paris. The receipts and accounts of our treasury department show the payment of tho monoy Into the nnnk of France nnd account for tin money being pnid over to tho liquidator ap pointed by tho civil tribunal of the Selno nnd to the New Panama Canal company of France, tho proportion of tho $10,000,000 being 128,000.000 francs to tho liquidator of tho old company nnd 77.400.000 francs to the Now Pannmn Cannl company of Franco In liquidation. In theso pay ments we followed to tho letter the decreo of the governmental tribunal of France, which hnd the authority to make such a decree, tho .vll tribunal of the Seine. Wo hnd neither desire nor nuthoilty to go behind this de creo of this proper governmental body, ns all tho conflicting rights of tho security holders of both com pnnl(s had been settled by the decree of said court by ratifications of arbi tration which lesulted In that divi sion. DI'tHb-'t'on of the Money. I wlf-h ' r.v..kt as clear as pos'b1o and as em v':c as pomlblp the statement t tt t -o did not have nny thing to do wl'li tho dlRtrlbut'nn of a dollar of the '.HV'fwoOO we pnl'l " regards miv atoeMi I'der or bond holdor ot the Flench comwauieti. xiiic that wo followed out tho award of the arbitrators appointed in aecordt-n-e with tho decreo of the French ci'irt which hnd dealt with the subject In awarding n proportl'n to th' old company nnd a certnln proportion to the new company. Any quostlon con corning the stockholders, handhold ors or other beneficiaries of tho pro ceeds ot sale was purely a question for the civil trlbunnl of tho Selno. the Fronch governmental body, with which this nation had nothing wht ever to do. Under theso clrcnn stances thee was not tho slightest need for Mr. Cromwell to give any Information on the subject of the company for which he hnd boon coun sol. This government hns no con cern with Mr. Cromwell's relation to thoso companies, or cither of them, or with the amount of his profession al compensation. It was not tho af fair ot this government to Inquire who wore tho security holders of the companies. Wcvortholoss, ot his own accord, ho haB submitted to mo, to gether with a copy of his statement published on the 11th instant, nnd which I transmit herowlth, a full list of tho stockholders of tho Now Pan nma cannl company of Franco on Jnn. 15, 1900 (numbering ovor C.000). and a list ot all stockholders who woro present nt a Bpeclnl meeting of tho company held Feb. 28, 1002, Im mediately after tho cablo offer of tho company wnH mado to tho United States (Jan. 9-11, 1902), to ncccpt tho appralsonicnt of $40,000,000 made by tho Isthmian canal commission, and to sell for snld sum tho Pnnnmn canal, concessions nnd other pro,) erty, nnd tho Bhnres of tho Panama Rntlrond company. Ho has also fur nished mo a certified copy of tho finnl report of tho liquidator of tho old company, which wns filed on Juno 25th last, und formally approved by tho civil tribunal of tho Solne, to gether with a summary account pro pared and signed by said liquidator as Into as tho 24th ultimo. I also transmit a translation of tho two resolutions with tho vote upon them, adopted at a meeting of tho stockholders of tho now company hold on April 23, 1904, for the purposo ot finally ratifying tho snlo. All these documents I herewith transmit as n part of this message. No Payments On Old Stock, It appears from thom that tho crodltors of the old company numbei 226,290 parties who have received dividends out of tho funds lu the hands ot tho liquidator, who in his let ter statos that in this present month of December tho second nnd last dis tribution to the creditors will bo be gun, and that tho averago dividend horotoforo paid to ench Individual was 782 francs, or $15G, No pay ment' whntovor wns or will bo mado upon tho stock of the old company, ns it was worthless from tho day Do LosBops failed and this cuts out from consideration all misleading stato monts regarding a possiblo purchnso by anybody of tho stock of the Old Panama Cannl company. It ha3 not recelvod and will not receivo a ponny. Even upon tho bondod lndobtodnoss, tho tho dividend, I am thus Informed, will amount in tho aggrogato to only about ton per centum. It likewise rlalnly nppeara that thia distribution by tho liquidator of tho Old company has been openly conducted nt hla office In Pails, No. 50 Ruo Etlenne Mnrcol, where nil the receipts ac counts nnd records of his payments aro on file. The New Pannma Cnnal company of France is In liquidation, ns the nc coirpnnylng pnpers set forth. This liquidated company recelvod as its proportion of the $l0,00u,000 tho sum of 77,000,000 franco nnd this was distributed by tho liquidation In thrco payments thtough four lending banks of Purls, covering a period of tho pust four years and to shareholders numbering about G.000. Every atop of thu transaction was not only tnKcn publicly but was contemporaneously thctewlth advertised In the legal nnd linanclal papers or France, and tho banks mnkiig the payments took proper receipts from all tho parties to whom payments were mado, as is customury lu such cases. The capital of the Now Panama Canal company of Franco was 05,000, 000 francs nnd the distribution thus made amounted to about 130 francs on each sharo of 100 francs. No divi dends woro paid during tho 10 years of tho company's existence It thero foro resulted that tho shnroholdors only recoveied their original Invest ment with annual interest ot about three per cent. Tho nccounts and records of this liquidation, which was concluded in Juno last nre on deposit with tho Credit Lyonnnlsp of Paris au a proper custodian of tho same, appointed up on such liquidation. Recently u re quest wns intuit by a prlvnto indi vidual to inspect the records of these pnynipntH, but answor was mado by custodians that thoy saw no proper reason for grunting such requost by a stranger, and, Inasmuch an thoo Is not the slightest ground for sus picion of un.v bad faith in the trans action It hardly seems worth while to tnnkc the requests; but if tho con gress desite-i, 1 have no doubt that on tho request of our ambassador in Paris, the lists of Individuals will bo shown him. Says Nothing to Probe, As n matter of fact there is noth ing whatever In which this govern ment Is Intel ested to Invos'tlgate about this transaction. So far as till 3 government Ik concerned, every stop of tl: sllj;l'tet Ini'iortanre has been mnde public by Its executive, and every step t'iken In France has there been made public- by the proper oiTi elals The enirresa Uok the action it did tnko alter thu inot minutu and oxhaustivo examination nnd discus sion, and the executive cairled out the dlrectl'in of the coiiaress to tho lotter. Ewy act of this government, every net for which this governmont had the slightest responsibility, was In pursuance of the net of the con gress heio, and following uut the do cree of tho civil trlbunnl of tho Solne In France. Furthermore, through tho entirely voluntary net of Mr. Crom woll, I am now nolo to prcsont to you full Information as to theso actions In Franco, with which this govern ment did not have nny concern, and which uro set forth In tho accompany ing pnpers. It may be well to recall that the New Panama Cannl company of France did not itself propose to fix tho figure, $40,000,000, ns tho valua tion of the cannl and railroad proper ties. That sum wns first fixed by our isthmian cnnal commission In its re ports to tho congress after two years of Investigation nnd personal inspec tion of all tho properties and work al ready done, whereby the properties and tho work dono woro In detail ap praised nt that sum as their value to tho Unltod Stntes. Tho French com pany steadily refused for ovor two years to mako any offer whatever in answer to the many written requosts of tho isthmian cnnal commission, and when Its president did npproach tho question of prlco it was on tho basis of $109,000,000. Later, under conditions not necessary now to re henrso, tho company by cablo nccopt ed tho appraisement of $40,000,000 mndo by our commission. This government thorofore acquir ed all tho properties and concessions both of cnnnl nnd railroad, at Its own valuation and price, the congress ap proving tho- prlco and authorizing tho expenditure of tho monoy after the most oxhaustivo examination and dis cussion, I transmit herowlth lists and docu ments in tho possession of tho depart ment of stnto, tho department of Jus tice nnd tho department of war, so that It tho congress sees fit It may di rect that thoy bo printod, Thoy are and always havo been open to tho ex amination of any mombor of tho con gress. Thore Is no object In printing thom, but there is also no objection to printing them, save that it la a use less expense I also transmit n list of tho docu ments furnished by Mr. Cromwell.
