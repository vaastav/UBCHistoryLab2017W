Within a few weeks l nave received a com munication from Her Majesty's government, renewing the consideration of the subject, both of the idemnity for the injuries at For tune Bay, and of the interpretation of the treaty in which the previous correspondence bad snown tne two governments to oe at va riance. Upon both these topics the disposi tion towards a friendly agreement is mani fested by a recognition of our ngnt to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to fur ther conference, and by an assent to the view of this government, presented in tne previ ous correspondence, that the regulation of conflictine interests of the shore fishery of tbe .Provincial sea coasts, ana tne vessel nBu- ery of our fishermen, should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrange ment between the two eovernments. I sincerely hope that the basis may oe found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views in the interpreta tion of the fishery clauses of the Treaty of Washington, which, s .the correspondence between the two eovernments stood at the close of tbe last session or (Jongress, seemed to be irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts and in dustries which was held last year at hyaney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at Melbourne, the United btates have been efficiently and honorably repre sented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable de partments, and the participation of the Uni ted States was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Mel bourne, the share taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of success is confidently expected. The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a convention with the French Republic for the settlement of claims of the citizens of either country against the other. Under this con vention a commission, presided over by distinguished publicist, appointed, in pursu ance of the request of both nations, by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, has been or ganized and has begun its sessions in this city. A congress to ' consider means for the protection of industrial property has recent ly been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and in Belgium as delegates. The International Commission upon Weights and Measures also continues its work in Pans. invite your attention to the necessity of an appropriation to be made in time to enable this government to comply with its obliga tions under the Metrical convention. Out friendly relations with the German Empire continue without interruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries at Berlin, the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make its preparations, was extremely success ful and meritorious, winning for private ex hibitors numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at large the principal prize of honor ottered by fcus Majesty the Emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this important and grow ing industry. There have been some ques tions raised between the two eovernments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but recent dis patches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable progress is making toward an understanding, in accordance with the views of this government, which makes and ad mits no distinction whatever between the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of the United states, in practice, the com plaints of molestation suffered by naturalized citizens abroad has never been fewer than at present. There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations with the gov ernments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Por tugal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Aurkey and iireece. During the last summer several vessels be longing to the merchant marine of this coun try, sailing in neutral waters of the West In dies, were fired at, boarded and searched by an armed cruiser of the Spanish government The circumstances, as reported, involve not only a private injury to the persons con cerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly relations existing for a centu ry between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such explanation or reparation as may ue called ror Dy the facts. Tho commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of our citizens against the government of SSpam is, I hope, ap proacning the termination of its labors. iue claims against the united States un der the Florida Treaty with Spain were sub mittcd to Congress for its action at the late session, and I again invite your attention I this long-standing question, with a view to final diuposition of the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish govern ment, a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreign powers of native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The Minister of tho United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this confer ence, the result of which is a convention riigned on behalf of all the powers represent ed. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The govern ment of the United States has also lost no opportunity tojurge upon that of the Emper or of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end to the persecutions which have been so prevalent in that country of persons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew residents of Morocco. The consular treaty concluded with Bel giuni has not yet been officially promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed for ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the period for ratifi cation. , The attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex tradition with Denmark failed on account of the objection of the Danish government to the usual clause providing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of the persons whose extradition it asks. lhe provision made by Congress, at its last session, for the expense of the commis sion which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the Imperial government of China, on subjects of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at once npon their mission. The Imperial government was pre pared to give prompt and respectful atten tion to the matters brought under negotia tion, and the conferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of November last, two treaties were signed at 1'ekin, one relating to the introduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of the com missioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before the Senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of ship wrecked seamen. 1 take occasion to urge once more upon Congress ' the propriety of majung provision lor tne erection or suitaDie fire-proof buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of the American legation, and the court house and jail connected wtth it. . The Japanese government, with great generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible piece or land. in my last annual message 1 invited the at tention of Congress to tire subject of the in demnity funds received some years ago from (Jhina and Japan. A renew the recommenda tion then made, that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid, and the residue re turned to these nations, respectively, to which they justly and equitably belong. lhe extradition treaty with the kingdom of the . Netherlands, which has been for some time in course of negotiation, has, dur ing the past year, been concluded and duly ratified. Relations of friendship and amity have been established between the government of the United btates and that of Atonnwma. We have sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have received at this capital the special envoy who has been charged by Hia Royal Highness Prince Charles to an nounce the independent sovereignty of Ron mania. We hope for a speedy development of commercial relations between the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet on the bor der between this country and Mexico would soon become so assured as to justify the mod ification of the orders, then in force, to our military commanders, in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging such dis turbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations, and the orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfac tion of our own citizens and the Mexican government. Subsequently the peace of the border was again disturbed by a savage foray, under tne command of tne UAuef Victoria, but, by the combined and harmonious action of the military forces of both countries, his band has been broken up and substantially destroyed. " . . . . , There is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long prevented rapid and con venient communication between the United States and Mexico by railways ara-on the point of disappearing-, and that several im portant enterprises of this character will soon be set on foot which cannot fail to contrib ute largely to the prosperity of both conn tries. 1 " - " V1 New envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela ani Nicaragua have re cently arrived at this capital, whose distinc tion and enlightenment afford the best guar antee of the continuance of friendly rela tions between ourselves and these sister re publics. The relations between this government and that of the United States of Colombia have engaged public attention during tbe past year, mainly by reason of the project of an interoceanic canal actoss the Isthmus of Pan ama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Colombian government frr that rrarrjose. The treaty obligations aiihsistincr between the United States and rinlnmhin bv which we guarantee the neu trality of the transit and the sovereignty and nrnnartv of coiomDia in tne lstnmus, mue ft necessary that the conditions under which an Kturjendous a - change in the region em braced m this guarantee snouiu ue tjutwiu transforming, as it would, this Isthmus from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific into a gatewav and "thoroughfare be tween them for the navies and the merchant Bhips of the world should receive the ap- Eroval of this government as being compata le with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our -interests as the principal commercial power of the. west ern hemisphere. The views which I ex pressed in a special message to Congress in March Jast, in relation to this project, I deem it mv dutv to again press upon your atten tion. Subsequent consideration has but con firmed the opinion "that it is the right and duty of the United States to assert and main tain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the Isthmus that oonnects North and South America as will Tirnfcect our national interest. " r . . . - it- r i-i. : i : ino war between tne repuouc oi viiui uu the one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other, still contin ues. This government has not felt called noon to interfere in a contest that is within the belligerent rights of the parties as mde pendent States We have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accom modating their difference, and have at differ ent times reminded both belligerents of our willingness to render such service. Our good offices in this direction were re cently accepted bv all the belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious ; but I regret to announce that the measures which the ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with a view to bring about peace, were not successful. In the course of the war some Questions have arisen affecting neutral rights in all of these the ministers of tho United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in protection of American interests. The relations of the United States with the empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily in creases, to their mutual advantage. The internal disorders with which the Ar gentine Republic has for some time past been afflicted, and which have more or less influ enced its external trade, arc understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that re public as well as to the development of its vast interior resources. In Samoa, the government of King Ma lietoa. under the support and recognition of the consular representatives of the United States, Great Britain and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity to the Isl ands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite local government, which has been proposed the common interests of the great treaty powers require harmony in their relations to the native frame of government, and this mav be best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction of our represen tative at Apia were increased in extent and importance so as to guard American inter ests in the surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica. The obelisk, generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of New i:ork, has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be erected in that metropolis. A com mission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this government, at the earnest solicitation of the Khedive, has acceeded to the provisions adopted bv it, which will be laid before Con gress for its information. A commission for the revision of the judicial code of the re form tribunal of Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman, consul general, and J. M. Batchelder, Esq., have been appointed as commissioners to participate in this work. The organization of the reform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of five years. i In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime States to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, oe. ginning the first of January. The acceptance of this invitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in this important measure, designed to establish a system of international notification by which the spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevented. The attention of Congress is invited to the neces sary appropriations for carrying into effect the provisions ot the act reierrea to. 

TBADZ AND COMMEBCE. The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of the Uni ted States, through the active agency of con sular officers and through the dissemination of information obtained from tbem, have been unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our commercial communities, and the value of the information secured by this means to the trade and manufactures of the country, w re recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication- of consular and other reports by the Department of State. The first issue of this publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports of con sular officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that the system of such publications is deserving of the approval of Congress, and that the necessary appropria tions for its continuance and enlargement will commend itself to your consideration. The prosperous energies of our domestic industries, and their immense production of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even require, an active development of the wishes and interests of our people in that di rection. Especially important is it that our commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of Eu ropean systems, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East Indies, with Australia and the Island groups which he along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate (to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications of our regu lations of trade and navigation may be neces sary or useful to meet and direct these im pulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of our carrying trade, A am sure the. wisdom of Congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular steam postal communication, by aid from government, has been the forerun ner of tne commercial predominance ox ureat Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the desire and the intent of our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce have been successful in pro portion with their adoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious to re ceive such postal communications with this country and - to aid in their development. Similar co-operation may be looked for, in due time, from the eastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from pri vate interests. An respect of foreign commerce, quite as much as in inter nal trade, postal communication seems neces sarily a matter of common and pubuo admin istration, and thus pertaining to government. I respectfully recommend to your prompt at tention such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our for eign commercial exchanges and the building np of our carrying trade. In this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service which might be expect ed in enlarging and facilitating our com merce on the Pacific ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sand wich Islands and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great influence of "such means of communication on these routes ef navigation in developing and securing the due share of our Aracihc coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustra tion or enforcement. It may be that such an enterprise, useful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid," and I submit the mat ter to your careful consideration. An additional, and not unimportant, al though secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the un- anestionabie service to tne expansion or our commerce which would be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas -and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of the proper construction and equip ment, to oe ox tne greatest emmency in case of maritime war, might be made constant and active agents in time of peace in tbe ad vancement and protection -of our foreign trade, and in the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would, naturally, in some numbers, mix . with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an active movement of our naval vessels, and the , intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval officers in promot ing every interest oi tneir countrymen is a just subject of national pride. THX FTNANOIAX, AITAIB8 OF THZ OOVEBNKXNT. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown by the report of the Secretary or tne xreasury, is very satis factory. It is ' believed that the present financial situation ' of the United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency credit, growing wealth, or the ex tent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of any otner country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any country at any period of its his tory. All our industries are thriving: the rate Of interest is low ; new railroads are be ing constructed ; a vast immigration is in creasing our population, capital and labor ; new enterprises in great number are in pro gress ; and our commercial relations with other countries are improving.

There was applied thereto the sum of $73,!HM,617.41, being 35.972,973.86 in excess of the annual re quirements for this year. The aggregate of the revenues from all sources during tho fiscal year ended J une 30. 1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the preceding year of $59,099, 426.52. The receipts thus far of the current year, amount to $350,000,000 which will be sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures of the year and leave a surplus of i!o, 000,000. It is fortunate that this large surplus rev enue occurs at a period when it may be di rectly applied to the payment of the public debt soon to be redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapidly as possible. The debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing inter est, attained its maximum of $2,76,431, 571.43 in August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced to $1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal of the debt, $108,758,100 has been paid since March 1, 1877, effecting an annual saving of interest of $6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by tbe sale of bonds bearing a loW rate of in terest, and the application of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, IS $14,290,453.50. Within a short period over six hundred millions of five and six per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity not only to further re duce the principal of the debt, but also to re duce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention of Con gress to the views expressed on this subject by the Secretary of the Treasury m bis annual re port, and recommend prompt legislation, to enable tbe Treasury department to compiet the refunding of the debt which is about to mature. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered Bince the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business arfa to our remarkable prosperity. The fears that pre ceded and accompanied resumption have proved groundless. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domes tic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,399, 42S. There are still in existence, uncancelled, $346,681,016 of United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the Umted States was then engaged. The preservation of the na tion's existence required, in the judgment of Congress, an issue of legal tender paper money. That it served well the purpose for which it was created is not question d, but the employment of the notes as t aper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for which they were provided, was not contemplated by the rramers 01 the law un der which they were issued. These notes long since became like any other pecuniary obligation of the government a debt to be paid, and, when paid, to be cancelled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no longer exist ing. I therefore repeat what was said in the annual message of last year, that the retire ment from circulation of United btates notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in -our prog ress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government and the interest and security of the people. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dol lars, fixing their value and giving them legal tender character, it was believed by many of the supporters of the measure that the silver dollar, which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability of this re sult, nevertheless were willing to give to the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to stop the coinage, if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued to be of less commercial value than the standard gold dollar. Abe coinage of silver dollars, under tbe act referred to, began in March, 1878, and has been continued as required by the act. The average rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492. The total amount coined prior to the first of November last was 872,847,750. Uf this amount 47,o4,450 re main in the Treasury, and only $25,763,291 axe in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable expense has been necessarily incurred for this purpose. but its return to the Treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation 01 tbe mends or the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar. containing 412$ grains of silver, has not in creased. During the year prior to the pass age of tbe bill authorizing its coinage, tbe market value of the silver which it contained was from ninety to ninety-two cents, as com pared with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight and a half cents. ' It is obvious that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to silver, so far as it - was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a result of that legislation, has failed to produce the effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does tbe coinage of a nominal dollar, which. in reality is not a dollar, the greater becomes tbe danger that this country will be forced to accept a single metal as tne sole legal stand ard of value, in circulation, and this is a standard of less value than it purports to be. worth in the recognized money of the world- Abe Constitution of the Umted states, sound financial principles, and our best in terests, all require that tne country should have as its 1 legal-tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an intrinsio value, as bul lion, equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The Constitution, in express terms, recognizes both gold and sil ver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our cur rency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange to the disparagement of important interests. The United States pro duces more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judg ment, contribute, to this result if" Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars contain ing only 412$ grains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value, as bullion, with gold dollars. This will defraud , no man, and will be in accordance with fa miliar precedents. Congress, on several oc casions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between tbe two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the dis cbarge of pecuniary obligations has been found by experience to ftiminiKh the rates of interest which debtors are required to pay, and to increase tbe faculty witb which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely .money becomes abundant whenever confidenoe in the exact performance of moneyed obligations is established. 

IHXIXABT MATTERS. - ; The Secretary of War reports that the ex penditures of the War department for the fiscal year ending June 80, 1880, were $39,- 924,773.03. 'Abe appropriations for this de partment for the current fiscal year amount to 41,Uy3,B3U-40. With respect to the army, tbe secretary in vites attention to the fact that its strength is limited by statute (section 1,115, Revised Statutes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, -but that provisos contained in appro priation bills have limited expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. At is believed the full legal Btrength is the least possible force at which the resent organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, dis cipline and economy. While the enlistment 01 this torce would add somewhat to tne ap propriation for pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new territory, impose on the military an entire change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along wagon and stage routes of travel Is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected, of a more substantial char acter than those heretofore constructed, will be required. Under existing laws perma nent buildings cannot be erected without the sanction of Congress, and when sales of mm tary sites and buildings have been authorized, the moneys received have reverted to the Treasury, and could only become available through a new appropriation. It is recom mended that provision be made, by a general statute, for tbe sale of such abandoned mili tary posts and buildings as are found to be unnecessary, and for the application of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed condition of the country, their occupation is continued at great expense and inconvenience, because they afford the only available shelter for troops. The absence of a large number of the offi cers of the line, in active duty, from their regiments, is a serious detriment to the main- tenance of the service. The constant de mand for small detachments, each of which should be commanded by a commissioned of ficer, and the various details of officers for necessary service away from their commands, occasions a scarcity in the number required for company duties. With a view to lessen ing this drain to some extent, it is recom mended that the law authorizing the detail of officers from the active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain col leges and universities be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired 11st 01 the army. Attention is asked to the necessity of pro viding by legislation for organizing, arming and disciplining the active militia of the country,-and liberal appropriations are rec ommended in this behalf. The reports of the adjutant general of the army and the chief of ordnance touching this subject fully set forth its importance. The report of the officer in charge of edu cation in tbe army shows that there are seventy-eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary recommends the enlistment of one hundred and fifty schoolmasters with the rank and pay of commissary-sergeants. An appropriation is needed to supply the judge advocates of the army with suitable libraries, and the Sec retary recommends that the corps of judge advocates be placed upon the same footing, as to promotion, with other staff corps of the army. Under existing laws, the Bureau of Military Justice consists of one officer, the judge-advocate general, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight officers of equal rank (maiors), with a provision that tne limit of the corps shall remain at four, when reduced by casualty or resignation to that number. The consolidation of the Bureau of Military Justice and the corps of judge advo cates upon tbe same basis with the othe: staff corps of the army, would remove an unjust discrimination against deserving offi cers, and subserve the best interests of the service. Especial attention is asked to the report of the chief engineers upon the condition of our national defences, if rom a personal in spection of many of the fortifications re ferred to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the recommendations made, and to state that their incomplete and defenseless condition is discreditable to the country. While other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on an offensive warfare and attack5 ing maritime cities, we have been dormant in preparation for defence ; nothing of import ance has been done towards strengthening and finishing our casemated works since our late civil war, during which the great guns of modern warfare and the heavy armor of mod ern fortifications and ships came into use among the nations, and our earthworks leit, by a sudden failure of appropriations some years since, in all stages of incompletion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the elements. IMPEOVEMEOT OF WATERWAYS. The two great rivers of the North Ameri can continent, the Mississippi and the Colum bia, have their navigable waters wholly with in the limits of the United States, and are of vast importance to our internal and foreign commerce. A he permanency ot the impor tant work on the South Pass of the Missis sippi river seems now to be assured. There has been no failure whatever in tho niainte nance of the maximum channel during the six months ended August 9 last. This ex periment has opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the permanent success of which congratula tions may be exchanged among people abroad and at home, and especially among the com munities of tbe Mississippi valley, whose commercial exchanges float in an unobstruct ed channel safely to and from the sea. A comprehensive improvement of the Mis sissippi and its tributaries is a matter of tran scendent importance. These great water ways comprise a system of inland transpor- tation spread like net-work over a large por tion of tbe United btates, and navigable to the extent of many thousands of miles. Producers and consumers alike have a com mon interest in such unequalled facilities for cheap transportation. Geographically, com mercially and politically, they are the strong est tie between the various sections of the country. These channels of communication and interchange are the property of the .Na tion. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and the plainest principles of public interest require their intelligent and careful supervision, with a view to their pro tection, improvement and the enhancement of their usefulness. The channel of the Columbia river, for a distance of about one hundred miles from its mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion serious delays in navigation, and heavy expense for lighterage and towage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured and maintained, to meet the requirements of the extensive and grow ing inland and ocean commerce it subserves. The most urgent need, however, . for this great waterway is a permanent improvement of tbe channel at tbe mouth of the river. From Columbia river to San Francisco, a distance of over six hundred miles, there is no harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approached during stormy weather. An ap propriation of $150,000 was made by the Forty-fifth Congress for the commencement of a breakwater and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point between the Straits of 1 nca and San 1 rancisco, at which the neces sities of commerce, local and general, will be best accommodated. The amount appropri ated is thought to be quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The cost of tbe work. when finished, will be very great, owing to tbe want of natural advantages for a site at any point on the coast between the designa ted limits, and it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake the work without a larger appropriation. I commend the matter to the attention of Congress. THE NEW WAS, DEPARTMENT BUILDING. The completion of the new building for the War department is urgently needed, and the estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. . A he collections of books, specimens and records constituting the Army Medical Mu seum and AJbrary are of national importance. The library now contains about fifty-one thousand five bnndred (al,500; volumes and fifty-seven thousand (57,000) pamphlets rela ting to medicine, surgery and allied topics. The contents of the Army Medical Museum consist of twenty-two thousand (22,000) specimens, and are unique in the complete ness with which both military surgery and the diseases of armies are illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only to the United States, but to the world. There are filed in the record and pension di vision over sixteen thousand (16,000) bound volumes of hospital records, together with a great quantity of papers, embracing the original records of the hospitals of our ar mies during the civil war. Aside from their historical value, these records . are . daily searched for evidence needed in the settle ment of large numbers of pension and other claims, for the protection of the government against attempted frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable collections are now in a building which is pe culiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly recommend ed that an appropriation be made for a new fire -proof building, adequate for the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these ' valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof ; no expendi ture ror . mere architectural display is re quired. It is believed that a suitable struc ture can be erected at a cost not to exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) '. . . ' . GENERAL GRANT. 1 I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the commander-in-chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for the recognition' of distinguished military merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services to the country. An act of Con gress authorizing the appointment of a Cap- tam-uenerai or tne Army, witn suitaDie pro visions relating to compensation, retirement and other details,' would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the country. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the successful and satisfactory man agement of that department during the last fiscal year. The total expenditures for the year were 12,916,639.45. leaving unexpend ed at the close of the vear 2. 141 .KB!!. 23 OI the amount of available appropriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal year end ing June 30. 1881, are $15,095,061.45 ; and the total estimates for tbe next fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, are $15,953,751.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1880, to November 1, 1880, is $5,041,570.45. The recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy, that provision be made for the es tablishment of some form of civil govern ment for the people of Alaska, is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that Territory, except such as is afforded by the officers of the United States ship Jamestown. The vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of the fear that, without the immediate presence of the national au thority, there was impending danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and tbe neces sity for this method of restraint does not, in my opinion, now exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, without the ordinary judicial and administrative authority of orga nized local government, serious consequences might ensue. The laws provide only for the collection of revenue, the protection of public poperty and the transmission of the mails. Abe problem is to supply a local rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in its origin and condition.- The natives are reported to be teachable and self-supporting, and, if prop erly instructed, doubtless would advance rap idly in civilization, and a new factor of pros perity would be added to the national hie. therefore recommend the requisite legislation npon this subiect. The Secretary of the Navy has taken steps towards the establishment of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the requirements of our commercial relations with Central and South America, which are growing in importance. Locations eminent ly suitable, both as regards our naval pur poses and the uses of commerce, have been selected, one on the east side of the Isthmus, at Chinqni Lagoon, in the Caribbean and the other on the Pacific coast, at the Bay of Uolnto. The only safe harbors, sufficient ly commodious, on the Isthmus, are at these points, and the distance between them is less than one hundred miles. The report of the Secretary of the Navy concludes with valuable suggestions with respect to the building np of our merchant marine service, which de serve the favorable consideration of Congress. THE POSTAL SEBVIOE. The report of the Postmaster General ex hibits the continual growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal service. The operations of no department of tbe govern ment, perhaps, represent with greater exact ness the increase in the population and the business of the country. In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,518,067.40 ; in 1880 the re ceipts were $33,315,479.34. All the inhabi tants of the country are directly interested in having proper mail facilities, and naturally watch the postoffice very closely. This care ful oversight on the part of the people has proved a constant stimulus to improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,134 postoffices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making an additional annual transportation of 10,804,191 miles. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at $38,845,174.10. and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $3,630,757.90. The Universal Postal Union has received the accession of almost all the countries and colonies of the world maintaining organized postal services, and it is confidently expected mat ail tne omer countries anu colonies out side the Union will soon unite therewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the found ers of the Union, of forming, for purposes of international mail communication, a single postal territory embracing the world, with complete uniformity of postal charges, and conditions of international exchange, for all descriptions of correspondence. To enable the United States to do its full share of this great work additional legislation is asked by the Postmaster ixenerai, to whose recommen dations especial attention is called. The suggestion of the Postmaster General that it would be wise to encourage, by ap propriate legislation, the establishment of American lines of steamers by our own citi zens, to carry tho mails between our own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America, and of trans-Pacinc countries is commended to the serious consideration of Congress. The attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the Postmaster General in regard to postal savings. AN 

INTERMEDIATE COURT. The necessity for additional provision, to aid in the transaction of the business of the Federal courts, becomes each year more ap parent. The dockets of the Supreme Court, and of the circuit courts, in the greater num ber of the circuits, are encumbered with the constant accession of cases. In . the former court, and iH many instances in the circuit courts, years intervene before it is practica ble to bring cases to nearmg. The Attorney General recommends the es tablishment of an intermediate court of er rors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of judges of the circuit court in each circuit, with the exception of the second circuit, should be increased by the addition of another judge ; in the second circuit, that two should be added ; and that an interme diate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to consist of the circuit judges and the circuit justice, and that in the event of the absence of either of these judges the place of the absent judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the circuit. Such an appellate court could be safely invested with larffe lunsdiction. and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many cases where appeals would still be allowed to the Supreme Court. The expense incurred for this intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of the appropriations for the expenses of tbe Department of Justice. This recommendation is commended to the careful consideration of Congress. It is evident that a delay of justice, in many instances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now necessarily occurs in the federal courts, which will in this way be remedied. THE INDIAN PROBLEM. The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate account of the opera tions ox that department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our In dian affairs appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made gratifying progress in agriculture, herding and mechanical pursuits. Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the government are quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their perma nent homes, building houses and engaging in the occupations of civilized life. The intro duction of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and remunerative employment, and in stimu lating their ambition to earn their own sup port. A heir honesty, fidelity and efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The orgamzi tion of a police force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservations, and in exercis ing a wholesome moral influence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the Sec retary of the Interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased, as an inducement to tbe best class of young men to enter 11. . Much care and attention has been devoted to the enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians. - The means available for this important object have been very inade quate. A few additional boarding schools at Indian agencies nave been established, and the erection of buildings has been begun for several more, but an increase of the appro priations for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to accommodate the large number or Indian - children of school age. The number offered by their parents from all parts or tbe country for education mtbe gov ernment schools is much larger than can be accommodated with the means at present available for that purpose. The number of Indian pupils at the Normal school at Hamp ton, - Va., under the direction of General Armstrong, has been considerably increased, and their progress is highly encouraging. The Indian school established by the Interior Department in 1879, at Carlisle, Pa., under the direction of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful. It has now nearly- two hundred pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety of the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains". The pupils in both these insti tutions receive not only an elementary Eng lish education, but are also instructed in housework, agriculture and useful - mechani cal pursuits. A similar school was estab lished this year at Forest Grove. Oregon, for the education of Indian youth-on the Pacific coast. In addition to this, thirty-six Tnijinri boys and girls were selected from the East ern Cherokees and placed in boarding schools in North Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary ASnglisn education and training in industrial pursuits. ' The interest shown by -Indian parents, even among tbe so-called wild tribes, in the education of their children is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results accomplished by tbe efforts now mak ing will be of lasting benefit. Tbe expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the permanent civiliza tion fund at the disposal of the Department of the Interior; but the fund is now so much reduced, that the continuance of this bene ficial work will in the future depend on specific appropriations by Congress for the purpose, and I venture to express the hope that Congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of good results, to perish for want of means for their support. On the contrary, an mcrease of the number of such schools appears to me highly advisable. Abe past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes, by which they surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of an annuity, to be paid to them, and agree to settle in sev eralty on certain lands designated for that purpose, as farmers, holding individual title to their land in fee. simple, inalienable for a certain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided,, which, at one time, seemed imminent, and, for the first time in the history of the country, an Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty, and to live as individ uals under the common protection of the laws of the country The conduct of the In dians throughout the country during the past year, with but few noteworthy excep tions, has been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla warfare carried on for two years by Victoria and his band of Southern Apaches has virtually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of his followers on Mex ican soil. The disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge in British domin ions, are also likely to cease. A large maior- ity of his followers have surrendered to our military forces, and the remainder are appar ently in progress of disintegration. I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in expressing the earnest hope that Congress will at this session take favorable action on the bill providing for the allotment of lands on the different reservations in severalty to tne Indians, witn patents conierring fee-sim ple title inalienable for a certain period, and the eventual disposition of the residue of the reservations, for general settlement, with the consent and for the benefit of the Indians, placing the latter under the equal protection ot tbe laws or tbe country. This measure. together with a vigorous prosecution of our educational efforts, will work the most im portant and effective advance toward the so lution of the Indian problem, in preparing for the gradual merging of our Tnriian popu- 1 .. . : .-. a 1 . 1 j 1 - ... xuLiuu lulu tiie greub uuuy ox American citi zenship. THE PUBLIC LANDS. A large increase is reported in the disposal or puoiic lands tor settlement during the past year, which marks the prosperous "growth of our agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement or population toward our unoccu pied lands. As this movement proceeds, the codification of our land laws, as well as prop er jogisiuuiuii iu regumte tne uisposition Or public lands, become of more pressing ne cessity, and I therefore invite the considera tion of Congress to the report and the accom panying draft of a bill, made by the Public Lands Commission, which were communicated by me to Congress at the last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desirable. The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands, and the rapid and indiscriminate destruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to this end is now generally recognized. In view of the lawless character of the depredations committed, and the disastrous consequences which will inevitably follow their continu ance, legislation has again and again been rec ommended to arrest the evil, and to preserve tor tne people 01 our western states and Ter ritories the timber needed for domestic and other essential uses. THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. . The report of the Director of the Geologi cal Survey is a document of unusual interest. The consolidation of the various geological and geographical surveys and exploring en terprises, each of which has heretofore oper ated upon an independent plan, without con cert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to all those industries of the country which depend upon the development of our mineral re sources. The labor of the scientific men, of recognized merit, who compose the corps of the Geological Survey, during the first sea-' son of their field operations and inquiries, ap- - jtMr to-"iftTft boon very ooinpirolionfSiT' o And will soon be communicated to Congress in a number of volumes. The Director of the Survey recommends that the investigations. carried on by his bureau, which, so far, have been confined to the so-called public land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country, and that the necessary appro priation be made for this purpose. This would be particularly beneficial to the iron. coal and other mining interests of the Mis sissippi valley, and of the eastern and south ern States. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of Congress. MORE BOOM NEEDED. The Secretary of the Interior asks atten tion to the want of room in the public build ings of the capital, now existing and in prog ress of construction, for the accommodation of tbe clerical force employed, and of the public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in different parts ot the city for the location of public offices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the separation of offices belong ing to the same department impedes the transaction of current business. The Secre tary suggests that the blocks surrounding Lafayette Square, on the east, north and west, be purchased as the sites for new edi fices, for the accommodation of the govern merit offices, leaving the Square itself intact ; and that, if such buildings were constructed upon a harmonious plan of architecture, they would add much to the beauty of the national capital, and would, together with the Treasury and the new State, Navy and war department building, form one of tbe most imposing groups of public edifices in the world. 

AGRICULTURE. The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses tbe confident belief that bis efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly rewarded. The im portance of the results attained have attract ed marked attention at home, and have re ceived the special consideration of foreign na tions. The successful cultivation of our own tea and the manufacture of our own sugar would mako a difference of many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the nation. The report of the commissioner asks at tention to the continued prevalence of an in fectious and contagious cattle disease, known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as cattle plague, or pleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of great loss to our farmers and of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes a market for most of our live stock and dressed meats. The value of neat cattle exported from the United States for eight months end. ed August 31, 1880, was more than twelve million dollars, and nearly double the value for the some period in 1879, an unexampled increase of export trade. Your early atten tion is solicited to this important matter. education. -The Commissioner of Education reports continued increase of public interest in edu cational affairs, and that the public schools generally throughout the country are well sustained. Industrial training is attracting deserved attention, and colleges for instruc tion, theoretical and practical, in agriculture and tbe mechanic arts, including the govern ment schools recently established for the in struction of Indian youth, are gaining steadi ly in public estimation. The commissioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on tne lands reserved for the fu ture support of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the southern States. The recommendation heretofore made is repeated and urged, that an educa tional fund be set apart from the net pro ceeds of the sales of the public lands annual. ly, the income of which, and the remainder of the net . annual proceeds, to be distributed on some satisfactory plan to tbe states and Territories and the District of Columbia. THE 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress made, under the intelligent direction of the Board of Education and the superintendent, in sup plying the educational requirements of the District, with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. - The acts of Congress, from time to time, donating public lands to the several States and Territories in aid of educational interests, have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of - this legislation, the wisdom of which has beem so fully vindicated by expe rience, to the District of Columbia. A again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia to the favorable consideration of Congress. The affairs of the District, as shown by the report of the Com missioners, are in a very satisfactory condition.-.' -: ;!: In my annual messages heretofore, and in my special message of December 19, 1879, I have urged upon the' attention of Congress the necessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the capital, and I am constrained by its- importance to advert again to the subject. These flats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment to the drainage of the city, and seriously impair its health. It is believed that, with this substantial improvement of its I river front, the capital would be, in all re spects, one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its permanent popu lation, this city is necessarily the place of residence of .persons from every section of the country' engaged in the public service. Many others reside here temporarily, for the transaction of business with the govern ment. It should not be forgotten that the land acquired will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it, and that the' navigation of the river will be greatly improved. I therefore again invite the attention of Congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much needed and too long delayed improvement. The water supply of tbe city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by government is necessarily very great in the navy yard, ar senal and the various departments, and a large quantity is required for the proper preservation of the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I recommend that this subiect receive the early attention of Con gress, and that, in making provision for an increased supply, such means be adopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Temporary expedients for such a pur pose cannot but be wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed. I commend again to the attention of Congress the subject of the removal, from their pres ent location, of the depots of the several rail roads entering the city; and I renew the recommendations of my former messages in behalf of the erection of a building for the Congressional Library ; the completion of the Washington Monument, and of liberal ap propriations in support of the benevolent, re formatory and penal institutions of the Dis trict.
