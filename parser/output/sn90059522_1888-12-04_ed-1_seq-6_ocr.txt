Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. The Fiftieth congress assembled for its second and final session at noon to-day. Long be- fore that hour the galleries - began to fill, and by 11:30 all but the diplomatic and executive galleries were crowded. The executive gallery- was empty. On the floor pages were distributing baskets of flowers. The largest decorated the desk of the presiding officer. There were two baskets on Senator Beck's desk, one on Senator Blodgett's, one on Sir. Pugh's and one on Mr. Daniel's. Not a bud or blossom adorned the desks of the Republican senators. Mr. Stew- art, of Nevada, was the first member of the senate to make an appearance on the lloor. He was soon joined by Mr. Chan dler, Mr. llawley and Mr. Dolph. A few minutes later Mr. Spooner, Mr. Aldrich, Mr. Manderson, Mr. Frye and Mr. Mor- rill came in at the left of the doak room and joined their colleagues on the floor. At the same time Mr. Harris, of Tennessee, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, appeared on the Democratic side of the chamber. As the hands of the big sen- ate clock moved on to the meridian mark, the chamber rapidly filled with members, and a general handshaking was going on in all of the aisles. At 12 o'clock Senator Ingalls entered the chamber, escorting the chaplain, Rev. Mr. Butler. When the gavel descended there were forty two senators present. Mr. Butler's prayer was brief. He asked for a blessing on the president and the president-elect. At the conclusion of the prayer, Mr. Ingalls announced THE 

SENATE IN SESSION.' Mr. Sherman asked if it was custom- ary to call the roll. Mr. Ingalls said it was not. Mr. Sherman then offered a resolution in- structing the secretary of the house that the senate was ready for the trans- action of business. The resolution was adopted. The resolution offered by Mr. Morrill, and adopted, the president pro torn appointed, Mr. Morrill and Mr. Saulsbury a committee to notify the president. A resolution offered by Mr. Cameron was adopted, making the reg- ular hour for assembling 12 o'clock. The senate went into recess from 12:47 to 1 :30 o'clock, when it was called to order. The notification committee re- ported that the president would com- municate with the senate immediately. The president's 

MESSAGE WAS THEN PRESENTED and at 1 :30 the clerk began to read it. The. reading occupied an hour and twenty minutes. At its conclusion the message was laid on the table and or- dered printed. The senate at 2:55 ad- journed, after a notification by Mr. Frye that he would call up the Union Pacific settlement bill to-morrow: by Mr. Chandler that he would ask for ac- tion on his resolution to investigate the Louisiana election of April last, and by Mr. Allison that he would ask the sen- ate to proceed with the tariff bill, and would even, if the - discussion • became ■ too protracted,- call it up during the morning hours of the session. rowdy REPRESENTATIVES. ; They Talk in a. Loud Tone Ex- plaining Election Incidents and Accidents— Mr'sT- Cleveland on Deck. Special to the ('lobe. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.— For fully an hour before Speaker Carlisle at 712 o'clock to-day struck bis desk with a brand new gavel and called the house to order, a scene was presented on the floor which was highly noisy and mirth ful. The desks of the members were nearly all occupied, and each man talked to the other in a loud tone of voice, explaining election incidents and accidents. There was much handshak ing. When Mr. Randall, looking fail ly well, entered and took his seat, a few minutes before 12 o'clock, he was imme diately surrounded and heartily, con gratulated upon his convalescence. A splendid floral offering stood upon his desk. There were baskets of : flowers upon the desks of the speaker, and Messrs. Springer, Weaver, Mills, Say ers, Richardson and others. Mrs. Cleveland and her mother, Mrs. Folsom, occupied the front scat of the diplo matic gallery. THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE wore a tan-colored cloth suit and a dark brown plush hat. The other galleries were filled to overflowing. Alter the blind chaplin, Rev. Dr. Mil burn, had offered supplication and the reading clerk began to call the roll of the house, the members recommenced their chat ter, continuing it while the secretary of the senat read the announcement that the upper body of congress had reassembled, was . ready for busi ness and had appointed a com mittee to act with a similar committee on the part of house to wait upon and notify the president that con gress awaited his pleasure. The presi dent's message was read to the house of representatives by Reading;' Clerk Brown. He began at 1:35 and con cluded at 8:15 p. m. Nearly every member was present, the only promi nent absentee being Mr. Randall, who, after answering the roll call, left the capital. The strictest attention at the beginning of the reading was given by members of both sides of the. chamber. The first subject to cause applause was at the conclusion of the paragraph dis cussing the tariff. Democrats led by Messrs. Springer, Herbert and others broke out into A noi'ND OF ITAND-CLAPPrXG. t was of a short duration, however, and did not cause the clerk to halt in his reading. When the message touched on the dismassal of Minister Sackville, and said it was necessary to the dignity of this government to have a "new per sonal channel" of communication with Great Britain, the Republicans broke out in decisive laughter, which was renewed when the clerk read the passage saying that the British minister's offence took place at the crisis of a presidential elec tion; and again where he read the ref erence to- Minister Sackville as "the person." Interest in the message flagged when the reading of the recommenda tions of the various departments was reached.and members all over the house kept up a constant buzz of conversa tion, visited one another and smoked and talked in groups behind the screens. When, at -3:15, the reading was com pleted', Mr. Mills offered a resolution which was agreed to, referring the mes sage to the committee of the whole and providing for its printing. The house then adjourned. ONE 

HUNDRED YEARS OLD. The First Century of Our Consti tutional Existence Closes With the Present Congress. The Congress of the United States : As you assemble foi the discharge of tho duties you have assumed as the repre sentatives of a free and generous people, your meeting is marked by an interest ing and impressivel incident. With the expiration of the present session of the congress the first century of your constitutional existence as a nation will be completed. Our survival for 100 years is not sufficient to assure us that we no longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance,with all its promised blessings, of a govern ment founded upon the freedom of the people. The time rather admonishes us to soberly inquire whether in the past we. have always kept in the course of safety or whether we have before a way, plain* and clear which leads to happi ness, to perpetuity. When the experi ment of our government was under taken the. chart, adopted for our guidance was the constitution, and de parture from the lines there laid down is failure. It is only by a strict adher ence to the direction they indicate, and by restraint within the limitations they fixed, that we can furnish proof to the world of the fitness of the Ameri can people . foi * self-government. The equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying principle of our institutions should not be con fined to the relations of our citizens to each other. The government itself is under bond to the American people that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will deal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously hon est and fair and absolutely just. It has agreed that American citizenship shall be the only credential necessary to justify the claim of equality before the law, and that no condition in life shall give rise to discrimination in the treat ment of the apostle by the government. The citizen of our republic in its early day rigidly insisted upon full compli ance with the letter of this bond, and saw stretching out before him a clear field, for individual endeavor. His tribute to the support of his govern ment was measured by the costs of its economical -maintenance, and he was secure in the enjoyment of the remain ing recompense of his steady and con tented toil. In these days the frugality of the people was stamped upon their government, and was enforced by the free, thoughtful and intelligent suf frage of the . citizens. Combinations, monopolies ami aggregations of capital were avoided or sternly regulated and restrained. The pomp and glitter of governments less free offered no temp tation and presented no delusion to the plain people who, side by side in friendly competition, wrought for the ennoblement and dignity of man for the solution of the problem of free govern ment'and for the achievement of the grand destiny awaiting the land which God has given them. A century has passed : our cities are the abiding places of wealth and luxury; our manufact ories yield fortunes never dreamed of by the" fathers of our republic; our busi ness men are madly striving in the race for riches, and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination in the magnitude of their undertakings. 

THOSE PRIVATE AFFAIRS. Trusts Further Enrich the Mill . ionaires and Rob the Breadwin ners of Their All. We view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny develops a somber shading. Upon more careful inspec tion we find the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unreniunerative toil. A crowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests the impov erishment of rural sections and discon tent with agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his fath er's simple and laborious . life, joins the larger chase for easily required wealth. We discover that the fortune realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely by reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they re sult from .the discriminating favor of the government, and are largely built upon undue exaction, from the masses of our people. The gulf between em ployers and the employed is. constantly widening, and classes are rapidly form ing—one comprising the very rich ami powerful, while iv another are -found the toiling • poor. As ywe view the achievement of aggregated capital we discover the existence of trusts, com THE SAINT PAUL" DAILY GLOBE: TUESDAY MORNING, ; DECEMBER 4, 1838. —TEN PAGES. binations - and 7 monopolies.*" while the citizen is struggling far in the rear, or is trampled to-day beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the care fully restrained ere. hires 7 of -the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters. ;y .7 TARIFF IS A TAX. Uncle Sam Assists the Trusts in •Pauperizing the Masses. . Still congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our coun try, and complacently contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions, it is our. duty as patriotic citizens to inquire at the pres ent stage of our progress how the bond of the government made with the peo ple has been kept and performed. In stead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of its economical administration, the govern ment persists in exacting from the sub-. stance of the people millions which, unapplied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury, his flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger attend ing . the diversion of the cur rency -of the country from the legitimate channels of business. Under the same laws by which these re sults are produced the government per mits many millions more to be added to the cost of living of our people and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. The people must still be taxed for the sup port of the government under the opera tion of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens is inordi nately burdened beyond any useful pur pose and for the. benefit of a favored few, the government, under, pretext of an exercise of its taxing power, enters gratuitously into partnership with these favorites, to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of our people. This is not equality before the law. The, existingsituation is injurious to the health of our entire body politic. It stifles all patriotic love of country and substitutes in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice. Devotion to American citizenship for its own sake and for what it should accomplish as a motive to our nation's advance ment and the happiness of our own people is displaced by the assumption that the government, instead of being the embodiment of equali ty, is but an instrumentality through which especial and individual advantages are to be gained. The arrogance of this assump tion is unconcealed. It .appears in the sordid disregard of all but personal in terests, in the refusal to abate for the benefit of others one iota of selfish ad vantage, and in combinations to per petuate such advantages through efforts to control legislation and improperly in fluence the suffrages of the people. THESE ARE THE SUFFERERS. Some Day the Scales Will Drop From the Eyes of tho Victims of the Tariff. The grievance of those not included within the circle of these beneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and discontent. Our farmers, long-suffering and patient, struggling in the race of life with the hardest and most unremitting toil, will not fail to see, in spite of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies, that they are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foreign markets, where they compete with the farmers of the world; that their lauds are de clining in value while their debts in crease; and that, without compensating favor, they are forced by the action of the government to pay, for the benefit of others, such enhancod prices for the things they need that the scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish their support or leave no margin for accumulation. Our workingmen, enfranchised from all delusions and no longer frightened by the cry that their wages are endangered by a just revision of our tariff laws, will reasonably demand, through such revision, steadier employment, cheaper means of living in their homes, freedom for themselves and their children from the chain of perpetual servitude, and an open door to their advancement be yond the limits of a laboring class. Others of our citizens, whose comforts and expenditures are measured by mod erate salaries and fixed incomes, will in sist upon the fairness and justice of cheapening the cost of necessaries for themselves and their families. When, to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our laws, there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer from such discrimina tion, we will realize the fact that the beneficent purposes of our government, dependent upon the patriotism and con tentment of our people, are endangered. COMMUNISM OF CAPITAL. It Is as Dangerous as the Com- munism of Oppressed. Poverty and Toil. Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace to peace and organized govern ment. But the communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously undermines the jus ticeand integrity of free institutions, is as dangerous as the communism of op pressed poverty and toil, which, exas perated by injustice and discontent, at tacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule. He mocks the people who proposes that the government shall protect the rich, and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor. Any intermediatry between the .people and their govern ment, or the least delegation of the care and protection the government owes to the humblest citizen in the land, makes the boast of free institutions a glitter ing delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless impo sition. jgfcgfeßj REVISE THE TARIFF. That Is the.Only Panacea for Ex- isting Evils. A just and sensible" revision of our tariff laws should be made for the relief of those of our countrymen who suffer under present conditions. Such a re vision should receive the support of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship; of all who realize that that in this justice and equality our government finds its strength and its power to protect the citizen and his property; of all who be lieve that the* contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colos sal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a few; of all who appreciate that the forbearance, and fraternity among our people which recognize the value of every American interest are the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of all who desire to see the products oi American skill and ingenuity in every market of the world, with a resulting res storation of American commerce. The necessity of the reduction of our revenue is so apparent as to be gener ally conceded; but the means by which this end shall be accomplished, and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizens present a controversy of the utmost importance. There should be no scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the burdens of the people are only apparently removed. Extravagant appropriations of public money, with all their demoralizing consequences, should not be tolerated either as a means of relieving the treasury of its present surplus or as furnishing pretexts • for <■ resisting ■ a ■ proper reduction in tariff rates. Existing evils and injustice should be honestly recog nized, boldly met, and effectively reme died. There should be no cessation of the struggle until a plan is perfected fair and conservative toward existing industries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers, of the necessaries of life, while it provides for our manu : facturers the advantage of freer l raw materials and permits no injury to the interests of American labor. The cause , for which the battle is waged is com-. prised within lines clearly and distinctly. %: defined. - It should never be compro mised. It is the people's cause. .. -  ' 

UNCLE SAM IS RICH. That Is the Assumption of People. : Who . Demand Gratuities and Class Legislation. . It cannot be denied i that the selfish and private interests which are so per- ; sistently heard hen efforts , are made ; to deal in 7 a just and comprehensive . maimer with our tariff laws are related) to, if they are not responsible - for, the? sentiment largely prevailing among the people that the general government is the fountain of individual private aid; that it may be expected to relieve with paternal care the; distress of citizens and communities," and that from the : fullness of its treasury it should, upon? the slightest possible pretext of pro;* moting the general good, apply pub lic funds to the benefit of • lo calities and individuals. Nor can it be denied that there is a growing assumption that as against the govern- ment and in favor of private claims and' interests, the usual rules and limit* tions of business principles and just dealing should be waived. : These Ideas have been unhappily much encouraged by legislative acquiescence. Relief from contracts made with the govern ment is too easily accorded in lavor of; the citizen; the. failure to support claims against the government by proof is often supplied by no better consider- ation than the wealth of the govern ment and the poverty of the claimant. Gratuities in the form of pensions are granted upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons less valid, and large sums are expended for the purpose of public buildings and other improvements upon representations carefully claimed to be related to public needs and necessities. To the extent to which the consideration of such matters subordinate and post pone action upon subjects of great pub lic importance, but involving no special private or partisan interest should ar rest attention and lead to reformation, a few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated. The crowded condition of the calendar of the supreme court and the delay to suitors and denial of justice resulting therefrom, has been strongly urged upon the attention of cougress with a plan for the relief of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its merits. While this subject remains without ef fective consideration many laws have been passed providing for the holding of terms of inferior courts at places to suit the convenience of localities or to lay the foundation of an application for the erection of a new public building. Repeated recommendations have been submitted for the amendment and change of the laws relating to our pub lic lands to other uses than for homes of honest settlers might be prevented. While a measure to meet this conceded necessity of reform remains awaiting the action of the congress many claims to the public lands, and applications for their donation in favor of states and individuals have been allowed. A plan in aid of Indian management well recommended by those well in- formed as containing valuable features in furtherance of the Indian problem has thus far failed of the legislative sanction, while grants of doubtful ex- 7 pediency to railroad corporations per mitting them to pass through Indian reservations have greatly multiplied. The propriety and necessity of the erec tion of one or more prisons for the con finement of United States convicts and a postoffice building in the national capital are not disputed,but these needs yet remain unanswered, while scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public pur poses is not apparent. A revision of our pension laws could easily be mado which would rest upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while our general pension laws remain confused and imperfect, hun dreds of private pension laws are an-1. Dually passed, which are the sources of unjust discrimination and popular demoralization. Appropriation bills for the support of the government are de faced by items and provisions to meet private ends, and it is freely asserted by responsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for. pub-. lie internal improvement would -fail to meet with favor unless it contained more for local and private advantage than for public benefit. These state ments can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the proportion of fed eral legislation, which either bears upon its face its private •: character, or which upon examination develops such a mo tive power WATCHING AND WAITING. What the People Want Is Legisla tion That Will Be for the Wel- fare of the Entire Country. ':,: And yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representative such patriotic action as will advance the wel fare of the entire country; and this ex pectation can only be answered by the performance of public duty with unself ish purpose. Our mission among the [ nations of the earth and our success in accomplishing good requires of those intrusted with the making and execu tion of our laws perfect devotion above all other things to the public good. This devotion will lead them to strongly re sist all impatience of constitutional limitations of federal power and to per sistently check the increasing tendency to extend the scope of federal legisla tion in the domain of state and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserv ing the public welfare. The preserva tion of. the partition between proper subjects of federal and local care and regulations of such importance under the constitution which is the law of our very existence, that no'consideration of expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground. We have undertaken to discover and pro claim the richest blessings of govern ment with' the constitution as our guide. Let us follow the way it points out. It will not mislead us. and surely no one who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in search of a better -way to reach the public welfare than' the constitution offers. what . has been said is deemed , not inappropriate : at a time when, trom a centuries height, we view the way already tried by the American people and attempt to discover their future path. The seventh presi dent of the United States— the soldier and statesman, and at all times the firm and brave friend of the people— in vin dication of his course as the protector, of the popular rights and the champion, of true American citizenship, declared; "The ambition which leads me on is anxious desire and fixed determination to restore to the peopie unimpaired the sacred trust they have confided to my charge. To heal the wounds of the con stitution and to preserve it from further violation. To persuade my country/, men, so far as I may, that it is not in a spendid government, supported by powerful monopolies and aristacratical; establishments, that they will find hap piness, or their liberties nrotected, but in a plain system void of pomp—pro tecting all and granting favor to none- dispensing its blessings like the dews ' of heaven, unseen and unfelt, save iii the freshness and beauty they contri bute to produce." It is such a govern ment that tne genius of our people quires.^ Such : a one only under which our states may remain for ages to come, united, prosperous and free. PEACE PREVAILS.

HERE IS A PISH STORY, 'Something - Concerning the Row . ! Over the Catching of Canadian '■ Cod. " ' ' -7 7 :":"- '- i The questions between the United ' {States and Great Britain relating to the rights of American fishermen under treaty anil international comity in the territorial waters of Canada'; and New England, I regret to say. are not satis factorily adjusted. These matters were fully treated in my message to the sen ate of Feb. 20. 1888, together / with such a convention concluded under my authority with Her Majesty's govern ment on Feb. 15, last for ; the re moval of all causes of misunderstand ing was submitted * by me for the approval of the senate. This treaty having been rejected by the senate, I transmitted a message to the congress on the 23d of August last, reviewing the transactions and sub mitting for consideration i certain;. rec ommendations for legislation concern ing the important questions involved.' Afterward, on the 12th oi . September, in response to a' resolution of the sen ate, 1 again communicated fwlly- all the information in my possession as to the action of tht government .of Canada affecting the commercial relations be tween the Dominion and the United .States, including the treatment •of American fishing vessels in ; the ports and waters of British North America. The communications have all been pub lished, and therefore opened to the. knowledge of both houses of congress, although" the two were addressed to the senate alone. Comment upon or repe tition of their contents would be super fluous, and lam not aware that any thing has since occurred which should be added to the . facts therein stated. Therefore, I merely repeat, as applicable to the present ! time, tlie statement, which will be found in my message to the senate of Sept. 27 last, that since March 3, 1887, no case has been reported to the de partment of state wherein complaint has been made of unfriendly or unlaw ful treatment of American fishing ves sels on the part of the Canadian authori ties, in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by the United States consul general at Halifax. Having essayed in the dis charge of my duty to procure by nego tiation the settlement of a long stand ing cause of dispute and to remove a constant menance to the good relations of the two countries, and continuing to the opinion that the treaty of February last, which failed to receive the ap proval of the senate, did supply a satis factory, practical and final adjustment upon a basis honorable and just to both parties of the difficulty and vexed ques tion to which it referred. And having subsequently and unavailingiy recom mended other legislation ■to congress, which, I hoped, would suffice to meet the exigency created by the rejection of the treaty. I now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention of the congress to the condition of this impor tant question as it now stands before them and the country, and for the set tlement of which I am deeply solicitous. j 

SACKVILLE SCORCHED. The Britisher's Bad Break Casu- ally Referred To. * j Near the close of the month of Octo ber last occurrences of a deeply regret table nature were brought to my knowl edge, which made it my painful but im perative duty to obtain, with as little' delay as possible, a new personal chan nel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the government of Great Britaiu. The correspondence in rela tion to this incident will in due course be laid before you, and will disclose the unpardonable conduct of the official re ferred to in his interference by edvice and counsel .with. : the suffrages;, of American citizens in the very crisis of the presidential election then near at hand, and his subsequent public decla rations to justify his actiou.superadding impugnment of the executive and sen ate of the United States in connection with important questions now. pending in controversy between the two govern ments. — The offense thus committed was most grave, involving disastrous possibilities to the good relations of the United States and Great Britain, constituting a gross breath of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domestic af fairs and essential sovereignty of the government to which the envoy was accredited. Having first fufilled the just demands of international comity by affording full opportunity for her maj esty's government to act in relief of the situation, I considered prolongation of discussion to be unwarranted, and thereupon declined to further recognize the diplomatic character of the person whose continuance in such function w*ould destroy that mutual confidence which is essential to the good under standing of the two governments, and was inconsistent with the welfare and self-respect of the government of the "United States. The usual interchange of communication has since continued through her majesty's legation in this city. __________ FUR SEAL FISHERIES. Measures for the Prevention of the Extermination of the Seals Are Pending. - My endeavors to establish, by inter national co-operation,' measures for the prevention of the extermination of fur seals in Behring sea have not been re laxed, and I have hopes of being en abled shortly to submit an effective and satisfactory conventional project with the maritime powers for the approval cf the senate. The coastal boundary between our Alaskan possessions and British Columbia. I regret to say, has not received the attention demanded by its importance, and which on several occasions heretofore 1 ~ have had the honor to recommend to the congress. The admitted impracticability, if not impossibility, of making an accurate and precise "survey and demarkation of the boundary line, as it is recited in the treaty with Russia under which Alaska was ceeded to the United States," renders it absolutely requisite for the prevention of national jurisdictional complications that adequate appropri ation for a reconnoissance and survey.to obtain the proper knowledge of the locality and the geographical features of the boundary, should be authorized by congress with as little delay as pos sible. Knowledge to be only thus ob tained is an essential prerequisite for negotiation for ascertaining a common boundary, or as a preliminary to any other mode of settlement. • AID FOR THE AFFLICTED. The Wrecking Laws Should Be ] Amended— Grief. j It is much to be desired that some agreement should be reached with her majesty's government by which the damages to life and property on- the great lakes may be alleviated by remov ing or humanely regulating the obstacles to reciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded vessels. The act of June 19, 1878, which offers to Canadian vessels free access to our inland waters .in aid of* wrecked or disabled vessels, has . not yet become effective . through concurrent action by.

Now That the Influx of Coolies 7 Has Ceased, a Cause of Unkind • Feeling Has Been Removed. ; In a message accompanying 'my ap proval on the Ist of October last, of a bill for the exclusion of Chinese labor- ers, I laid before congress full informa tion and all correspondence touching the negotiation of the treaty with China concluded at this capital on the 12th day of March. 1888, and which, ; having been confirmed by the senate with cer- tain amendments, was rejected by the Chinese government. This message contained a recommendation that a sum of money be appropriated as compensa tion :to Chinese subjects who had suffered injuries at the hands of lawless men within our jur isdiction. Such appropriation hay- ing been duly made, it awaits re- ception by the Chinese government. It is sincerely hoped that by the cessation of the influx of this class of Chinese subjects, in accordance* with the ex- pressed wish of both governments, a cause of unkind feeling has been per- manently removed. JAPAN IS ALL EIGHT. On the 9th of August, 1887, notifica tion was given by the Japanese minister at the capital of the adjournment of the conference for the revision of the trea- ties of Japan with foreign powers, ow- ing to the objection of his government to the provision in the draft of the juris dictional convention , which required tho submission of the criminal code of the empire to the powers in advance of its becoming operative. This ratification was, however, accompanied with an as- surance of Japan's intentions to continue the work of revision. Notwithstanding this • temporary inter- ruption of negotiations it is hoped that improvements may soon be secured in the jurisdictional system as respects foreigners in Japan, and relief afforded to that country from the present undue and oppressive foreign control in mat- ters of commerce. 1 earnestly, recom- mend that relief be provided for tbe in- juries accidentally caused to Japanese subjects in the island of Ikisima by the target practice of one of our vessels. 

DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS. Corea and Persia Are Now Repre sented at the Capital. A diplomatic mission from Corea has been received, and the formal inter course between the two countries, con- templated by the treaty of 1882, is now established. Legislative provision is hereby recommended to organize and equip consular courts in Corea. Tersia has established diplomatic representa tions at this capital, and has evidenced very great interest in the enterprise and achievements of our citizens. lam therefore hopeful that beneficial com- mercial relations between the two coun- tries be brought about. A THEATER OF DISORDER. Hayti's Insolence and What We Are Going to Do About It, I announce with sincere regret that Hayti has again become the theater of insurrection, disorder and bloodshed. The titular government of President Solomon has been forcibly overthrown aud he driven out of the country to France, where he has since died. The tenure of power has been so unstable amid the war of factions that has en- sued since the expulsion of President Solomon that no government consti tuted by the will of the Haj tian people has been recognized as administering responsibly the affairs of that country. Our representative has been instructed to abstain from interference between the warring factions, and a vessel of our navy has been sent to Haytian wat- ers to sustain our minister and for the protection of the persons and property of American citizens. Due precautions have been taken to enforce our neu trality laws and prevent our territory from becoming the base of military supplies for either of the warring fac tions. Under color of a blockade, of which no reasonable notice had been given, and which does not appear to have been efficiently maintained, a seizure of vessels under the American flag has been reported, and in conse quence measures to prevent and rdress any molestation of our innocent mer chantmen have been adopted. 

KALAKAUA'S KINGDOM. Hawaii Affords a Good Stamping Ground for Americans. Proclamation was duly made on the 9th day of November, 1887, of the con- ventional extensions of the treaty of June 3, 1875, with Hawaii, under which relations of such special and beneficent intercourse have been created. in the vast field of Oriental commerce now * unfolded from our Pacific borders no feature presents stronger recom mendations for congressional action than the establishment of communica tion by submarine telegraph with Hono- lulu. The geographical position of the Hawaiian group, in relation to our Pa- cific states, creates a national inter-dc- pendency and mutuality of interest which our present treaties were in- tended to foster, and which make close communication a logical and modern necessity. ~'/E_Kl-B 

MEXICAN MATTERS. The wisdom of concluding a treaty of commercial reciprocity with Mexico has been heretofore stated in . my messages to congress, and the lapse of time and commerce with that close neighbor and sister republic confirm the judgment so expressed. The precise relocation of our boundary line is needful, and- adequate appropriation is now recommended. It is with sincere satisfaction that I am enabled to advert to this spirit of good- neighborhood and friendly co-operation aud conciliation that has marked the correspondence and action of the Mcxi- can authorities in their share of the talk of maintaining law and order about the line of our common boundary. SOUTn AMERICAN DISPUTES SQUELCHED The long-pending' boundary dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was referred to my arbitration, and by an award made on the 22d of March last, the question has been finally settled to the expressed satisfaction of both the parties in interest. -/. DOM PEDRO CONGRATULATED. The empire of Brazil, in abolishing the last vestige of slavery among Chris- tian nations, called forth the earnest congratulations of this government in ; expression of the cordial sympathies of our people. The claims of nearly all - other countries against Chili, growing out of her late war with Bolivia and Peru, have been disposed of, either by arbitration or "by a lump settlement. Similar claims of our citizens will con- tinue to be urged upon the Chilian gov ernment, and iit is hoped, will not be subject to further delays. / ".; 7/C7 • CLAIMS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. § A comprehensive treaty of amity and commerce with Peru was proclaimed on Nov. 7 last," and it is expected ; that under its operation • mutual \ properity and good understanding will be pro- moted. In pursuance of the policy of arbitration, a treaty to settle '■■ the . claim of Santos, an American citizen, against Ecquador, - has been concluded under my authority, and will be - duly sub- mitted v for the \ approval of the senate Like disposition of the claims of Charles Buttertield / against Denmark, and. of , Van Bakelen against Hayti will prob- ably be made, and 1 trust the principle of such settlements may be extended in practice under, the approval of the -sen- ate.. Through unforeseen causes foreign to the will of both governments, tlie rat- ification of the convention ot Dec. -5, 1885, with Venezuela for the rehearing of the claims of citizens of the United States under the treaty of 1880, Tailed to exchange within the term provided; and a supplementary convention, fur- ther extending the time for exchange of ratifications, and explanatory of an : am- biguous provision of the prior conven tion, now awaits the advice and consent of the senate. Although this matter in the stage referred to concerns only the concurrent treaty-making power of one bianch of congress. 1 advert to it in view of the interest repeatedly and con- spicuously shown by you in your legis lative capacity in favor of a speedy ami equitable adjustment of the questions growing out of the discredited judg ment of.the previous mixed commission of Caracas. With every desire to do -jus tice to the representatives of Venezuela in this regard, the time seems to have come to end this matter, and I trust the prompt confirmation by both parties of the supplementary action referred to will avoid the need of legislative or other action to prevent the longer with- holding of such rights of actual claim- ants as may be shown to exist. COMING CONVENTIONS. Matters of Importance That Will Conic Before Representatives of Many Powers. As authorized by the congress, pre- liminary steps have been taken for the assemblage at this capital during the coming year of tho representatives of South and Central American states, to- gether with those of Mexico, Hayti and San Domingo, to discuss sundry impor tant monetary and commercial topics, Excepting in those cases where from reasons of contiguity of territory and the existence of a border line incapable of being guarded, reciprocal commer cial treaties may be found expedient, it is believed that commercial policies in- ducing freer mutual exchange of prod- ucts can be most advantageously ar- ranged by independent but co-operative legislation. In the mode last mentioned the control of our taxation for revenue will be always retained in our own hands, unrestricted by conventional agreements with" other governments. In conformity, also, with congressional authority , the maritime powers have been invited to confer in Washington in April next upon the practicability of devising uniform rules and measures for the greater security of life and prop- erty at sea. A disposition to accept on tho part of a number of the powers has already been manifested, and if the co-operation of the nations chiefly in- terested shall be secured important re- sults may be confidently anticipated. TONNAGE DUTIES. The act of June 26, 1884, and the acts amendatory thereof, in relation to the tonnage duties, have given jise to ex- tended correspondence with foreign nations with whom we have existing treaties of navigation and commerce, and have caused wide and regrettable divergence of opinion in relation to the imposition of the duties referred to. These questions are important, and I shall make them a subject of a special and more detailed communication at the present session. BOG 

CITIZENSH IP. Flagrant Abuses of the Natural- ization Laws Call for Their Revision. With the rapid increase of immigra tion to our shores and the facilities of modern travel abuses of our natural- ization laws call for their careful re- vision. The easy aud unguarded man- ncr in which certificates of American citizanship can now be obtained has in- duced a class, unfortunately large, to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from allegiance to their native lands, and yet by a foreign residence 'to escape any just duty and contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus, while evading the. duties of citizen- ship to the United States, they may make " prompt claim for its national protection, and demand its intervention in their behalf. Interna tional complications of a serious nature arise, and the correspondence of the state department discloses the great number and complexity of the questions which have been raised. Our laws regu lating the issue of passports should be carefully revised, and the institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital is again strongly recommended. By this means full particulars of each case of naturalization in the United States would be secured and propeily indexed and recorded, and thus many cases of spurious citizenship would be detected, and unjust responsibilities would be avoided. The reorganization of the consular service is a matter of serious inlportauce to our national in- terests. THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. It Needs a Lively Shaking; Up, and at Once. The number of existing principal con- sular offices is believed to be greater than is at all necessary for the conduct of the public business. It should be our policy to maintain not more than a moderate number of principal offices, each supported by a salary sufficient to. enable the incumbent to live in com- fort, and so distributed as to secure the convenient supervision through subor dinate agencies of affairs over a consid erable district. I repeat the recom mendations heretofore made by me that the appropriation for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular sevice should be recast; that the so-called no- torial or unofficial fees which our repre sentatives are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites should be forbid- den; that a system of consular inspec tion should be instituted and that a lim ited number of secretaries of legation at large should be authorized. THE COMING CENTENNIAL. Preparations for ; the centennial cele bration April 30, 1889, of the inaugura tion of George Washington as presi- dent of the United States at the city of New York have been made by a volun tary organization of the citizens of that locality, and believing that an oppor tunity should be afforded for the ex- pression of the interest felt throughout the country with this event, I respect- fully recommend fitting and co-operate action by congress on behalf of the people of the United States. NATIONAL FINANCES. Figures Submitted by Secretary' Fairchild Through the Medium of the President. The report of the ; secretary of ; the treasury exhibits in detail the condition of our national finances and the opera tions of the several branches related to his department. The total ordinary revenues of the government for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888, amounted to $379,206,074.76,, of which $219,091,173.63 was received from customs .duties and $124,296,871.98 from internal . revenue taxes. The total receipts from all sources ex- ceed those for tne fiscal year ended June SO, 1887, by $7,862,797.10. The ordinary expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 

ISSB, were $259,653, ---058.67, leaving a surplus of $119,012, - The decrease in these expendi tures, as compared with tlie fiscal year ended June 30, < 1887, was $8,278,2.0.30, notwithstanding the payment of more than $5,000,000 for pensions in excess of what was paid for that purpose in the latter • mentioned year, fhe revenues of the government • for the year ending J une 30, 1889," ascertained for the quar ter ended Sept. .3o,. 1888, and estimated for the remainder of the time, amount to $377,000,000, and the actual and esti- mated ordinary expenditures for the same year are 7 $274,000,000, leaving an .estimated. surplus of $104,000,000. The estimated receipts for the year end- ing June 30, 1890, are . $377,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time are $275,407,488.34, ; show- ing a surplus of $101,232,511.66. The foregoing statements of surplus - do not take into account tho sum necessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sinking fund act," amounting to more than $47,000,000 annually. The " cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiscal year was 2.44 per cent; for the year 1885 it was 3.77 per cent. - The excess of internal revenue .taxes collected during the last fiscal year over those collected for the year ended June 80, 1887,. was $5.559.174.26, and the cost of collecting this revenue decreased from 3.4 per cent in 1887 to less than to 3.2 per cent for the last year. The tax collected on oleomargarine was $723,« 948.01 for the year ending June 80, 1887, and $804,1:39.88 for the following ear. PURCHASES OF PONDS. Tlie requirements of the sinking fund act have been met for the year ended June SO, 1888, and for the current year also by the purchase of bonds. After complying with this law. as positively required and bonds sufficient for that purpose had been bought at a premium it was not deemed prudent to further expend the surplus in such purchases until the authority to do so should be more explicit. A resolution, however, having been passed by both houses of congress removing all doubt as to executive utive authority, daily purchased ol bonds were commenced" on the 23d day of April, 1888, and have continued until* the present time. By this plan bonds of the government not yet due have been purchased up to and including the 30th day of November, 1888, amounting to $94,700,400, the premium paid thereon amounting to $17,508,613.08. The premium added to the principal of these bonds represents an investment of about 2 per cent interest for the time they still had to run, and the saving tq the government represented by the dif ference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for principal and premium and what if would have paid for Interest at the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to their maturity is about $27,165,000. At first sight this would seem to be a profit- able and sensible transaction on the part of the government, bur. as sug gested by the secretary of the treasury, the surplus thus expended for the pur- chase of bonds was money drawn from the people in excess of any actual need of the government.and was so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in (ho treasury. If this surplus, under the operation of just and equitable laws.had been left in the bands of the people it would have been worth at least 6 per cent per annum. Deducting from the amount of interest upon the principal and premium of these bonds for the time they had to run at the rate of 0 per cent the saving of 2 per cent made for the people by the purchase of such bonds, the loss will appear to be $55, - - - IS
