Wall Street Yesterday.?'The stock mar ket showed more weakness to-day and there iran a serious decline in Lake Shore. Gold tie dined from 102;14 to 102?ti. Government bonds rere firm, States lower and railroads strong. Money on call was easy at 5 a 6 per cent, clos ing at 5 per cent.

It is not improbable that some of these Indians were born east of the Alleghuuies. The Descendants of the New England Hugue nots dedicated in Westchester county yester day a pretty church as a memorial to their per secuted ancestors. It is the only one of the kind in the country. Savings Bank Officers look coldly on the postal savings bank proposition. The opinion of one of them, that if established they will not interfere with the regular banks because the government cannot pay as high a rate of inter est, possesses some grim humor. Tiie Estate of the late James Kelly bus for tunately passed undiminished through the courts. Several charitable societies wiJl receive liund sonie amounts and the deserving scholars of the future in the public schools the gold and silver mcduls provided for in the will. The Trial of the Silk Smugglers, which has been dragging through the courts for the last four weeks, has at last ended in the convic tion of tlse accused. Sentence has not yet been passed, but the public will be disappointed if it is not of a character to make an end for some time to come of this branch of business on the part of other equally enterprising persons. The foverninent. and especially honest merchants, ?re to be congratulated upon the result of tbo trial. The Wbathkr.?The depressions ?which were }u movement oti Sunday night west cf the Mis. sissippi and Missouri rivers hare since then made considerable progress und undergone very decided changes ill their relative conditions. As frequently occurs in the region where such areas of low barometer approached each other a union has taken place of these two und a storm has been organised which lias taken a general northeasterly course, bringing Its centre into the vulley of the Upper Mississippi. The southern or Tesun depression having the greatest energy seems to have ab lorbed the northwestern one, for its movement wit* uiore marked than that of the latter, even when approaching the point of union. The storm, as developed, is attended by rains along iu eastern and southern, and by snow on its northern margin. The rain area extends from the lukes to the Gulf. Heavy gales prevail on (he western murgiu of the storm, but the weather on that side i* clearing, with falling temperature. Ou the Atlantio count the movement eastward of the area of high pressure is progressing slowly, while the low pressure from' the westward is already ad rancing into the St. Lawrence Valley. The com paratively high temperature that hus been ex perienced within the punt day or two will con tinue until the storm centre hus moved eastward far enough to give this vicinity the westerly to torthwestsriy M'inds. Ut-neral ruins, followed by snow, will probubly attend the storm in the Middle States and Mew England. The coast winds will be southwesterly to southeast erly, shifting again to southwest, west ?ud northwest as the; storm moves custward. Dangerous winds ore probable for the lakes and also for the coast north ot Cape llutteras during the next two or three days. The weather in New Ifork and its vicinity to-d?y will be worm and cloudy, with raiu and increasing southeast to southwest winds. On to-morrow it will be cooler and cloudy, possibly with light snow or rain and followed by cold, clearing weather. PrMMtal Hayes Thai Far. Every Chief Magistrate is judged by pos terity and by history with reference to his administration as a whole. It is always suppoaable during the progress of an ad ministration that it may mend before it reaches its close, and hcnee there is always soma danger that injustice may be done to a President daring his first or second year by contemporary critics. Bat they can judge only by what is offered to their obser vation, and if a President makes a feeble be ginning the best service they can render him is to point out his shortcomings with the frankness of true friendship, and thereby aid him in retrieving his reputation and secaring from his coantrymen the final verdict that "all's well that ends well." Mr. Hayes has had a trial of nine months, and the transmission to Congress of his first annual Message affords a fit occasion for considering what he has thus far done in the light of his own explanations. The press of the country has been disposed to treat him with considerate generpsity while he was still new to his office ; bat after the lapse of the greater part of a year, and with the advantage of the revised opinions expressed in his Message, it woald be a dereliction of duty to dandle him as if ho were still a Presidential infant. This, therefore, seems a fit stage for a candid and faithful estimate of what the President has done up to this time. In considering the Message wo must lay out of view all it says on the resumption question and the silver question, for this portion of the Message is only a hazy re flection of Secretary Sherman's annual re port. Mr. Sherman has bad opportunities to learn sound views on these questions in the best of all practical schools. His nego tiation with the Syndicate'for the sale of the four per cent bonds brought him in con tact with some of the best informed finan cier* of our time. The argument offered to Mr. Sherman by the Syndicate is one of the most cogent possible. The annual saving of interest by refunding stlch of our na tional bonds as fall due previous to 1881 would be more than twenty-two million dol lars. Mr. Sherman has had occasion to learn, by his intercourse with the Syndicate, that funding at four per cent is impossible until the Silver bill is defeated beyond all hope of resurrection, and he has sense enough to see that no possible gain by the remonetiza tion of silver would approach this an nual saving of interest. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the clearness of his perceptions on this point, and this part of his annual report is a model of lucid exposition and conclusive argument. The corresponding part of the President's Mes sage, borrowed from this and reflecting it, belongs not to Mr. Hayes, but to his Secretary of the Treasury, whose official intercourse with the Syndicate has lifted him into a higher financial atmosphere than that where float the current West ern notions on this class of subjects. After rendering unto Hayes the things which are Hayes' and unto Sherman the things which a?e Sherman's the pnly paits of the Mes sage which can be credited to the President are those which relate to other subjects than the national finances. , . .. . Laying out of the Message the parts which belong to Secretary Sherman, what remains to be carried to the credit of the President ? Nothing except what he claims in connection with his Southern policy and his civil service reform. Laying out of view the financial merits of the Message, that document is a mere catalogue of unre deemed pledges, exoept with reference to the Southern question. But even with regard to the South Mr. Hayes' course is exposed to criticism. It has been oharged, and is widely believed, that there was a great deal of underhand intrigue previous to the withdrawal of the troops. Mr. Stan ley Matthews was bupposed to be the prin cipal agent of the President iu those in trigues. It is the popular impression that the President, in order to reward Mr. Mat thews for that service, discouraged Mr. Gar field's claims to succeed Mr. Sherman as Senator from Ohio. The history of that intrigue is but vaguely known, but there is a widely diffused impression that its in side history would reflect no credit on the President. If, as he seems to assert in his Message, it was his clear constitutional duty to withdraw the troops from Louisiana and South Carolina, why did he wait and bargain and resort to finesse and keep the country in a state of protracted anxiety before discharg ing a plain duty ? Had he withdrawn the troops within three or four days after bis inauguration his action would have been in perfect accord with the theory of his Message; but the long delay, which oovered a secret intrigue, puts this matter in a somewhat different light. Justice does not wait to consummate underhand bargains before it consents to act. Leaving the Southern policy, which is a dead question, we come to Mr. Hayes' bur lesque attempts to reform the civil service. We spare him any discussion of the noted civil service order which he quiotly aban dons in his Message by passing it in silence as if ha were ashamed of it. We leave him to "chew theoud of sweet and bitter fancies" on that strange order which he discreetly passed in expressive sijence in his Message as a thing about which "the least said the soonest mended." Quite apart from that order President Hayes' pretended civil ser vice reform provokes derision. We have never had a President who has shown him self more willing to uso his patronage to subserve his personal ends. At the begin ning of his administration he tried to cap ture Senator Morton by making ever to him all the local patronage he wanted. He would have done the same thing for Senator Blaine if Blaine had given him any encouragement. In New York he knew that he had offended Senator Conkling in the composition of his Cabinet, and, therefore, made no proil'ers to the ablest man in the Senate. He has given no sign that he regrets that mistake, but it is one of the greatest that Mr. Hayes has made. Nothing has done so much to bring his civii service pretensions into contempt as his mode of dealing with the New York Custom House. Everybody believes that his motive was to humiliate Mr. Conkling. The administration does not hesitate to interfere with local politics, and it has thus tainted what promised to be a decided move toward civil service reform. The President has no right to re gard all the citizens of New York as simpletons ; bat a man must- be very muoh a fool indeed not to perceive that Mr. Hayes' New York Cnstom House appointments are diotated by^pure hos tility to Senator Conk ling. It is one of the most flagrant instances in onr political his tory of an attempted use of patronage to humiliate a political opponent. A precious comment on the lofty profession of the President that the patronage of the govern ment is to be used only for the promotion of broad public interests ! It is charitable to assume that the Presi dent could not have made such mis takes unless he had been badly advised. Elected as arepablican, and having no claim to publio consideration except as a member of that party, what title has he to pursue a course directly contrary to that which Mr. Blaine or Mr. Morton or Mr. Conkling would have adopted had either of them been nominated and elected in his place ? Even Vice Presi dent Wheeler, who was elccted on the name ticket with him, repudiates his policy. How are we to account for the fact that a President elected by the repub licans finds himself at war with the leaders of his party before he has been a year in of fice? Is Mr. Hayes so much superior to all the other republican statesmen that the party would have chosen him had* it known that he would set himself in opposition to all the members of both houses of Congress who enjoy its confidence? The idea is absurd. Considering the mediocrity of Mr. Hayes' talents and his limited experience in pub lic life as compared with the foremost re publican leaders, it is impossible to suppose that he would have set their judgment at defiance if his own modesty and his own sense of his abilities had controlled his ao tion. He is doubtless the victim of bad advisers. Who these bad advis ers are we will not undertake to determine. We think it inoredible that one of them should be Mr. Evarts? "little Evarts," as Mr. Conkling called him?becuuse Mr. Evarts is too good a law yer and has too large an experience in affairs to lead a new President to his ruin by set-' ting him at loggerheads with the party that elected him. Hod Mr. Evarts been the Presi dent's political adviser he could not have permitted him to get into hot water with the foremost men of his party. But it is clear that Mr. Hayes has been misled. He is too modest, sincere and honest to have got into such a scrape without having been pushed into it by bad counsellors. We are confident that Mr. Evarts is not one of them; but whoever they may be they have put him in a posi tion which will make his shilly-shally, namby-pamby, milk-andrwater administra tion more contemptible than that of Polk or "poor Pierce." President Hayes can re deem himself by following better advice. If he would reconstruct his Cabinet, still keeping Mr. Evarts at its head, he might, perhaps, recover the confidence of hia party and make a useful if not a brilliant admin istration. Pops wan a littje man. Tom Moore .was the same, and voluntarily took the nom de plume of "Little." "Little Evarts," as Conkling calls him, is not a poet, but he is a very able lawyer. Batter Tamper In Franre< In the despatches with regard to M. Du faure there may be a glimmer of hope for the reconciliation oi the different views that have inspired the passions nnd disputes by which France has been so deeply troubled through the whole summer ; but it is not yet clear precisely what his authority is. The Left disclaim him under the general statement that they have not authorized anybody to act as intermediary for them. Indeed, it is not positively certain that he acts with any authority whatever. It may be true that the Marshal, urged to promise that he would iavor a revisioiflbf the constitution in a republican Bense. did in reality only call M. Dufaure to declare the impossibility of such a course on his part, and that . Dufaure then responded that the Marshal's pride as to his dignity and the demand of the Left for guarantees of the future were not necessa rily irreconcilable. From that point the interview would almost inevitably drift to the very point indicated in the stories that represent the lormer Minister as an inter mediary ; for when a man says that he be lieves it possible to roooncile hostile claims as to a point of great importance, the inquiry "How?" cannot be restrained by ordinary men. And to answer that inquiry would be to trace the outline of a political programme. This is the labor in which report says Dufaure is engaged, and that story is consequently not inconsistent with the fact that he was called only in order to hear the Marshal's objection to the exclusion from the consti tution of the power of the Executive to dissolve the Chamber. If any man in France can reconcile the claims of the parties, can satisfy at oncc the Marshal and the Lett, it is M. Dufaure. He is so distinctly a man of moderate opinions that his name will reassure all that is reasonable in the conservative opinion of the country, and ao undoubtedly a believer in the llepublio that the republicans, fully awake to the danger of trying extreme steps, can scarcely fail to accept the plan he will prepare. There is no real political difficulty in the case; for, in fact, the trouble has all the time been a personal difficulty, and the separation of the Marshal from the unpropitious personalities is almost equivalent to a solution. It will be very good news if the report as to M. Dufaure is confirmed. It looks as though the majority of the Chamber will not compro mise on the Budget. The matter comes op for discussion to-morrow, when the crisis will .be brought to a pesitive test of moral power on both sides. "The Most Valuable Goods are packed in small parcels," says the old proverb. No doubt this quotation was in the mind of Senator Conkling when he playfully alluded to our learned Secretary of State as "Little Evarts" in his interview with a Herald cor respondent. An Ottoman Fl*rrjr. ConaciotisnesH of their desperate extrem ity rather than sound strategic conceptions is perhaps at the bottom of the sadden Mos lem activity in Balg&ri*. It might almost be thought that ths Turks are like the whale at the end of his battle for life when he summdns for a supreme effort what is left of his strength and so stirs the sea with the "flurry" in which he dies. It is not possi ble that their fighting nt Osman Bazar can be any more effective for a legitimate military purpose than the whale's fiurry for his defence. In a season when active opera tions on a grand scale were possible Me hemet All tried on the Lom the plan of en deavoring to distract the operations at Plevna by forcing the fighting on the line held by the Czarewitch. That came to an almost ridiculous conclusion. All the Russian positions on that front were so well held that the Ruftsinns were able to simply refuse their outer lines and the Otto man energy was exhausted before it had de livered a blow at the real objective point. Those operations never disturbed for a moment the operations at Plevna. But now they are repeated when the approaches to Plevna are less susceptible to aby exterior danger, and when the mere difficulties of the way, if there were even no Russians in the path, would render it scarcely possible for Suleiman Pacha to move his army to Plevna before Osman is finally starved out. Size has no necessary connection with quality. If we were starting out in search of bright intellect and k^n judgment there is no reason why we should make directly for the turtle soup celebration of the Heavy Weights' Club. George Seddons' "Moufe" or Harry Hill's "Chicken" may possess more real grit and science than a Tom Hyer or an Irish giant. "Little Evarts," as Conkling calls him, eannot easily be over topped in learning and genius. A. Conference. It is manifest lrom the conference held at the Mayor's office yesterday that oar pres ent city officials are incapable of giving us clean streets. Mayor Ely himself, with an easy indifference, expresses the opinion that the streets could not be better cleaned with the present appropriation than they now are, although the official protest of the Board of Health against their dangerously filthy condition, and the notorious tact that the Street Cleaning Bureau has not lor weeks made even a pretence of cleaning the streets occasioned the very conference at which the Mayor expresses this opinion. Professor Chandler, of the Board of Health, declares the streets to be in a dangerously filthy oondition, and testifies that some of them are entirely neglected. Mr. Hawley, the chief clerk of the Police Board, thought it would require three million dollars a year to clean all the streets and an extra million and a half to remove the snow. It is absurd to tell the people of New York that eight hundred thousand dollars a year is not sufficient to give them clean streets in such weather as we have enjoyed this year. The *tr??ts are filthy because the money is not properly expended, aud not betiause it is insufficient The city has neverbeen so shanieiully neglected as under the present'authorities. ? Mr. Hawliiy stated as a reason why it was neoessary to dump garbage and ashes and street sweep ings all together that the dwell ers in large tenement houses could not be induced to separate them, and it would "cause endless trouble" to compel them to do so. But all the citizens of New York do not dwell in large tenement houses, and we should like Mr. Hawley to explain why the separation cannot bo made in all other caseB and the mixed emptyings of these few tenement houses be disposed of with the separated garbage? The difficulty lies in the incapacity of the officials and in the expenditure of the street cleaning money on large payrolls for labor and carts, which are mere pension lists for ward politicians. If the Mayor would do his duty and re move the public officers who have neglected their public duties, filling their places with energetic, capable, independent men, he would soon find that the honest expendi ture of nearly a million dollars a year would give us much cleaner streets than we have had for the last year. GOVibkob Mabct was once criticised be cause, hearing that William H. Seward was in Albany, he asked, "What is Little Seward doing here?" But Marcy recognizod Sew ard's ability as a statesman. 4'Little Evarts," as Conkling calls him, has statesmanlike qualities which the New York Senator doubtless recognizes. Congress Yesterday. The Senate was not in session yesterday, having adjourned until to-morrow. In the House a large number of bills were intro duced and one or two weTe passed. The most important, in a general way, was one from the Judiciary Committee repealing what is known as the iron-clad oath, set in the statutes during the stormy days of re construction, and which has long been an anachronism. Another statute, the politi cal birth of the same period, imposing jury disqualifications on account of the rebellion, was also repealed. It is fitting that with the disappearance of the Southern question from our politics these partisan laws should dis appear also, and the Senate, it is to be hoped, will not interpose an objection. Colleges and universities have been relieved, so far as the House can do so, from the burden of paying taxes on alcohol used in the preservation of specimens, and two other resolutions were adopted-one directing the enforcement of the joint rule prohibiting the sale of liquors in the restaurant of the House and the other providing for the erection of a railing around the desks of members, so as to keep them fenced in lrom lobbyists and other in truders. Thus fortified against the wicked lobby and the temptation to intemperance the popular bfaoolt of the Forty-filth C on gress Is in a fair way to become a-model of purity and reform. ' ? Stephen A. Docolah was called the "Lit tle Giant." No doubt Mr. Conkling, when he spoke of the Secretary of State as "Little Evarts," intended the word "giant" to be understood. An EipUaailM Needed. The Commissioners of Excise have sod* denly determined not to take money on de posit from applicant* for licenses, and it is stated that they are returning the money they have already received trem persons whose licenses have not been granted. The practice- of receiving the umonnt of the license foe on deposit and withholding the license for farther consideration has been followed for several months, and it has been stated that more than two-thirds of the liquor stores and saldons in New York have been thus dealt with. A very large sum of money must have accumulated in the Com missioners' hands from this sort of suspen sion fund. If it has been paid into the City Treasury it has probably been appro priated to charitable institutions, and how is it to be paid back? If the Excise Com missioners have kept it in their own pos session, by what right have they done so, and how has it been used ? It should have drawn a good amount of interest. Who has derived the benefit? The Exoise Board should promptly make an explanation of this apparently irregular proceeding. Re corder Hackett, in deciding the oases of a number of men who were taken before him yesterday charged with violating the Excise law, postponed sentence upon such of them as paid money on deposit to the Excise Com missioners. The Recorder added, "Every day that this money is withheld from these men by the groat treasury of the city of New York intensities the wrong which these Commissioners have substantially done these men." But has the Treasury had the money or has it been kept in the hands of the Ex cise Commissioners? Napoleon ihe Great in war wan Napoleon the small in stature, and we da not sup pose that he felt annoyed at the title of* the "Little Corporal" bestowed on him by his devoted soldiers in Italy. Neither should the friends of the Secretary of State feel aggrieved at the title of "Little Evarts" bestowed on their political chieftain in the same admiring and affectionate spirit by hike. Conkling. A Fortunate Man. Some men are born to good lack. Byrne, the keeper at the Insane Asylum who had so deadly a hand to hand struggle with the deceased inmate, Odenwald, testified before the Coroner yesterday that he was for fifteen minutes engaged in the terrible light. Ac cording to his own account he attempted to drag Odenwald away from another pa tient when the madman turned and seized him. They clinehed each other and fell heavily several times, the first time on two pails with iron handles, and onco the de ceased struck against the corner of an iron bedstead. These falls must have been se vere ones, for poor Odenwald, besides a contusion on the hetid and bruises all over the body, had eight ribs broken and driven into his lungs on one side and three on the other side; yet the fortunate Byrne, though he shared the falls, did not share the injuries. He stands before the Coroner giving his testimony hale and hearty, although, it is said, bearing a scratch or two on his throat Fortunate Byrne ! And the beauty of it is that the lucky fellow, amid all the deadly struggle which so crushed and mangled a large, powerful man as to leave him insensible for forty-eight hours until death terminated his sufferings, was enabled to conduct himself in a humane, Christian manner. "I never kicked Oden wald," he swears, "nor abused him in any way." Singular that the crushed ribs and lacerated lungs should have been confined to one of the combatants. Should not the District Attorney be represented at this ex amination ? Is it fit that it should bo left wholly in Coroner Croker's hands ? Alexander Stephens weighs ninety pounds, and is one of the soundest and most accomplished statesmen of the South ern States. "Little Evarts," as Conkling calls him, is one of the ablest jurists of the country, and was strong enough to carry the United States successfully through the Geneva arbitration.
