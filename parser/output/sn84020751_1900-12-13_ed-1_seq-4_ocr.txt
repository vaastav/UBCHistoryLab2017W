Experts s-ill dL-agree as to the size of the cotton crop. Some say it will go to 10,250,000 tales, while ethers say it will not exceed 9.250.000. Tne extremes Rre a million bales apart. Ta'ent rarely is uuaaimeu, and never so over the size of a cotton cr p . The McFaddens of Philade'puia and other bears will continue to pre dict a big outcome, but the weight of opmion is against them. Takirgone year with another it is Been that just about one half of the crop is oiaikt- d tyDo-embir 1, and if we use this as a basis this year, we find that the crop will be 9,600,000 bales; and this is as good an estimate, or raiher calcus Jation, as can be made at present. Thcre are some who believe high prices have hurried the crop to market, and that over one -half of it had been marketed by December 1. In 1896 there was marketed at tne close of November 54.83 per cent. It is therefore possible tha't the crop wili not turn out to be 9,600.000 bales. It is best to take that aggregate as a maximum. Such a crop is below consump tion. Ii would be far below con sumption if the diplomats had not managed to close China another year to the cotton goods trade. There seems to be no limit to the delays they are able to create. But even if China be wholly and alto gether dropped from the problem, cotton t-hould, and ur.doiib'edly will, cross the 10-cent mark, and stay acioss it, until iat least all can see that a big crop is assured next year.

We cannot tell how far Timo thy Healey was justified in say ing that the conduct of the Brit ish soldiers in South Africa had not been "as black as that of the American troops in the Philip pines." Probably in neither case has the actual conduct of the sol diers been as biack as it had been painted. American soldiers have always been credited with snort conduct everywhere.

Probably half or two -thirds ot ms lung surface barely knows the contact of oxygen. He's the kind of man, who, when a cough attacks him, goes galloping down the road toward consumption. Many such a man has found strength and healing for weak lungs and tissues lacerated by coughing and drained by hemorrhages, in the use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov ery. The healing power of this medi cine in pulmonary diseases seems little short of marvelous at times, so extreme are the conditions which it cures. The Discovery " contains no alcohol, and no narcotics. "When I started to take your 'Golden Med ical Discovery,' writes Mr. A. F. Kovotny, of New York, N. Y., Box 1437. I had a regular consumptive cough, of which I was afraid, and everybody cautioned me and warned me con cerning' it I was losing weight rapidly, was very pale and had no appetite, whatever. Now my condition is changed entirely. I do not cough at all, have gained eight pounds in weight, have recovered my healthy color, and my appetite is enormous.

In order to expadite the army reorganization, the bill which psss;d the Senate at tha last ses sion was Ti ported with amend ments in the House and wes pases ed ia that form. It was intended that it should then go to a com miltee of confeieLc?. But the amendments ara so extensive as to leave little of the Senate bill be yocd the enacting cliuse. Tha Senate cannot recognize its own child. So the present disposition of the military comm'ttee of the Senate is to treat it as a new bill originating in the House and to discuss and amond it o that basis. This is wise. If the Senate should substitute an entirely new bill it might be wiser still. It is not a mere party opinion but a military fact that the Democratic proposition lo extend the opera tions of the present law for two years would be a great deal better for the army, as well a-i for the nation. The Houae bill has noth ing to recommend it, even to those "who believe ia army ix p'msioD, t-xsept as a plan for in creasing the Presidential patron age.

If Congress cannot do better than this it had better do nothing. The act of 1898 author izes as large an army as can pos sibly be jusufiad and its extension for two ytats would have time fir tte proper organization of the Dermarent establishment on a peace basis. This is the Demo cratic proposition and is still open for the Senate to adopt it. The Republican scheme, obnoxious in its fl 'grant Imperialism, is a mil- itbry abortion and a parliamentary failure.

BKYAX HEARD FROM. Mr. Bryan failed for the sec ond time to be -elected President, but defeat did not deprive him of the power of trenchant critis cism. In a twelve-huodred-word analysis of President McKinley'a tventy-five thousand word mes sage he has exposed its sophis try and uumasked the imperial policy of the present Rapublican leadership. Wbila the President5 and which even omits trials by jury, This demonstration that the Democrats at Kaasas City we re absolutely correct in declaring imperialism to be the param6unt issue of the campaign is not the only incisive exposure of the in defensible nature of the Republi can policy. We are to have a ship subsidy bill ostensibly to pro mote foreign commerce when our foreign trade has been in creasing by leaps and bounds, VZftT spite of the fact that American manufactures and the products of Americaa mines have been protected lo the point nf exclud ing foreign products of a similar nature and the erection of as high a barrier against foreign trade as it was possible to raise, tbe abundance and excellence of American products have created a constantly growing demand for them, aad in face of this it is now proposed to spend millions from the public treasury to sub sidize the ships of a few trans portation corporations on the plea of increasing a commerce which is increasing by the hun dreds of millions annually from natural causes. All the denunciation of Repub lican imperialism and subservi ence to the greed-swollen trusts indulged in by Mr. Bryan during the campaign be shows to have ben fui'y justmea by the rec ommendations of the President in his message to Congress. Io is a plea for colonial subjugation, for the abandonment of the principle of the consent of the governed and the return of cam paign contributions by direct subsidies from the public treas ury to the only corporate indus try not already subsidized. Mr. Bryan indulges in no vain regrets over defeat. He recog rnz?s tha a, rrv j rity of the too pie voted for imperialism and the perpetuatfon and extension of trust domination whether they were aware of it or not. He simply points out that all dis guise had been thrown off since the election, and the Republican leaders are proceeding to do just what ne prophesied they wou'd do if saccesuful.
