OFFICES NEW YORK AND CHICAGO 'ntSiCWES JN AL1 THE PRINCIPAL CJT MESSAGE A TRIUMPH. President Wilson's message which he delivered to congress yesterday was a triumpha triumph of calm ness and sanity, devoted to the ends of patriotic action. Devoted to national /defense the question of financing the defense, revenues, the medium for fostering the most desirable international rela tions of trade and friendship, a mer chant marine and the problem of European intrigue on American soil it was distinctly a war message and it was also a distinctly American message. During the entire long message there was but one note of passion and that was when the president charac terized the citizens of the United States who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the arteries of na tional life. The chief thoughts of the message are as follows: All the governments of America stand on a footing of genuine equal ity and unquestioned independence. Our concern for the independence and the prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not altered. We still mean always to make a common cause of national in dependence and of political liberty in America. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Conquest and dominion are not our reckoning or agreeable to our prin ciples. We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war. The plans of the war department contemplate an increase of the standi ing force of our regular .army to 181,- 843. These are the additions neces sary to render the army adequate for its present duties. The plan also contemplates sup plementing the army by a force of 40(h000 disciplined citizens. The program of the secretary of the navy involves only the: Pioneerstitutionsr shorten- ing of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out. It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and de velopment that we should have a great merchant, marine. There are citizens of the United States who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life. Such.creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy* must be crushed out.
