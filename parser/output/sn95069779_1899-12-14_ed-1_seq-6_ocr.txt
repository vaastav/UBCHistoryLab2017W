The i public was first apprised of the sen ator's < precarious condition through the daily papers , which on the morning of Nov. H , , stated that he was confined to his bed and quoted his son as saying that no alarm was : felt and that his father was expected to be up and about again in a few days. On I the 15th the first really alarming symptoms were manifest and for three days death was looked for at any time. His right side had become paralyzed and the senator had largely lost the power of speech. On tin 19th he was considerably improved , having regained in a large measure the use of his right side and his mind was much clearer. The improvement did not last long , for on the 22nd he had a relapse , from which he rallied only slightly on the 24th.

Voluminous Document Comprieeo 23- 000 "Words Suggestions Concerning Our Colonial and Financial Policies- Civil Government for Dependencies. President McKinley's third annual mes sage to Congress was not delivered until Tuesday , the Senate fiaving adjourned icomediutely after organizing Monday out of respect to the memory of Vice-Presi dent Hobart. The message is the longest ever sent to Congress by President Mc- Kinlej- , comprising nearly 25,000 words. The death of Vice-President lEobart is mentioned as an event Congress is called to mourn at the threshold of its delibera tions. The President pronounces a high encomium upon a private life Avhich Avas pure and elevated and a public career distinguished by large capacity , stainless integrity and exalted motive * . In beginning his review of national and international relations and. questions the President calls attention to the present conditions of unusual prosperity , of uni versal good Avill among the people at home and the relations of peace and friendship that exist Avith every Govern ment of the Avorld. As an element of this unusual prosperity our foreign commerce , it is stated , has shown great increase in volume and value , the combined imports and exports for the twelvemonth being the greatest ever recorded in a single year of our history. It is mentioned as a noteworthy fact that the only years In all our history Avhcn the products our manu factories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and 1899. Government receipts from all sources11 for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1S99 , aggregated $010,982,004.35 ; expenditures were 700,093,504.02 , leaving a deficit'of $89,111,559.07. The estimated receipts for the current year aggregated $ t > 40- 358,112 ; estimated expenditures , $1500- j)5Sll2 ; : , leaving a surplus of $40,000,000.th rhe strength of the treasury is gratify ing. On Dec. 1 , 1899 , the available cash balance Avas $278,004,837.72 , of which 239,744,905.30 was in gold coin and Million. Customs receipts are now almost mtirely paid in gold. Owing to this favor- ible condition of the treasury Avith re spect to the cash on hand compliance * vith the provisions of the sinking fund , ! lisregarded for eight years ou account of | leficiencies in the resum"a revenues , Avas resum- , the Treasury Department purchasing luring November $18,408,500 of the 5 V er cent loan of 1904 , thus making a net * laving of about $2,885,000 in interest.ihl L'he Government will continue to pur- pu iliase bonds to the extent of $25,000,000 all pVovided these are offered and pur- 'based up to and including Dec. 23. coi Xote on National Banking : Act. die Increased activity in industry and agri- ulture and consequent larger employ- iient of labor at higher wages adds to capacity of the people to absorb the irculatiug medium. These changed and hanging conditions have impaired the ational banking act as to making the eedful addition to the circulation. The est ttention of Congress is therefore invited rte this subject with a view to making act more responsive to the people's eeds. The President again urges , there- if are , that national banks be authorized * organize with a capital of $25,000. He recommends that tile Secretary of Treasury be given additional power he charged Avith the duty to sell United tates bonds and to emnloy such other fective moans as may be necessary to taintain the parity in value of the two he letals , gold and silver , and the equal Dwer of every dollar at all times in the larkct and in the payment of debts , nil old now seeks , the treasury , but ade- he Jate provision should be made t'o insure continuance of the gold standard and 'lit ' public confidence in the ability of the y overnment to meet all its obligations in money which the civilized world rec- nizes as the best. In this connection y President repeats his former recom- or endation that a portion of the gold hold- ' shall be placed in a trust fund from ) Inch greenbacks shall be redeemed upon esentation , but when once redeemed not thereafter be paid out except in : nd rnai vein rs nong the nations of the earth. Only will this way can we secure our share in valuable carrying trade of the world , present situation 'in this respect , the C resident says , is regarded with humilia- ing at homo and with surprise abroad. the Cub Calls Attention to Trusts. ants the subject of trusts the President . pun iclares they are justly provoking public tion scussion and should claim the attention of f Congress. The industrial commission , the eated by act of Congress June IS , 

IS'JS , is , not yet completed its investigations and this subject. Whatever power Con- moa has in the way of controlling or this ecking these jnonopojies should be a re omplly ascertained and assorted. At- ernr ntiou is called to tlio recommendation Cub President Harrison in his annual ines1 nam of Dec. 3 , 1SS9 , and to that of Pres is n Cleveland in his annual message of cissii . 7 , 189.0 , as well as to the act of arat , 1890 , bearing upon this subject. It govc ( noted that the State legislation to In President Cleveland looked for re- our from the evil of trusts has failed fully clair accomplish that object , owing prin- yet ally to the fact that different States ent different views as to the proper way menAt discriminate between evil and injurious mad mbinations and those associations data are beneficial and necessary to the Amc siuess prosperity of the country. The more osident adds that uniformity in State then jislation on this subject is much to bo can sired and expresses the hope that i fron ans may bo found for Congress within ' The limitations of constitutional power so Ha < T supplement an effective code of State nine islation as to make a complete system wnr ; laws and compel a general observance the the salutary rules to which he refers. ( > nga Foreign Questions. duly his review of our relations to foreign In the President notes the settlement Phili long-pending boundary dispute bo- fact. : the Argentine Republic and Chili , diers which the United States minister at turin lonos Ayres served as umpire. A con- a sp ntion of extradition between A'rztina regu the United States awaits some slight the singes in the text before exchange. uftei Reference is made to the claim of the The istro-Hungarian Government for the Phili of certain Austrian and Hunga- prise subjects at Lattimer Pa. , Sept. 10 , dove 1807. As the sherifl and his deputies tried for their murder were acquitted by the courtM this Government , after due consideration , declined to indemnify the sufferers. Note Is made of various minor difficulties - ties and insurrections in certain South American and Central American repub lics and the changes resulting. The Blue- fields controversy is still unsettled. The events of the past year looking to an isthmian canal are recapitulated and reasons for early action in the matter are urged. Events in China as far as concerns American Interests are recounted and the extension of the area opened to foreign settlement Is referrd to. The significant statement Is made on this subject that our commercial rights in China under ex isting treaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year , ns they will be in the future. A commission to study the commercial and Industrial con ditions In the Chinese empire Is recom mended. No time should be lost In study ing for ourselves the resources of this great field for American trade and enter prise. The Paris exposition and the prepara tions of this country to take part In it are related at length , and the Importance of a representative display Is urged. Our relations with Germany continue to be most cordial and the statement is made that In all that promises closer ro- nhi ations of Intercourse and commerce and hih better understanding between two races having so many traits In common , Ger many can be assured of the most cordial inC co-operation of this Government and pee ple. Various .matters pertaining to cer tain restrictions of trade between the two countries and also the satisfactory set tlement of most of them and a recommendation tlm mendation for a joint commission of ex perts and practical men of affairs for the investigation of production and exporta tion In both countries in urged. As to affairs with Great Britain the work of the joint high commission is re capitulated and the arrival nt a harmoni- ous modus vivendi In the Alaskan boun- in dary dispute gives hope of a permanent satisfactory settlement. In other mutters the relations between the United States 'and Canada and Great Britain remain 'anmi most friendly. In the unfortunate contest between the Boer ( states of Africa and Great Britain of this Government has maintained an at titude of neutrality. In the exercise of to customary good oUlccs of a neutral for IOC the ' care of British interests opportunity jng has been afforded to show the impartial urn ity of this Government toward both com wit batants. "a hai As to the deplorable events at Tallu- pas lah , La. , Avhcn five Italians Avere taken ma L'rom jail and hanged , the President states wo that a satisfactory eolution of the dis pute betAveen the two Governments in regard to the matter Avill doubtless be reached. The recurrence of such events Cai loads the President to recommend the conferring upon the Federal courts juris diction in this class of cases. wh Favors the Pacific Cable. sen Mention is made in speaking of our re- mei ations Avith Japan of the treaty of com- ricn nerce and navigation between the United dosi 3tntcs and Japan on Nov. 22 , 1894 , Avhich Mil jecame operative in July last. It is also mot stated that is ' him Japan taking a JiA'oly inter in the proposition of the Pacific Ca V.'llt Company to add to its projected cable mm ines to tLnvaii , Guam and the Philip- acc lines , a branch connection with the coast by Japan , whereby the latter would be fror MOught into direct communication Avith his country. Without repeating his pre- ious recommendations on this subject President respectfully calls the atten- ion of Congress to them and recom- ueuds that the Postmaster General be juthorized to invite competitive bids for establishment of such cable. A review of our relations Avith Mexico hews a gratifying record of mutual good , one of the latest instances being acceptance of President Diaz of an nvitation to visit Chicago last October , the illness of a member of his fam- prevented his attendance. Claims growing out of the seizure of imerican sealing A'essels in Bering Sea Russia have been under discussion several years Avith the recent happy L'sult of an agreement to submit them the decision of a single arbitrator. The important events leading to the issolution of the tripartite agreement as gards the Samoan islands are recounted also the satisfactory partition of the ilands between Germany and the United tates , Great Britain being given by Ger- lany an equivalent elsewhere. A con dition has been made by the three pow- to Avhich the attention of the Senate be invited. Declares for "Free Cuba.

As to uba , held by us in trust for the inhabit- Avith the intent of realizing the high .irpose proclaimed in the joint resolu- adopted by the Congress on the 19th April , 1898 , the President states that pledge contained in this resolution of the highest honorable obligation must be kept. All the administration easuves adopted heretofore in Cuba by Government have aimed to fit it for regenerated existence and for self-gov- nment within its own sphere. Free , hoAvever , must be a reality , not a line. A loosely framed commonwealth not < to be turned adrift to face the vi- ssitudes of Aveaker states , but Avise prep- - ation must be made for eventual self- vernment of responsible character. the Turkish empire the situation of citizens remains unsatisfactory and aims of many years' standing haA'e not been collected , though our Govern- is hopeful in this regard. Attention is called to the arrangements for collecting olficial and economic under the international union of , T merican republics and also tthe com- , . . ercial of v ° rcl museum Philadelphia in fur- erance of this idea and the I'an-Aineri- Lei exposition of 1001 on the Xiagara cil ai ontier.

Future of the Philippines. The statements of the message as tq the future of the Philippines are clean tiP tia unequivocal. The rebellion must ba put down and civil government restored. . Free public schools must be established and the burden of government equally ; distributed. Already hundreds of schools- are open and tilled with children. Ii lig- iotis freedom is sacredly assured and MM joyed. The courts are dispensing justicq- and : business is beginning to circulate ia its accustomed channels. The futur < ? government ' of the islands rests wittt- tl Congress of the United States , and the President adds that few graver re- spoiisSbilities have ever been confided to siU ! . If we accept them in a spirit worthy , our race and traditions a great opportu- * uity i comes with them. The islands lie under our Hag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot he- abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. No specific or final form ofl government for the islands is recommend ed. ] When peace is restored it will bo the duty of Congress to construct a plan of government which shall establish free dom and order in the Philippines. Until Congress makes known the final expression - . sion of its Avill the President must use the authority vested in him to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in the islands. When the insurrecticn ends it islwi with be the hour of peace and clemency. As to Porto Itico the message states the < time is ripe for the adoption of a temporary form of government for the island. Many of the suggestions made with reference to Alaska , it is stated , are applicable also to Porto Ilico. Changes the latter , however , should not be * inme made abruptly and racial peculiarities must be given due Aveight. mirj The message closes with some pertiuenfc suggestions as to lyiichings in the South the proposed memorial bridge over ther Potomac and a statement of the purposes ! f the executive order relating to eivili service of May 0 , 1S9G , and a referencer the coming 14th of December , ther LOOth anniversary of the death of Wush- ngton , and the patriotic reflections nat- irally arising therefrom and concludes vith these words : "Never has this nation ) more abundant cause than during the ] ast year for thankfulness to God forf nanifold blessings and mercies , for which ) make reverent acknowledgment.
