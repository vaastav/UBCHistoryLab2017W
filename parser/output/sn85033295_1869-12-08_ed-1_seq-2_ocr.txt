THE RED RIVER REBELLION Some* over zealous f. leads of tlii° country are becoming very much .alarm ed for fear that should m liters come to a crisis with the Red River settlors this country would be made a thoroughfare for the troops sent by the Canadian Government in rutting down r ‘iat fractious population. Wc consider these fca s groundless, lathe first place we : ardly think the government of Great Britain woulu have the presumption to ask a favor of that kind from us, who still smart under the treatment wo received from that government during the late Rebellion, and in the second place it is conceded all around that those Seikirkers have our warmest sympathy in the position they have taken. They are doing nothing more nor less than asserting the right of self government. In fact their position hardly reaches out to that point, they merely a.-k for the privi'ege of a little '.oice in the selection of rulers for their territory, and are opposed not only to having their country disposed of as merchantable property, but them selves handed over bodies and souls as part of the merchandize. The Red River Rebels still holdout, and Gov. McDougall dues not move a peg from his posi ion at Pembina He is in no condition to show any authori ty without troops, and unless trans ported through our territory it would take many months to send him any as- that kiud. Perhaps, now, after all, tho matter may end, as it 1 should, annexation of their tend 1 tory to the United States. We know that a large portion of the population are favorable to the project; this is more particularly true of the French half breed ; it is not, however, so certainT ow the Scotch and English half breeds feel on this subject; but as a choice between becoming the subdued subjects of Can ada, or anuexatiou, they would uu- 1 duubtedly accept the latter alterative. | DEATH OF A D- RICHARDSON ' ibis noted journalist and writer, who was shot by 31 cFarland in Kow York city a few weeks ago, died on Thursday last from the effects of his wound.. A day or two previous to his decease 3lr. Richardson was married to 3lrs. 31c Farland, Henry Y ard Beecher perform ing the ceremony, and Horace Greeley being one of the witnesses. We think many of the newspapers throughout the country are committing a great wrong in forestalling public opinion against McFarland in this affair, for this case undoubtedly, like all others, has two sides to it It is only natural of coarse, that under tiic circumstances, 3lr. Ilichardsou should have the press come t,o his rescue, but we are hardly pre pared to admit that because of tliis dis graceful transaction 3lr. Richardson should be canonized as a martyr, 3lrs. McFarland as a saintly heroine, and Mr. 3lcFarlund condemned before the public and country as a cold blooded murderer. Before justifying fully Rich ardson’s course, let us wait for the evi dence in the case on both sides, for perhaps, after all, 3lcFarlaad may be able to show some palliating cireuai stances which will temper and soften the crime for which he now stands condemned. Prying into household af fairs is not only contemptible, but wick ed io the extreme, and when carried to such an extent, as to cause the separa tion of man and wife, it is not surpris ing if someone should g-t hurt. There is too much of this business goixg on all over the land, and the sooner the people are convinced that ‘‘what God has joined together let not man put asunder,” the better it will be for the country generally. For Sergeant ax-Arms. The two Norwegian papers published in this State that have always battled so nobly for the Republican cause, are out in fa vor of Col. Ole 0. Johnson of Dane county for Sergeant-at-Arms of the nest Assembly. Col. Johnson served with honor and and distinction during the war, and representing as he does our large Nor wiegan population, nine tenths of whom are Republican to the core, it must cer tainly be conceded that he has strong claims on the position, especially since that class of our voters wore ignored at the late State Convention, to give away to others. In speaking thus we do not wish in any way to prejudice the claims of other worthy and we I qualified candidates v\h) have been named throughout the Stat: icr this office. Meeting of Congress.—Congress assembled on Monday last and the roll in the house showed lt-0 members present. Several new members pre sented themselves and were sworn in.

Those pasteboard squares, with their entanglement of monograms, sum mon us to take part in a great many absurdities of custom; but,of all these the most absurd and burdensome is that of giving presents. The fact is that marrying people practice upon all their friends at the present day a system of bare f cod extortion, without giving them the right to resent or expose it. Tbers is no pretense of spontaneity or sentiment in those gifts; they are pur chased because they must be; and this the receiver well understands. The exactions upon people of moderate means, rating their affections before the town by the number of dollars they are ab e or willing to invent on the oc casion, and mortifying them if the gift be small by parading it. with name at tached, in contrast with the outlay of wealthier friends, is so essentially vul- gar and indelicate that it is a wonder I how it ever came to be tolerated in any society claiming to be refined. The custom is absurd, also, as well as vulgar and burdensome, when one ; comes to reflect upon it. The mutri- ; raonial party really gain nothing, for they have to pay the same in value when the donors invite them to a similar occasion; so their gifts are sim ply loans. How many times the bride must have said, 'Thank you very much ; how lovely it is !” over this amount of plate, when she knows that the equi valent which must be given for it in the future would purchase a uniform service after her own heart. As it is, each couple find themselves possessed of a heterogenous mass of silverware not only unlike in design, but with ; excesses and deficiencies which nobody | could foresee. We have heard of one | bride with self-control enough to smile secretly on receiving her fourth soup- j ladle, and her white lies of gratitude i must surely L-e pardoned to her for their very heroism.” Sea Serpents.—The Gum n-rciaJ Adoertiser says the captain and crew of ! the ship Scottish l*riUe, just arrived, j saw sea serpents on the edge j of the Gulf Stream, ab >ut 200 miles east of Delaware Bay, one six and the other twenty feet long, the captain and crew being sober at the time. \ They looked about the color of a large land snake. • • Suez—The bark Noel, bound to Bombay, the first mercbantile vessel to pass through the Suez anal, w th a i cargo, was wrecked in the Red Sea. lily-six >!l ■' - t 

MURDER, IN GRANT COUNTY. The Platteville IH'Oiess says that Christopher Ko'ly, living ab >ut a mile and a half east of Fairplay, in the smthern part of Grant county, was murdered Monday night, the 15th nit. His wife did not teport his murder un til Tuesday evening, when she went to Fairplay and informed the authorities. From her statement it would appear that on Monday night someone came to the house after all had retired and called for her husband* lie got ud and went out. She then fell asleep and slept till morning, and when she got up they found him lying outside the door with ‘.he back part of his head smashed in. The Dubuque Herald gives the following details obtained from Daniel Kelly, a son of the murdered mac, living in Dubuque : Christopher Kelly, a man fifty-two years of age and an old well-known citizen, lived in a small house two miles east of Fairplay, and had a small farm of forty acres. With his wife he came over to Dubuque on Sunday the 1-lth to make a visit to his son and returned o-i Mondayjthe day following. He left Dubuqe about 10 o’clock A. M., on the 15th, and went to bis home near Sinsinawa Mound, where he arrived between three and four o’clock on the evening of the same day. lie was seen doing his chores that night, when he was in good health ; ho was also seen in bed by a neighbor, between 9 and 10 o’clock at night. He was found dead about 7 o’clock tl e next morning, within about six paces of the door. He tiad four large gashes in his head, and his skull was completely smashed in; a scratch, supposed to have been made by a hand, was seen extended down tke right jaw. lie was completely covered with snow, indicating that the j murder had been committed before the snowstorm came on, there being a heavy snow that night. His wife states that she awoke in thtf night feeling cold, and found that Kelly was missing. Thinking he might have gone and slept in another bed, there being two beds in the same room, she went to sleep again. Upon waking between six and seven in the morning, she got up, and started out to feed the stock, but had hardly proceeded as far as the corn crib, probably ten paces from the house, when she discovered a heap on the west side of the h mse, about six paces from the door. She went up to it smoped down and took hold of it, and found it was the body of her husband. Sue then wemjro her sou's house, John Murray, about a quarter of a mile dist ant, to get soiri-j help. Murray re turned with her and removed the body into the house. They then went out, shut the door, and returned to her son ( s house. Kelly was not supposed to be worth much in actual cash. He had no land ed property said his son, and had noth ing more than about 8500 worth of personal property. The general pre sumption at the pres nt time is against John Murray, who it is believed had some spite against him It appears that Murray had two little pigs, weigh ing about fifty pounds each, which were running round the old man’s place and eating Iris chickens, which annoyed Kelly, and he told Murray he would kill the pigs if they were not removed. Murray was heard to say a few days ; after this that if the old man crossed ; his path ho would kill him. i After the murdei a bloody hammer, an ax with a short handle, covered ; with hair and blood, and a bloody shirt were found stowed away in one of the chambers. 31 array is a son of Mrs. Kelly by a former husband, and is a man thirty-one years of age. He and bis wife Ine in a small house on the other corner of the forty acres, lie has not been upon good terms with the old man, though there is no difference except some of the trivial masters already mentioned. He and his wife are known to have been at Kelly’s Monday eve ning. 31urray and his wife and Mrs. Kelly were ail arrested on Thursday, after the coroner’s inquest, and were held for ex amination, which commenced on the next Wednesday, at Fairplay, before Justice Henry Mann. After a patient uud full investiga ion, the two women were discharged and 31 array was held to bail in the sum if 810,000 to await the action of the Grand Jury. As it is not at a 1 probable that he can obtain bail to that amount, he will be lodged in jail. There seems to be little doubt in the public mind of his gr it. Ine manner of the killing was so barbarous and demoniacal, .Kelly’s head being completely hammered in, that the whole community wore horrified at the event, and the excitement during the preliminary examination was very great. ► m - aUADJT LETTER- The followong interesting and truth ful piece of literature from the city of ■‘Train’s town lots,” was done up in a letter from somebody to somebody.

Where whisky shops the live-long night are vending out their poison juice; where men are often pretty tight, and women deemed a trifle loose ? Where “beats” and “blacklegs, ’ thick and hale, or deep in faro, cards and vices; where real estate is still for sale and held at most outrage a s prices ?
