Kntered at the Postofflce In St. JotK-uh, Missouri, as Second Class Ma. I Matter. Tin: itKTAtii pricks or rooi You cannot but help noticing It for there Is no one that eats that doc? not and that la that despito the fact that almost every article and every commodity on the St. Joseph market has tone down, tho prices of food and foodstuffs like the wily old goose still hang high and do not seem to even tako a notion lot alono doing so to fall In tho least. Hut It Is not no with the producer, v.ho lias been hit a most blfflng-wal-lop In tho reduced prices paid him for his corn, his wheat, his cattle, his hogs, as well h.s for cotton, wool, hide, Hilk, copper and other commod ities that are not foodstuffs. These reduced prices In many In stances have been passed on In their Attenuated form clear down to the ultimate consumer. This U noticeable in the case of dry goods and clothing, of halt and haberdashery, of carpets nml rugs and furniture and other manufactured articles that tho people buy articles that ore non-perishable and In which tho labor cost is a large element of tho total cost. It Is much less notably truo of foods. You notice tho difference when you go to tho butcher and tho grocer and tho baker. You do not notice any apprcclablo dlfferenco, though, when jou compare your cur rent grocery bill with your grocery bill of sis month or a your or two years ago. It Is curiously Hltnll.ir, In Itemized prices and In total, to the bill you paid when cattle ami hogs and wheat and such llko weie twlco as high as now. If you inquire about n, little you find that the chicken for your Sunday dinner, and the potatoes that go with It. cost you three or four time as much as the farmer gets for them on his place "somewhere In iil)UXl. Kaitoh. or Iowa." And when you notice that fact It seems strange, to you, does it not? for why should tho "spread" between producer and consumer In tho case of Perishable food products, especially em h as come almost Intact from the farmer to your kitchen table, grow larger as basic prices fall, whllo It shrinks in the case of non-perishable minufactured articles in the cost of which high priced latftiT Is so much greater (Ui element? Cotton and wool go through many 1. inris and through many expensive machine and much work i done on thm btfore they pass from the fields and ranees Into your hands 'is a gar ment The time required to convert ti ra from the raw to the finished U'MH h much longer. Ono would think that the retail prices on these Mould be the tost to respond to the lowering of the price of the basic raw material. And one would think that l,..,.f and pork and poultry and break I.u.t foods and potatoes and hominy r.nd bread, which pass much more quickly from producer to consumer, and deteriorate in quality so much more rapidly, would be among the f.rst to give the consumer his share of the benefit of falling prices. Hut It doesn't work out that way rt alt. The grocery bill, which In i indue the butcher's bill and the bak er's bill, ts, llko taxes, a relic of the v. ur that folds you still In a close em 1'iace at a time when other bills are 1' i ting go a little and giving you a chance to draw a full breath. Of course we cannot help but won der why and again we wonder If it is because tho "consumers' boycott" vlitcli for a tune at least was distinct ly in evidence, cannot be made to ap ply In the case of foodstuffs? People tan continue to get along, If they must, with tost year's clothes and be-fore-tho-war carpets and furniture, hut they can't do that with food. When it comes to something to cat they are simply compelled to go right on buying, whatever tho prire. Tho law of supply and demand has brought down tho other bills, Includ ing disastrously the price paid to tho farmer. What law will bring down tho grocer's bill? JIVT AS WKJ.h I'IJ1I CVUITY If we can take the prepared ktato jnent of Secretary of War Baker as correct and wa do It Is perfectly evident that tho United States war department and Secretary Raker were jrullty at the time the armistice was signed of having assembled and drill ed too many men and purchased and 'i J i u m.uiy nu.liuiu of djllars woith ui supplies. It is cident that i!.e at my of 5,000,000 men which Amerlcu was to have to put into khaki for the campaign of 1919 was ontlrely too large. U got In the way of a. wonderful war and stopped It, The war wa stopped by tho prep aration Which America achieved in an amazingly short time and at n really Indecorous gait. Germany had Intended to continue It, Franco and (Ireat Britain and Italy had expected to continue It, when, as Ueucral Hln dciibutg says tho action of America In tho Argonne made It Impossible for Germany to continue and thcre foro unnecessary for Prance nnd Croat Britain and Italy to continue. Energetic costlgntors of the Wilson administration have asserted that this country way not sufficiently prepared for war In 1917. Itetweon April, 1917, und November, 191S, prepared ness waxed In America like a snowball rolled down hill. It gathered momen tum as it went. When the armistice was signed, because American effic iency In action made It necessary for tho Hermans to sign up, and glvo up, wo were Just about to roll up an army of 0,000,000. Compared with It the army of Xerxes would have looked like a sheriff's posse. In course of preparation tho war department bought right and left what would bo needed by 3,000,000 red-blooded fighting men; men of a greater army, In point of size, and effectiveness, than the world had ever seen, an army which proved a decid ing factor In tho greatest war In the history of mankind, before It got half through Its growing pains. The war department, with its Im nifnso supplies on hand, was caught rod-handed In the act of ending the war by making It too hot for the cn umy. There was too much prepared ness. Thero were too many military stores. There were lots too many men. There was not exactly too much Johnson, but too much Brother Jona than; altogether too much. In the circumstances this paper suggests that tho New York Herald bo empowered by joint n solution of tho congress which convened Monday to hang Secretary Hiker In effigy In every state whoso sons contributed to tho strength of tho army that stopped tho war, and to hang him on a sour applo tree In Washington. No (secretary of war, no war de partment, no country In Christendom or lit Pagandom, ever was guilty of beating up an army so extravagantly largo and buying for that army so many millions of tons of supplies. W1IV YOUR TAXIS AUK HIGH Thero la not a person In tho Platte Purchase that Is not complaining about high taxes and for that matter thin complaint Is general all ocr tho United States -nnd all the world over slnco tho Croat war. Over In Olios county In tho wilds of Tennessee Is published a paper called tho Record and its editor who also seems to pay taxes puts up tho situa tion in a way that is not only truth ful but decidedly interesting for so few peoplo associate taxes with the reason for which they are levied. This novel way of putting a perfectly le gitimate subject and which hits every one, Is shown In this Tennessee edi tor's remarks In this way: "It ts no wonder that this country Is troubled, tax-ridden and all-around in a hell of a mess. Here are a few knots' that Just now como to mind. If I would Liko more time the list would be Increased fourfold. A half dozen salaried revenue officers go 100 miles to bust up a $20 outfit. A 'special' revenue agent comes around to sco about your privilege (as If you had any privilege) taxes. An auditor comes from Nashville, Memphis or Honolulu and "chocks up" two offi cers at the courthouse and leaves the others for the county court to look after. Another fellow 'comes down tho pike' In bio sedan to see if the country merchant has six bottles of vasellno and if ho has six United states stamps to put on 'cm. An 'alcohol and wine' man comes to the druggist to see If lie is fourteen names abort' on hla registration. And an other 'narcotic man' comes along to see about the paregoric. And another ono comes a few days later to 'check up' on the morphine, opiurc, etc. And the one-horse country merchant gels a questionnaire about his stock of patent medicines that it would puzzle a. Philadelphia (or Pulaski) lawyer to fill out. And so on ail Infinitum, ud nauseam and ad nux voir.lo or any other darn thing yoa cars to, but It is all so. and then sotue, and I re peat, in all sincerity, fiat it Is no wonder that the 'cuvrnent' gets cuss ed out Hi days (5C5 leap yecrj) in tho calendar year from Cape Cod to Kalamazoo, and from Tadmor in the WilderneKi to Yuba J Jam, Arizona." NOTHING HUT ItA.VIiltUPr STATiXMANSHIP It Is a solemn and woll authenti cated fact that no 7rlh campaign of polltloal murder has over brought any benefits to the Irish poepla. And It U IlkewlM another duly authenticated fact that no Brltlah campa gn of coercion has ever been successful or made the Irish problem less difficult of solution, Yet with those two Indisputable historical facts before them, Sinn Fein Ireland Is engaged In wholesale murder and the llrltlsh government Is engaged lit wholesale coercion und reprisal. Outside of soviet Russia thero arc no other such conditions In the world that used lo call Itself civilized as those existing in Ireland today. Tho Sinn Fclners descrlbo the situ ation ns one of civil war, but It Is not civil war. Civil war Implies organized armed forces responsible to a dcflnlto authority nnd fighting In tho open. Killing men In their beds Is not civil war. It Is murder and nothing can mako It anything else. Although tho I,loyd Ocorge govern ment reluscs to rccognlzo tho Irish uprising as anything more than a dis turbed condition of the peace. It has encouraged a policy of reprisals which aro nothing moro than counter nssasslnatlon. Tho nnswer to mur der is due process of law. No gov ernment that pretends to respect law can afford to deal with murder by tho primltlvo process of destroying towns nnd killing Innocent and guilty Indiscriminately. When tho British authotltlcs attempt to suppress Irish murdirs by a scries of police pogroms they confess that tho great llrltlsh admlnlstratlvo system, which has long been ono of tho bulwarks of civilization, has broken down. It Is plain enough that the Irish will never succeod In murdering their way to Independence, nnd It Is equal ly plain that tho llrltlsh government will never succeed In driving tho Irish back to the status quo at the point of tho bayonet. Both methods are equal ly futile, and In tho circumstances both nro equally criminal. As for cccompllshlng any good for Ireland, tho Sinn Fein leaders havo failed utterly; hut the llrltlsh govern ment has likewise failed, and failed Ignomlnously. It has shown Itself Incapable of sitlsfylng the Irish or of pacifying the Irish. Instead of mak ing matters better It has mado them worse. That ought to bo as apparent In Downing street as In Dublin. THAT IOWA "CIV1IJZATION" Iowa peoplo In general havo for a long time looked down on Missourlans In fact they treat tho peoplo of this state with contempt, alleging that our civilization Is not oqual to their brand. Now this may bo all right In its way but it Ls a poor way for that boasted superiority and civilization of the Ilawkcyo state ts not helped through the medium of a bloody af fair which occurred on tho Crcston branch of the Burlington at tho vll logo of Conway, a short distance north of Hopkins, last week, when a hundred llawkeycs stood by In Con way nnd saw two young men fight to the eath, ono dying the ncx,' day. For an hour, tho dispatches say, the two young men battled, and then ono said "Bnough," and died Boon there after. It was known that ono of tho boys had Just recovered from an operation. Ho was tho one who died from his Injuries, being kicked In tho side. causing Internal hemorrhages. There must havo beon many of those who stood by and shouted encouragement to tho boys who knew of tho condi tion of one of them, yet, the dispatches say. no one tried to stop tho fight. To a marked degree those who aid ed and abetted by their presence and words of encouragement, are responsi ble for tho death that followed. To all, it seems, must come deep rog'ct that they did not stop tho fight In stead of permitting it to go to a brut ish finish at tho expense of a human Ufa, Regrets, however, can never bring back to llfo somebody's boy. Such brutal affairs do not go far In boosting Iowa's boasted "civilization." STICK TO YOUIt JOIt There aro now said to be 5,000 Idle men in St. JoMiph at least that is what Supt Morris of tho State Free Employment bureau says and that brings tho uuggeatlon that all thoso men who now havo a Job should stick to it. Por months this paper has hammered on the fact that those who had good Jobs would do well to stick to them and those- who had been holding good Jobs should save some of their money for the coming hard days; which arc now not only close ly approaching, but uro really here. Those slovens and clock watchers who havo all along during the war drawn high salaries and done Indifferent and many times rotten work will now sit up rJid tako notice for their days are short. The time Is now ending when tho garago helper could demand J 33 a week for hammering cars with a monkey wrench when the manager v.-iH able to chargo II or 12 un hour for rolling clgarcts. Tho careless days are coming to a close now. Thero are still plenty of demands for belli, and lots of good Jobs, Thoso who now hold tho good Jobs ore hold ing thcxa bu:a.uso they deserve them. not becauso tho boss enn't get somo body clso, Thero was a frightful lot of In offlclcncy nnd Indifference when thero wcro more Jobs than workmen. That was natural, for Iho Independent never llko to tako on tho airs of de pendence. Hut from this tlmo on, tho belter work a man docs, tho better servlco an Institution gives, tho better chnnro ho-ahl it will havo to survlvo tho pangs of readjustment Men of wlMlom, seolng thu truth, will not fall to profit thereby. TIIIJ HKKOIC TIIOTZKY That world's hero tho heroic Trotzky Is prepared to mako stupen dous sacrifices In order that tho cause of world revolution may bo paved nnd carried through to Its glorious tri umph of destruction and chaos. IIo sees famine sweeping over Rus sia, but ho Is not turned from hLs purpose by tho spectacle, "Though three-fourths of the population die of hunger and cold," says he, "the remainder will survlvo to carry through to victory the world revolu tion." As communist and commissar, the brave Trotzky is ono of tho twenty flvo or less per cont for whom a sus taining ration Is assured under tho discriminating democracy practiced by the soviet rcglmo. It Is said that when tho delegation which notified tho prcsldont that Congress was ready to rccelvo his mossago called at the White House Tuesday, tho president did not shake hands with tho members, becauso Senator Lodge was ono of the delega tion. After tho brutal manner in which Lodge treated him, It Is no wonder that Wilson did not extend his hand. Do not bo discouraged, fellow dem ocrat, over tho turning over of the country to tho republicans. Tho next four years will bo ones that are worse than Sherman's description of war, and at the end of that time tho peo plo almost to a man and woman will bo so disgusted over tho condition of tho country that they will voto the Democratic ticket almost unanimous ly. Supt. Morris of tho State Free Em ployment Bureau nay3 that thero are 5,000 idle men in St. Joseph and two thirds of them have not saved a dol lar of tho excessively high wage3 they havo been drawing for the pist two yoars. Such peoplo are not entitled to ariy help or jsympathy. That suro was some swift Jolt that Prosecutor-elect Brubaker administer ed to tho Silks when ho this week ap pointed Lewis F. Randolph, a "rant ing Cotton," to tho position of first assistant, Brubaker's backbono Is made of Iron and is not a lath painted to look like Iron, Tho success achieved In the Initial performance of tho St Joseph Sym phony Orchestra U such as to glvo tho lovers of real music much encour agement The right thing to do now is for the people of St Joseph to sup port it and it will give them full value Sheriff Isaacson did a proper thing when ho dropped Deputies Grace and Nims on Monday. Men who could do no better than to allow criminals to escape, and also allow them question able company, have no business around tho outside of a county JilL, The St. Joseph (Iks Co. alleged In asking for a change of venue Monday on a case, that the peoplo of St. Jos eph, "wcro prejudiced against It." This la the flnt time In years that tho gas company was absolutely right for tho peoplo should be. President Wilson's last message to Congress, delivered Tuesday, was like all of his previous ones a master piece of tho Kngllsh language re plete wltli good suggestions and perti nent paragraphs on tho great ques tions which confront tho people. Wo nro glad that you will to allow ed no "spike" In your Chrlstmrs plum pudding, nor In your mince pie. You voted for the Ice cream and soft drink man so he could mulct you and now you should enjoy what ho has to give you at high prices. A Texas court refused to bar the dofendants In a suit filed against them by tho Coca-Cola company from describing that dccoltlon as "dope," which It must be, or the rourt would have refused to allow tho appellation to stand. It looks Just a trifle odd to have that great moral agency, the after noon paper, come out and advocate a letting up on some of the drastic "re forms" that will be attempted to be put upon the peoplo. Senator Lodge nnd "his cabinet" have already told President-elect Harding who shall make up his cab- Inct and that Is alt that Ihero Is to It for Lodgo nnd his gang will bo tho presidency. Tho only advantage wo can see lo tho pay-as-you-leavo cars Is that If a fellow is broko tho conductor does not find It out until tho passenger arrives at his destination which Is too lute. If St. Joseph wants base ball next year, It Is tlmo that work was started, for Ilanlon says ho will not put n team In tho field, but will Fell tho franchise Now is tho time to get into tho game. Mrs. Wilson Inducted Mrs. Harding Into tho mysteries of tho White House Tuesday. The President Fhowed President-elect Harding over Iho ex ecutive offices. This Is real democ racy for you. Tho peoplo who voted for a change at tho last election are getting It and they aro not at all pleased with what they are getting but they vot ed for It and must tako 11. It will bo no trouble to be a demo crat four years from tho present time and thero will be several million more Democrats than thero were at the last election. By falling to fllo his cxpenso ac count In tho required time last Sat urday Representative Harry Mc Pherson forfeited his office In the First Legislative district President Wilson lgnorod the treaty In his message Tuosday, preferring to let the people discover what they had missed when It is too late. Tho grand jury Is still In session, and some of tho donlzens of this place aro staying away from the sessions with decided diligence. Tho Noblo pcaco prlzo will be con ferred on President Wilson today. To no ono could it bo moro appropriately or fittingly given.

WILSON SUBMITS HIS FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS ( Cootinned from Tige One) on tho other sldo of the water and has given promise, I vonture to say, of early completion only In our own fortunato country; but even with us tho recovery halts and is impeded at times and there aro Immediately ser viceable acts of legislation which it seems to me wo ought to attempt, to assist that recovery and provo the In- destructiblo rccuperatlva force of a great government of the people. One of these Is to provo that a great de mocracy can keep house as success fully and In as buslnessllko a fashion as any other government. It socms to mo that tho first step toward prov ing this is to supply oursolvcs with a systematic method of handling our estimates and expenditures and bring them to tho point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our Incomo or neccssltato unrcasonablo taxation; In other words, a workable budget system, and I respectfully sug gest that two elements are essential to buch a system, namely, not only that tho proposal of appropriations should bo In the hands of a single, body, such as n single appropriations committco In each house of tho congress, but also that this body should bo brought Into such co-operation with tho de partments of the government und with tho treasury of the United States as would enable it to act upon a com plete conspectus of the needj of the government nnd tho resources from which it must draw lis Incomo. I re luctantly vetoed thu budget bill pass ed by the last besslon of the congress becauso of a constitutional objection. Tho house of representatives subse quently modified tho bill In order to meet this objection. In the revised form I bollcvo that the bill, coupled with action already taken by the con gress to revise Its rules and procedure, furnishes the foundations for an ef fective national budget system. I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of tho first steps taken by tho present kesslon of the congress will be to pass the budget bill. rinanoca in Good Shape Tho nation's finances havo shown marked Improvement during the last year. Tho total ordinary receipts of 50,894,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920 exceeded those for 1319 by Jl, 042. 000, 000, while the total net or dinary expenditures decreased from 118,51 1.500,000 to J6.403, 00,000. The grosj public debt, which reached Its highest point on Aug. 31, 1915, when It was $20,096,000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920, lo $24,175,000,000. Thero nlso has been n marked do creaso In holdings of government wnr securities by the banking Institutions of tho country na well ns In the amount of bills held by thu rodernl reservo banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunato result has relieved the banks nnd left them freer to finance tho needs or agricul ture, Industry nnd commerce. It has been due in largo part to tho reduc tion of tho public debt, especially of Ihe floating debt, but moro particu larly to tho Improved distribution of government securities among perma nent Investors. The cessation of tho goeriinuint's borrowing except through short term certificates of In debtedness has been a mailer of great conscquenco lo the peoplo of the country at large, as well ns lo tho boldais of liberty bonds and victory notes and hss had an Important bonr Ing on the matter of effective credit control. Tho year has been char acterized by tho progressive withdraw al of tho treasury from tho domestic credit market, and from a position of dominant Influence In that market. The future course will necessarily do- pend upon tho extent to which eco nomics aro practiced and upon the burdens placod upon the treasury, as well ns upon Industrial developments and tho maintenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high level. Must Prnotlcu Koonomy Tho fundamental fact which at present dominates tho government's financial situation is that seven and a half billions of lis war Indebtedness mature within the next two and a half years. Of this amount two and a halt billion are floating debt and five bil lions victory notes and war savings certificates. The fiscal program of the government must be determined with rcferonco to these maturities. Sound policy demands that tho gov ernment expenditures bo reduced to the lowest amount which will permit the various services tp operate effic iently and that government receipts from taxes and salvage bo maintained sufficiently high to provide for cur rent requirements, Including Interest and sinking fund charges on tho pub lic debt, and at tho samo tlmo retlro the floating debt and part of the vic tory loan before maturity. With rigid economy, vigorous salvago operations and ndequato j-evenuo for taxation, a surplus of current receipts over cur rent expenditures can bo realized and should be applied to tho floating debt Ml branches of tho government should co-operate to see that this program la realized. I cannot overemphasize the neces sity of economy In government appro priations and the avoidance by tho congress of practices which tako money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriations the estimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expendi tures wero authorized by tho last con gress In addition to the amounts shown in the usual compiled state ments of appropriations. Urscs Revision of Taxca This strikingly illustrates tho im portance of making direct and specific appropriations. The relations between tho current receipts and current ex penditures of the government during tho present fiscal year, as woll as dur ing tho last half of the last fiscal year, havo been disturbed by the ex traordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the transportation act, in connection with the return of the rail roads to private control. Over S600, 000,000 has already been paid to tho railroads under this act $350,009,000 during the present fiscal year; and It Is estimated that further payments aggregating possibly $650,000,000 must still bo mado to the railroads during the current year. It is obvious that these large payments havo al ready seriously limited the govern ment's progress In retiring the float ing debt Closely connected with this. It seems to me, is the necessity for an Immed iate consideration of the revision of our tax laws. Simplification of tho Income and profits taxes has becomo an immed iate necessity. These taxes performed an indispensable servlco during the war. Tho need for their simplifica tion, however, Is very great. In order to nave the taxpayer Inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite. Other and more detailed recommen dations with regard to taxes will no doubt be laid before you by the secre tary of the treasury and the commis sioner of Internal rovenue. It Is my privilege to draw to the attention of congress for very sympa thetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for the caro and treatment of former mem bers of tho military and naval forces who are sick or disabled, as tho result of their participation iu the war. These heroic men can never be paid In money for the service they pa triotically rendered the nation. Their reward will He rather In realization of tho fact that they vindicated the rights of their country nnd nlded in safeguarding civilization. Tho .nation's gratitude must bo cffoetltcly revealed to theln by tho most ample provision for (heir medical caro and treatment as welt as for their vocational training and placement. Tho tlmo has como when a moro complete program can be formulated nnd more satisfactorily iidmliilstcrcd for their treatment and training, and I earnestly urgo that the congress glvo tho matter Its early consideration. Tho secretary of tho treasury and the board for vocational education will outline in their annual reports proposals covering medical caro and rehabilitation which I nm suro wilt engage your earnest study and com mand your most generous support 1'iTgcH Aid for Disabled Veterans Permit mo to emphasize onco mors tho need for action upon certain mat ters upon which I dwelt at soma length In my message to the second session of the sixty-sixth congress: The necessity, for example, of encour aging the manufacture of dyestuffs and rclatod chemicals; tho Impor tance of doing everything posslblo to promoto agriculture production along economic lines, to lmprovo agricultur al marketing and make rural life more attractive and healthful; thq need for law regulating cold storage in such a way as to limit the tints during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period and requiring goods rcloascd from storago la-all cases to bear tho data of their receipt. It would also bo most serviceable If It wore provided that all goods released from cold storage for interstate ship ment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or mar ket price at which they went Into storago, in order that the. purchaser might bo able to learn what profits stood between him and tho producer or tho wholesalo dealer. Indeed, it would be very serviceable to tho pub lic It all good! destined for Interstate commerce v.ire made to carry upon every packing caso whoso form made It poaitlhle a plain statement of tho price at which they loft thehanJs of tho producor. I respectfully call jour attention also to the message referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in lnterstato commerce. Sngsoslfl Loan to Armenia In brief, tho Immediato legislation need ot tho time Is the removal of all obstacles to the realization of' the best ambitions of our peoplo In their sev eral classes of employment and tho strengthening of all Instrumentalities by which difficulties are to be met and removed and Justlco dealt out whether by law or by some form of modlntlon and conciliation. I do not fool It to be my privilege at present to ruggest the detailed and particular methods by which theso objects mrjy bo attained, but I have faith that tho ' Inquiries of your several committees will discover tho way and the method. In response to what I believe to bo the lmpulso ot sympathy and opinion throughout tho United States, I earn estly suggest that tho congress au thorize tho treasury of tho United States to make to the struggling gov ernment of Armenia such a loan as was mule to several of tho allied gov ernments during tho war; and I would also suggest that It would be desirable to provide In tho legislation Itself that the expend Ituro of tho money thus loaned should bo under the supervis ion of a commission or at least a com missioner, from tho United States, In order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia Itself might not b! affordod by the loan a further tempt ing opportunity. Allow mo to call your attention to the fact that the ponple ot the Philippine Islands have succeeded In maintaining a stable gov ernment since the last action of tho congress In their behalf, and havo thus fulfilled tho condition set by the congress as precedent to a considera tion ot granting Independence to the Islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulflllod, It Is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promlso to the peo ple of those Islands by granting them the Independence which they so hon orably covet I have not so much laid bofore you a sorios of recommendations, gentle men, as sought to utter a confession of faith, ot the faith In which I was bred and which it U my solemn pur pose to stand by until my last fight ing day.
